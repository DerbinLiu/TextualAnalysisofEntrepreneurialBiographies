it
be
acre
about
eleven
time
the
size
of

as
many
as
fourteen

we
held
cast
call

the
safety

as
tiny
as
whether

ribbon
on

the
creation
of
the

an
education
in
geopolitics
and

constant
balance

expansion

me
in
a
way

thing
have
over
the
course
of
my
career
it
wouldn
t
be
make
public
until
nearly
two
year
later
during

ping
off
one
of
our
cell
tower
earlier
that
night
they
study
the
cctv
footage
and
saw
him
again
walk
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
entrance
near
the
house
of
blue
there
be
a
heavy
metal
concert
there
that
night
which
meant
extra
security
five
arm
police
officer
and
after
a
few
minute
of
case
the
area
mateen
could
be
see
walk
back
to
his
car
security
camera
picked
up
two
weapon
in
mateen
s
possession
a
semiautomatic
rifle
and
a
semiautomatic
pistol
hidden
inside
a
child
s
stroller
along
with
a
baby
blanket
that
hadn
t
yet
be
take
out
of
its
packaging
investigator
suspect
that
his
plan
be
to
cover
his
weapon
with
the
blanket
and
wheel
them
up
to
the

head
of

and
resort

be
also
in

and
he
and
i
consult
throughout
the
day
as
ron
pass
on
more
news
we
be
still
anxiously
wait
to
hear
if
any
of
our
people
have
be
at
the
nightclub
and
now
we
be
concerned
that
the
news
of
our
be
a
target
would
soon
be
leak
it
would
be
a
big
story
and
would
take
a
difficult
emotional
toll
on
the
community
there
the
bond
you
form
in
high
stress
moment
like
this
when
you
re
share
information
that
you
can
t
discus
with
anyone
else
be
a
powerful
one
in
every
emergency
i
ve
encounter
as
ceo
i
ve
be
grateful
for
the
competence
and
cool
head
and
humanity
of
the
team
around
me
bob
s
first
move
be
to
send
the
head
of
walt
disney
world
george
kalogridis
back
to
orlando
from
shanghai
to
give
his
people
on
the
ground
more
executive
support
the
data
on
mateen
s
phone
show
that
once
he
get
back
to
his
car
he
typed
in
a
search
for
nightclub
in
orlando
he
drove
to
the
first
club
that
come
up
but
there
be
construction
go
on
in
front
of
the
entrance
and
traffic
be
back
up
the
second
result
be
pulse
where
he
ultimately
commit
his
massacre
as
the
detail
of
the
investigation
trickle
in
i
felt
horror
and
grief
for
the
victim
of
the
shoot
and
at
the
same
time
a
sicken
there
but
for
the
grace
of
god
relief
that
he
d
be
deter
by
the
security
we
have
in
place
i
m
often
ask
what
aspect
of
the
job
most
keep
me
up
at
night
the
honest
answer
be
that
i
don
t
agonize
over
the
work
very
much
i
don
t
know
if
it
s
a
quirk
of
brain
chemistry
or
a
defense
mechanism
i
developed
in
reaction
to
some
family
chaos
in
my
youth
or
the
result
of
year
of
discipline
some
combination
of
all
of
those
thing
i
suppose
but
i
tend
not
to
feel
much
anxiety
when
thing
go
awry
and
i
tend
to
approach
bad
news
as
a
problem
that
can
be
work
through
and
solve
something
i
have
control
over
rather
than
something
happen
to
me
but
i
m
also
all
too
aware
of
the
symbolic
power
of
disney
as
a
target
and
the
one
thing
that
weighs
heavily
on
me
be
the
knowledge
that
no
matter
how
vigilant
we
be
we
can
t
prepare
for
everything
when
the
unexpected
do
happen
a
kind
of
instinctive
triage
kick
in
you
have
to
rely
on
your
own
internal
threat
scale
there
be
drop
everything
event
and
there
be
others
when
you
say
to
yourself
this
be
serious
i
need
to
be
engage
right
now
but
i
also
need
to
extricate
myself
and
focus
on
other
thing
and
return
to
this
later
sometimes
even
though
you
re
in
charge
you
need
to
be
aware
that
in
the
moment
you
might
have
nothing
to
add
and
so
you
don
t
wade
in
you
trust
your
people
to
do
their
job
and
focus
your
energy
on
some
other
press
issue
that
s
what
i
be
tell
myself
in
shanghai
half
a
world
away
from
orlando
this
be
the
most
momentous
thing
the
company
have
embark
on
since
disney
world
open
in
we
have
never
invest
so
much
in
something
with
so
much
potential
for
success
or
failure
in
our
nearly
hundred
year
history
i
have
no
choice
but
to
compartmentalize
to
focus
on
the
last
minute
detail
of
the
opening
ceremony
and
trust
in
my
team
in
orlando
and
in
the
protocol
we
have
in
place
we
have
a
system
that
track
employee
whenever
a
disaster
occurs
if
there
s
a
plane
crash
or
a
hurricane
or
a
wildfire
i
get
report
on
who
s
unaccounted
for
who
s
have
to
evacuate
their
home
who
lose
a
friend

whose
property
be
damage
we
have
well
over
two
hundred
thousand
employee
around
the
world
so
if
something
catastrophic
happens
the
odds
aren
t
insignificant

one
of
our
people
have
be

responsibility
but
my
mind
return
constantly
to
the
graf
family
in
orlando
the
thought
that
they
have
come
to

world
of

an
unimaginable
loss

at
a
m
and
work
out

try
to
clear
my
head
then
wander
to
a
lounge
on
our
floor
and
met
with
zenia
mucha
our
chief
communication
officer
zenia
and
i
have
work
together
for
more
than
a
dozen

good
and
bad
she
s
tough
she
ll
tell
me
straight
to
my
face
when

think
i
m

a
mistake
and

have
the
best
interest
of
the
company
at
heart
the
story
be
be
report
widely
now
and
i
want
our
response
to
come
from
me
i
ve
see
other
company
deal
with
crisis
by
let
a
company
spokesperson
be
their
official
voice
and
that
strategy
have
always
struck
me
as
cold
and
a
bit
cowardly
corporate
system
often
work
to
insulate
and
protect
ceo
sometimes
to
a
fault
and
i
be
determine
not
to
do
that
now
i
told
zenia
i
have
to
issue
a
statement
and
she
immediately
agree
that
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
there
be
so
little
you
can
say
to
make
sense
of
something
like
this
but
we
sat
there
in
the
lounge
and
i
dictate
my
feeling
to
zenia
as
honestly
as
i
could
i
talk
about
be
a
father
and
a
grandfather
and
how
that
give
me
the
slightest
window
into
the
parent

pain
fifteen

answer
her
phone
i
say
i

family
this
time
i
expect
pushback
from
her
and
from
our
general
counsel
alan
braverman
this
could
become
a
complicate
legal
situation
and
lawyer
want
to
restrict
the
possibility
of
say
anything
that
might
exacerbate
liability
in
this
case
though
they
both
knew
this
be
something
i
need
to
do
and
neither
of
them
offer
resistance
i
ll
get
you

what
i
d
say
in
the
statement
that
i
be
a
parent
and
a
grandparent
that
i
couldn
t
fathom
what

want
him
to
know
from

the
person
at
the
top
of
this
company

direct
number
and
told

it
if
he
need

and
then

if
there
be
anything
i

this
from
ever
happen
to
another
child
i
give
him
my
promise
i
knew
from
a
lawyer
s
perspective
that
i
should
be
careful
about
what
i
be
say
that
i
should
consider
whether
that
be
somehow
an
admission
of
negligence
when
you
work
in
a
corporate
structure
for
so
long
you
become
train
to
give
legalistic
corporate
response
but
i
didn
t
care
about
any
of
that
in
this
moment
i
reiterate
to
jay
that
he
should
call
me

there
be
anything
they
need

also
a
never
end
exercise
in
compartmentalization

address
one
thing
what
be
the
attribute
of
a
disney
princess
in
today
s
world
and
how
should
they
manifest
in
our
product
then
you
put
it
away
and
shift
your
focus
to
the
next
what
will
our
slate
of
marvel
film
be
for
the
next
eight
year
and
those
be
the
rare
day
when
thing
actually
unfold
accord
to
schedule
as
the
week
described
above
make
all
too
clear
there
be
also
always
crisis
and
failure
for
which
you
can
never
be
fully
prepared
few
will
be
as
tragic
as
the
event
of
that
week
but
something
will
always
come
up
this
be
true
not
just
of
the
walt
disney
company
but
of
any
company
or
institution
something
will
always
come
up
at
its
simplest
this
book
be
about
be
guide
by
a
set
of
principle
that
help
nurture
the
good
and
manage
the
bad
i
be
reluctant
to
write
it
for
a
long
time
until
fairly
recently
i
even
avoid
talk
publicly
about
my
rule
for
leadership
or
any
such
idea
because
i
felt
i
hadn
t
fully
walk
the
walk
after
forty
five
year
though
and
especially
after
the
past
fourteen
i
ve
come
to
believe
that
i
have
insight
that
could
be
useful
beyond
my
own
experience
if
you
run
a
business
or
manage
a
team
or
collaborate
with
others
in
pursuit
of
a
common
goal
this
book
might
be
helpful
to
you
my
experience
from
day
one
have
all
be
in
the
medium
and
entertainment
world
but
these
strike
me
as
universal
idea
about
foster
risk
take
and
creativity
about
building
a
culture
of
trust
about
fuel
a
deep
and
abide
curiosity
in
oneself
and
inspire
that
in
the
people
around
you
about
embrace
change
rather
than
living
in
denial
of
it
and
about
operating
always
with
integrity
and
honesty
in
the
world
even
when
that
mean
face
thing
that
be
difficult
to
face
these
be
abstraction
but
my
hope
be
that
the
story
and
example
that
be
significant
to
me
as
i
look
back
at
the
long
arc
of
my
career
will
help
them
feel
more
concrete
and
relatable
not
just
to
the
aspire
ceo
of
the
world
but
to
anyone
want
to
be
less
fearful
more
confidently
themselves
as
they
navigate
their
professional
and
even
personal

the
way

and
what

both
relevant
to
a
modern
audience
and
faithful
to
a
nearly
hundred
year

thoughtfully
to

devour
them
and

urge
me
to
read
even
more
we
also
spent
our
dinner
discuss
world
event
and
as
young
as

old
i
d
grab
the
new
york
time
on
our
front

three
year
young
my
mother
be
warm
and
love
a
stay
at
home
mom
until
i
go
to
high
school
at
which
point
she
get
a
job
in
the

back
from
the
war
and
played
the
trumpet
with
some
lesser
big
band
but
he
figure
he
could
never
make
much
of
a
living
as
a
musician
so
never
try
to
do
it
full
time
he
major
in

at
the

move
by
the
time
i
be
ten
or
eleven
he
d
change
job
so
many
time
that
i
begin
to
wonder
why
he
be
always
deeply
politically
engage
and
have
a
very
strong
liberal
bias
he
once
lose
a
job
because
he
be
determine
to
go
to
the
march
on

bos
wouldn
t
give
him
the
day
off

go
anyway
i
don
t
know
if
he
quit
and
go
to
the
speech
or
if
he
be
fire
for
go
after
he
d
be
told
he
couldn
t
but
it
be
just
one
of
several
such
ending
i
be
proud
of
his
strong
character
and
his
politics
he
have
a
fierce
sense
of
what
be
right
and
fair
and
he
be
always
on
the
side
of
the
underdog
but
he
also
have
trouble
regulate
his
mood
and
would
often
say
thing
that
get
him
into
trouble
i
later
learn
that
he
d
be
diagnose
with
manic
depression
and
that
he
d
try
several
therapy
include
electroshock
therapy
to
treat
his
illness
as
the
old
child
i
bore
the
brunt
of
his
emotional
unpredictability
i
never
felt
threaten
by
his
mood
but
i
be
acutely
aware
of
his
dark
side
and
felt
sad
for
him
we
never
knew
which
dad
be
come
home
at
night
and
i
can
distinctly
recall
sit
in
my
room
on
the
second
floor
of
our
house
know
by
the
sound
of
the
way
he
open
and
shut
the
door
and
walk
up
the
step
whether
it
be
happy
or
sad
dad
he
would
sometimes
check
in
on
his
way
past
my
room
to
make
sure
i
be
spending
time
productively
as
he
put
it
that
meant
reading
or
do
homework
or
be
engage
in
something
that
would
well
me
in
some
way
he
want
my
sister
and
me
to
have
fun
but
it
also
be
very
important
to
him
that
we
use
our
time
wisely
and
work
in
a
focus
way
toward
our
goal
i
m
certain
that
my
vigilance
some
might
say
obsessiveness
about
time
management
come
from
him
i
felt
early
on
that
it
be
my
job
to
be
the
steady
center
of
our
family
which
extend
even
to
practical
matter
around
the
house
if
something
broke
my
mother
would
ask
me
to
fix
it
and
i
learn
as
a
young
kid
how
to
repair
whatever
need
repair
that
s
part
of
where
my
curiosity
about
technology
come
from
too
i
think
i
like
use
tool
and
take
thing
apart
and
understand
how
they
work
my
parent
be
worrier
there
be
a
sense
with
both
of
them
that
something
bad
would
soon
be
come
down
the
pike
i
don
t
know
how
much
of
it
be
a
fluke
of
genetics
and
how
much
be
a
learn
reaction
to
their
anxiety
but
i
ve
always
be
the
opposite
of
that
with
few
exception
in
my
life
i
ve
never
worried
too
much
about
the
future
and
i
ve
never
have
too
much
fear
about
try
something
and
fail
as
i
grow
old
i
become
more
aware
of
my
father
s
disappointment
in
himself
he
d
lead
a
life
that
be
unsatisfying
to
him
and
be
a
failure
in
his
own
eye
it
s
part
of
why
he
push
us
to
work
so
hard
and
be
productive
so
that
we
might
be
successful
in
a
way
that
he
never
be
his
employment
trouble
meant
that
if
i
want
to
have
any
spending
money
i
need
to
find
my
own
job
i
start
work
in
eighth
grade
shovel
snow
and
babysitting
and
work
as
a
stock
boy
in
a
hardware
store
at
fifteen
i
get
a
job
as
the
summer
janitor
in
my
school
district
it
involve
cleaning
every
heater
in
every
classroom
then
move
on
to
the
bottom
of
every
desk
make
sure
they
be
gum
free
when
the
school
year
start
cleaning
gum
from
the
bottom
of
a
thousand
desk
can
build
character
or
at
least
a
tolerance
for
monotony
or
something
i
attend
ithaca
college
and
spent
nearly
every
weekend
night
my
freshman
and
sophomore
year
make
pizza
at
the
local
pizza
hut
i
get
mostly
b
s
and
a
few
a
s
in
high
school
but
academic
be
never
my
passion
something
clicked
for
me
when
i
go
to
college
though
i
be
determine
to
work
hard
and
learn
as
much
as
i
could
learn
and
i
think
that
too
be
related
to
my
father
a
function
of
never
want
to
experience
the
same
sense
of
failure
that
he
felt
about
himself
i
didn
t
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
success
meant
no
specific
vision
of
be
wealthy
or
powerful
but
i
be
determine
not
to
live
a
life
of
disappointment
whatever
shape
my
life
take
i
told
myself
there
wasn
t
a
chance
in
the
world
that
i
be
go
to
toil
in
frustration
and
lack
fulfillment
i
don
t
carry
much
pain
with
me
from
those
early
year
other
than
the
pain
that
my
dad
didn
t
live
a
happier
life
and
that
my
mother
suffer
too
as
a
result
i
wish
he
could
have
felt
prouder
of
himself
my
sister
and
i
be
never
deprive
of
love
as
kid
we
always
have
a
roof
over
our
head
and
food
on
the
table
but
there
be
little
or
no
money
for
much
else
vacation
be
usually
spent
drive
to
mundane
place
in
our
car
or
go
to
the
beach
a
few
minute
away
from
our
house
we
have
enough
clothes
to
look
presentable
but
nothing
extra
and
when
i
tore
a
pair
of
pant
in
the
fall
i
be
typically
told
to
wear
them
with
a
patch
until
we
have
the
money
to
replace
them
which
could
be
month
i
never
felt
poor
and
no
one
view
me
as
such
thing
be
a
lot
thinner
than
they
look
though
and
as
i
grow
old
i
become
aware
of
that
late
in
life
after
i
d
become
ceo
of
disney
i
take
my
father
to
lunch
in
new
york
we
talk
about
his
mental
health
and
his
perspective
on
his
life
i
told
him
how
much
i
appreciate
everything
that
he
and
my
mom
have
do
for
us
the
ethic
they
instill
and
the
love
they
give
us
i
told
him
that
be
enough
more
than
enough
and
wish
that
my
gratitude
might
liberate
him
in
some
small
way
from
disappointment
i
do
know
that
so
many
of
the
trait
that
serve
me
well
in
my
career
start
with
him
i
hope
that
he
understood
that
too


i
start
my
career
at
abc
on
july
as
a

in

that
year
of
toil
in

the
people
of

their
daily
weather
report
taught
me
a
necessary
skill
which
be
the
ability
to
deliver
bad
news
for
roughly
six
month
of
the
year
the
long
bleak
stretch
from

me
for
whatever

often
that
meant
be
at
a

a
m
for
light
call
soap
opera
set
be
set
up
the
night
before
a
shoot
and
my
job
be
to
let
in
the
light
director
and
stagehand
long
before
the
sun
come
up
so
the
light
would
be
in
place
when
the
director
and
actor
arrive
for
their
first
run
throughs
i
coordinate

check
everybody
in
and

sure
they
have
their
march
order
for
the
day
i
kept
track
of
their
hour
and
their
grievance
and
their
violation
of
union
rule
i
make
sure
catering
be
in
place
and
the
air
conditioning
have
cool
the
studio
enough
to
begin
shoot
under
the
hot
light
it
be
the
opposite
of
glamorous
but
i
learn
the
in
and
out
of
all
of
those
show
i
spoke
the
lingo
i
get
to
know
all
of
the
people
who
make
a
tv
show
work
maybe
most
important
i
learn
to
tolerate
the
demand
hour
and
the
extreme
workload
of
television
production
and
that
work
ethic
have
stayed
with
me
ever
since
to
this
day
i
wake
nearly
every
morning
at
four
fifteen
though
now
i
do
it
for
selfish
reason
to
have
time
to
think
and
read
and
exercise
before
the
demand
of
the
day
take
over
those
hour
aren
t
for
everyone
but
however
you
find
the
time
it
s
vital
to
create
space
in
each
day
to
let
your
thought
wander
beyond
your
immediate
job
responsibility
to
turn
thing
over
in
your
mind
in
a
less
pressure
more
creative
way
than
be
possible
once
the
daily
triage
kick
in
i
ve
come
to
cherish
that
time
alone
each
morning
and
be
certain
i
d
be
less
productive
and
less
creative
in
my
work
if
i
didn
t
also
spend
those
first
hour
away
from
the
email
and
text
message
and
phone
call
that
require
so
much
attention
as
the
day
go
on


it
be
a
very
different
industry
back
then
in
some
way
it
be
well
the
competition
be
simpler
the
world
less
atomize
certainly
there
be
a
mostly
share
american
narrative
organize
around
a
general
societal
belief
in
basic
fact
in
many
other
way
though
it
be
bad
for
one
there
be
a
shrug
tolerance
of
a
level
of
disrespect
that
would
be
unacceptable
today
it
be
without
a
doubt
much
more
difficult
on
a
day
to
day
basis
for
woman
and
member
of
underrepresented
group
than
it
ever
be
for
me
but
even
in
my
case
be
low
on
the
food
chain
meant
exposure
to
the
occasional
casual
abuse
that
people
would
be
fire
for
now
one
example
that
capture
so
much
of
that
time
the
even
news
be
broadcast
at
p
m
eastern
standard
time
the
moment
we
wrap
the
anchorman
harry
reasoner
and
his
stage
manager
a
man
call
whitey
would
walk
off
the
set
and
park
themselves
at
the
bar
of
the
hotel
de
artiste
on
west
sixty
seventh
street
the
even
news
be
broadcast
from
a
convert
ballroom
in
the
old
hotel
every
even
harry
would
down
a
double
extra
dry
beefeater
martini
on
the
rock
with
a
twist
one
of
my
responsibility
be
to
wait
while
the
producer
review
the
show
then
pas
on
word
to
harry
and
the
studio
crew
if
any
update
or
fix
need
to
be
make
before
it
air
in
later
time
zone
one
night
harry
be
ready
to
move
on
to
martini
number
two
and
he
ask
me
to
run
back
to
the
studio
and
find
out
from
the
producer
where
thing
stood
i
venture
into
the
control
room
and
say
harry
sent
me
to
find
out
how
it
look
the
producer
look
at
me
with
complete
disdain
then
he
unzipped
his
pant
pull
out
his
penis
and
reply
i
don
t
know
you
tell
me
how
it
look
forty
five
year
later
i
still
get
angry
when
i
recall
that
scene
we
ve
become
much
more
aware
of
the
need
for
fair
equal
non
abusive
treatment
in
the
workplace
but
it
have
take
too
long
in
the
fall
of
i
get
assign
to
work
the
main
event

frank
sinatra

on
hand
to
run
errand
for
the
enormous
madison
square
garden
stage
crew
this
be
a
plum
assignment
and
it
be
a
big
deal
for
me
personally
my
father
played
sinatra
record
endlessly
on
the
turntable
in
our
house
to
this
day
i
can
remember
perfectly
the
image
of
my
dad
stand
in
the
living
room
blowing
on
his
trumpet
in
accompaniment
as
frank
croon
to
be
in
the
same
building
as
sinatra
attend
rehearsal
and
do
my
small
part
to
make
sure
the
production
go
smoothly
i
couldn
t
believe
my
good
fortune

high
point

a
few
hour
before
the
concert

be
told
by
an
associate
producer
to
run
out
and
get
a
bottle
of
mouthwash
and
deliver
it
as
fast
as
i
could
to
mr
sinatra
s
dress
room
i
ran
a
few
block
to
a
pharmacy
uptown
and
bought
the
large
bottle
of
listerine
i
could
find
think
the
whole
time
that
frank
be
have
throat
issue
and
the
entire
broadcast
rest
on
my
shoulder
nervous
and
out
of
breath
i
knock
on
the
dress
room
door
mouthwash
in
hand
the
door
swung
open
and
i
be
greet
by
an
impose
bodyguard
who
want
to
know
what
the
hell
i
be
do
there
i
m
deliver
mr
sinatra
s
listerine
i
say
before
he
could
respond
i
heard
that
familiar
voice
from
somewhere
deep
in
the
room
let
him
in
moment
later
i
be
stand
in
front
of
the
chairman
of

romance

a
crisp
hundred
dollar
bill
when

he
give
every
member
of
the
crew
a
sleek
gold
cigarette
lighter
inscribed

i
spent
the
hundred
dollar
almost
immediately

classic
roone

accept
good
enough
and
completely
comfortable
push
right
up
against
an
unmovable
deadline
and
exhaust
a
lot
of
people
along
the
way
to
make
it
great
the
thrill
of
work
on
the
main
event
wore
off
as
soon
as

return
to
my
mundane
world
of

before
long
i
have
my
own
drama
to

abc
sport
show
me
the
world
and
make
me
more
sophisticated
i
get
expose
to
thing
i
d
never
contemplate
before
i
remember
exactly
where
and
when
i
ate
my
first
fine
french
meal
in
paris
the
first
time
i
ever
uttered
the
word
montrachet
and
my
first
experience
drive
through
monaco
in
a
luxury
sport
car
for
a
kid
who
d
grown
up
in
a
split
level
house
in
oceanside
new
york
it
all
felt
a
little
head
spin
it
be
much
more
than
the
high
life
though
i
travel
regularly
to
the
develop
world
and
arrange
for
coverage
of
event
in
the
communist
bloc
negotiate
with
intransigent
govern
body
and
navigate
often
corrupt
and
byzantine
system
i
witness
firsthand
how
people
live
behind
the
iron
curtain
and
get
a
sense
of
the
daily
challenge
of
their
life
i
can
still
remember
look
out
over
darken
bucharest
during
the
nightly
brownout
when
the
government
shut
down
the
electrical
grid
in
winter
i
also
saw
the
way
in
which
their
dream
be
no
different
from
the
dream
of
the
average
person
in
america
if
politician
have
an
urge
to
divide
the
world
or
generate
an
us
versus
them
good
versus
bad
mentality
i
be
expose
to
a
reality
much
more
nuanced
than
that
as
for
all
the
glamour
there
be
and
eventually
there
be
a
convincing
argument
to
be
make
that
living
that
high
off
the
hog
be
irresponsible
however
at
that
time
abc
sport
exist
in
its
own
orbit
often
immune
from
the
law
that
govern
the
rest
of
abc
roone
arledge
be
at
the
center
of
that
orbit

have
be
tapped
to
run

and
by
the
time
i
arrive
he

to

he
be
the
most
competitive
person
i
ve
ever
work
for
and
a
relentless
innovator
but
he
also
knew
that

roone
turn
them
into
household
name
the
human
drama
of
athletic
competition
to
cite
another
line
from
that
wide
world
of

opening
that

really
how

in
the
idea

me
in
every

i
ve
held
since

and
lay

to
air
roone
would
often
show
up
in
the

if
he
didn

appear
in
person
he
d
call
in
from
wherever
he
be
there
be
a
red
roone
phone
in
each
of
our
control
room
as
well
as
in
the
mobile
unit
at
every
event
we
cover
if
he
be
at
home
watch
a
broadcast
he
be
always
watch
from
somewhere
and
saw
something
he
didn

like
he
d
call
in
and
tell
us
this
camera
angle

more
emphasis
we
re
not

people
what

come
up
no
detail
be
too
small
for
roone
perfection
be
the
result
of
get
all
the
little
thing
right
on
countless
occasion
just
as
i
d
witness
at
the
sinatra
concert
he
would
rip
up
an
entire
program
before
it
air
and
demand
the
team
rework
the
whole
thing
even
if
it
meant
work
till
dawn
in
an
edit
room
he
wasn
t
a
yeller
but
he
be
tough
and
exact
and
he
communicate
in
very
clear
term
what
be
wrong
and
that
he
expect
it
to
get
fix
and
he
didn
t
much
care
what
sacrifice
it
require
to
fix
it
the
show
be
the
thing
it
be
everything
to
him
the
show
be
more
important
to
roone
than
to
the
people
who
make
it
and
you
have
to
make
peace
with
that
if
you
work
for
him
his
commitment
to
make
thing
great
be
galvanize
it
be
often
exhaust
often
frustrate
largely
because
he
would
wait
until
very
late
in
the
production
process
to
give
note
or
demand
change
but
it
be
inspire
too
and
the
inspiration
far
outweigh
the
frustration
you
knew
how
much
he
care
about
make
thing
great
and
you
simply
want
to
live
up
to
his
expectation
his
mantra
be
simple
do
what
you
need
to
do
to
make
it
well
of
all
the
thing
i
learn
from
roone
this
be
what
shape
me
the
most
when
i
talk
about
this
particular
quality
of
leadership
i
refer
to
it
as
the
relentless
pursuit
of
perfection
in
practice
that
mean
a
lot
of
thing
and
it
s
hard
to
define
it
s
a
mindset
really
more
than
a
specific
set
of
rule
it
s
not
at
least
as
i
have
internalize
it
about
perfectionism
at
all
cost
something
roone
wasn
t
especially
concerned
about
instead
it
s
about
create
an
environment
in
which
you
refuse
to
accept
mediocrity
you
instinctively
push
back
against
the
urge
to
say
there
s
not
enough
time
or
i
don
t
have
the
energy
or
this
require
a
difficult
conversation
i
don
t
want
to
have
or
any
of
the
many
other
way
we
can
convince
ourselves
that
good
enough
be
good
enough
decade
after
i
stop
work
for
roone
i
watch
a
documentary
jiro
dream
of
sushi
about
a
master
sushi
chef
from
tokyo
name
jiro
ono
whose
restaurant
have
three
michelin
star
and
be
one
of
the
most
sought
after
reservation
in
the
world
in
the
film
he
s
in
his
late
eighty
and
still
try
to
perfect
his
art
he
be
described
by
some
as
be
the
living
embodiment
of
the
japanese
word
shokunin
which
be
the
endless
pursuit
of
perfection
for
some
great
good
i
fell
in
love
with
jiro
when
i
watch
it
and
become
fascinate
by
the
concept
of
shokunin
in
i
travel
to
tokyo
for
work
and
go
to
the
restaurant
with
some
colleague
we
met
jiro
who
make
us
our
dinner
and
i
watch
in
awe
as
he
deftly
laid
out
nineteen
gorgeous
piece
of
sushi
one
after
the
other
over
the
course
of
thirty
five
minute
the
speed
of
the
meal
be
due
to
his
commitment
to
serve
the
sushi
on
rice
that
be
at
body
temperature
if
the
meal
take
too
long
the
rice
would
drop
a
couple
of
degree
below
degree
fahrenheit
which
to
jiro
be
unacceptable
i
love
the
documentary
so
much
that
i
show
excerpt
of
it
to
executive
at
a
disney
retreat
i
want
them
to
understand
well
through
the
example
of
jiro
what
i
meant
when
i
talk
about
the
relentless
pursuit
of
perfection
this
be
what
it
look
like
to
take
immense
personal
pride
in
the
work
you
create
and
to
have
both
the
instinct
toward
perfection
and
the
work
ethic
to
follow
through
on
that
instinct


one
of
my
favorite
interaction
with
roone
come
at
the
begin
of
my
tenure
at
abc
sport
even
though
we
work
on
the
same
floor
and
sport
be
a
relatively
small
division
roone
never
come
across
as
accessible
to
me
in
those
day
other
than
perfunctory
hello
he
barely
acknowledge
me
one
day
i
found
myself
stand
next
to
him
at
a
urinal
to
my
surprise
roone
begin
to
talk
with
me
how
s
it
go
after
a
moment
of
stun
silence
i
say
well
some
day
i
feel
like
it
s
tough
just
keep
my
head
above
water
roone
look
straight
ahead
without
miss
a
beat
he
say
get
a
longer
snorkel
then
he
finish
his
business
and
walk
out
he
wasn
t
much
for
excuse
only
later
when
i
work
more
closely
with
him
would
i
discover
what
people
meant
when
they
say
that
he
refuse
to
accept
no
for
an
answer
if
he
ask
you
to
do
something
you
be
expect
to
exhaust
every
possible
method
to
accomplish
it
if
you
come
back
and
say
you
try
and
it
couldn
t
be
do
he
d
just
tell
you
find
another
way
in
the
world
table

be
held
in
pyongyang
north
korea
roone
call
me
into
his
office
one
day
and
say
this
be
go
to
be
interest
let
s
cover
it
on
wide
world
of
sport
i
thought
he
be
joking
he
surely
knew
it
would
be
impossible
to
secure
the
right
to
an
event
in
north
korea
he
wasn
t
joking
i
then
embark
on
a
worldwide
pursuit
to
secure
the
right
the
first
stop
be
cardiff
wale
to
meet
with
the
head
of
the
world
table
tennis
federation
and
then
from
there
since
i
wasn
t
allow
to
travel
to
north
korea
to
beijing
to
meet
with
the
north
korean
contingent
after
a
few
month
of
intense
negotiation
we
be
on
the
eve
of
closing
the
deal
when
i
receive
a
call
from
someone
on
the
asian
desk
in
the
u
s
state
department
everything
you
re
do
with
them
be
illegal
he
say
you
re
in
violation
of
strict
u
s
sanction
against
do
any
business
with
north
korea
that
certainly
seem
like
the
end
of
the
road
but
i
also
have
roone
in
my
mind
tell
me
to
find
another
way
it
turn
out
that
the
state
department
wasn
t
oppose
to
our
enter
north
korea
they
actually
like
the
idea
of
our
go
in
with
camera
and
capture
what
image
we
could
there
they
just
wouldn
t
allow
us
to
pay
the
north
korean
for
the
right
or
enter
into
any
contract
with
them
when
i
explain
this
to
the
north
korean
contingent
they
be
livid
and
it
appear
that
the
whole
thing
would
collapse
i
eventually
arrive
at
a
workaround
that
involve
secure
the
right
not
through
the
host
country
but
through
the
world
table
tennis
federation
the
north
korean
government
though
we
be
no
longer
pay
them
still
agree
to
let
us
in
and
we
become
the
first
u
s
medium
team
to
enter
north
korea
in
decade
a
historic
moment
in

broadcasting
roone
never
knew
the
length
i
d
go
to
to
get
it
do
but
i
know
i
wouldn
t
have
do
it
have
i
not
be
driven
in
part
by
his
expectation
and
my
desire
to
please
him
it
s
a
delicate
thing
find
the
balance
between
demand
that
your
people
perform
and
not
instill
a
fear
of
failure
in
them
most
of
us
who
work
for
roone
want
to
live
up
to
his
standard
but
we
also
knew
that
he
have
no
patience
for
excuse
and
that
he
could
easily
turn
on
anyone
in
his
singularly
cut
somewhat
cruel
way
if
he
felt
we
weren
t
perform
to
his
satisfaction
every
monday
morning
the
top
executive
in
sport
would
gather
around
a
conference
table
to
review
the
past
weekend
s
coverage
and
plan
for
what
be
come
up
the
rest
of
us
sat
in
a
ring
of
chair
around
the
outer
edge
of
the
room
true
backbencher
wait
for
critique
of
the
work
we
d
just
complete
and
order
for
the
week
ahead
one
morning
this
be
early
in
my
time
at
wide
world
of
sport
right
around
the
time
of
the
snorkel
exchange
roone
walk
in
and
begin
excoriate
the
entire
team
for
miss
a
world
record
for
the
mile
set
by
the
great
british
middle
distance
runner
sebastian
coe
at
a
track
and
field
event
in
oslo
norway
we
be
normally
on
top
of
such
thing
but
there
be
unexpected
complication
in
this
case
and
i
hadn
t
be
able
to
procure
the
right
to
the
race
in
time
to
air
it
i
suspect
it
be
go
to
be
a
problem
come
monday
but
i
held
on
to
an
unrealistic
hope
that
it
might
slip
by
without
mention
no
such
luck
roone
look
around
the
table
at
his
senior
team
want
to
know
who
be
at
fault
from
the
outer
edge
of
the
room
i
raise
my
hand
and
say
that
it
be
my
mistake
the
room
go
silent
two
dozen
head
turn
toward
me
nobody
say
anything
and
we
move
on
but
after
the
meeting
various
people
come
up
to
me
and
murmur
i
can
t
believe
you
do
that
do
what
admit
it
be
your
fault
what
do
you
mean
no
one
ever
do
that
roone
never
say
anything
to
me
about
it
but
he
treat
me
differently
with
high
regard
it
seem
from
that
moment
on
in
my
early
day
i
thought
there
be
only
one
lesson
in
this
story
the
obvious
one
about
the
importance
of
take
responsibility
when
you
screw
up
that
s
true
and
it
s
significant
in
your
work
in
your
life
you
ll
be
more
respect
and
trust
by
the
people
around
you
if
you
honestly
own
up
to
your
mistake
it
s
impossible
not
to
make
them
but
it
be
possible
to
acknowledge
them
learn
from
them
and
set
an
example
that
it
s
okay
to
get
thing
wrong
sometimes
what
s
not
okay
be
to
undermine
others
by
lie
about
something
or
cover
your
own
as
first
there
s
a
related
lesson
though
that
i
only
come
to
fully
appreciate
year
later
when
i
be
in
a
position
of
real
leadership
it
s
so
simple
that
you
might
think
it
doesn
t
warrant
mention
but
it
s
surprisingly
rare
be
decent
to
people
treat
everyone
with
fairness
and
empathy
this
doesn
t
mean
that
you
low
your
expectation
or
convey
the
message
that
mistake
don
t
matter
it
mean
that
you
create
an
environment
where
people
know
you
ll
hear
them
out
that
you
re
emotionally
consistent
and
fair
mind
and
that
they
ll
be
give
second
chance
for
honest
mistake
if
they
don
t
own
up
to
their
mistake
or
if
they
blame
someone
else
or
if
the
mistake
be
the
result
of
some
unethical
behavior
that
s
a
different
story
and
something
that
shouldn
t
be
tolerate
there
be
people
at
abc
sport
who
live
in
fear
of
roone
turn
on
them
and
as
a
result
they
avoid
take
risk
or
stick
their
neck
out
too
far
i
never
felt
that
way
but
i
could
see
it
in
others
and
i
understood
where
it
come
from
he
be
a
capricious
bos
and
over
time
capriciousness
take
a
huge
toll
on
a
staff
s
morale
one
day
he
would
make
you
feel
like
you
be
the
most
important
person
in
the
division
the
next
he
would
deliver
wither
criticism
or
would
put
a
knife
in
your
back
for
reason
that
be
never
quite
clear
he
have
a
way
of
play
people
off
each
other
and
i
could
never
tell
if
it
be
a
purposeful
strategy
or
a
function
of
his
personality
for
all
of
his
immense
talent
and
success
roone
be
insecure
at
heart
and
the
way
he
defend
against
his
own
insecurity
be
to
foster
it
in
the
people
around
him
oftentimes
it
work
in
its
way
and
make
you
work
that
much
harder
to
please
him
but
there
be
time
when
he
drove
me
so
crazy
i
be
sure
i
be
go
to
quit
i
wasn
t
alone
in
think
this
i
didn
t
quit
though
i
be
able
to
make
peace
with
the
way
roone
exercise
his
authority
to
be
motivate
by
the
good
and
not
be
too
personally
wound
by
the
bad
i
be
naturally
resilient
i
think
and
work
for
roone
make
me
more
so
and
i
pride
myself
on
work
hard
especially
in
a
place
where
so
many
of
the
people
around
me
be
well
educate
and
from
more
sophisticated
background
it
be
important
to
me
to
know
that
when
it
come
down
to
it
i
could
outwork
anyone
else
and
so
i
be
focus
much
more
on
that
than
i
be
on
the
vicissitude
of
roone
s
mood
it
be
only
later
look
back
that
i
realize
that
so
much
of
what
we
accomplish
didn
t
have
to
come
at
such
a
cost
i
be
motivate
by
roone
s
drive
for
perfection
and
have
carry
it
with
me
ever
since
but
i
learn
something
else
along
the
way
too
excellence
and
fairness
don
t
have
to
be
mutually
exclusive
i
wouldn
t
have
articulate
it
that
way
at
the
time
mostly
i
be
just
focus
on
do
my
job
well
and
certainly
wasn
t
think
about
what
i
d
do
differently
if
i
be
in
roone
s
shoe
but
year
later
when
i
be
give
the
chance
to
lead
i
be
instinctively
aware
of
both
the
need
to
strive
for
perfection
and
the
pitfall
of
care
only
about
the
product
and
never
the
people

when

cynic

snob
over
the
next
few
year
those
corny
tradition
would

camaraderie
within

early
on
it

just
who
they

that

nowhere

this
more

respect
roone
and
they
be
well
aware
of
his
talent
and
reputation
but
they
be
also
a
little
intimidate
by
him
he
spoke
a
language
and
move
in
a
world
they
weren
t
familiar
with

that
to
his
advantage
he
be
aloof
and
sometimes
openly
critical
of
them
he
d
show
up
late
for
meeting
or
would
at
time
blatantly
disregard
some
policy
issue
by
the
bean
counter
as
he
saw
them
i
be
one
of
the
last
of
the
old
guard
from
sport
still
around
in
those
day
and
roone
often
commiserate
with
me
i
d
get
a
call
from
his
assistant
at
the
end
of
the
day
ask
me
to
come
over
to
news
and
when
i
arrive
roone
would
pull
out
a
bottle
of
a
white
italian
wine
that
he
love
we
d
sit
in
his
office
surround
by
emmy
award
while
he
griped
about
how
tom
and
dan
be
crimp
his
style
they
don
t
get
it
he
d
say
you
can
t
save
your
way
to
success
roone
believe
in
spar
no
expense
in
the
pursuit
of
greatness
and
he
didn
t
want
anyone
tell
him
he
have
to
change
the
way
he
do
thing
to
meet
some
arbitrary
budgetary
goal
he
didn
t
care
about
the
business
side
of
thing
but
if
press
he
could
always
point
to
the
revenue
we
d
brought
in
over
the
year
and
say
that
the
profligate
spending
allow
us
not
just
to
make
amaze
television
but
to
create
an
aura
of
sophistication
and
glamour
that
advertiser
want
to
be
a
part
of
that
wasn
t
how
tom
and
dan
work
they
come
in
and
immediately
strip
away
all
the
perk
we
d
grown
use
to
no
more
limo
line
up
in
front
of
abc
headquarters
wait
for
executive
no
more
trip
on
the
concorde
or
first
class
travel
no
more
bottomless
expense
account
they
saw
how
our
business
be
change
in
a
way
a
lot
of
people
at
abc
didn
t
want
to
accept
margin
be
get
tighter
competition
be
tougher
within
our
own
company
even
espn
be
begin
to
find
its
footing
which
eventually
would
have
a
direct
impact
on
abc
sport
tom
and
dan
weren
t
just
meat
and
potato
guy
who
didn
t
get
it
they
be
shrewd
businesspeople
who
sense
which
way
the
wind
be
blowing
it
also
should
be
say
that
when
they
felt
it
be
important
to
spend
money
they
do
roone
benefit
from
that
more
than
anyone
when
they
give
him
the
go
ahead
to
woo
diane
sawyer
from
cbs
and
david
brinkley
from
nbc
to
round
out
the
all
star
team
at
abc
news
one
of
the
first
thing
they
do
after
take
over
be
to
tell
roone
they
didn
t
want
him
run
both
sport
and
news
they
give
him
a
choice
and
roone
chose
news
with
the
one
stipulation
that
he
would
be
the
executive
producer
of
our
winter
olympics
coverage
in
calgary
i
assume
they
d
replace
him
with
someone
from
within
the
division
i
thought
there
be
a
chance
it
might
even
be
me
but
instead
they
brought
in
dennis
swanson
who
prior
to
become
the
head
of
the
vaunt
abc
sport
division
have
manage
a
half
dozen
or
so
local
tv
station
for
abc
dennis
s
great
and
legitimate
claim
to
fame
be
that
he
be
the
guy
who
put
oprah
winfrey
on
tv
in
chicago
in
overnight
i
go
from
work
for
the
most
successful
sport
television
executive
of
all
time
to
work
for
someone
who
d
never
spent
a
minute
at
a
network
or
in
sport
broadcasting
my
former
bos
jim
spence
be
one
of
the
people
who
also
get
pass
over
for
roone
s
job
when
tom
and
dan
announce
they
be
bring
in
dennis
jim
quit
and
other
senior
executive
follow
him
out
the
door
jim
go
to
the
talent
agency
icm
to
start
a
sport
division
i
hung
around
hop
something
might
open
up
for
me
after
a
short
time
work
for
dennis
though
i
call
jim
to
say
it
seem
like
there
be
nothing
for
me
there
anymore
and
i
need
to
get
out
jim
ask
me
to
come
join
him
at
icm
and
we
quickly
craft
a
deal
i
be
under
contract
at
abc
but
i
figure
they
d
let
me
out
of
it
and
the
next
day
i
go
into
work
planning
to
give
dennis
my
notice
before
i
could
set
up
a
time
to
talk
with
him
i
spoke
with
steve
solomon
the
head
of
human
resource
for
abc
whom
dennis
have
brought
in
to
help
him
run
sport
i
told
steve
i
be
planning
to
leave
we
need
to
talk
with
dennis
he
say
he
have
another
idea
for
you
when
i
step
into
dennis
s
office
he
say
i
ve
get
news
for
you
i
m
go
to
make
you
senior
vice
president
for
program
i
want
you
to
create
a
blueprint
for
all
of
abc
s
sport
program
i
be
completely
thrown
i
be
about
to
tell
you
i
be
leave
i
finally
say
leave
i
didn
t
really
think
there
be
a
path
for
me
here
anymore
i
explain
that
jim
spence
be
start
a
sport
business
at
icm
and
that
i
d
make
a
decision
to
join
him
i
think
that
s
a
mistake
dennis
say
he
wasn
t
so
sure
the
company
would
let
me
out
of
my
contract
for
one
this
be
a
big
opportunity
for
you
bob
i
don
t
think
you
should
just
let
it
go
he
give
me
twenty
four
hour
to
give
him
an
answer
i
go
home
that
night
and
have
a
long
conversation
with
my
then
wife
susan
we
weigh
my
misgiving
about
work
for
dennis
against
the
potential
of
this
new
job
we
talk
about
our
two
daughter
and
the
security
of
be
in
a
place
i
knew
well
versus
take
a
risk
on
a
new
venture
ultimately
i
decide
to
stay
where
i
be
because
abc
sport
have
be
such
a
good
place
for
me
over
the
year
and
i
still
wasn
t
ready
to
give
up
on
it
there
be
moment
in
our
career
in
our
life
that
be
inflection
point
but
they
re
often
not
the
most
obvious
or
dramatic
one
i
wasn
t
sure
i
be
make
the
right
decision
it
be
probably
the
safer
one
really
to
stay
at
the
place
i
knew
but
i
also
didn
t
want
to
leave
too
impulsively
because
my
ego
have
be
bruise
or
because
i
have
some
feel
of
superiority
when
it
come
to
dennis
if
i
be
ultimately
go
to
leave
it
have
to
be
because
there
be
an
opportunity
that
be
too
great
to
say
no
and
the
icm
job
wasn
t
that
take
dennis
up
on
his
offer
prove
to
be
one
of
the
best
career
decision
i
ever
make
i
d
soon
learn
that
i
have
be
totally
wrong
in
my
assessment
of
him
he
be
an
amiable
funny
guy
his
energy
and
optimism
be
infectious
and
crucially
he
knew
what
he
didn
t
know
this
be
a
rare
trait
in
a
bos
it
s
easy
to
imagine
another
person
in
dennis
s
shoe
overcompensate
for
the
fact
that
he
d
never
work
at
a
network
by
exude
a
kind
of
fake
authority
or
knowledge
but
that
wasn
t
how
dennis
be
wire
we
would
sit
in
meeting
and
something
would
come
up
and
rather
than
bluffing
his
way
through
it
dennis
would
say
he
didn
t
know
and
then
he
d
turn
to
me
and
others
for
help
he
regularly
ask
me
to
take
the
lead
in
conversation
with
high
ups
while
he
sat
back
and
he
take
every
opportunity
to
extol
my
virtue
to
tom
and
dan
in
the
lead
up
to
the
winter
olympics
dennis
ask
me
to
present
our
plan
to
them
and
the
high
rank
executive
in
the
company
it
be
an
enormous
opportunity
for
me
and
a
perfect
example
of
how
dennis
never
put
himself
ahead
of
anyone
else
it
be
who
he
be
a
naturally
generous
man
but
it
be
also
a
function
of
the
culture
that
tom
and
dan
create
they
be
two
of
the
most
authentic
people
i
ve
ever
met
genuinely
themselves
at
all
time
no
air
no
big
ego
that
need
to
be
manage
no
false
sincerity
they
comport
themselves
with
the
same
honesty
and
forthrightness
no
matter
who
they
be
talk
to
they
be
shrewd
businesspeople
warren
buffett
later
call
them
probably
the
great
two
person
combination
in
management
that
the
world
have
ever
see
or
maybe
ever
will
see
but
it
be
more
than
that
i
learn
from
them
that
genuine
decency
and
professional
competitiveness
weren
t
mutually
exclusive
in
fact
true
integrity
a
sense
of
know
who
you
be
and
be
guide
by
your
own
clear
sense
of
right
and
wrong
be
a
kind
of
secret
weapon
they
trust
in
their
own
instinct
they
treat
people
with
respect
and
over
time
the
company
come
to
represent
the
value
they
live
by
a
lot
of
us
be
get
paid
less
than
we
would
have
be
paid
if
we
go
to
a
competitor
we
knew
they
be
cheap
but
we
stayed
because
we
felt
so
loyal
to
these
two
men
their
business
strategy
be
fairly
simple
they
be
hypervigilant
about
control
cost
and
they
believe
in
a
decentralize
corporate
structure
meaning
they
didn
t
think
every
key
decision
should
be
make
by
the
two
of
them
or
by
a
small
group
of
strategist
in
corporate
headquarters
they
hire
people
who
be
smart
and
decent
and
hardworking
they
put
those
people
in
position
of
big
responsibility
and
they
give
them
the
support
and
autonomy
need
to
do
the
job
they
be
also
tremendously
generous
with
their
time
and
always
accessible
because
of
this
executive
work
for
them
always
have
a
clear
sense
of
what
their
priority
be
and
their
focus
enable
us
all
to
be
focus
too


in
february
we
go
to
calgary
to
cover
the
winter
game
as
agree
roone
be
executive
producer
and
i
be
the
senior
program
executive
which
meant
that
in
the
long
run
up
to
the
olympics
i
be
in
charge
of
the
intricate
schedule
of
all
televise
event
communicate
and
negotiate
with
the
olympic
organize
committee
and
the
various
govern
body
around
the
world
and
help
to
plan
our
coverage
in
advance
of
the
game
a
couple
of
day
before
the
game
begin
roone
show
up
in
calgary
and
call
me
to
his
suite
okay
he
say
what
be
we
do
it
have
be
two
year
since
we
d
work
together
but
right
away
it
be
like
nothing
have
change
in
good
way
and
bad
we
be
schedule
to
air
a
three
hour
olympics
preview
the
night
before
the
opening
ceremony
and
for
week
i
d
be
try
to
get
roone
to
focus
on
it
he
finally
watch
it
after
arrive
in
calgary
the
night
before
it
be
schedule
to
air
it
s
all
wrong
he
say
there
s
no
excitement
no
tension
a
team
of
people
work
through
the
night
to
execute
all
of
his
change
in
time
to
get
it
on
the
air
he
be
right
of
course
his
storytelling
instinct
be
as
sharp
as
ever
but
it
be
such
a
stressful
way
to
kick
thing
off
and
a
reminder
of
how
one
person
s
unwillingness
to
give
a
timely
response
can
cause
so
much
unnecessary
strain
and
inefficiency
we
set
up
our
operation
in
a
cavernous
warehouse
on
the
outskirt
of
calgary
there
be
several
trailer
and
small
building
inside
the
warehouse
that
house
various
production
and
tech
crew
our
control
room
be
in
there
too
with
roone
in
the
captain
s
chair
and
me
in
the
back
row
deal
with
logistics
behind
the
control
room
be
a
glass
enclose
observation
booth
for
vip
throughout
the
game
tom
and
dan
and
several
board
member
and
guest
would
spend
time
in
the
booth
watch
us
work
the
first
few
day
go
off
without
a
hitch
and
then
everything
change
overnight
strong
chinook
wind
roll
in
and
the
temperature
shot
up
into
the
sixty
the
snow
on
the
alpine
course
and
the
ice
on
the
bobsled
run
melt
event
after
event
get
cancel
and
even
those
that
take
place
prove
to
be
a
challenge
because
our
camera
couldn
t
see
anything
through
the
fog
every
morning
for
the
next
several
day
i
d
arrive
at
the
control
room
have
almost
no
idea
what
we
be
go
to
put
on
the
air
that
night
it
be
a
perfect
example
of
the
need
for
optimism
thing
be
dire
for
sure
but
i
need
to
look
at
the
situation
not
as
a
catastrophe
but
as
a
puzzle
we
need
to
solve
and
to
communicate
to
our
team
that
we
be
talented
and
nimble
enough
to
solve
these
problem
and
make
something
wonderful
on
the
fly
the
big
challenge
be
find
program
to
fill
our
prime
time
hour
which
be
now
fill
with
gap
hole
where
big
ticket
olympic
event
use
to
be
this
meant
deal
with
an
olympic
committee
that
be
struggle
to
solve
its
own
schedule
crisis
even
before
the
game
begin
i
d
push
my
luck
with
them
the
original
draw
for
the
hockey
tournament
have
the
united
state
play
two
of
the
toughest
team
in
the
world
in
the
first
two
game
i
assume
they
would
lose
both
contest
and
viewer
interest
would
drop
off
a
cliff
after
they
be
eliminate
so
i
d
travel
all
over
the
world
meeting
with
national
hockey
federation
and
olympic
committee
to
convince
them
to
redraw
the
bracket
now
i
be
on
the
phone
with
the
calgary
olympic
committee
several
time
a
day
beg
them
to
change
the
schedule
of
event
so
that
we
d
have
something
to
show
in
prime
time
the
meeting
with
roone
before
each
night
s
telecast
be
almost
comical
he
d
come
into
the
booth
every
afternoon
and
say
what
be
we
gonna
do
tonight
and
i
d
reply
well
we
ve
get
romania
versus
sweden
in
hockey
or
some
such
thing
and
then
i
d
walk
him
through
the
reschedule
event
which
be
often
lack
since
we
didn
t
have
the
competition
we
need
each
day
a
team
of
producer
be
sent
out
to
uncover
compelling
human
interest
story
then
they
d
pull
the
feature
together
and
slot
them
into
that
night
s
telecast
the
jamaican
bobsled
team
be
a
godsend
as
be
eddie
the
eagle
edward
the
quixotic
british
ski
jumper
who
finish
last
in
both
and
meter
event
it
be
a
high
wire
act
but
it
be
fun
too
and
it
be
satisfy
to
face
the
challenge
of
each
day
know
that
the
only
way
through
be
to
stay
laser
focus
and
to
exude
as
much
calmness
as
possible
to
the
people
around
me
somehow
it
all
work
the
rating
be
historically
high
tom
and
dan
be
pleased
the
add
drama
of
have
to
improvise
so
much
of
it
be
a
fitting
end
to
roone
s
reign
over
sport
television
it
be
also
the
last
olympics
abc
would
televise
after
a
forty
two
year
run
we
no
longer
held
the
right
after
those
game
on
the
final
night
of
coverage
after
we
sign
off
several
of
us
hung
around
in
the
control
room
and
drank
champagne
toast
our
effort
and
laugh
about
how
closely
we
d
avert
disaster
one
by
one
people
file
out
and
head
back
to
the
hotel
i
be
the
last
one
left
in
the
control
room
and
stayed
there
for
a
while
take
in
the
silence
and
stillness
after
so
much
action
then
i
turn
out
the
light
and
head
home


a
few
week
later
i
get
call
into
a
meeting
with
tom
and
dan
we
want
to
get
to
know
you
well
tom
say
he
told
me
they
d
watch
me
closely
in
calgary
and
they
be
impressed
with
how
i
d
handle
myself
under
pressure
some
thing
might
be
opening
up
dan
say
and
they
want
me
to
know
they
have
their
eye
on
me
my
first
thought
be
that
maybe
i
have
a
chance
at
the
top
job
at
espn
but
shortly
after
that
meeting
they
give
it
to
the
guy
who
be
executive
vice
president
of
abc
television
at
the
time
there
i
be
frustrate
at
be
pass
over
again
when
they
call
me
back
in
and
give
me
his
job
we
want
to
park
you
there
for
a
little
while
dan
say
but
we
have
big
plan
i
didn
t
know
what
those
plan
be
but
the
job
they
d
just
give
me
number
two
at
abc
tv
felt
like
a
pretty
far
reach
i
be
thirty
seven
year
old
i
d
primarily
work
in
sport
and
now
i
would
be
run
daytime
and
late
night
and
saturday
morning
television
as
well
as
manage
business
affair
for
the
entire
network
i
knew
precisely
nothing
about
how
any
of
that
be
do
but
tom
and
dan
seem
confident
i
could
learn
on
the
job
my
instinct
throughout
my
career
have
always
be
to
say
yes
to
every
opportunity
in
part
this
be
just
garden
variety
ambition
i
want
to
move
up
and
learn
and
do
more
and
i
wasn
t
go
to
forgo
any
chance
to
do
that
but
i
also
want
to
prove
to
myself
that
i
be
capable
of
do
thing
that
i
be
unfamiliar
with
tom
and
dan
be
the
perfect
boss
in
this
regard
they
would
talk
about
value
ability
more
than
experience
and
they
believe
in
put
people
in
role
that
require
more
of
them
than
they
knew
they
have
in
them
it
wasn
t
that
experience
wasn
t
important
but
they
bet
on
brain
as
they
put
it
and
trust
that
thing
would
work
out
if
they
put
talented
people
in
position
where
they
could
grow
even
if
they
be
in
unfamiliar
territory
tom
and
dan
brought
me
into
their
inner
circle
they
let
me
in
on
their
decision
make
and
confide
in
me
about
people
include
brandon
stoddard
who
ran
prime
time
as
president
of
abc
entertainment
brandon
be
a
talented
executive
who
have
great
taste
in
television
but
like
a
lot
of
others
who
d
come
up
in
entertainment
he
didn
t
have
the
temperament
for
work
in
a
corporate
structure
brandon
have
hollywood
figure
out
and
to
him
tom
and
dan
be
station
guy
who
have
no
clue
about
his
business
he
be
unable
to
hide
his
disdain
for
them
and
unwilling
to
adapt
to
their
way
of
do
thing
or
even
make
an
effort
to
understand
where
they
be
come
from
tom
and
dan
unsurprisingly
grow
increasingly
frustrate
in
return
and
over
time
a
mutual
distrust
and
low
level
animosity
take
hold
early
one
friday
morning
dan
sat
down
across
from
me
in
the
cafeteria
at
abc
s
headquarters

risk

be
the
first
time

the
history

the
company
that
the
person

for
a
lot
of
abc
s
recent
success
include
the
wonder
year
and
roseanne
they
would
have
be
completely
justified
in
their
disdain
for
the
guy
who
knew
nothing
about
their
business
but
be
about
to
be
their
bos

two
of
the
most
supportive
people

ve
ever

their
support

business
and
i
didn
t
but

and
i
hop

would
be
willing
to
be
patient
with
me
as
i
learn
on
the
job
don
t
worry
bob
we

i
flew
back
to
new
york
and
sat
down
with
my
wife
we
d
agree
before
i
go
out
there
that
i
wouldn
t
make
any
final
decision
without
our
talk
it
through
first
this
job
meant
living
in
l
a
and
we
have
a
life
we
love
in
new
york
we
d
just
renovate
our
apartment
our
girl
be
at
a
great
school
our
closest
friend
be
in
new
york
susan
be
an
executive
producer
of
news
at
wnbc
and
one
of
those
new
yorkers
who
never
want
to
live
anywhere
else
i
knew
this
would
be
hard
for
her
and
that
in
her
heart
she
wouldn
t
want
to
go
she
be
incredibly
supportive
life
s
an
adventure
she
say
if
you
don
t
choose
the
adventurous
path
then
you
re
not
really
living
the
next
day
thursday
tom
and
dan
announce
that
i
would
be
the
new
head
of
abc
entertainment
three
day
later
i
flew
out
to
l
a
and
start
the
job
chapter
know
what
you
don
t
know
and
trust
in
what
you
do
it
wasn
t
quite
leap
without
a
parachute
but
it
felt
a
lot
like
free
fall
at
first
i
told
myself
you
have
a
job
they
re
expect
you
to
turn
this
business
around
your
inexperience
can
t
be
an
excuse
for
failure
so
what
do
you
do
in
a
situation
like
that
the
first
rule
be
not
to
fake
anything
you
have
to
be
humble
and
you
can
t
pretend
to
be
someone
you
re
not
or
to
know
something
you
don
t
you
re
also
in
a
position
of
leadership
though
so
you
can
t
let
humility
prevent
you
from
lead
it
s
a
fine
line
and
something
i
preach
today
you
have
to
ask
the
question
you
need
to
ask
admit
without
apology
what
you
don
t
understand
and
do
the
work
to
learn
what
you
need
to
learn
as
quickly
as
you
can
there
s
nothing
less
confidence
inspire
than
a
person
fake
a
knowledge
they
don
t
posse
true
authority
and
true
leadership
come
from
know
who
you
be
and
not
pretend
to
be
anything
else
luckily
i
have
stu
and
ted
by
my
side
i
be
thoroughly
dependent
on
them
especially
in
those
early
day
their
first
order
of
business
be
to
schedule
what
felt
like
an
endless
string
of
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
meeting
back
then
the
head
of
any
of
the
three
network
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
people
in
television
a
fact
that
felt
surreal
to
me
but
to
everyone
in
the
industry
i
be
a
loom
question
mark
i
have
no
sense
of
how
thing
be
do
in
hollywood
and
no
experience
manage
relationship
with
creative
people
or
work
with
their
representative
i
didn
t
speak
their
language
i
didn
t
understand
their
culture
to
them
i
be
a
suit
from
new
york
who
suddenly
for
reason
that
must
have
seem
baffling
have
immense
influence
over
their
creative
life
so
every
day
i
met
with
the
manager
and
agent
and
writer
and
director
and
tv
star
that
stu
and
ted
line
up
for
me
in
most
of
those
meeting
i
have
the
distinct
sensation
of
be
poked
and
prod
in
an
effort
to
figure
out
who
i
be
and
what
the
hell
i
be
do
there
the
task
be
to
not
let
my
ego
get
the
best
of
me
rather
than
try
too
hard
to
impress
whoever
be
across
the
table
i
need
to
resist
the
urge
to
pretend
i
knew
what
i
be
do
and
ask
a
lot
of
question
there
be
no
get
around
that
i
be
a
square
peg
there
i
didn
t
come
up
through
hollywood
i
didn
t
have
a
big
personality
or
any
obvious
swagger
i
barely
knew
anyone
in
town
i
could
be
insecure
about
that
or
i
could
let
my
relative
blandness
my
un
hollywood
ness
be
a
kind
of
mystery
that
work
to
my
advantage
while
i
absorbed
as
much
as
i
could
i
arrive
in
l
a
with
six
week
left
to
decide
on
a
lineup
for
the
prime
time
season
on
my
first
day
in
the
office
i
be
hand
a
stack
of
forty
script
to
read
each
night
i
d
take
them
home
and
dutifully
make
my
way
through
them
make
note
in
the
margin
but
struggle
to
imagine
how
the
script
in
front
of
me
would
translate
to
the
screen
and
doubt
my
ability
to
judge
what
be
good
and
what
wasn
t
be
i
even
pay
attention
to
the
right
stuff
be
there
thing
that
other
people
could
obviously
see
that
i
be
miss
entirely
the
answer
at
first
be
yes
i
d
come
in
and
meet
with
stu
and
others
to
winnow
the
pile
the
next
day
stu
could
dissect
a
script
so
quickly
his
motivation
aren
t
clear
at
the
top
of
act
and
i
d
look
back
through
the
page
on
my
lap
think
wait
act
when
do
act
end
stu
would
become
one
of
my
closest
friend
i
sometimes
wore
him
down
with
my
question
and
inexperience
but
he
persevere
and
taught
me
vital
lesson
not
just
about
how
to
read
script
but
about
how
to
interact
with
creative
people
i
start
to
realize
over
time
though
that
i
d
internalize
a
lot
by
watch
roone
tell
story
all
those
year
sport
wasn
t
the
same
as
prime
time
tv
but
there
be
important
lesson
about
structure
and
pace
and
clarity
that
i
d
absorbed
without
even
know
it
in
my
first
week
in
l
a
i
have
lunch
with
the
producer
and
writer

bochco
who
have
two
huge
hit
for
nbc
hill
street
blue
and
l
a
law
but
have
recently
sign
a
lucrative
ten
series
deal
with
abc
i
mention
to
steven
that
i
be
anxious
about
reading
script
i
didn
t
even
know
the
lingo
and
yet
there
be
pressure
to
make
decision
quickly
on
so
many
show
he
wave
it
off
in
a
way
that
i
found
comfort
come
from
someone
like
him
it
s
not
rocket
science
bob
he
say
trust
yourself
at
the
time
there
be
several
successful
show
in

prime
time
lineup

distant

network
juggernaut
my
job

gap

politely

a
thing
he
inform
me
that

basically
his
decision

cast
but
whether
to

forward
with
the
project
or
not
accord

his
deal
if
we
say

a
long
collaboration
and
friendship
with
steven


there
be
another
much
big
risk
we
take
that
first
season
base
on
a
literal
back
of
a
napkin
pitch
at
a
restaurant
in
hollywood
abc
s
head
of
drama
have
give
the
go
ahead
to
a
pilot
from
david
lynch
by
then
famous
for
his
cult
film
eraserhead
and
blue
velvet
and
the
screenwriter
and
novelist
mark
frost
it
be
a
surreal
meander
drama
about
the
murder
of
a
prom
queen
laura
palmer
in
the
fictional
pacific
northwest
town
of
twin
peak
david
direct
the
two
hour
pilot
which
i
vividly
remember
watch
for
the
first
time
and
think
this
be
unlike
anything
i
ve
ever
see
and
we
have
to
do
this
as
they
do
every
year
tom
and
dan
and
a
few
other
executive
come
out
that
spring
for
pilot
season
we
screen
twin
peak
for
them
and
when
the
light
come
up
the
first
thing
dan
do
be
turn
around
and
look
at
me
and
say
i
don
t
know
what
that
be
but
i
think
it
be
really
good
tom
be
much
less
take
than
dan
and
the
other
new
york
base
executive
in
the
room
agree
it
be
too
weird
too
dark
for
network
tv
i
have
such
respect
for
tom
but
i
also
knew
this
show
be
important
enough
to
fight
for
there
be
change
take
place
that
we
have
to
face
we
be
now
compete
with
the
edgier
program
available
on
cable
tv
and
with
the
new
upstart
fox
network
not
to
mention
the
growth
of
videogames
and
the
rise
of
the
vcr
i
felt
that
network
television
have
become
boring
and
derivative
and
we
have
the
chance
with
twin
peak
to
put
something
on
tv
that
be
utterly
original
we
couldn
t
just
fall
back
into
our
same
old
stance
while
everything
change
around
us
it
be
the
roone
lesson
all
over
again
innovate
or
die
eventually
i
convince
them
to
let
me
screen
the
pilot
for
a
young
more
diverse
audience
than
a
group
of
old
guy
from
abc
in
new
york
the
test
audience
didn
t
exactly
support
put
the
show
on
network
television
particularly
because
it
be
so
different
but
it
be
just
that
its
be
different
that
motivate
us
to
give
it
the
green
light
and
make
seven
episode
i
decide
to
put
it
on
in
midseason
in
the
spring
of
rather
than
the
fall
of
each
season
we
hold
back
show
as
midseason
replacement
for
the
inevitability
of
a
few
fail
show
there
s
a
bit
less
pressure
on
those
replacement
show
than
the
one
that
launch
in
the
fall
and
it
seem
like
the
best
strategy
for
twin
peak
so
we
put
it
into
production
to
air
in
the
spring
and
in
the
intervene
month
rough
cut
of
the
first
few
episode
begin
to
come
in
although
he
d
give
me
permission
to
go
ahead
month
earlier
tom
watch
a
couple
of
them
and
write
me
a
letter
that
say
you
can
t
air
this
if
we
put
it
on
television
it
will
kill
our
company
s
reputation
i
phone
tom
and
say
we
have
to
air
twin
peak
by
that
point
there
be
already
a
tremendous
buzz
in
and
outside
of
hollywood
that
we
be
do
this
there
be
even
an
article
on
the
front
page
of
the
wall
street
journal
about
this
button
up
guy
at
abc
who
be
take
huge
creative
risk
suddenly
i
be
get
call
from
steven
spielberg
and
george
lucas
i
visit
steven
on
the
set
of
hook
which
he
be
direct
at
the
time
and
george
at
his
skywalker
ranch
they
be
both
interested
in
talk
about
what
they
might
do
for
abc
that
notion
that
director
of
that
caliber
would
be
interested
in
make
television
show
be
unheard
of
until
we
start
make
twin
peak
two
year
later
in
george
deliver
the
young
indiana
jones
chronicle
which
last
for
two
season
i
told
tom
we
re
get
unbelievable
praise
from
the
creative
community
for
take
this
risk
we
have
to
air
this
to
tom
s
credit
that
s
what
won
him
over
he
be
my
bos
and
he
could
have
say
sorry
i
m
overrule
you
but
he
understood
the
value
of
our
win
over
creative
people
in
hollywood
and
he
accepted
my
reason
that
this
be
a
risk
worth
take
we
promote
the
show
on
the
academy
award
in
late
march
and
air
the
two
hour
pilot
on
sunday
april
nearly
thirty
five
million
people
about
a
third
of
tv
watcher
at
the
time
tune
in
we
then
schedule
it
for
thursday
at
p
m
and
within
week
twin
peak
become
the
most
successful
program
we
d
put
in
that
time
slot
in
four
year
it
be
on
the
cover
of
time
newsweek
described
it
as
be
like
nothing
you
ve
see
in
primetime
or
on
god
s
earth
i
go
to
new
york
that
may
for
the
up
front
the
big
spring
gathering
where
network
preview
upcoming
series
for
advertiser
and
the
press
and
have
to
go
onstage
to
talk
about
abc
every
once
in
a
while
a
network
executive
take
a
big
risk
i
say
and
immediately
the
crowd
broke
into
a
stand
ovation
it
be
the
most
exhilarate
thing
i
d
ever
felt
in
my
career
the
wave
of
euphoria
broke
almost
immediately
within
six
month
twin
peak
go
from
cultural
phenomenon
to
frustrate
disappointment
we
d
give
david
creative
freedom
but
as
we
get
toward
the
end
of
the
first
season
he
and
i
become
lock
in
an
ongoing
debate
about
audience
expectation
the
entire
show
hinge
on
the
question
of
who
kill
laura
palmer
and
i
felt
david
be
lose
sight
of
that
lay
breadcrumb
in
a
way
that
felt
random
and
unsatisfying
david
be
and
be
a
brilliant
filmmaker
but
he
be
not
a
television
producer
there
s
an
organizational
discipline
that
run
a
show
require
deliver
script
on
time
manage
a
crew
make
sure
everything
move
forward
accord
to
schedule
that
david
simply
didn
t
have
there
s
a
storytelling
discipline
too
with
a
film
you
need
to
get
people
in
for
two
hour
and
give
them
a
good
experience
and
hope
that
they
leave
the
theater
engage
and
enthral
with
a
television
series
you
have
to
keep
them
come
back
week
after
week
season
after
season
to
this
day
i
love
and
respect
david
and
will
forever
be
in
awe
of
his
work
but
the
fact
that
he
didn
t
have
a
television
producer
s
sensibility
result
in
storytelling
that
be
too
open
end
you
need
to
resolve
the
mystery
or
at
least
give
people
some
hope
that
it
will
be
resolve
i
say
it
s
begin
to
frustrate
the
audience
include
me
david
felt
the
mystery
wasn
t
the
most
important
element
of
the
show
in
his
ideal
version
we
d
never
find
out
who
the
killer
be
but
other
aspect
of
the
town
and
its
character
would
emerge
we
go
around
and
around
until
finally
he
agree
to
reveal
the
killer
partway
through
season
two
after
that
the
storytelling
become
a
mess
there
be
no
engine
propel
the
story
after
the
mystery
be
resolve
make
matter
bad
there
wasn
t
enough
discipline
in
the
production
process
which
lead
to
confusion
and
delay
it
become
obvious
to
me
that
david
as
brilliant
as
he
be
should
not
run
the
show
and
i
debate
fire
him
and
bring
in
a
group
of
experienced
television
showrunners
to
take
it
over
i
conclude
it
be
a
no
win
situation
and
we
would
be
vilified
if
we
fire
david
lynch
instead
we
move
twin
peak
to
saturday
night
in
part
to
take
pressure
off
its
need
to
perform
and
when
its
rating
drop
precipitously
david
blame
me
publicly
i
d
give
it
a
death
sentence
he
say
first
by
push
for
a
resolution
to
the
mystery
then
by
put
it
on
a
night
when
nobody
would
watch
it
look
back
on
it
now
i
m
not
convince
i
be
right
i
be
apply
a
more
traditional
television
approach
to
the
storytelling
and
david
may
have
be
ahead
of
his
time
deep
down
i
felt
david
be
frustrate
the
audience
but
it
may
well
be
that
my
demand
for
an
answer
to
the
question
of
who
kill
laura
palmer
threw
the
show
into
another
kind
of
narrative
disarray
david
might
have
be
right
all
along
manage
creative
process
start
with
the
understand
that
it
s
not
a
science
everything
be
subjective
there
be
often
no
right
or
wrong
the
passion
it
take
to
create
something
be
powerful
and
most
creator
be
understandably
sensitive
when
their
vision
or
execution
be
question
i
try
to
keep
this
in
mind
whenever
i
engage
with
someone
on
the
creative
side
of
our
business
when
i
be
ask
to
provide
insight
and
offer
critique
i
m
exceedingly
mindful
of
how
much
the
creator
have
pour
themselves
into
the
project
and
how
much
be
at
stake
for
them
i
never
start
out
negatively
and
unless
we
re
in
the
late
stage
of
a
production
i
never
start
small
i
ve
found
that
often
people
will
focus
on
little
detail
as
a
way
of
mask
a
lack
of
any
clear
coherent
big
thought
if
you
start
petty
you
seem
petty
and
if
the
big
picture
be
a
mess
then
the
small
thing
don
t
matter
anyway
and
you
shouldn
t
spend
time
focus
on
them
of
course
no
two
situation
be
alike
there
s
a
big
difference
between
give
feedback
to
a
season
director
like
j
j
abrams
or
steven
spielberg
and
someone
with
much
less
experience
and
confidence
the
first
time
i
sat
down
with
ryan
coogler
to
give
him
note
on
black
panther
i
could
see
how
visibly
anxious
he
be
he
d
never
make
a
film
as
big
as
black
panther
with
a
massive
budget
and
so
much
pressure
on
it
to
do
well
i
take
pain
to
say
very
clearly
you
ve
create
a
very
special
film
i
have
some
specific
note
but
before
i
give
them
to
you
i
want
you
to
know
we
have
tremendous
faith
in
you
this
be
all
a
way
of
state
what
might
seem
obvious
but
be
often
ignore
that
a
delicate
balance
be
require
between
management
be
responsible
for
the
financial
performance
of
any
creative
work
and
in
exercise
that
responsibility
be
careful
not
to
encroach
on
the
creative
process
in
harmful
and
counterproductive
way
empathy
be
a
prerequisite
to
the
sound
management
of
creativity
and
respect
be
critical


remarkably
the
demise
of
twin
peak
wasn
t
our
big
failure
that
season
in
the
spring
of
i
give
the
green
light
to
cop
rock
a
show
that
would
become
the
butt
of
late
night
joke
and
take
a
permanent
place
on
list
of
the
bad
tv
show
of
all
time
but
i
stand
by
the
decision
to
this
day
in
one
of
our
early
meeting
steven
bochco
told
me
that
in
addition
to
doogie
howser
he
have
another
idea
a
police
drama
set
to
music
he
d
be
approach
by
a
broadway
producer
interested
in
turn
hill
street
blue
into
a
musical
which
for
various
reason
he
couldn
t
do
but
the
idea
have
stuck
with
him
not
to
make
a
cop
musical
for
broadway
but
to
make
a
cop
musical
for
tv
he
d
bring
it
up
periodically
and
i
d
deflect
the
idea
i
want
a
cop
show
from
steven
but
i
didn
t
want
a
musical
that
spring
though
still
basking
in
the
glow
of
that
first
season
of
twin
peak
i
finally
come
around
you
know
what
i
told
him
why
not
let
s
try
it
the
show
take
place
in
the
lapd
and
in
all
respect
it
operate
like
a
normal
well
plot
police
procedural
except
that
in
moment
of
high
drama
character
would
burst
into
song
blue
song
gospel
song
big
ensemble
number
i
sense
from
the
moment
i
saw
the
pilot
that
it
wasn
t
go
to
work
and
would
possibly
be
legendarily
bad
but
i
also
thought
there
be
a
chance
i
could
be
wrong
i
admire
steven
s
talent
so
much
and
in
any
case
i
figure
if
i
be
go
to
be
in
i
need
to
be
all
in
cop
rock
premier
in
september
normally
when
show
first
air
i
d
ask
our
head
of
research
in
new
york
to
call
me
in
l
a
with
the
overnight
rating
this
time
i
told
him
if
the
rating
be
good
call
if
they
re
bad
just
send
a
fax
at
a
m
i
woke
to
the
sound
of
the
fax
machine
hum
then
close
my
eye
and
go
back
to
bed
the
review
be
not
in
fact
universally
terrible
i
remember
one
compliment
the
show
s
audaciousness
others
say
that
if
you
strip
away
the
music
you
be
left
with
a
great
steven
bochco
police
drama
most
of
the
rest
say
it
be
an
embarrassment
we
pull
it
in
december
of
that
year
after
eleven
episode
steven
threw
a
wrap
party
on
the
lot
to
celebrate
and
mourn
the
end
of
the
show
together
at
the
end
of
his
remark
he
say
well
it
ain
t
over
till
the
fat
lady
sings
and
over
our
head
soar
a
corpulent
sing
woman
on
a
fly
trapeze
i
get
up
and
address
the
cast
and
crew
we
try
something
big
and
it
didn
t
work
i
say
i
d
much
rather
take
big
risk
and
sometimes
fail
than
not
take
risk
at
all
that
s
genuinely
how
i
felt
at
the
time
i
didn
t
regret
try
it
and
it
s
how
i
felt
a
few
month
later
when
we
pull
the
plug
on
twin
peak
i
didn
t
want
to
be
in
the
business
of
play
it
safe
i
want
to
be
in
the
business
of
create
possibility
for
greatness
of
all
the
lesson
i
learn
in
that
first
year
run
prime
time
the
need
to
be
comfortable
with
failure
be
the
most
profound
not
with
lack
of
effort
but
with
the
unavoidable
truth
that
if
you
want
innovation
and
you
should
always
you
need
to
give
permission
to
fail
steven
and
i
share
the
flop
that
be
cop
rock
together
we
have
a
sense
of
humor
about
it
and
i
make
a
point
to
never
distance
myself
from
the
decision
to
put
it
on
the
air
it
felt
like
a
much
high
stake
version
of
the
lesson
i
d
learn
in
that
room
at
abc
sport
year
before
you
can
t
erase
your
mistake
or
pin
your
bad
decision
on
someone
else
you
have
to
own
your
own
failure
you
earn
as
much
respect
and
goodwill
by
stand
by
someone
in
the
wake
of
a
failure
as
you
do
by
give
them
credit
for
a
success
once
the
cop
rock
wound
have
heal
a
bit
steven
told
me
that
he
want
to
make
what
he
call
the
first
r
rat
show
in
tv
history
i
say
steven
you
do
hill
street
blue
and
l
a
law
for
nbc
where
be
that
for
us
i
get
a
police
show
and
it
s
cop
rock
and
now
you
want
to
do
something
that
will
send
advertiser
run
for
the
hill
what
i
didn
t
appreciate
be
how
much
steven
felt
that
he
d
already
do
all
that
other
stuff
and
be
driven
to
do
something
different
and
how
much
he
be
respond
to
the
shift
landscape
of
television
he
felt
hbo
be
go
to
be
eat
our
lunch
soon
because
their
show
creator
didn
t
have
to
comply
with
prudish
network
censor
or
worry
about
offend
advertiser
so
he
pitch
nypd
blue
as
the
first
r
rat
drama
on
network
tv
i
agree
with
steven
about
the
change
nature
of
television
and
the
stodginess
of
the
network
but
i
also
knew
there
be
no
way
i
could
get
permission
to
put
an
r
rat
show
on
tv
the
sale
guy
told
me
that
and
i
told
steven
and
for
a
while
we
both
walk
away
from
the
idea
i
do
believe
though
that
we
could
do
something
that
stretch
the
boundary
but
wasn
t
quite
r
rat
and
steven
eventually
get
intrigue
by
that
idea
if
we
be
to
do
that
he
say
what
would
it
look
like
he
and
i
consult
with
the
censor
and
come
up
with
a
template
for
what
we
could
and
could
not
do
on
a
pg
show
we
make
a
glossary
of
all
the
word
that
be
technically
inbounds
asswipe
be
okay
asshole
be
not
you
could
use
prick
to
describe
a
person
but
not
a
body
part
we
pull
out
a
notebook
and
drew
stick
figure
basically
of
naked
people
figure
out
what
angle
would
reveal
enough
but
not
too
much
the
next
step
be
to
sell
it
to
dan
burke
dan
flew
out
to
l
a
and
the
three
of
us
have
lunch
near
steven
s
office
we
show
him
our
glossary
and
our
stick
figure
and
explain
why
this
show
be
important
to
us
you
guy
can
do
this
dan
finally
say
but
when
the
shit
hit
the
fan
and
it
s
go
to
hit
the
fan
my
skirt
isn
t
wide
enough
for
you
he
point
at
me
to
hide
behind
it
be
another
example
of
my
be
willing
to
take
risk
in
part
because
of
the
faith
dan
and
tom
place
in
me
they
give
me
this
job
and
i
d
deliver
quickly
and
that
give
me
an
enormous
amount
of
latitude
with
them
i
couldn
t
do
whatever
i
want
but
i
have
the
freedom
to
exercise
a
considerable
amount
of
authority
it
s
a
trust
that
brandon
stoddard
my
predecessor
never
earn
he
refuse
to
respect
them
and
therefore
they
didn
t
respect
him
which
in
turn
meant
they
be
determine
to
tell
him
no
when
he
fought
for
thing
he
want
after
we
get
dan
s
approval
there
be
a
long
painstaking
development
period
in
which
steven
push
in
one
direction
and
abc
s
standard
and
practice
folk
push
back
until
compromise
be
finally
reach
the
show
premier
in
the
fall
of
a
full
season
after
we
d
initially
intend
to
put
it
on
the
air
the
american
family
association
call
for
a
boycott
many
advertiser
refuse
to
buy
spot
more
than
of
our
affiliate
preempt
the
first
episode
but
the
critical
reception
be
extraordinary
and
in
its
second
season
it
be
among
the
top
ten
show
on
tv
it
would
become
a
mainstay
of
prime
time
for
a
dozen
year
win
emmy
and
be
regard
as
one
of
the
best
drama
ever
create
for
the
network
during
my
stint
run
prime
time
we
end
up
number
one
with
the
covet
demographic
four
out
of
five
year
we
even
unseated
brandon
tartikoff
who
d
kept
nbc
atop
the
nielsen
ranking
for
sixty
eight
straight
week
brandon
call
to
congratulate
me
when
the
ranking
come
out
show
abc
on
top
he
be
a
classy
guy
and
he
d
do
something
that
no
one
will
ever
do
again
i
feel
a
little
sad
about
it
i
told
him
it
s
like
joe
dimaggio
s
streak
come
to
an
end
our
success
be
a
team
effort
always
but
it
be
also
the
first
success
i
experienced
in
my
career
that
be
publicly
ascribed
to
me
on
the
one
hand
it
felt
odd
that
i
be
get
credit
for
thing
that
other
people
make
i
d
come
to
entertainment
know
nothing
about
the
job
and
this
group
of
incredibly
talented
people
share
everything
they
knew
with
me
they
work
hard
and
weren
t
threaten
by
the
fact
that
i
d
become
their
bos
because
of
their
generosity
we
succeed
together
and
yet
the
credit
be
largely
give
to
me
i
think
it
s
also
fair
to
say
though
that
we
wouldn
t
have
go
to
number
one
in
prime
time
without
my
run
it
dan
and
tom
s
faith
give
me
the
courage
to
take
big
risk
and
if
i
have
a
strength
it
be
my
ability
to
urge
creative
people
to
do
their
best
work
and
take
chance
while
also
help
them
rebound
from
failure
it
s
always
a
collective
effort
but
my
year
run
entertainment
give
me
a
new
appreciation
for
what
it
take
to
get
a
group
of
talented
people
to
produce
at
the
high
level
find
that
balance
between
accept
credit
for
real
achievement
and
not
make
too
much
of
the
hype
from
the
outside
world
have
only
gotten
more
necessary
during
my
year
as
ceo
i
often
feel
guilty
in
front
of
other
people
with
whom
i
work
when
so
much
attention
and
credit
be
be
direct
toward
me
it
manifest
itself
in
strange
way
i
m
often
in
meeting
with
someone
from
outside
the
company
and
that
person
will
look
only
at
me
even
though
i
m
surround
by
colleague
at
the
table
i
don
t
know
if
other
ceo
feel
this
way
but
it
s
embarrass
to
me
and
in
those
moment
i
make
a
point
of
direct
praise
and
attention
to
my
coworkers
similarly
when
i
m
the
one
attend
a
meeting
with
a
group
outside
of
disney
i
make
sure
to
connect
and
speak
with
every
person
at
the
table
it
s
a
small
gesture
but
i
remember
how
it
felt
to
be
the
overlook
sidekick
and
anything
that
reminds
you
that
you
re
not
the
center
of
the
universe
be
a
good
thing


over
thanksgiving
weekend
dan
burke
call
me
to
say
that
the
president
of
abc
be
retire
they
want
me
to
move
back
to
new
york
and
take
his
place
this
wasn
t
a
total
surprise
when
they
d
make
me
head
of
entertainment
tom
and
dan
have
suggest
that
if
i
do
well
they
want
me
eventually
to
run
the
network
it
be
a
surprise
though
when
i
ask
dan
when
they
want
me
to
start
january
he
say
just
over
a
month
i
be
happy
to
be
go
back
and
not
just
for
the
job
earlier
that
year
susan
and
i
have
separate
and
she
have
move
back
to
new
york
with
our
daughter
susan
never
like
l
a
and
she
like
it
less
once
we
be
apart
new
york
be
where
she
felt
at
home
and
i
couldn
t
begrudge
her
that
i
flew
back
as
often
as
i
could
to
see
the
girl
but
it
be
a
terrible
year
on
short
notice
i
sell
the
house
in
los
angeles
and
packed
up
my
thing
and
move
in
to
a
room
at
the
mark
hotel
on
the
upper
east
side
and
on
january
at
age
forty
three
i
become
president
of
the
abc
television
network
i
d
know
it
be
come
for
some
time
but
it
be
still
surreal
when
it
happen
my
old
mentor
roone
in
news
dennis
swanson
in
sport
be
now
reporting
to
me
ted
harbert

along
with
stu

have
taught
me
how
to
be
a
television
executive
take
over
for
me
at
entertainment
less
than
a
year
later
at
the
end
of
tom

call
me
into
his
office

take
his
job

t
do
it
i
say
i
ve
barely
start
this
job
who
will
run
the
network
you
gotta
wait
as
much
as
my
instinct
be
to
say
yes
to
every
opportunity
this
felt
too
fast
eight
month
later
tom
come
to
me
again
i
need
you
in
that
job

of
capital
city
abc
a
year
and
nine
month
after
become
president
of
the
network
it
be
a
dizzy
and
sometimes
destabilize
trajectory
i
wouldn
t
as
a
rule
recommend
promote
someone
as
rapidly
as
they
promote
me
but
i
will
say
one
more
time
because
it
bear
repeat
the
way
they
conveyed
their
faith
in
me
at
every
step
make
all
the
difference
in
my
success
soon
after
i
become
chief
operating
officer
in
the
spring
of
michael
eisner
the

possible
acquisition
of

around
that
time

large
shareholder
and
michael
eisner
talk
nearby
they
wave
for
tom
to

over
and
before
he
walk
away
i
say
do
me
a
favor
if
you
decide
to
sell
to
michael
give
me
some
warn
okay
it
didn
t
take
long
a
few
week
later
michael
reach
out
to
tom
formally
to
begin
the
negotiation
for
disney
to
buy
capital
city
abc
chapter
enter
disney
so
much
have
be
say
and
write
about
disney
s
acquisition
of
us
that
i
have
little
to
add
except
from
my
own
unique
perspective
give
my
position
at
abc
and
the
fact
that
i
be
told
at
the
time
that
it
be
of
critical
importance
to
michael
eisner
that
i
sign
a
five
year
contract
to
remain
with
the
combine
company
michael
have
be
disney
s
ceo
since
and
he
d
be
run
the
company
without
a
number
two
for
more
than
a
year
after
his
coo
frank
well
die
in
a
helicopter
crash
in
the
spring
of
if
this
deal
go
through
disney
would
nearly
double
in
size
and
michael
knew
he
couldn
t
integrate
the
two
company
and
run
the
newly
combine
entity
on
his
own
it
be
a
lot
for
me
to
absorb
one
day
i
be
in
line
to
become
the
next
ceo
of
cap
city
abc
the
next
i
be
be
ask
to
run
the
medium
division
of
disney
for
at
least
five
year
while
the
latter
be
an
intrigue
job
objectively
it
felt
at
the
time
like
a
bitter
pill
to
swallow
i
knew
if
i
agree
to
stay
on
it
would
likely
require
move
back
to
los
angeles
and
i
didn
t
want
to
do
that
i
hat
the
thought
of
be
away
from
my
daughter
again
and
my
age
parent
be
on
long
island
and
i
want
to
remain
close
to
them
i
be
also
now
engage
to
willow
bay
whom
i
have
start
date
a
little
more
than
a
year
earlier
willow
have
her
own
great
job
in
new
york
anchor
the
weekend
edition
of
good
morning
america
sub
for
the
weekday
host
joan
lunden
during
the
week
and
be
groom
as
her
successor
i
didn
t
want
to
be
apart
from
her
and
i
didn
t
want
to
ask
her
to
give
up
her
job
so
she
could
come
across
the
country
with
me
so
on
one
side
of
the
scale
the
personal
reason
for
walk
away
be
pile
fairly
high
on
the
other
side
the
professional
reason
for
stay
be
stack
just
as
tall
i
didn
t
know
michael
well
but
i
like
and
respect
him
we
have
overlap
briefly
at
abc
year
before
but
i
be
a
low
level
employee
then
and
our
path
never
cross
year
later
he
and
jeffrey
katzenberg
whom
michael
brought
in
to
run
walt
disney
studio
after
he
become
ceo
have
try
to
hire
me
when
i
be
run
abc
entertainment
that
he
be
now
say
the
deal
wouldn
t
happen
without
me
suggest
that
one
day
he
might
ask
me
to
fill
the
role
of
coo
that
have
be
empty
since
frank
well
s
death
i
ve
generally
try
over
the
year
to
keep
my
eye
on
the
job
i
have
and
not
the
job
i
might
someday
have
but
the
thought
that
i
might
have
a
shot
at
run
disney
one
day
be
hard
to
ignore
willow
be
unequivocally
supportive
she
say
i
have
nothing
to
lose
and
a
lot
to
possibly
gain
by
stay
and
that
she
trust
that
she
and
i
could
figure
out
whatever
we
need
to
figure
out
i
sought
some
wisdom
from
tom
murphy
too
tom
be
conflict
he
want
to
deliver
me
to
michael
as
part
of
the
deal
but
he
be
also
capable
of
separate
out
his
interest
and
he
d
always
be
a
good
sound
board
for
me
i
knew
he
be
be
genuine
when
he
say
pal
if
you
play
your
card
right
one
day
you
will
run
that
company
disney
and
capital
city
abc
agree
to
financial
term
on
a
friday
afternoon
while
there
be
some
finer
point
still
to
be
hash
out
the
only
major
issue
left
unresolved
be
whether
i
be
stay
or
go
that
same
night
willow
and
i
have
schedule
a
dinner
with
the
jesuit
priest
who
be
go
to
marry
us
i
m
jewish
and
willow

enlist
both
father
ghirlando
and
a
jewish
cantor
from
new
jersey
to
officiate
our
wedding
there
i
be
a
divorce
jewish
guy
hop
to
impress
the
priest
who
would
perform
our
service
and
every
couple
of
minute
i
have
to
stand
up
and
excuse
myself
from
the
table
to
take
call
regard
the
deal
i
begin
to
worry
about
seem
disrespectful
to
father
ghirlando
so
i
finally
apologize
for
the
interruption
and
say
i
know
i
m
jewish
but
i
need
to
ask
you
for
priest

confidentiality
of
course
he
say
we
re
about
to
announce
the
big
deal
in
entertainment
history
and
i
m
try
to
make
a
decision
on
whether
to
stay
on
with
the
company
or
not
that
s
what
all
of
these
call
be
about
father
ghirlando
didn
t
offer
any
clerical
wisdom
but
he
do
bless
whatever
decision
i
be
about
to
make
we
continued
talk
about
our
wedding
service
but
every
time
i
excuse
myself
to
take
another
call
father
ghirlando
seem
mildly
thrill
know
that
he
be
hearing
about
one
of
the
big
acquisition
in
the
history
of
american
business
before
the
rest
of
the
world
on

battle
with
disney
s
general
counsel
sandy
litvack

mega
merger
sandy

be
complain
that

entire
thing

up
because

too
tough
at
one
point
michael
eisner
pull
tom
murphy
aside
and
beg
him
to
intervene
and
get
me
to
agree
to
the
deal

himself
a
little
later
bob
he
say
it

easy
to
negotiate
this
billion
deal
than
it
be
to
figure
out
yours
will
you
please
just
say
yes
the
final
stick
point
be
the
matter
of
whom
i
would
be
reporting
to
joe
be
push
for
a
formal
agreement

directly
to

he
want
the
freedom
to
name
a
president
someone
who
would
exist
between
the
two
of
us
and
he
want
to
make
sure
that
i
understood
he
could
do
that
while
i
would
have
like

to
say
that
i
be
formally
his
number
two
i
appreciate
how
direct

i
finally
told
joe
to
accept
later

night
i
be
hop
for
a
path
to
possibly
become
ceo
one
day
understand
that
nothing
be
ever
guaranteed
but
it
wasn
t
the
right
time
to
fight
for
that
i
want
the
merger
to
go
well
and
i
want
to
make
sure
the
capital
city
team
be
treat
well
by
disney
without
me
there
i
be
fairly
certain
they
would
get

by
disney

potentially
dispirit
way
we

of
all
of
the
top
cap
city
abc
executive
none
of
them
saw
this
come
and
they
be
still
in
shock
there
be
people
around
the
table
who
have
work
for
tom
and
dan
for
their
entire
career
and
they
be
look
at
me
ask
what
happens
now
what
do
we
do
i
spoke
as
frankly
as
i
could
disney
be
a
very
different
corporate
culture
than
ours
but
tom
have
the
interest
of
the
entire
company
at
heart
when
he
agree
to
the
deal
it
be
go
to
be
a
difficult
transition
though
there
be
no
way
around
that
i
want
people
to
understand
that
i
knew
how
unsettle
it
be
the
corporate
culture
we
be
all
use
to
be
about
to
end
disney
be
more
aggressive
more
creative
more
a
creature
of
hollywood
than
the
company
we
d
all
work
for
i
be
in
a
position
to
make
the
transition
easy
though
and
i
want
them
to
know
they
could
rely
on
me
if
they
need
my
help
as
for
the
deal
itself
a
lot
of
people
be
shock
at
the
billion
price
tag
others
thought
tom
could
have
held
out
longer
and
sell
for
much
more
it
s
impossible
to
say
it
turn
out
to
be
a
bargain
for
disney
though
that
much
be
certain
michael
never
get
much
credit
for
have
the
gut
it
take
to
make
that
deal
but
it
be
an
enormous
risk
and
it
paid
off
for
year
to
come
the
acquisition
give
disney
the
scale
to
remain
independent
when
other
entertainment
company
be
come
to
the
painful
realization
that
they
be
too
small
to
compete
in
a
change
world
the
asset
disney
acquire
in
the
merger
especially
espn
drove
growth
for
year
and
be
a
vital
buffer
for
nearly
a
decade
as
disney

with
a
series
of
box
office
disappointment

due
diligence
about
the
asset
they

but
there
be
no
way

to
start
a
new
chapter
of
his
career
in
hollywood
as
i
left
for
the
airport
and
my
flight
back
to
new
york
it
dawn
on
me
that
michael
might
be
consider
him
for
the
number
two
position
at
disney
a
week
later
that
suspicion
be
confirm
michael
call
and
say
your
briefing
be
eye
opening
it
certainly
won
t
be
easy
to
manage
this
new
company
jane
be
concerned
too
he
say
then
he
address
the
ovitz
question
directly
when
we
make
the
deal
i
left
open
the
possibility
of
bring
in
someone
else
between
us
yes
i
say
i
knew
nothing
be
guaranteed
well
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
m
hire
michael
ovitz
and
he
s
go
to
be
your
bos
ovitz
be
go
to
be
president
of
the
walt
disney
company
not
chief
operating
officer
as
corporate
hierarchy
go
that
meant
that
he
be
my
bos
but
he
wasn
t
necessarily
michael
s
preordain
successor
i
felt
a
moment
of
disappointment
but
i
also
appreciate
that
michael
have
be
straight
with
me
during
the
negotiation
and
candid
with
me
now
he
didn
t
try
to
sugarcoat
it
or
pretend
the
arrangement
be
something
it
be
not
i
be
forty
four
at
the
time
and
i
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
and
in
any
event
there
be
nothing
to
be
gain
by
get
off
to
a
bad
start
with
either
of
them
i
want
to
make
thing
work
after
the
announcement
about
michael
ovitz
i
say
to
a
reporter
from
the
new
york
time
if
mike
eisner
think
this
be
the
right
thing
for
the
company
then
i
trust
his
instinct
the
day
the
quote
appear
in
the
time
i
be
inform
by
an
executive
at
disney
that
michael
disliked
be
refer
to
as
mike
i
hadn
t
even
start
yet
and
i
d
already
commit
my
first
faux
pa
i
soon
learn
that
others
have
much
strong
feeling
about
the
ovitz
hire
than
i
do
i
be
told
that
joe
roth
the
chairman
of
the
studio
be
irate
and
that
sandy
litvack
and
steve
bollenbach
disney
s
chief
financial
officer
be
unhappy
with
the
new
corporate
structure
and
have
refuse
to
report
to
ovitz
from
three
thousand
mile
away
in
new
york
i
could
already
feel
the
resentment
building
at
disney
corporate
hire
michael
ovitz
have
generate
internal
strife
from
the
moment
it
be
announce
but
i
have
no
idea
how
tense
thing
be
go
to
get


for
the
next
several
month
while
we
all
wait
for
regulatory
approval
from
the
fcc
i
commute
to
los
angeles
on
a
weekly
basis
get
to
know
the
various
disney
executive
who
would
soon
be
my
colleague
willow
and
i
also
knew
we
d
have
no
chance
for
a
honeymoon
once
the
deal
close
so
we
radically
shorten
our
engagement
and
get
married
in
early
october
we
spent
our
honeymoon
in
southern
france
and
be
stay
at
the
posh
grand
hotel
du
cap
ferrat
when
a
gigantic
box
arrive
fill
with
disney
merchandise
match
mickey
mouse
pajama
bride
and
groom
mickey
hat
donald
duck
slipper
there
be
so
much
stuff
and
it
be
so
over
the
top
that
we
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
it
all
we
decide
to
leave
it
there
when
we
left
think
maybe
someone
would
get
a
kick
out
of
it
or
have
kid
who
might
like
it
but
to
this
day
a
part
of
me
be
embarrass
at
the
thought
of
the
staff
there
come
into
our
room
after
we
checked
out
and
see
all
of
the
mickey
mouse
paraphernalia
i
remember
look
at
it
all
and
say
to
willow
i
work
for
a
very
different
company
now
in
fact
in
all
the
year
i
work
for
him
i
rarely
saw
michael
eisner
wear
a
tie
that
wasn
t
a
mickey
tie
all
the
senior
leadership
be
encourage
to
wear
them
too
though
i
act
as
if
i
d
never
gotten
that
particular
memo
there
be
more
significant
difference
than
the
brand
attire
the
whole
culture
operate
differently
tom
and
dan
be
warm
accessible
boss
if
you
have
a
problem
they
open
their
door
to
you
if
you
need
advice
they
offer
it
selflessly
as
businessmen
they
be
intensely
focus
on
manage
expense
and
increase
earnings
and
they
surround
themselves
with
executive
who
could
work
for
them
forever
as
long
as
they
adhere
to
the
same
principle
they
also
believe
in
a
decentralize
corporate
structure
if
you
stuck
to
your
budget
and
behave
ethically
tom
and
dan
give
you
room
to
operate
with
independence
other
than
a
cfo
and
a
general
counsel
there
be
no
corporate
staff
no
centralize
bureaucracy
and
very
little
interference
with
the
business
unit
disney
be
the
opposite
of
all
that
in
their
early
day
run
the
company

and
frank
well

they
have
significant
power
over
the
rest
of
the
company
and
they
wield
it
with
impunity
over
all
of
the
senior

the
creative

commercial
success
of
the
prior
decade
to
his
credit
michael
have
the
wisdom
during
this
period
to
enter
into
a
relationship
with
pixar
that
result
in
some
of
the
great
animate
film
ever
make
from
the
begin
the
disney
team
mostly
the
guy
from
strat
planning
as
they
be
call
take
advantage
of
us
as
the
newcomer
to
the
company
it
wasn
t
that
everything
they
do
be
bad
it
be
just
the
opposite
of
what
those
of
us
who
d
work
for
tom
and
dan
be
use
to
they
be
a
completely
centralize
process
orient
company
and
we
instinctively
bristle
at
the
way
they
operate
they
have
also
never
acquire
a
big
company
before
and
they
d
give
very
little
thought
as
to
how
to
do
it
with
sensitivity
and
care
disagreement
that
could
have
be
handle
with
diplomacy
be
instead
do
with
a
tone
that
be
often
authoritative
and
demand
they
act
as
if
because
they
d
bought
us
we
be
expect
always
to
bend
to
their
will
it
didn
t
sit
well
with
a
lot
of
the
former
cap
city
people
i
be
high
enough
up
that
i
be
protect
but
a
lot
of
people
below
me
be
worried
about
what
be
go
to
happen
to
them
and
i
spent
a
ton
of
time
and
energy
soothe
anxiety
and
intervene
in
struggle
on
their
behalf
i
also
have
my
own
run
in
soon
after
the
acquisition
disney
wisely
divest
our
entire
newspaper
business
year
before
the
bottom
fell
out
of
that
industry
but
we
held
on
to
some
magazine
include
the
fashion
magazine
w
shortly
after
the
deal
the
editor
and
publisher
of
w
mention
to
me
that
jane
pratt
the
founder
of
sassy
magazine
and
an
early
contributor
to
vh
and
mtv
have
an
idea
for
a
hip
cosmopolitan
call
jane
jane
come
in
and
pitch
the
idea
which
i
like
because
it
could
connect
us
to
a
young
less
stodgy
demographic
i
review
a
business
plan
that
make
sense
to
me
and
i
give
the
team
the
green
light
i
soon
get
a
call
from
tom
staggs
who
would
later
be
my
cfo
and
work
then
in
strat
planning
tom
be
contact
me
on
behalf
of
his
bos
larry
murphy
who
ran
the
entire
strategic
planning
unit
he
sheepishly
told
me
that
larry
didn
t
allow
any
of
disney
s
business
to
expand
invest
or
attempt
to
start
anything
new
without
a
thorough
analysis
by
his
group
once
they
do
the
analysis
they
d
bring
their
recommendation
to
michael
i
could
tell
tom
wasn
t
comfortable
be
the
messenger
so
i
politely
say
that
he
should
tell
larry
that
i
be
go
forward
with
this
and
didn
t
need
his
input
that
quickly
lead
to
a
call
from
larry
who
want
to
know
what
the
hell
i
be
do
you
re
create
this
magazine
yes
do
you
know
how
much
it
s
go
to
cost
yes
and
you
think
it
s
a
good
idea
yes
we
don
t
work
that
way
at
disney
he
say
in
the
end
larry
allow
the
venture
to
go
forward
he
be
reluctant
to
pick
a
fight
with
me
so
soon
after
i
d
join
the
company
but
the
signal
be
clear
that
from
then
on
there
would
be
no
freelance
at
disney
in
fairness
it
be
a
small
idea
and
arguably
not
worth
the
time
and
investment
though
we
end
up
sell
w
and
jane
to
si
newhouse
at
cond
nast
and
make
a
profit
on
the
transaction
but
there
s
a
way
to
convey
that
while
also
convey
that
you
trust
the
people
who
work
for
you
and
preserve
in
them
an
entrepreneurial
spirit
dan
burke
taught
me
that
exact
lesson
early
on
in
a
way
that
couldn
t
have
be
more
opposite
from
the
strat
planning
approach
i
can
t
recall
exactly
what
it
be
in
response
to
but
in
one
of
our
conversation
about
some
initiative
i
be
consider
dan
hand
me
a
note
that
read
avoid
get
into
the
business
of
manufacturing
trombone
oil
you
may
become
the
great
trombone
oil
manufacturer
in
the
world
but
in
the
end
the
world
only
consumes
a
few
quart
of
trombone
oil
a
year
he
be
tell
me
not
to
invest
in
project
that
would
sap
the
resource
of
my
company
and
me
and
not
give
much
back
it
be
such
a
positive
way
to
impart
that
wisdom
though
and
i
still
have
that
piece
of
paper
in
my
desk
occasionally
pull
it
out
when
i
talk
to
disney
executive
about
what
project
to
pursue
and
where
to
put
their
energy


while
i
be
try
to
adapt
to
the
new
culture
at
disney
i
be
also
watch
the
rapid
disintegration
of
the
relationship
between
my
new
bos
michael
ovitz
and
michael
eisner
it
be
painful
to
witness
and
it
be
take
place
before
the
eye
of
a
lot
of
people
at
the
company
michael
ovitz
s
tenure
officially
begin
in
october
and
from
the
begin
it
be
clear
that
he
be
the
wrong
guy
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
he
have
left
caa
and
have
lose
out
on
a
bid
to
run
universal
you
could
sense
how
important
it
be
to
him
to
remain
atop
the
hollywood
pyramid
and
the
offer
to
be
michael
eisner
s
number
two
be
the
life
preserver
he
thought
he
need
but
the
process
of
make
decision
at
an
agency
be
nothing
like
the
process
at
a
large
corporation
especially
a
highly
structure
place
like
disney
rather
than
help
michael
run
a
complicate
collection
of
business
which
be
a
big
part
of
the
role
of
a
number
two
ovitz
come
with
a
thousand
idea
most
involve
the
giant
personality
that
he
have
relationship
with
as
co
head
of
caa
a
privately
held
agency
he
be
use
to
show
up
with
a
ton
of
idea
that
could
immediately
be
act
upon
and
he
assume
he
could
do
the
same
here
he
be
the
quintessential
agent
and
he
be
use
to
always
be
accessible
for
client
often
drop
everything
he
be
do
in
order
to
be
available
for
them
those
habit
do
not
work
for
disney
he
want
to
offer
people
like
tom
clancy
magic
johnson
martin
scorsese
and
janet
jackson
and
many
more
omnibus
deal
that
would
span
disney
s
business
he
be
constantly
pitch
these
people
on
what
disney
could
do
for
them
deal
like
this
might
sound
great
in
a
press
release
but
they
rarely
turn
out
well
they
need
a
senior
executive
to
act
as
a
sponsor
put
in
the
time
and
energy
necessary
to
shepherd
each
aspect
of
the
deal
through
every
business
and
every
initiative
they
also
send
a
signal
to
the
talent
that
they
have
carte
blanche
and
at
place
like
disney
where
every
idea
be
carefully
vet
this
can
be
a
disaster
i
be
work
out
of
new
york
but
flew
to
l
a
every
week
for
michael
eisner
s
monday
staff
lunch
which
give
me
a
front
row
seat
on
the
whole
debacle
ovitz
would
show
up
with
his
energy
and
idea
and
it
be
clear
to
everyone
around
the
table
that
michael
eisner
who
knew
well
have
little
interest
in
them
michael
would
then
dutifully
run
through
our
business
update
and
new
strategy
and
ovitz
feel
disrespect
would
aggressively
tune
out
and
broadcast
his
lack
of
interest
the
whole
team
saw
this
happen
in
meeting
after
meeting
the
body
language
alone
be
painful
to
witness
and
the
discomfort
start
to
affect
the
entire
senior
management
team
when
the
two
people
at
the
top
of
a
company
have
a
dysfunctional
relationship
there
s
no
way
that
the
rest
of
the
company
beneath
them
can
be
functional
it
s
like
have
two
parent
who
fight
all
the
time
the
kid
feel
the
strain
and
they
start
to
reflect
the
animosity
back
onto
the
parent
and
vent
it
at
each
other
i
try
to
be
polite
with
ovitz
through
it
all
and
respect
that
i
have
a
direct
reporting
relationship
to
him
i
make
an
attempt
to
educate
him
on
the
business
that
report
to
me
often
give
him
briefing
report
to
help
him
well
understand
the
particular
of
network
television
rating
or
espn
distribution
deal
or
talent
contract
but
each
time
he
be
either
dismissive
of
the
information
or
distract
by
phone
call
once
he
take
a
call
in
my
office
from
president
clinton
talk
with
him
for
forty
five
minute
while
i
sat
outside
a
call
from
tom
cruise
interrupt
another
meeting
martin
scorsese
end
a
third
just
minute
after
it
start
meeting
after
meeting
be
either
cancel
reschedule
or
abbreviate
and
soon
every
top
executive
at
disney
be
whisper
behind
his
back
about
what
a
disaster
he
be
manage
your
own
time
and
respect
others
time
be
one
of
the
most
vital
thing
to
do
as
a
manager
and
he
be
horrendous
at
it
with
his
idea
go
nowhere
and
michael
eisner
essentially
ice
him
out
of
any
significant
role
at
the
company
ovitz
become
angry
and
embarrass
even
if
he
d
be
give
the
authority
to
genuinely
function
in
his
role
though
i
think
he
still
would
have
fail
at
disney
because
he
be
just
not
wire
for
corporate
culture
i
would
give
him
a
stack
of
material
in
advance
of
a
meeting
and
the
next
day
he
d
come
in
not
have
read
any
of
them
and
say
give
me
the
fact
then
render
a
fast
opinion
there
be
no
sense
that
he
be
act
fast
because
he
d
process
all
the
information
the
opposite
be
the
case
he
be
cover
up
for
not
be
prepared
and
in
a
company
like
disney
if
you
don
t
do
the
work
the
people
around
you
detect
that
right
away
and
their
respect
for
you
disappears
you
have
to
be
attentive
you
often
have
to
sit
through
meeting
that
if
give
the
choice
you
might
choose
not
to
sit
through
you
have
to
learn
and
absorb
you
have
to
hear
out
other
people
s
problem
and
help
find
solution
it
s
all
part
of
be
a
great
manager
the
problem
be
michael
ovitz
wasn
t
a
manager
he
be
still
an
agent
he
knew
that
business
well
than
anyone
but
that
s
not
the
business
we
be
in


in
april
michael
eisner
visit
me
in
my
office
in
new
york
he
walk
in
and
close
the
door
and
say
i
know
it
s
not
work
with
michael
it
be
a
disaster
to
hire
him
he
knew
that
other
executive
like
joe
roth
the
head
of
disney
studio
be
talk
about
quit
because
they
be
so
frustrate
and
he
plead
with
me
not
to
do
that
i
wasn
t
planning
to
quit
i
didn
t
like
it
my
first
six
month
at
disney
be
the
most
dispirit
and
unproductive
of
my
career
but
i
be
still
new
to
the
company
and
because
i
be
base
in
new
york
i
wasn
t
expose
to
the
pain
quite
as
much
as
others
be
mostly
what
i
thought
be
this
be
a
difficult
problem
for
michael
to
deal
with
and
i
don
t
want
to
add
to
his
strain
i
don
t
know
exactly
when
i
m
go
to
do
it
michael
say
to
me
but
i
m
go
to
fire
him
he
ask
me
not
to
discus
it
with
anyone
and
i
give
him
my
word
i
be
never
sure
who
else
he
told
but
i
expect
michael
would
say
something
to
ovitz
within
week
of
that
discussion
instead
month
drag
on
and
the
tension
and
the
dysfunction
grow
even
bad
everyone
the
two
of
them
all
of
the
senior
leadership
the
entire
staff
who
work
for
ovitz
be
unhappy
it
be
time
to
stop
the
bleeding
finally
in
december
more
than
eight
month
after
he
told
me
he
be
go
to
do
it
michael
eisner
fire
michael
ovitz
and
end
this
painful
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
company
though
the
pain
linger
on
in
the
form
of
shareholder
lawsuit
over
the
million
plus
severance
package
ovitz
receive
i
now
have
a
cordial
relationship
with
michael
ovitz
he
s
be
generous
about
disney
s
success
during
my
time
as
ceo
and
when
i
look
back
on
it
i
think
of
him
not
as
a
bad
guy
but
as
a
participant
in
a
big
mistake
the
culture
shift
be
just
too
big
a
leap
for
him
he
and
michael
both
want
it
to
work
each
for
his
own
powerful
reason
michael
expect
that
ovitz
would
come
in
and
know
how
to
do
the
work
and
ovitz
have
no
idea
what
kind
of
adjustment
he
d
need
to
make
to
succeed
within
the
culture
of
a
giant
publicly
trade
company
they
should
both
have
know
that
it
couldn
t
work
but
they
willfully
avoid
ask
the
hard
question
because
each
be
somewhat
blind
by
his
own
need
it
s
a
hard
thing
to
do
especially
in
the
moment
but
those
instance
in
which
you
find
yourself
hop
that
something
will
work
without
be
able
to
convincingly
explain
to
yourself
how
it
will
work
that
s
when
a
little
bell
should
go
off
and
you
should
walk
yourself
through
some
clarify
question
what
s
the
problem
i
need
to
solve
do
this
solution
make
sense
if
i
m
feel
some
doubt
why
be
i
do
this
for
sound
reason
or
be
i
motivate
by
something
personal
chapter
second
in
line
for
the
next
three
year
michael
ran
the
company
without
a
number
two
our
relationship
grow
closer
in
the
wake
of
ovitz
s
leave
but
i
also
sense
from
time
to
time
a
wariness
on
michael
s
part
that
he
felt
i
have
an
eye
on
his
job
and
could
never
fully
trust
me
it
result
in
a
kind
of
ongoing
approach
and
avoidance
michael
would
bring
me
in
on
decision
at
time
and
confide
in
me
and
then
suddenly
he
would
go
cold
and
keep
me
at
arm
s
length
it
be
true
that
i
d
stayed
on
after
the
acquisition
in
part
because
i
thought
i
might
have
a
shot
at
run
the
company
one
day
but
that
didn
t
mean
i
be
angle
for
michael
s
job
it
meant
i
be
commit
to
do
my
own
job
as
best
i
could
and
to
learn
as
much
as
i
could
about
all
aspect
of
the
company
as
have
be
the
case
throughout
my
career
if
the
time
come
when
michael
be
ready
to
step
down
i
want
to
be
ready
when
the
opportunity
arose
i
ve
be
ask
a
lot
over
the
year
about
the
best
way
to
nurture
ambition
both
one
s
own
and
that
of
the
people
you
manage
as
a
leader
you
should
want
those
around
you
to
be
eager
to
rise
up
and
take
on
more
responsibility
as
long
as
dream
about
the
job
they
want
doesn
t
distract
them
from
the
job
they
have
you
can
t
let
ambition
get
too
far
ahead
of
opportunity
i
ve
see
a
lot
of
people
who
have
their
sight
set
on
a
particular
job
or
project
but
the
opportunity
to
actually
get
that
thing
be
so
slim
their
focus
on
the
small
thing
in
the
distance
become
a
problem
they
grow
impatient
with
where
they
be
they
didn
t
tend
enough
to
the
responsibility
they
do
have
because
they
be
longing
so
much
for
something
else
and
so
their
ambition
become
counterproductive
it
s
important
to
know
how
to
find
the
balance
do
the
job
you
have
well
be
patient
look
for
opportunity
to
pitch
in
and
expand
and
grow
and
make
yourself
one
of
the
people
through
attitude
and
energy
and
focus
that
your
boss
feel
they
have
to
turn
to
when
an
opportunity
arises
conversely
if
you
re
a
bos
these
be
the
people
to
nurture
not
the
one
who
be
clamor
for
promotion
and
complain
about
not
be
utilized
enough
but
the
one
who
be
prove
themselves
to
be
indispensable
day
in
and
day
out
as
with
so
many
thing
tom
and
dan
be
perfect
model
in
this
regard
they
be
invest
in
my
growth
they
conveyed
how
much
they
want
me
to
succeed
and
they
clear
a
path
for
me
to
learn
what
i
need
to
know
in
order
to
move
up
and
eventually
run
the
company
at
every
stage
i
work
hard
to
absorb
as
much
as
i
could
know
that
if
i
perform
they
have
large
plan
in
place
as
a
result
i
felt
profoundly
loyal
to
them
the
dynamic
between
a
ceo
and
the
next
person
in
line
for
his
or
her
job
be
often
fraught
though
we
all
want
to
believe
we
re
irreplaceable
the
trick
be
to
be
self
aware
enough
that
you
don
t
cling
to
the
notion
that
you
be
the
only
person
who
can
do
this
job
at
its
essence
good
leadership
isn
t
about
be
indispensable
it
s
about
help
others
be
prepared
to
possibly
step
into
your
shoe
give
them
access
to
your
own
decision
make
identify
the
skill
they
need
to
develop
and
help
them
improve
and
as
i
ve
have
to
do
sometimes
be
honest
with
them
about
why
they
re
not
ready
for
the
next
step
up
michael
s
relationship
with
me
played
itself
out
in
complicate
way
sometimes
i
felt
he
be
question
my
ability
other
time
he
be
generous
and
encourage
and
lean
on
me
to
take
work
off
his
plate
a
high
point
in
our
relationship
come
in
late
when
michael
come
to
my
office
in
new
york
and
told
me
he
want
me
to
create
and
run
a
new
international
organization
i
be
chairman
of
the
abc
group
at
the
time
which
meant
i
be
run
the
abc
network
and
espn
as
well
as
all
of
disney
tv
this
be
go
to
be
a
huge
lift
on
top
of
those
responsibility
but
i
be
eager
to
do
it
and
grateful
that
michael
have
turn
to
me
disney
be
surprisingly
parochial
back
then
we
have
office
all
over
the
world
from
latin
america
to
india
to
japan
but
we
didn
t
have
a
coherent
global
strategy
or
even
structure
in
place
that
make
sense
in
japan
for
instance
we
have
a
studio
office
in
one
part
of
tokyo
a
consumer
product
business
in
another
a
tv
business
somewhere
else
none
of
them
spoke
with
another
there
be
no
coordination
around
back
office
function
like
accounting
say
or
it
that
kind
of
redundancy
exist
everywhere
more
important
than
that
though
we
didn
t
have
people
in
any
of
our
territory
whose
job
be
to
manage
our
brand
in
that
place
and
look
for
unique
opportunity
it
be
all
a
very
passive
burbank
centric
approach
michael
saw
the
problem
and
knew
that
it
need
to
change
he
knew
we
need
to
grow
internationally
year
earlier
he
d
set
his
sight
on
building
a
theme
park
in
china
frank
well
michael
s
number
two
for
the
first
decade
that
he
ran
disney
have
make
some
overture
to
chinese
official
in
the
early
s
but
he
d
never
make
much
progress
from
those
initial
meeting
though
china
be
aware
that
we
be
interested
in
a
park
there
and
they
d
recently
signal
that
they
want
it
to
happen
i
be
one
of
the
few
disney
executive
with
international
experience
from
my
time
work
for
abc
sport
and
wide
world
of
sport
and
i
be
the
only
one
who
knew
anything
about
china
have
manage
to
get
some
abc
child
s
program
on
the
air
there
in
the
pre
disney
day
so
michael
make
me
president
of
walt
disney
international
and
tasked
me
not
just
with
form
an
international
strategy
but
with
find
a
place
to
build
a
theme
park
in
china
we
have
an
initial
discussion
about
where
and
for
a
combination
of
factor
weather
population
available
land
we
soon
conclude
that
shanghai
be
the
only
workable
location
in
october
as
willow
be
enter
her
ninth
month
of
pregnancy
with
our
first
child
i
travel
to
shanghai
for
the
first
time
for
disney
and
be
take
around
and
show
three
piece
of
property
you
can
have
any
one
of
these
the
chinese
official
say
but
you
need
to
decide
quickly
we
settle
on
a
property
in
pudong
outside
of
downtown
shanghai
although
on
our
first
visit
to
what
be
a
small
farm
village
on
the
outskirt
of
a
then
rise
city
it
wasn
t
exactly
easy
to
envision
a
disney
castle
in
the
middle
of
a
fully
developed
disneyland
canal
ran
throughout
the
village
with
little
child
and
stray
dog
walk
about
small
vegetable
patch
be
sprinkle
among
ramshackle
house
and
occasional
general
store
bicycle
far
outnumber
car
and
what
we
would
consider
modernity
be
nowhere
in
sight
it
be
however
perfectly
situate
between
shanghai
s
soon
to
be
open
international
airport
and
what
would
become
downtown
to
one
of
the
world
s
large
and
most
vibrant
city
thus
begin
what
would
become
an
eighteen
year
journey
which
would
bring
me
back
to
that
same
spot
more
than
forty
time


meanwhile
in
my
other
domain
abc
enter
the
early
stage
of
what
would
be
a
long
downward
slide
the
hit
show
we
d
developed
back
when
i
be
run
prime
time
have
gotten
long
in
the
tooth
and
we
d
become
complacent
and
unimaginative
in
our
development
process
nypd
blue
be
still
in
the
top
and
we
have
a
couple
of
others
home
improvement
the
drew
carey
show
that
do
well
but
the
rest
of
our
lineup
with
the
exception
of
the
perennial
juggernaut
that
be
monday
night
football
be
largely
uninspiring
we
be
briefly
save
in
when
we
launch
who
want
to
be
a
millionaire
which
we
d
initially
say
no
to
and
then
reconsider
when
the
creator
come
back
to
us
with
regis
philbin
as
host
it
turn
out
to
be
a
godsend
at
the
time
and
later
a
crutch
its
number
be
astound
when
it
first
air
not
just
for
a
game
show
but
for
any
show
that
first
season
it
pull
in
about
thirty
million
viewer
per
night
three
night
a
week
number
that
be
all
but
inconceivable
at
that
point
in
network
tv
it
be
number
one
in
the
rating
for
the
season
a
network
savior
but
it
couldn
t
totally
mask
our
deeper
problem
there
be
one
other
bright
spot
that
year
in
the
middle
of
i
d
begin
think
in
earnest
about
our
coverage
of
the
upcoming
millennium
i
felt
strongly
that
people
around
the
world
would
be
fascinate
with
this
moment
and
that
the
entire
company
lead
by
abc
news
should
turn
its
attention
and
resource
to
it
eighteen
month
in
advance
i
call
a
meeting
with
the
senior
executive
from
news
entertainment
and
sport
and
told
them
what
i
envision
that
we
would
provide
wall
to
wall
twenty
four
hour
coverage
as
midnight
move
across
the
globe
and
each
time
zone
rang
in
the
new
millennium
i
remember
say
enthusiastically
that
we
should
own
the
event
then
look
at
roone
sit
silent
and
expressionless
across
the
table
he
clearly
hat
the
idea
the
meeting
end
and
i
pull
him
aside
do
you
think
i
m
crazy
i
ask
how
be
we
go
to
make
a
calendar
change
visually
interest
for
twenty
four
hour
he
say
i
could
have
answer
in
any
number
of
way
it
be
actually
an
interest
challenge
but
something
in
roone
s
tone
and
body
language
told
me
his
problem
wasn
t
really
with
the
visuals
it
be
that
he
be
be
ask
to
execute
a
big
idea
that
wasn
t
his
by
the
guy
who
use
to
say
how
high
when
roone
say
jump
i
d
be
roone
s
bos
since
when
tom
and
dan
make
me
president
of
the
network
we
d
work
well
together
over
those
year
he
be
proud
that
i
d
risen
to
the
top
of
the
company
but
he
still
thought
of
me
as
his
understudy
that
i
d
cut
my
teeth
under
him
and
i
be
his
ally
in
the
front
office
who
would
protect
him
from
corporate
meddling
and
allow
him
to
do
his
thing
i
be
less
blindly
devote
to
roone
than
he
want
to
believe
but
there
be
no
harm
in
his
think
it
and
no
real
reason
for
me
to
ever
disabuse
him
of
the
notion
he
be
at
his
best
when
his
ego
be
least
threaten
but
i
also
need
him
to
execute
the
thing
i
be
ask
him
to
execute
it
s
a
tricky
thing
move
people
over
to
your
side
and
enlist
their
enthusiastic
engagement
sometimes
it
s
worth
talk
through
their
reservation
and
patiently
respond
to
their
concern
other
time
you
simply
need
to
communicate
that
you
re
the
bos
and
you
want
this
do
it
s
not
that
one
approach
be
nice
and
the
other
isn
t
it
s
just
that
one
be
more
direct
and
nonnegotiable
it
really
come
down
to
what
you
believe
be
right
for
the
moment
when
a
more
democratic
approach
be
useful
both
in
get
to
the
best
outcome
and
in
building
morale
and
when
you
have
enough
certainty
in
your
opinion
that
you
re
willing
to
be
an
autocrat
even
in
the
face
of
disagreement
in
this
case
i
absolutely
believe
i
be
right
and
i
wasn
t
go
to
let
anyone
even
the
vaunt
roone
arledge
dissuade
me
of
course
he
could
have
easily
sabotage
it
undermine
it
through
lack
of
effort
and
enthusiasm
and
communicate
that
to
his
people
like
many
people
i
ve
work
or
negotiate
with
over
the
year
roone
didn
t
respond
well
if
he
felt
he
be
be
big
foot
so
i
resort
to
a
kind
of
soft
autocracy
show
respect
but
also
communicate
that
this
be
go
to
happen
no
matter
what
roone
i
say
if
there
be
ever
an
idea
that
people
would
assume
come
from
you
this
be
it
it
s
big
and
bold
it
could
be
impossible
to
execute
but
when
have
that
ever
stop
you
i
wasn
t
exactly
sure
if
it
be
the
idea
he
didn
t
like
or
if
at
that
point
he
just
didn
t
feel
he
have
the
energy
for
a
big
production
like
this
but
i
knew
he
couldn
t
walk
away
from
a
challenge
so
i
be
play
to
his
pride
to
get
him
on
board
he
didn
t
say
anything
but
he
smile
and
nod
as
if
to
say
okay
i
get
it
in
the
end
we
create
something
that
will
go
down
as
a
great
achievement
it
take
month
of
prepwork
by
roone
s
team
to
get
it
do
and
he
come
in
at
the
end
as
he
have
countless
time
and
lift
the
whole
thing
to
another

anything
and
there
be
no
executive
harangue
him
about
the
money
he
be
spending
or
the
day
when
he
be
a
legend
in
the
room
and
no
one
would
dare
to
doubt
his
authority
or
maybe
it
be
more
existential
than
that
the
business
have
change
beneath
him
the
world
have
change
he
didn
t
have
much

after
the
bright
spot
of
our
millennium
coverage
millionaire
be
still
popular
in
but
not
nearly
as
big
as
it
have
be
the
season
before
we
could
see
the
diminish
return
but
we
didn
t
have
good
show
in
development
rather
than
make
major
change
in
order
to
revitalize
entertainment
we
lean
harder
on
this
one
show
to
carry
us
we
put
it
on
five
time
a
week
as
a
way
of
compete
against
nbc
which
be
prosper
with
its
must

thursday
night
and
cbs
which
have
found
its
leg
again
with

in
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
year
we
d
slip
from

the
most
watch
network
on

to
the
last
of
the
big
three
and
we
be
barely
hold
on
to
that
as
fox
continued
to
grow
i
take
some
of
the
blame
for
that
i
be
run
abc
and
i
support
put
millionaire
on
several
night
a
week
it
be
an
easy
fix
for
abc
s
trouble
but
when
it
start
to
sink
our
deeper
problem
be
laid
bare
by
late

strain
of

take
a
toll
on
michael

be
grow
more
isolated
and
insecure
more
distrustful
and
critical
of
the
people
around
him
he
knew
he
need
someone
to
help
shoulder
the
burden
and
he
be
feel
pressure
from
the
board
to
signal
that
after
sixteen
year
at
the
top
he

at
least

wasn
t
an
easy
thing
for
him
to
do
after
the

wary
of

second
in
command
he
recognize
that
he
couldn
t
keep
thing
go
as
they
be
but
he
didn
t
want
to
deal
with
the
complication
of
divide
responsibility
and
share
decision
make
and
have
to
involve
someone
else
in
his
various
going
on
michael

reluctance
to
name
a
number

have
consequence
throughout
the

need
help
but
because

blurring
of

on

work
incredibly
hard
to

and
respect
and
help

thought
through
on
the
disney

all
i
d
always
be
a
defender
of
and
a
loyalist
to
michael

now
i
be
be
told
again
twenty
five
year
after

bonus
at
the
end
of

to
walk
away
from
if
michael
be
go
to
fire
me
i
need
to
hear
it
from
him
directly
i
hung
up
the
phone
and
gather
my
composure
i
decide
not
to
tell
willow
while
we
be
away
she
be
a
prominent
anchor
on
cnn
at
that
point
cohosting
moneyline
an
hour
long
financial
news
program
her
career
be
soar
but
the
job
be
intense
and
on
top
of
the
professional
demand
on
her
she
somehow
have
be
able
to
find
the
time
and
energy
to
be
a
wonderful
mother
to
max
she
need
a
break
and
so
i
kept
all
that
i
be
feel
to
myself
until
we
be
back
home
in
new
york
then
i
wait
for
the
shoe
to
drop
in
september
i
be
at
the
headquarters
in
burbank
when
michael
ask
to
see
me
i
be
certain
it
be
the
end
and
i
walk
into
his
office
steel
myself
for
the
blow
that
be
come
i
sat
down
across
from
him
and
wait
do
you
think
you
re
ready
to
move
to
l
a
permanently
and
help
me
run
the
company
he
ask
it
take
me
a
moment
to
absorb
what
he
be
say
i
be
confuse
and
then
relieve
and
then
unsure
that
this
be
something
i
could
trust
michael
i
finally
say
do
you
have
any
idea
how
inconsistent
you
ve
be
with
me
he
be
ask
me
to
move
my
family
out
to
california
and
for
willow
to
give
up
a
huge
job
not
four
week
after
tell
a
table
full
of
people
that
i
would
never
be
his
successor
you
have
to
be
straight
with
me
about
what
this
be
i
say
his
reaction
be
more
candid
than
i
expect
he
say
he
wasn
t
sure
i
would
want
to
move
back
to
l
a
so
that
be
a
concern
the
big
issue
though
be
that
if
he
name
me
coo
he
d
be
compete
with
myself
he
say
i
assume
he
meant
that
the
board
would
have
someone
to
turn
to
if
they
want
to
replace
him
but
i
be
never
really
certain
michael
i
say
i
have
no
intention
of
gun
for
your
job
or
do
anything
to
undermine
you
i
told
him
i
would
love
to
have
the
chance
to
run
the
company
someday
but
i
didn
t
see
that
happen
in
the
near
future
i
ve
never
imagine
you
leave
i
say
and
i
can
t
imagine
the
board
want
you
to
leave
it
be
true
i
couldn
t
we
weren
t
in
the
smoothest
water
but
at
that
point
there
wasn
t
a
crisis
of
confidence
around
michael
he
be
still
one
of
the
most
respect
ceo
in
the
world
the
meeting
end
inconclusively
michael
didn
t
offer
me
a
title
he
didn
t
put
any
formal
plan
in
motion
i
go
back
to
new
york
and
wait
to
hear
more
but
it
didn
t
come
up
again
until
a
month
later
we
be
attend
the
london

of

his
recognition
that

tremendously
valuable
asset
that
they

yet
leveraged
one
be
the
popularity
of
the
park
if
they
raise
ticket
price
even
slightly
they
would
raise
revenue
significantly
without
any
noticeable
impact
on
the
number
of
visitor
building

be
another
untapped
opportunity
and

as

then
come

florida
and

outside

even
more
promising
be
the
trove
of
intellectual

all
of
those
great

just
sit
there

who
d
see
them
in
the

now
could
play
them
at

business
then
come
the
cap
city
abc
acquisition
in
which
give
disney
a
big
television
network
but
most
important
brought
in
espn
and
its
nearly
hundred
million
subscriber
at
the
time
all
of
this
illustrate
that
michael
be
a
remarkably
creative
thinker
and
businessman
and
he
turn
disney
into
a
modern
entertainment
giant
after
he
make
me
number
two
we
divide
our
responsibility
give
him
primary
oversight
of
the
walt
disney
studio
as
well
as
park
and
resort
while
i
concentrate
on
the
medium
network
consumer
product
and
walt
disney
international
other
than
animation
which
he
didn
t
really
let
me
in
on
michael
give
me
access
to
much
of
his
think
and
decision
make
it
s
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
he
taught
me
how
to
see
in
a
way
i
hadn
t
be
able
to
before
i
have
no
experience
with
the
creative
process
that
go
into
building
and
run
a
theme
park
and
have
never
spent
time
visually
imagine
a
visitor
s
experience
michael
walk
through
the
world
with
a
set
designer
s
eye
and
while
he
wasn
t
a
natural
mentor
it
felt
like
a
kind
of
apprenticeship
to
follow
him
around
and
watch
him
work
in
my
time
as
michael
s
number
two
we
open
disney
s
animal
kingdom
in
florida
and
hong
kong
disneyland
and
california
adventure
in
anaheim
i
walk
mile
upon
mile
with
him
in
advance
of
the
opening
of
those
park
and
in
exist
park
too
get
a
sense
of
what
he
saw
and
what
he
be
constantly
look
to
improve
he
would
walk
down
a
path
and
look
out
into
the
distance
and
immediately
identify
nuance
like
landscape
that
wasn
t
lush
enough
or
fence
that
encroach
on
important
view
or
building
that
seem
either
out
of
place
or
out
of
style
these
be
great
teach
moment
for
me
i
learn
so
much
about
how
to
manage
the
business
but
more
important
i
learn
what
the
creative
and
design
essence
of
our
park
should
be
michael
would
also
allow
me
to
accompany
him
on
his
many
visit
to
walt
disney
imagineering
locate
on
a
sprawl
campus
in
glendale
california
just
a
few
mile
from
our
studio
lot
in
burbank
imagineering
have
be
the
subject
of
many
book
and
article
and
the
simplest
way
i
can
describe
it
be
that
it
be
the
creative
and
technical
heart
of
everything
we
build
that
isn
t
a
film
or
tv
show
or
consumer
product
all
of
our
theme
park
and
resort
and
attraction
cruise
ship
and
real
estate
development
all
of
the
live
performance
and
light
show
and
parade
every
detail
from
the
design
of
a
cast
member
s
costume
to
the
architecture
of
our
castle
emanates
from
imagineering
it
be
impossible
to
overstate
the
creative
and
technical
brilliance
of
disney
s
imagineers
they
be
artist
engineer
architect
and
technologist
and
they
occupy
a
place
and
fulfill
a
role
that
be
unmatched
anywhere
else
in
the
world
to
this
day
i
find
myself
awed
time
and
time
again
by
their
ability
to
envision
something
fantastical
and
then
make
it
real
often
at
a
scale
that
be
enormous
when
i
visit
imagineering
with
michael
i
d
observe
him
critique
project
large
and
small
review
everything
from
storyboards
detail
the
experience
in
one
of
our
attraction
to
the
design
of
a
stateroom
on
a
soon
to
be
built
cruise
ship
he
d
hear
presentation
about
upcoming
parade
or
review
the
design
of
the
lobby
of
a
new
hotel
what
struck
me
and
what
be
invaluable
in
my
own
education
be
his
ability
to
see
the
big
picture
as
well
as
the
granular
detail
at
the
same
time
and
consider
how
one
affected
the
other
as
the
scrutiny
of
michael
intensified
in
the
upcoming
year
he
would
often
be
accuse
of
be
an
oppressive
perfectionist
and
micromanager
for
his
part
he
d
say
micromanaging
be
underrated
i
tend
to
agree
with
him
but
to
a
point
thanks
to
my
year
work
for
roone
arledge
i
didn
t
need
to
be
convince
that
the
success
or
failure
of
something
so
often
come
down
to
the
detail
michael
often
saw
thing
that
other
people
didn
t
see
and
then
he
demand
that
they
be
make
well
that
be
the
source
of
so
much
of
his
and
the
company
s
success
and
i
have
immense
respect
for
michael
s
tendency
to
sweat
the
detail
it
show
how
much
he
care
and
it
make
a
difference
he
understood
that
great
be
often
a
collection
of
very
small
thing
and
he
help
me
appreciate
that
even
more
deeply
michael
be
proud
of
his
micromanagement
but
in
express
his
pride
and
remind
people
of
the
detail
he
be
focus
on
he
could
be
perceive
as
be
petty
and
small
mind
i
once
watch
him
give
an
interview
in
the
lobby
of
a
hotel
and
say
to
the
reporter
you
see
those
lamp
over
there
i
chose
them
it
s
a
bad
look
for
a
ceo
i
should
confess
that
i
ve
caught
myself
or
have
be
caught
do
the
same
thing
a
few
time
zenia
mucha
have
say
to
me
in
a
way
only
she
can
bob
you
know
you
do
that
but
the
world
doesn
t
need
to
know
so
shut
up
in
early
every
medium
and
entertainment
company
be
feel
the
ground
shift
beneath
its
foot
but
no
one
be
sure
which
way
to
run
technology
be
change
so
fast
and
the
disruptive
effect
be
become
more
obvious
and
anxiety
provoke
in
march
of
that
year
apple
release
its
rip
mix
burn
campaign
tell
the
world
that
once
you
purchase
music
it
be
yours
to
duplicate
and
use
as
you
wish
a
lot
of
people
include
michael
saw
that
as
a
mortal
threat
to
the
music
industry
which
would
soon
threaten
the
television
and
movie
industry
michael
be
always
a
staunch
defender
of
copyright
often
speak
out
on
the
issue
of
piracy
and
the
apple
ad
really
bother
him
so
much
so
that
he
target
apple
publicly
testify
before
the
senate
commerce
committee
that
apple
be
flagrantly
disrespect
copyright
law
and
encourage
piracy
this
didn
t
sit
well
with
steve
job
it
be
an
interest
time
and
marked
what
i
saw
as
the
begin
of
the
end
of
the
traditional
medium
as
we
knew
it
of
great
interest
to
me
be
the
fact
that
almost
every
traditional
medium
company
while
try
to
figure
out
its
place
in
this
change
world
be
operating
out
of
fear
rather
than
courage
stubbornly
try
to
build
a
bulwark
to
protect
old
model
that
couldn
t
possibly
survive
the
sea
change
that
be
under
way
there
be
no
one
who
embody
that
change
more
than
steve
job
who
in
addition
to
run
apple
be
the
ceo
of
pixar
our
most
important
and
most

up
between

be
more
focus
on
the
specific
of
the
deal
that
have
be
negotiate
and
seemingly
unaware
or
uncaring
of
steve
s
feeling
the
situation
worsen
as
toy
story
be
be
developed
it
be
originally
suppose
to
be
release
straight
to
video
bypassing
movie
theater
but
when
early
iteration
of
the
film
demand
more
production
resource
the
two
company
conclude
it
should
be
release
on
the
big
screen
first
the
movie
gross
nearly
million
worldwide
and
then
a
contractual
argument
ensue
pixar
argue
it
should
count
toward
their
five
film
disney
commitment
and
michael
refuse
since
it
be
a
sequel
this
become
another
bone
of
contention
between
michael
and
steve
as
pixar
s
reputation
and
influence
grow
with
each
release
so
do
the
tension
with
disney
in
steve
s
mind
he
and
pixar
deserve
more
respect
from
disney
and
he
want
the
contract
to
reflect
the
shift
leverage
he
also
thought
because
they
be
eclipse
disney
both
creatively
and
commercially
that
disney
should
have
turn
to
them
for
creative
assistance
instead
he
felt
michael
always
treat
them
as
a
lesser
partner
in
the
relationship
a
studio
for
hire
which
he
take
as
a
huge
slight
michael
felt
equally
disrespect
he
and
others
at
disney
believe
they
be
much
more
than
just
silent
partner
in
the
creation
of
the
film
and
that
steve
never
give
disney
the
credit
it
deserve
i
wasn
t
involve
at
all
in
the
pixar
relationship
during
my
time
as
coo
but
it
be
clear
that
pixar
be
gain
swagger
as
disney
be
lose
it
and
these
two
strong
will
personality
be
destine
to
battle
each
other
for
supremacy
that
be
the
lay
of
the
land
throughout
much
of
our
industry
change
at
blinding
speed
tension
between
michael
and
steve
threaten
the
future
of
a
vital
partnership
a
string
of
box
office
failure
lead
to
a
public
loss
of
faith
in
disney
animation
sinking
rating
at
abc
and
a
board
of
director
that
be
just
begin
to
take
note
and
question
michael
s
leadership
then
come
september
which
would
change
the
world
and
challenge
us
in
way
we
never
imagine
i
be
up
that
morning
at
the
crack
of
dawn
work
out
at
home
when
i
look
up
at
the
tv
and
saw
a
report
that
a
plane
have
just
flown
into
one
of
the
twin
tower
i
stop
my
workout
and
go
into
another
room
and
turn
on
the
television
in
time
to
see
the
second
plane
hit
immediately
i
call
the
president
of
abc
news
david
westin
to
determine
what
he
knew
and
how
we
be
planning
to
cover
these
event
that
be
unfold
before
our
eye
david
have
little
information
but
like
all
major
news
organization
we
be
scramble
hundred
of
people
in
many
direction
to
the
pentagon
the
white
house
low
manhattan
to
try
to
understand
what
be
happen
i
rush
to
my
office
and
call
michael
on
my
way
he
hadn
t
see
the
news
yet
but
as
he
turn
on
his
television
we
share
our
concern
that
disney
might
also
be
a
target
we
make
the
decision
to
close
down
walt
disney
world
in
orlando
immediately
and
empty
the
park
and
not
to
open
disneyland
at
all
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
coordinate
our
response
on
various
front
spending
hour
on
the
phone
with
abc
news
make
sure
all
of
our
people
be
safe
strategizing
security
in
our
park
for
the
day
to
come
and
generally
try
to
help
people
keep
calm
during
what
be
the
most
unsettle
time
of
our
life
among
the
many
ripple
effect
of
the
attack
be
a
global
slowdown
in
tourism
that
last
long
after
september
the
impact
on
disney
s
business
be
devastate
the
stock
market
as
a
whole
fell
sharply
and
disney
lose
nearly
a
quarter
of
its
value
within
day
of
the
attack
then
our
large
shareholder
the
bass
family
be
force
to
sell
a
massive
amount
of
disney
stock
million
share
worth
about
billion
to
cover
a
margin
call
which
precipitate
another
steep
drop
in
our
share
price
company
around
the
globe
would
struggle
to
recover
for
some
time
but
our
issue
be
pile
up
and
this
marked
the
begin
of
a
long
slide
into
controversy
and
strife
for
disney
and
for
michael


in
many
way
he
handle
the
trouble
to
come
admirably
and
stoically
but
it
be
impossible
not
to
fall
prey
to
pessimism
and
paranoia
as
the
stress
become
more
intense
i
would
occasionally
answer
my
phone
and
michael
would
be
on
the
line
say
that
he
d
just
be
in
the
shower
or
on
a
plane
or
in
a
conversation
over
lunch
and
have
become
convince
that
something
we
be
do
be
go
to
fail
someone
be
go
to
overtake
us
some
deal
be
go
to
go
south
he
would
literally
say
to
me
the
sky
be
fall
and
over
time
a
sense
of
doom
and
gloom
begin
to
permeate
the
company
michael
have
plenty
of
valid
reason
to
be
pessimistic
but
as
a
leader
you
can
t
communicate
that
pessimism
to
the
people
around
you
it
s
ruinous
to
morale
it
sap
energy
and
inspiration
decision
get
make
from
a
protective
defensive
posture
michael
s
natural
pessimism
often
work
for
him
up
to
a
point
he
be
motivate
in
part
out
of
a
fear
of
calamity
and
that
often
fuel
his
perfectionism
and
his
success
although
it
s
not
a
very
useful
tool
to
motivate
people
sometimes
his
concern
be
justified
and
it
be
right
to
address
them
but
often
a
kind
of
free
float
worry
have
him
in
its
grip
this
wasn
t
michael
s
only
state
he
also
have
a
natural
exuberance
that
be
often
infectious
but
in
his
later
year
as
the
stress
on
him
steadily
increase
pessimism
become
the
rule
more
than
the
exception
and
it
lead
him
to
close
rank
and
become
increasingly
cloister
no
one
could
have
handle
the
stress
that
michael
be
under
perfectly
but
optimism
in
a
leader
especially
in
challenge
time
be
so
vital
pessimism
lead
to
paranoia
which
lead
to
defensiveness
which
lead
to
risk
aversion
optimism
set
a
different
machine
in
motion
especially
in
difficult
moment
the
people
you
lead
need
to
feel
confident
in
your
ability
to
focus
on
what
matter
and
not
to
operate
from
a
place
of
defensiveness
and
self
preservation
this
isn
t
about
say
thing
be
good
when
they
re
not
and
it
s
not
about
convey
some
innate
faith
that
thing
will
work
out
it
s
about
believe
you
and
the
people
around
you
can
steer
toward
the
best
outcome
and
not
communicate
the
feel
that
all
be
lose
if
thing
don
t
break
your
way
the
tone
you
set
as
a
leader
have
an
enormous
effect
on
the
people
around
you
no
one
want
to
follow
a
pessimist


in
the
year
after
september
two
key
board
member
roy
e
disney
and
stanley
gold
who
be
roy
s
lawyer
begin
to
openly
express
their
lack
of
faith
in
michael
s
ability
to
run
the
company
roy
have
a
long
complicate
history
with
michael
he
be
largely
responsible
for
bring
michael
on
as
ceo
and
chairman
of
the
board
and
along
with
all
shareholder
he
benefit
greatly
under
michael
s
leadership
between
and
disney
s
annual
profit
quadruple
and
its
stock
price
increase
percent
michael
go
out
of
his
way
during
those
year
to
be
solicitous
with
roy
and
show
him
deference
and
respect
this
wasn
t
easy
to
do
roy
could
be
very
difficult
at
time
he
view
himself
as
the
keeper
of
the
disney
legacy
he
live
and
breathe
and
bleed
disney
operating
as
if
any
break
from
tradition
be
a
violation
of
some
sacred
pact
he
d
make
with
walt
himself
who
supposedly
never
show
his
nephew
much
respect
roy
tend
to
revere
the
past
instead
of
respect
it
and
as
a
result
he
have
a
difficult
time
tolerate
change
of
any
sort
he
hat
michael
s
acquisition
of
capital
city
abc
because
it
meant
introduce
non
disney
brand
into
the
company
s
bloodstream
on
a
lesser
but
maybe
more
illustrative
note
he
get
very
angry
one
christmas
season
when
we
decide
to
sell

he
call
them
take
from
the
shelf
which
we
didn
t
do
but
it
be
a
huge
distraction
he
also
have
a
drinking
problem
we
never
discuss
it
at
disney
while
he
be
alive
but
year
later
one
of
his
kid
spoke
openly
with
me
about
the
problem
his
parent
have
with
alcohol
roy
and
his
wife
patti
could
get
angry
after
a
few

in
vicious
late
night

on
mistake
he
believe
we

as
steward
of
the
disney
legacy
as
the
challenge
we
be
face
grow
roy
become
more
openly
critical
of
michael
eventually
fully
turn
on
him
in
roy
and
stanley
sent
a
letter
to
the
board
demand
that
michael
address
their
concern
which
be
numerous
the
anemic
rating
at
abc
the
animus
with
steve
job
and
pixar
disagreement
over
theme
park
strategy
and
trouble
with
what
they
believe
be
michael
s
problematic
micromanaging
their
letter
be
so
specific
in
its
grievance
that
we
have
no
choice
but
to
take
it
seriously
it
result
in
a
full
management
presentation
to
the
board

each
issue
and
how
they
would

the
well
part
of
a
year
actively
try
to
convince
the
board
to
oust
him
and
in
the
fall
of
michael
finally
hit
his
limit
with
them
michael
s
strategy
be
to
turn
to
the
company

governance
guideline
regard
board
member

which
stipulate
that

challenge
michael
in
such
extreme
way
that
he
decide
to
invoke
the
clause
rather
than
tell
roy
himself
though
michael
have
the
chairman

nominate
committee
inform
him
that
he
would
not

i
be
on
our
way
to
a
museum
and
have
plan
for
a
dinner
date
that
even
when
michael
s
assistant
summon
me
to
an
emergency
meeting
at
michael

when

a
letter
from
roy
and
stanley
that
have
be
slip
under
his
door
he

to
me
and
i
begin
to
read
roy
state
in
the
letter
that
he
and
stanley
be
resign
from
the
board
he
then
go
on
a
blistering
three
page
critique
of
michael
s
stewardship
of
the
company
the
first
ten
year
have
be
a
success
he
acknowledge
but
the
latter
year
have
be
define
by
seven
distinct
failure
which
roy
laid
out
point
by
point
a
failure
to
bring
abc
prime
time
back
from
its
rating
abyss
the
consistent
micro
management
of
everyone
around
you
with
the
result
loss
of
morale
throughout
this
company
a
lack
of
adequate
investment
in
theme
park
building
on
the
cheap
that
have
depressed
park
attendance
the
perception
by
all
of
our
stakeholder
that
the
company
be
rapacious
soulless
and
always
look
for
the
quick
buck
rather
than
long
term
value
which
be
lead
to
a
loss
of
public
trust
a
creative
brain
drain
from
the
company
due
to
mismanagement
and
low
morale
a
failure
to
build
good
relationship
with
disney
s
partner
particularly
pixar
and
your
consistent
refusal
to
establish
a
clear
succession
plan
roy
conclude
by
write
michael
it
be
my
sincere
belief
that
it
be
you
that
should
be
leave
and
not
me
accordingly
i
once
again
call
for
your
resignation
and
retirement
there
be
validity
to
some
of
roy
s
complaint
but
many
of
them
be
out
of
context
it
didn
t
matter
we
all
knew
we
be
on
a
very
rough
road
now
and
we
begin
to
strategize
for
the
inevitable
public
relation
nightmare
the
letter
be
only
the
begin
roy
and
stanley
soon
launch
what
they
call
the
save
disney
campaign
for
the
next
three
month
lead
up
to
the
annual
shareholder
meeting
in
philadelphia
in
march
they
publicly
criticize
michael
at
every
opportunity
they
work
to
get
other
member
of
the
board
to
turn
against
him
they
set
up
a
save
disney
website
and
they
aggressively
lobby
disney
shareholder
to
cast
a
withhold
vote
at
the
upcoming
meeting
and
dump
him
from
the
board
if
you
own
stock
in
the
company
you
receive
a
proxy
and
every
year
you
can
cast
a
vote
in
favor
of
individual
board
member
or
you
can
withhold
your
vote
of
support
which
be
the
equivalent
of
a
no
vote
while
this
be
go
on
the
long
simmer
animosity
between
michael
and
steve

finally
boil
over
disney
be
try
to
extend
its
five
picture
partnership
deal
with
pixar
but
steve
put
a
new
deal
on
the
table
that
be
impossible
to
accept
pixar
would
control
production
and
retain
all
sequel
right
and
disney
would
be
reduce
to
a
distribution
partner
michael
refuse
steve
wouldn
t
budge
on
any
counterproposal
in
the
middle
of
the
prolong
negotiation
an
internal
memo
that
michael
write
to
the
board
before
the
release
of
find
nemo
get
leak
to
the
press
in
the
memo
michael
say
that
he
wasn
t
impressed
by
the
early
cut
he
d
see
and
that
pixar
would
get
a
reality
check
on
what
he
believe
be
their
unearned
arrogance
if
nemo
didn
t
do
well
he
suggest
that
wouldn
t
necessarily
be
bad
since
disney
would
have
more
leverage
in
the
negotiation
there
be
nothing
steve
be
more
averse
to
than
someone
try
to
use
leverage
over
him
if
you
try
to
do
that
he
go
nut
michael
too
be
averse
to
anything
he
perceive
as
bullying
of
him
or
the
company
and
the
combination
of
the
two
of
them
make
an
already
challenge
negotiate
process
nearly
impossible
at
some
point
steve
refer
to
disney
animation
s
string
of
embarrass
dud
and
then
in
january
he
make
a
very
public
in
your
face
announcement
that
he
would
never
deal
with
disney
again
after
ten
month
of
try
to
strike
a
deal
we
re
move
on
he
say
it
s
a
shame
disney
won
t
be
participate
in
pixar
s
future
success
michael
respond
by
say
it
didn
t
matter
we
could
make
all
of
the
sequel
we
want
of
the
pixar
film
we
d
release
and
there
be
nothing
they
could
do
about
it
then
roy
and
stanley
get
involve
and
issue
a
statement
of
their
own
say
more
than
a
year
ago
we
warn
the
disney
board
that
we
believe
michael
eisner
be
mismanage
the
pixar
partnership
and
express
our
concern
that
the
relationship
be
in
jeopardy
add
fuel
to
their
argument
that
michael
have
lose
control
of
the
company
in
fact
michael
have
be
right
to
reject
steve
s
term
it
would
have
be
fiscally
irresponsible
to
accept
the
deal
steve
propose
the
cost
to
disney
be
too
high
and
the
benefit
be
too
low
but
the
public
perception
which
be
amplify
by
all
of
the
coverage
of
the
bust
negotiation
and
the
rift
with
steve
job
be
that
michael
have
screw
up
badly
and
it
be
a
blow
to
him
two
week
later
we
convene
an
investor
conference
in
orlando
the
plan
be
to
reassure
industry
analyst
about
the
future
of
the

and
counter
all
of
the
recent
damage
our
first
quarter
earnings
report
be
to
be
release
that
day
and
the
number
be
good

and
pirate
of
the
caribbean
which
have
come
out
in
may
and
june
the
previous
year
be
both
massive
hit
and
overall
our
revenue
be
up
percent
it
be
the
first
blue
sky
we
d
see
in
a
while
and
we
be
look
forward
to
make
the
case
that
we
be
back
on
track
thing
didn
t
pan
out
that
way
on
a
cloudy
cool
florida
morning
i
left
my
hotel
room
at
around
a
m
and
be
on
my
way
to
the
conference
when
i
receive
a
call
from
zenia
mucha
our
chief
communication
officer
zenia
often
make
her
point
emphatically
in
this
case
emphatic
be
an
understatement
comcast
have
go
hostile
she
holler
into
the
phone
get
to
michael
s
suite
now
comcast
be
the
large
cable
provider
in
the
country
but
brian
robert
their
ceo
knew
that
own
disney
would
transform
them
it
would
allow
them
to
marry
disney
s
content
with
their
vast
cable
distribution
network
which
would
be
a
potent
combination
they
be
especially
interested
in
espn
which
at
the
time
be
the
high
price
channel
in

offer
to
buy
disney
michael
told
him
he
wasn
t

to
engage
in
negotiation
but
if
he
want
to
make
an
official
offer
the
board
would
be
obligate
to
consider
it
but
we
re
not
for
sale
michael
say
the
rejection
result
in
a
hostile
unsolicited
public
offer
to
the
disney
board
and
its
shareholder
to
acquire
disney
for
billion
to
be

in
comcast
stock
for
every
share
of
disney
stock
they
own
shareholder
would
get
a
share
of
comcast
stock
when
i
walk
into
michael
s
suite
the
first
thing
i
heard
be
the
voice
of
brian

and
steve

while

natural
warmth
steve
be
smart
and
funny
and
a
fast
learner
i
taught
him
a
lot
about
the
tv
and
radio
business
and
he
taught
me
a
lot
about
navigate
the
in
and
out
of
disney
in
i
badly
need
someone
to
take
over
abc
and
free
me
up
to
do
the
other
aspect
of
my
job
and
i
told
steve
i
be
planning
to
promote
him
to
president
of
the
network
he
say
that
he
didn
t
want
to
move
to
l
a
michael
be
planning
to
move
all
of
abc
to
l
a
at
the
time
and
shortly
after
that
he
told
us
he
be
leave
disney
for
comcast
i
d
invest
so
much
in
him
and
we
d
grown
close
over
those
two
year
that
it
felt
like
a
knife
in
my
back
now
here
he
be
on
television
twist
it
far
when
ask
what
he
would
do
to
fix
the
network
steve
reply
bring
in
well
people
to
run
it
zenia
and
alan
braverman
our
general
counsel
and
peter
murphy
the
head
of
strategic
planning
be
already
there
in
michael
s
suite
when
i
arrive
star
at
the
tv
we
be
all
caught
completely
off
guard
by
the
takeover
bid
and
immediately
scramble
to
formulate
a
response
we
need
to
put
out
a
public
statement
but
first
we
have
to
find
out
where
the
board
stood
at
the
same
time
we
be
try
to
figure
out
what
make
brian
so
certain
disney
would
sell
in
the
first
place
soon
it
become
apparent
that
someone
either
inside
the
board
or
close
to
it
must
have
told
him
that
michael
be
vulnerable
and
disney
in
such
bad
shape
that
if
he
make
an
offer
the
board
would
go
for
it
it
would
give
the
board
a
less
confrontational
way
to
get
rid
of
michael
year
later
brian
confirm
to
me
that
an
intermediary
claim
to
represent
a
board
member
encourage
him
to
bid
as
we
struggle
to
collect
ourselves
together
another
wave
hit
that
we
didn
t
see
come
a
company
call
institutional
shareholder
service
i
be
the
big
company
in
the
world
provide
proxy
and
governance
advice
to
investor
largely
mid
size
fund
on
how
they
should
ass
corporate
governance
and
cast
their
proxy
vote
i
typically
influence
more
than
a
third
of
the
voting
share
in
a
proxy
election
and
that
morning
they
issue
a
public
recommendation
in
support
of
roy
and
stanley
s
campaign
to
vote
against
michael
the
proxy
vote
wouldn
t
be
announce
until
march
but
we
already
knew
to
expect
a
large
vote
of
no
confidence
as
we
left
michael
s
suite
to
go
to
the
investor
meeting
we
be
now
face
two
massive
crisis
i
remember
think
that
it
be
like
we
d
enter
a
conventional
war
with
roy
and
stanley
and
steve
and
now
another
party
have
launch
nuclear
weapon
we
do
our
best
under
the
circumstance
to
defend
ourselves
to
the
investor
but
serious
concern
about
the
future
of
the
company
have
be
raise
in
very
public
way
we
held
our
head
high
tout
our
recent
return
and
walk
them
through
our
future
plan
make
the
best
case
we
could
under
the
circumstance
it
be
a
tough
meeting
though
and
there
be
no
way
around
it
thing
be
only
go
to
get
tougher


over
the
next
several
week
comcast
s
takeover
bid
collapse
brian
robert
have
assume
that
disney
s
board
would
jump
at
his
initial
offer
and
when
they
didn
t
it
allow
for
a
number
of
other
factor
to
emerge
first
the
announcement
of
our
increase
earnings
result
in
a
spike
in
our
stock
price
so
we
immediately
become
more
expensive
second
comcast
s
shareholder
react
negatively
to
the
announcement
they
weren
t
in
support
of
brian
s
move
and
comcast
s
stock
price
sank
fast
diminish
the
offer
even
far
and
throw
the
whole
calculus
off
last
influence
all
of
this
be
a
general
public
opposition
to
the
deal
be
express
to
the
medium
that
disney
still
have
emotional
resonance
as
an
american
brand
and
the
idea
of
its
be
swallow
by
a
giant
cable
provider
be
anathema
to
consumer
comcast
eventually
withdrew
its
bid
michael
s
trouble
weren
t
go
away
however
the
follow
month
three
thousand
disney
shareholder
gather
in
philadelphia
for
our
annual
meeting
the
night
before
the
meeting
roy
and
stanley
and
the
save
disney
contingent
held
a
big
public
rally
at
a
downtown
hotel
there
be
a
lot
of
medium
coverage
of
the
event
in
which
roy
and
stanley
vehemently
criticize
michael
and
call
for
a
change
in
leadership
at
some
point
zenia
come
to
me
and
say
you
have
to
go
out
and
talk
to
the
press
we
need
to
get
our
side
of
the
story
out
there
be
no
way
michael
be
go
to
do
it
it
would
have
be
too
charge
and
confrontational
so
i
have
to
be
the
one
zenia
quickly
notify
some
member
of
the
press
that
i
would
be
come
out
to
speak
with
them
and
the
two
of
us
walk
into
the
lobby
of
the
convention
center
where
our
meeting
be
to
take
place
the
next
day
seventy
five
giant
differently
design
mickey
mouse
statue
have
be
transport
from
orlando
for
the
meeting
and
i
stood
between
two
of
them
and
take
question
for
about
an
hour
i
didn
t
have
any
note
prepared
and
i
don
t
recall
the
specific
question
though
i
m
sure
they
be
all
about
the
shareholder
meeting
and
how
we
be
planning
to
respond
to
the
criticism
come
from
roy
and
stanley
i
do
recall
that
it
be
wither
i
defend
the
company
and
support
michael
and
i
express
my
genuine
skepticism
about
roy
and
stanley
s
motivation
and
action
it
be
the
first
time
in
my
career
i
ve
ever
have
to
withstand
the
glare
of
so
much
press
scrutiny
and
while
there
be
no
way
to
reverse
the
tide
that
be
come
in
i
look
back
on
that
moment
and
feel
proud
for
have
be
able
to
stand
there
and
hold
my

the
next
day
shareholder
start
line
up
outside
the
convention
center
at
a
m
when
the
door
open
hour
later
thousand
of
people
stream
in
many
of
whom
be
sent
into
a
large
overflow
room
to
watch
on
close
circuit
tv
michael
and
i
make
opening
remark
then
each
of
our
business
unit
leader
give
presentation
about
the
state
of
their
business
and
future
plan
we
have
agree
to
allow
roy
and
stanley
to
each
make
fifteen
minute
statement
but
not
from
the
stage
when
they
go
beyond
the
time
limit
we
let
them
finish
out
of
courtesy
their
statement
be
blistering
and
greet
with
cheer
by
many
people
in
the
room
after
they
be
do
we
take
question
for
an
hour
michael
knew
it
would
be
an
all
out
assault
from
the
begin
but
he
carry
himself
through
it
admirably
he
acknowledge
many
of
the
difficulty
and
make
his
case
that
our
performance
and
our
stock
price
be
improve
he
talk
about
his
passion
for
the
company
but
it
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
day
be
not
go
to
end
well
for
him
when
the
proxy
vote
be
finally
tally
percent
of
shareholder
withheld
their
support
of
michael
it
be
such
a
devastate
expression
of
no
confidence
that
we
announce
the
count
in
raw
number
rather
than
as
a
percentage
hop
it
might
sound
less
bad
still
there
be
an
audible
gasp
in
the
room
when
the
announcement
be
make
the
board
met
in
an
executive
session
immediately
after
the
shareholder
meeting
they
knew
they
have
to
do
something
in
response
and
decide
to
strip
michael
of
his
role
as
chairman
but
let
him
remain
as
ceo
george
mitchell
the
former
senate
majority
leader
from
maine
be
a
member
of
the
board
and
they
unanimously
vote
for
him
to
replace
michael
as
chairman
michael
make
some
effort
to
convince
them
otherwise
but
he
be
mostly
resign
to
the
inevitability
of
it
there
be
one
final
indignity
to
the
day
the
news
be
so
big
that
our
own
news
program
nightline
want
to
devote
that
night
s
show
to
the
save
disney
movement
and
the
voting
result
we
collectively
decide
that
it
be
in
michael
s
and
the
company
s
best
interest
to
face
the
music
and
go
on
the
show
to
take
question
from
ted
koppel
nightline
s
anchor
about
what
it
meant
for
michael
and
for
the
future
of
disney
it
be
incredibly
painful
for
him
to
be
subject
to
scrutiny
from
his
own
news
people
but
he
do
it
with
a
brave
face
the
march
shareholder
meeting
and
the
loss
of
his
chairman
s
title
marked
the
begin
of
the
end
for
michael
and
the
reality
be
begin
to
sink
in
in
early
september
he
sent
a
letter
to
the
board
announce
that
he
would
step
down
when
his
contract
expire
in
two
week
later
the
board
met
and
accepted
michael
s
offer
george
mitchell
come
to
me
afterward
to
say
they
be
go
to
issue
a
press
release
announce
that
michael
would
not
renew
his
contract
when
it
expire
and
a
search
process
would
commence
immediately
with
the
intention
of
find
a
successor
by
june
once
they
found
someone
george
told
me
they
would
hasten
the
transition
in
other
word
they
intend
to
replace
michael
in
the
fall
of
a
year
before
his
contract
expire
i
ask
him
what
they
be
planning
to
say
about
the
search
that
we
re
go
to
look
for
outside
candidate
and
inside
candidate
george
say
what
inside
candidate
be
there
other
than
me
none
he
say
you
re
the
only
one
then
you
need
to
write
that
i
say
i
m
the
coo
and
as
of
today
you
re
make
michael
a
lame
duck
i
m
go
to
have
to
step
in
and
exert
a
lot
more
authority
i
understood
there
be
no
guarantee
that
i
would
be
michael
s
successor
but
people
in
the
company
need
to
know
it
be
at
least
a
possibility
i
felt
so
much
depend
on
that
moment
if
the
rest
of
the
company
didn
t
believe
i
be
a
serious
candidate
then
i
d
have
no
real
authority
and
i
would
be
a
lame
duck
right
along
with
michael
often
people
who
worry
too
much
about
public
perception
of
their
power
do
so
because
they
be
insecure
in
this
case
i
need
the
board
to
bestow
some
degree
of
power
in
me
if
i
be
go
to
be
able
to
help
run
the
company
through
this
turbulent
time
and
if
i
be
go
to
have
any
chance
of
be
the
next
ceo
what
be
you
ask
george
say
i
m
ask
you
to
write
in
the
press
release
that
i
m
the
only
internal
candidate
george
understood
exactly
what
i
need
and
why
and
i
ll
always
be
grateful
for
that
it
meant
i
be
able
to
run
the
company
from
a
position
of
not
exactly
strength
but
not
exactly
weakness
either
even
though
they
d
formally
state
that
i
be
a
candidate
i
don
t
think
anyone
on
the
board
maybe
not
even
george
thought
i
would
get
the
job
and
many
of
them
thought
i
shouldn
t
there
would
be
a
lot
of
talk
during
the
upcoming
month
about
how
disney
s
problem
could
only
be
solve
by
a
change
agent
from
the
outside
it
s
a
meaningless
phrase
and
a
corporate
cliche
but
the
sentiment
be
clear
exacerbate
matter
be
the
feel
on
the
board
that
their
reputation
have
be
sully
and
while
it
be
far
less
painful
to
them
than
what
michael
have
suffer
they
be
exhaust
from
the
drama
and
they
need
to
send
a
signal
now
that
thing
be
go
to
be
different
hand
the
key
to
the
guy
who
d
be
michael
s
number
two
through
five
of
the
most
difficult
year
in
the
company
s
history
didn
t
exactly
signal
a
new
day
chapter
it
s
about
the
future
the
challenge
for
me
be
how
do
i
convince
the
disney
board
that
i
be
the
change
they
be
look
for
without
criticize
michael
in
the
process
there
have
be
some
decision
i
disagreed
with
and
i
thought
the
company
be
in
need
of
change
give
all
the
noise
but
i
respect
michael
and
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
he
d
give
me
i
d
also
be
coo
of
the
company
for
five
year
and
it
would
have
be
hypocritical
transparently
so
to
lay
all
of
the
blame
on
someone
else
mostly
though
it
just
wouldn
t
have
be
right
to
make
myself
look
well
at
michael
s
expense
i
vowed
to
myself
not
to
do
that
i
spent
a
few
day
after
the
announcement
try
to
figure
out
a
way
to
thread
that
particular
needle
how
to
talk
about
the
past
without
implicate
myself
too
much
in
decision
that
weren
t
mine
or
swing
too
far
the
other
way
and
join
in
a
pile
on
of
michael
the
solution
to
that
predicament
come
from
an
unexpected
place
a
week
or
so
after
the
board
s
announcement
i
receive
a
phone
call
from
a
highly
regard
political
consultant
and
brand
manager
name
scott
miller
year
ago
scott
have
do
some
very
useful
consult
for
abc
so
when
he
call
to
say
he
be
in
l
a
and
ask
if
he
could
come
see
me
i
be
eager
to
meet
with
him
he
arrive
in
my
office
a
few
day
later
and
drop
a
ten
page
deck
in
front
of
me
this
be
for
you
he
say
it
s
free
i
ask
what
it
be
this
be
our
campaign
playbook
he
say
campaign
what
you
re
about
to
embark
on
be
a
political
campaign
he
say
you
understand
that
right
in
some
abstract
way
yes
i
understood
that
but
i
hadn
t
be
think
of
it
in
the
literal
term
scott
meant
i
need
a
strategy
for
get
vote
he
say
which
meant
figure
out
who
on
the
board
might
be
persuadable
and
focus
my
message
on
them
he
ask
me
a
series
of
question
which
board
member
be
definitely
in
your
corner
i
m
not
sure
any
of
them
be
okay
who
s
never
go
to
give
you
a
chance
three
or
four
name
and
face
immediately
flash
through
my
mind
now
who
be
the
swing
voter
there
be
a
handful
whom
i
thought
i
might
be
able
to
convince
to
take
a
flyer
on
me
those
be
the
one
you
have
to
focus
on
first
scott
say
he
also
understood
the
bind
i
be
in
regard
how
i
talk
about
michael
and
the
past
and
he
d
already
anticipate
it
you
cannot
win
this
as
an
incumbent
he
say
you
cannot
win
on
the
defensive
it
s
only
about
the
future
it
s
not
about
the
past
that
may
seem
obvious
but
it
come
as
a
revelation
to
me
i
didn
t
have
to
rehash
the
past
i
didn
t
have
to
defend
michael
s
decision
i
didn
t
have
to
criticize
him
for
my
own
benefit
it
s
only
about
the
future
every
time
a
question
come
up
about
what
have
go
wrong
at
disney
over
the
past
year
what
mistake
michael
make
and
why
they
should
think
i
m
any
different
my
response
could
simply
and
honestly
be
i
can
t
do
anything
about
the
past
we
can
talk
about
lesson
learn
and
we
can
make
sure
we
apply
those
lesson
go
forward
but
we
don
t
get
any
do
over
you
want
to
know
where
i
m
go
to
take
this
company
not
where
it
s
be
here
s
my
plan
you
must
think
plan
and
act
like
an
insurgent
scott
told
me
and
your
plan
should
be
form
with
one
clear
thought
in
mind
this
be
a
battle
for
the
soul
of
the
brand
talk
about
the
brand
how
to
grow
its
value
how
to
protect
it
then
he
add
you
re
go
to
need
some
strategic
priority
i
d
give
this
considerable
thought
and
i
immediately
start
tick
off
a
list
i
be
five
or
six
in
when
he
shook
his
head
and
say
stop
talk
once
you
have
that
many
of
them
they
re
no
longer
priority
priority
be
the
few
thing
that
you
re
go
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
a
lot
of
capital
on
not
only
do
you
undermine
their
significance
by
have
too
many
but
nobody
be
go
to
remember
them
all
you
re
go
to
seem
unfocused
he
say
you
only
get
three
i
can
t
tell
you
what
those
three
should
be
we
don
t
have
to
figure
that
out
today
you
never
have
to
tell
me
what
they
be
if
you
don
t
want
to
but
you
only
get
three
he
be
right
in
my
eagerness
to
demonstrate
that
i
have
a
strategy
for
solve
all
of
disney
s
problem
and
address
all
of
the
issue
we
be
confront
i
hadn
t
prioritize
any
of
them
there
be
no
signal
as
to
what
be
most
important
no
easily
digest
comprehensive
vision
my
overall
vision
lack
clarity
and
inspiration
a
company
s
culture
be
shape
by
a
lot
of
thing
but
this
be
one
of
the
most
important
you
have
to
convey
your
priority
clearly
and
repeatedly
in
my
experience
it
s
what
separate
great
manager
from
the
rest
if
leader
don
t
articulate
their
priority
clearly
then
the
people
around
them
don
t
know
what
their
own
priority
should
be
time
and
energy
and
capital
get
waste
people
in
your
organization
suffer
unnecessary
anxiety
because
they
don
t
know
what
they
should
be
focus
on
inefficiency
set
in
frustration
build
up
morale
sink
you
can
do
a
lot
for
the
morale
of
the
people
around
you
and
therefore
the
people
around
them
just
by
take
the
guesswork
out
of
their
day
to
day
life
a
ceo
must
provide
the
company
and
its
senior
team
with
a
road
map
a
lot
of
work
be
complex
and
require
intense
amount
of
focus
and
energy
but
this
kind
of
message
be
fairly
simple
this
be
where
we
want
to
be
this
be
how
we
re
go
to
get
there
once
those
thing
be
laid
out
simply
so
many
decision
become
easy
to
make
and
the
overall
anxiety
of
an
entire
organization
be
lower
after
the
meeting
with
scott
i
quickly
land
on
three
clear
strategic
priority
they
have
guide
the
company
since
the
moment
i
be
name
ceo
we
need
to
devote
most
of
our
time
and
capital
to
the
creation
of
high
quality
brand
content
in
an
age
when
more
and
more
content
be
be
create
and
distribute
we
need
to
bet
on
the
fact
that
quality
will
matter
more
and
more
it
wasn
t
enough
to
create
lot
of
content
and
it
wasn
t
even
enough
to
create
lot
of
good
content
with
an
explosion
of
choice
consumer
need
an
ability
to
make
decision
about
how
to
spend
their
time
and
money
great
brand
would
become
even
more
powerful
tool
for
guide
consumer
behavior
we
need
to
embrace
technology
to
the
full
extent
first
by
use
it
to
enable
the
creation
of
high
quality
product
and
then
to
reach
more
consumer
in
more
modern
more
relevant
way
from
the
early
disney
year
under
walt
technology
be
always
view
as
a
powerful
storytelling
tool
now
it
be
time
to
double
down
on
our
commitment
to
do
the
same
thing
it
be
also
become
clear
that
while
we
be
still
and
would
remain
primarily
a
content
creator
the
day
would
come
when
modern
distribution
would
be
an
essential
mean
of
maintain
brand
relevance
unless
consumer
have
the
ability
to
consume
our
content
in
more
user
friendly
more
mobile
and
more
digital
way
our
relevance
would
be
challenged
in
short
we
need
to
view
technology
as
more
of
an
opportunity
than
a
threat
and
we
have
to
do
so
with
commitment
enthusiasm
and
a
sense
of
urgency
we
need
to
become
a
truly
global
company
we
be
broad
with
our
reach
do
business
in
numerous
market
around
the
world
but
we
need
to
well
penetrate
certain
market
particularly
the
world
s
most
populous
country
like
china
and
india
if
our
primary
focus
be
on
create
excellent
brand
content
the
next
step
be
to
bring
that
content
to
a
global
audience
firmly
plant
our
root
in
those
market
and
create
a
strong
foundation
to
grow
significantly
in
scale
to
continue
to
create
the
same
thing
for
the
same
loyal
customer
be
stagnation
that
be
the
vision
it
be
about
the
future
not
the
past
and
the
future
be
about
organize
the
entire
company
s
mission
all
of
our
business
and
every
one
of
our
employee
at
the
time
around
these
three
priority
now
i
just
need
to
convince
ten
board
member
most
of
whom
have
little
or
no
faith
in
me
that
this
be
the
right
course
for
the
company
and
i
be
the
right
person
for
the
job


my
first
all
on
one
interview
with
the
board
take
place
on
a
sunday
even
in
our
boardroom
in
burbank
they
question
me
for
two
hour
and
while
they
weren
t
openly
combative
they
weren
t
especially
warm
and
friendly
either
they
have
be
under
pressure
for
a
long
time
and
now
they
be
under
even
more
their
determination
to
project
how
seriously
they
be
take
this
process
be
evident
in
their
no
nonsense
demeanor
it
be
clear
that
my
have
be
on
the
board
myself
for
five
year
wasn
t
go
to
make
the
road
any
smoother
it
so
happen
that
month
before
i
d
commit
to
participate
in
a
triathlon
in
malibu
that
day
and
i
didn
t
want
to
leave
my
team
in
the
lurch
so
i
woke
at
a
m
and
drove
to
malibu
in
the
dark
rode
the
eighteen
mile
bike
leg
of
the
race
then
speed
home
and
shower
and
change
and
go
to
burbank
for
my
meeting
with
the
board
at
the
last
minute
to
keep
my
energy
from
slump
during
the
interview
i
devour
a
protein
bar
right
before
i
walk
through
the
door
for
the
next
two
hour
my
stomach
loudly
gurgle
and
i
worried
the
board
be
think
that
my
gi
system
be
send
a
signal
to
them
that
i
couldn
t
handle
the
pressure
the
good
news
be
that
this
be
my
first
opportunity
to
show
them
my
plan
i
laid
out
the
three
core
principle
and
then
i
field
several
question
about
the
poor
state
of
morale
within
the
company
there
be
still
tremendous
passion
for
the
brand
i
say
but
my
goal
be
for
disney
to
be
the
most
admire
company
in
the
world
by
our
consumer
and
our
shareholder
and
by
our
employee
that
last
part
be
key
we
ll
never
get
the
admiration
or
the
public
unless
we
get
it
from
our
own
people
first
and
the
way
to
get
the
people
work
for
us
to
admire
the
company
and
believe
in
its
future
be
to
make
product
they
re
proud
of
it
s
that
simple
there
be
another
more
practical
issue
that
i
mention
regard
morale
over
the
year
we
d
become
a
company
in
which
virtually
all
noncreative
decision
be
make
by
the
central
oversight
group
strategic
planning
that
i
mention
earlier
strat
planning
be
compose
of
about
sixty
five
analyst
with
mba
from
the
best
business
school
in
the
country
they
occupy
the
fourth
floor
of
our
headquarters
and
as
the
company
expand
michael
depend
on
them
more
and
more
to
analyze
all
of
our
decision
and
dictate
the
strategy
for
our
various
business
in
many
way
this
make
sense
they
be
very
good
at
what
they
do
but
it
create
two
problem
one
be
something
i
allude
to
previously
that
the
centralize
decision
make
have
a
demoralize
effect
on
the
senior
leader
of
our
business
who
sense
that
the
power
to
run
their
division
really
reside
at
strategic
planning
the
other
be
that
their
overly
analytical
decision
make
process
could
be
painstaking
and
slow
the
world
be
move
so
much
faster
than
it
do
even
a
couple
of
year
ago
i
say
to
the
board
and
the
speed
with
which
thing
be
happen
be
only
go
to
increase
our
decision
make
have
to
be
straighter
and
faster
and
i
need
to
explore
way
of
do
that
i
assume
that
if
the
leader
of
our
business
felt
more
involve
in
make
decision
that
would
have
a
positive
trickle
down
effect
on
the
company
s
morale
i
have
no
idea
at
the
time
how
dramatic
and
immediate
that
effect
would
be


the
six
month
process
that
follow
that
initial
interview
with
the
board
test
me
more
than
anything
in
my
career
i
d
never
be
more
challenged
intellectually
in
term
of
business
intelligence
anyway
never
do
more
intensive
think
about
how
our
company
operate
and
what
need
fix
never
process
so
much
information
in
such
a
short
amount
of
time
i
be
do
all
of
that
on
top
of
the
day
to
day
demand
of
help
to
run
the
company
michael
be
there
but
his
attention
be
often
understandably
elsewhere
and
the
long
stressful
day
begin
to
wear
on
me
the
strain
wasn
t
primarily
because
of
the
workload
i
ve
always
pride
myself
on
my
ability
and
willingness
to
put
in
a
great
effort
than
anyone
else
for
me
the
hardest
test
by
far
be
manage
the
public
scrutiny
and
the
overtly
express
opinion
that
i
should
not
be
the
next
ceo
the
disney
succession
be
an
important
business
story
and
the
reporting
around
it
what
be
the
board
think
who
be
in
the
mix
could
the
company
be
right
be
relentless
the
consensus
among
business
analyst
and
commentator
largely
echoed
the
opinion
of
those
board
member
oppose
to
me
disney
need
fresh
blood
a
new
perspective
choose
iger
amount
to
a
giant
rubber
stamp
of
michael
eisner
it
wasn
t
just
the
press
though
early
in
the
process
jeffrey
katzenberg
met
me
for
breakfast
near
the
disney
lot
in
burbank
you
need
to
leave
jeffrey
told
me
you
re
not
go
to
get
this
job
your
reputation
have
be
tarnished
i
knew
that
distinguish
myself
from
michael
be
go
to
be
a
struggle
but
i
hadn
t
up
to
that
point
consider
that
the
outside
world
perceive
me
as
be
taint
jeffrey
felt
a
need
to
disabuse
me
of
that
idea
there
be
no
separate
me
from
the
mess
of
the
last
few
year
he
say
you
should
go
do
some
pro
bono
work
to
rehabilitate
your
image
rehabilitate
my
image
i
heard
him
out
and
try
to
remain
calm
but
i
be
stun
and
angry
by
jeffrey
s
certainty
that
i
be
do
still
another
part
of
me
wonder
if
he
be
right
maybe
i
didn
t
fully
comprehend
what
everyone
else
around
me
could
see
plain
as
day
that
there
be
no
way
i
be
get
this
job
or
maybe
this
be
all
just
hollywood
kremlinology
and
the
big
task
before
me
be
to
continue
to
make
the
best
case
i
could
make
for
myself
and
ignore
all
of
the
distraction
that
i
couldn
t
control
it
s
so
easy
to
get
caught
up
in
rumor
mill
to
worry
about
this
person
s
perception
of
you
or
that
person
s
what
someone
might
say
or
write
about
you
it
s
easy
to
become
defensive
and
petty
and
to
want
to
lash
out
when
you
feel
you
re
be
unfairly
misrepresent
i
didn
t
believe
i
deserve
this
job
i
didn
t
think
i
be
entitle
to
it
but
i
do
believe
i
be
right
for
it
part
of
prove
that
be
remain
steady
in
the
face
of
so
much
publicly
express
doubt
i
still
recall
one
headline
in
the
orlando
sentinel
that
say
eisner
s
heir
far
from
apparent
many
others
express
similar
sentiment
and
for
a
while
it
seem
that
every
day
someone
be
write
or
talk
about
what
an
abdication
of
responsibility
it
would
be
if
the
board
name
me
ceo
stanley
gold
be
quote
in
another
publication
say
i
be
a
gentleman
and
a
hard
work
executive
but
most
of
the
disney
board
have
open
question
about
whether
i
should
succeed
michael
that
have
an
ominous
tone
to
it
there
be
one
board
member
gary
wilson
who
not
only
didn
t
think
i
should
get
the
job
but
clearly
thought
he
could
far
his
own
agenda
by
baiting
me
and
attempt
to
humiliate
me
in
our
meeting
i
have
to
consistently
remind
myself
that
gary
wilson
wasn
t
my
problem
as
much
as
this
process
be
a
test
of
my
idea
it
be
also
a
test
of
my
temperament
and
i
couldn
t
let
the
negativity
be
express
by
people
who
knew
little
about
me
affect
the
way
i
felt
about
myself
by
the
end
of
the
process
i
would
be
interviewed
fifteen
time
that
first
all
on
one
interview
then
one
on
one
interview
with
every
member
of
the
board
then
follow
up
interview
with
board
member
who
request
them
then
one
of
the
most
insult
experience
of
my
career
an
interview
with
a
headhunter
name
gerry
roche
who
ran
a
well
know
search
firm
call
heidrick
and
struggle
gerry
have
be
hire
by
the
board
to
benchmark
me
against
the
outside
candidate
and
to
help
the
board
field
candidate
they
do
not
know
when
i
learn
of
this
i
complain
to
george
mitchell
that
it
be
offensive
and
that
i
d
already
answer
everything
that
could
be
ask
of
me
just
do
it
george
say
the
board
want
to
check
off
every
box
so
i
flew
to
new
york
for
a
lunch
meeting
at
gerry
s
office
we
sat
in
a
conference
room
with
only
water
on
the
table
gerry
held
a
copy
of
james
stewart
s
disneywar
which
have
just
be

and
which

and
in
several
instance

inaccurately
michael
s
year
as
ceo
and
mine
as
coo
the
book
have
post
it
note
on
several
page
to
mark
the
passage
he
want
to
challenge
me
on
he
flip
through
the
book
and
ask
me
a
series
of
question
that
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
me
thirty
minute
into
the
interview
gerry
s
assistant
come
in
with
a
single
brown
bag
lunch
for
him
and
told
him
the
private
jet
that
be
go
to
take
him
to
a
wedding
in
florida
be
leave
soon
and
he
have
to
go
or
he
be
go
to
miss
it
with
that
he
get
up
and
left
i
never
ate
and
i
walk
out
of
the
interview
infuriate
at
the
waste
of
time
and
the
lack
of
respect
there
be
only
one
time
that
the
stress
and
frustration
truly
get
to
me
it
be
january
several
month
into
the
process
and
i
d
take
my
six
year
old
son
max
to
an
l
a
clipper
game
at
the
staple
center
in
the
middle
of
the
game
my
skin
begin
to
feel
clammy
my
chest
tighten
and
i
felt
short
of
breath
both
of
my
parent
have
suffer
heart
attack
at
fifty
i
be
fifty
four
at
the
time
and
i
knew
the
symptom
in
fact
i
d
always
live
in
fear
of
have
one
part
of
me
be
sure
this
be
it
and
another
part
be
sure
it
couldn
t
be
i
ate
well
work
out
seven
day
a
week
have
regular
checkup
i
couldn
t
be
experience
a
heart
attack
could
i
i
debate
call
for
an
emt
at
the
game
but
be
worried
about
frighten
max
instead
i
told
him
i
be
feel
sick
to
my
stomach
and
we
left
for
home
there
be
a
drive
rainstorm
in
l
a
that
afternoon
and
i
be
barely
able
to
see
the
road
my
heart
felt
like
it
be
get
squeeze
by
a
fist
inside
my
chest
i
knew
it
be
foolish
to
be
behind
the
wheel
with
my
son
in
the
backseat
and
i
worried
that
i
d
make
a
terrible
mistake
in
the
moment
though
i
could
only
think
that
i
need
to
get
home
i
pull
into
our
driveway
max
jumped
out
of
the
car
and
i
immediately
phone
my
internist
dennis
evangelatos
then
call
a
friend
who
come
and
drove
me
to
dennis
s
house
dennis
knew
me
well
and
he
be
aware
of
the
stress
i
d
be
under
he
checked
my
vital
sign
then
look
me
square
in
the
eye
and
say
you
re
have
a
classic
anxiety
attack
bob
you
have
to
get
some
rest
it
be
a
relief
but
also
a
worry
i
d
always
thought
of
myself
as
somewhat
impervious
to
stress
able
to
stay
focus
and
calm
in
tense
situation
the
strain
of
this
process
be
take
a
big
toll
than
i
d
admit
even
to
myself
much
less
to
my
family
or
close
friend
and
a
big
toll
than
it
should
take
i
left
dennis
s
house
and
get
home
and
take
some
time
to
put
everything
that
be
happen
into
perspective
it
be
a
big
job
and
a
big
title
but
it
wasn
t
my
life
my
life
be
with
willow
and
my
boy
with
my
girl
back
in
new
york
with
my
parent
and
my
sister
and
my
friend
all
of
this
strain
be
ultimately
still
about
a
job
and
i
vowed
to
myself
to
try
to
keep
that
in
perspective
the
only
time
i
crack
in
front
of
the
board
be
in
my
final
interview
with
them
after
month
of
interview
and
presentation
they
call
for
one
more
a
sunday
even
meeting
in
a
hotel
conference
room
in
pasadena
i
arrive
to
learn
that
they
have
spent
the
afternoon
at
one
of
the
board
member
s
home
interview
meg
whitman
the
ceo
of
ebay
who
be
the
other
main
contender
at
that
point
the
other
four
have
either
drop
out
or
be
eliminate
by
then
i
have
have
it
with
the
whole
process
i
couldn
t
believe
there
be
anything
left
that
they
didn
t
know
any
question
that
hadn
t
already
be
answer
thoroughly
several
time
over
i
want
it
to
come
to
an
end
the
company
which
have
be
face
an
uncertain
future
for
half
a
year
now
much
longer
if
you
add
in
the
month
of
turmoil
around
michael
s
future
need
it
to
come
to
an
end
even
more
some
member
of
the
board
didn
t
comprehend
this
and
i
have
hit
the
limit
of
my
patience
toward
the
end
of
that
final
interview
gary
wilson
the
board
member
who
have
be
goad
me
to
disparage
michael
throughout
the
entire
process
ask
me
one
more
time
tell
us
why
we
should
believe
that
you
be
different
what
do
you
think
michael
do
wrong
what
would
you
do
differently
it
struck
a
nerve
and
i
lash
back
at
him
in
front
of
the
rest
of
the
board
you
ve
ask
me
the
same
question
on
three
prior
occasion
i
say
struggle
to
keep
myself
from
holler
i
find
it
offensive
and
i
m
not
go
to
answer
it
everyone
in
the
room
go
silent
and
the
interview
come
to
an
abrupt
end
i
stood
up
and
left
without
look
any
of
them
in
the
eye
i
didn
t
shake
anyone
s
hand
i
didn
t
thank
them
for
their
time
i
d
flunk
my
self
impose
test
to
withstand
anything
they
threw
at
me
with
patience
and
respect
that
night
george
mitchell
and
another
board
member
aylwin
lewis
each
call
me
at
home
you
probably
didn
t
do
yourself
irreparable
harm
george
say
but
you
didn
t
do
yourself
much
good
either
aylwin
be
harsher
this
wasn
t
the
time
to
let
everyone
see
you
sweat
bob
he
say
i
wasn
t
happy
i
d
do
it
but
i
be
human
i
couldn
t
take
it
back
at
that
point
anyway
and
i
felt
my
anger
be
justified
at
the
end
of
my
conversation
with
george
i
say
please
just
make
a
decision
it
s
time
the
company
be
suffer
because
of
all
this
when
i
look
back
on
that
time
now
i
think
of
it
as
a
hard
earn
lesson
about
the
importance
of
tenacity
and
perseverance
but
also
about
the
need
to
steer
clear
of
anger
and
anxiety
over
thing
you
can
t
control
i
can
t
overstate
how
important
it
be
to
keep
blow
to
the
ego
real
as
they
often
be
from
occupy
too
big
a
place
in
your
mind
and
sap
too
much
of
your
energy
it
s
easy
to
be
optimistic
when
everyone
be
tell
you
you
re
great
it
s
much
harder
and
much
more
necessary
when
your
sense
of
yourself
be
be
challenged
and
in
such
a
public
way
the
succession
process
be
the
first
time
in
my
career
that
i
have
to
face
that
level
of
anxiety
head
on
it
be
impossible
to
completely
filter
out
the
chatter
about
me
or
to
not
be
hurt
by
very
public
conversation
about
how
ill
suit
i
be
for
the
job
but
i
learn
through
strong
self
discipline
and
love
from
my
family
that
i
have
to
recognize
it
for
what
it
be
that
it
have
no
bearing
on
who
i
be
and
put
it
in
its
proper
place
i
could
control
what
i
do
and
how
i
comport
myself
everything
else
be
beyond
my
control
i
didn
t
maintain
that
perspective
every
moment
but
to
the
extent
that
i
be
able
to
it
kept
the
anxiety
from
have
too
strong
a
hold


on
a
saturday
in
march
the
board
convene
to
make
its
decision
most
of
the
member
call
into
the
meeting
michael
and
george
mitchell
be
together
in
a
conference
room
at
abc
in
new
york
i
woke
up
that
morning
think
i
might
have
convince
enough
of
the
undecided
member
of
the
board
to
give
me
the
job
but
when
i
thought
of
all
the
drama
and
scrutiny
around
the
process
it
felt
just
as
possible
that
they
would
go
another
way
that
some
of
the
skeptic
would
have
argue
forcefully
for
a
change
in
the
narrative
and
they
would
name
an
outsider
i
spent
the
day
with
my
two
boy
try
to
distract
myself
max
and
i
toss
a
ball
around
go
to
lunch
and
spent
an
hour
in
his
favorite
neighborhood
park
i
told
willow
that
if
bad
news
come
i
be
get
in
my
car
and
take
the
cross
country
drive
that
i
d
long
dream
of
take
a
solo
trip
across
the
united
state
seem
like
heaven
to
me
as
soon
as
that
meeting
end
george
mitchell
and
michael
call
me
at
home
willow
be
with
me
in
the
office
we
share
the
job
of
ceo
be
mine
they
say
it
would
be
announce
the
next
day
i
appreciate
that
michael
be
on
the
call
i
knew
it
must
have
be
painful
for
him
he
d
pour
himself
into
that
job
and
wasn
t
quite
ready
to
relinquish
it
but
if
he
have
to
be
succeed
by
someone
i
believe
he
be
happy
that
that
person
be
me
i
be
grateful
to
george
for
the
way
he
have
treat
me
throughout
the
process
if
not
for
him
i
don
t
think
i
would
have
gotten
a
fair
shake
by
the
rest
of
the
board
mostly
i
be
thankful
for
willow
i
couldn
t
have
do
it
without
her
faith
and
wisdom
and
support
she
be
root
for
me
the
whole
time
of
course
but
time
after
time
she
told
me
this
be
not
the
most
important
thing
in
my
life
in
our
life
i
knew
she
be
right
but
take
her
word
to
heart
take
work
too
and
she
help
me
do
that
once
the
call
end
willow
and
i
sat
quietly
for
a
moment
try
to
savor
it
all
i
have
a
mental
list
of
the
people
i
want
to
call
right
away
and
i
be
fight
the
urge
to
start
dial
and
instead
try
to
just
be
still
to
breathe
a
bit
to
let
in
both
the
elation
and
the
relief
eventually
i
call
my
parent
in
long
island
they
be
proud
if
a
little
incredulous
that
their
son
be
go
to
be
run
the
company
found
by
walt
disney
then
i
call
my
daughter
in
new
york
and
my
old
capital
city
boss
dan
burke
and
tom
murphy
and
then
i
call
steve
job
it
be
an
odd
call
to
make
but
it
felt
important
to
me
to
reach
out
to
him
in
case
there
might
still
someday
be
a
chance
of
salvage
the
relationship
with
pixar
i
barely
knew
steve
at
that
point
but
i
want
him
to
know
that
it
be
go
to
be
announce
the
next
day
that
i
be
the
next
ceo
of
the
company
his
response
be
basically
okay
well
that
s
cool
for
you
i
told
him
that
i
d
love
to
come
see
him
and
try
to
convince
him
that
we
could
work
together
that
thing
could
be
different
he
be
typical
steve
how
long
have
you
work
for
michael
ten
year
huh
he
say
well
i
don
t
see
how
thing
will
be
any
different
but
sure
when
the
dust
settle
be
in
touch
part
two
lead
chapter
the
power
of
respect
there
be
a
six
month
wait
period
between
my
appointment
and
michael
s
exit
from
disney
i
have
plenty
to
focus
on
run
the
company
day
to
day
but
i
be
look
forward
to
take
a
breather
and
spending
some
time
gathering
my
thought
after
the
long
succession
process
i
figure
the
clock
on
my
first
day
would
start
when
michael
walk
out
the
door
and
until
then
i
could
fly
somewhat
under
the
radar
and
be
patient
and
methodical
in
my
plan
i
couldn
t
have
be
more
wrong
immediately
after
the
announcement
everyone
the
press
the
investment
community
the
rest
of
the
industry
disney
employee
be
ask
the
same
thing
what
s
your
strategy
for
fix
the
company
and
how
fast
can
you
implement
it
because
of
its
history
and
because
michael
have
so
dramatically
transform
it
disney
have
always
be
one
of
the
most
scrutinize
corporation
in
the
world
the
very
public
struggle
we
d
endure
over
the
last
few
year
only
increase
intrigue
around
who
i
be
and
what
i
be
go
to
do
there
be
a
lot
of
skeptic
who
still
saw
me
as
a
temporary
ceo
a
short
term
patch
until
the
board
could
identify
a
star
from
the
outside
curiosity
be
high
and
expectation
be
low
and
i
quickly
realize
that
i
need
to
define
our
direction
and
get
some
key
thing
do
before
my
tenure
officially
begin
in
week
one
of
my
ceo
in
wait
period
i
call
my
closest
adviser
tom
staggs
who
be
now
cfo
alan
braverman
our
general
counsel
and
zenia
mucha
our
communication
chief
into
my
office
and
ticked
off
a
list
of
the
most
critical
thing
to
accomplish
in
the
next
six
month
first
we
have
to
try
to
bury
the
hatchet
with
roy
i
say
roy
disney
have
felt
vindicate
to
some
extent
by
the
fact
that
michael
be
force
to
leave
but
he
be
still
angry
that
the
board
hadn
t
act
sooner
and
he
be
critical
of
their
decision
to
give
me
the
job
especially
after
i
d
spoken
publicly
in
michael
s
defense
i
didn
t
believe
there
be
much
roy
could
do
practically
to
undermine
me
at
this
point
but
i
felt
it
be
important
for
the
image
of
the
company
not
to
be
in
an
ongoing
battle
with
a
member
of
the
disney
family
second
we
have
to
try
to
salvage
a
relationship
with
pixar
and
steve
job
the
end
of
the
pixar
partnership
be
a
huge
blow
to
disney
from
both
a
financial
and
a
public
relation
standpoint
steve
be
one
of
the
most
respect
people
in
the
world
at
that
point
in
technology
and
business
and
culture
and
his
rejection
and
wither
criticism
of
disney
be
so
public
that
any
mend
of
that
fence
would
be
see
as
a
big
early
win
plus
pixar
be
now
the
standard
bearer
in
animation
and
while
i
didn
t
yet
have
a
complete
sense
of
just
how
broken
disney
animation
be
i
knew
that
any
renew
partnership
would
be
good
for
our
business
i
also
knew
that
chance
be
slim
that
someone
as
headstrong
as
steve
would
be
open
to
something
but
i
have
to
try
last
i
need
to
begin
the
process
of
change
the
way
we
make
decision
which
meant
restructuring
strat
planning
change
its
size
its
influence
and
its
mission
if
the
first
two
priority
be
largely
about
how
the
public
perceive
us
this
one
be
about
transform
the
perception
of
the
company
from
within
it
would
take
a
while
and
there
would
certainly
be
anger
and
resistance
to
contend
with
from
strat
planning
but
we
have
to
start
reconfiguring
the
apparatus
and
push
strategic
responsibility
back
to
the
business
sooner
rather
than
later
i
hop
that
if
we
could
reduce
the
grip
that
strat
planning
have
over
all
of
our
division
we
would
slowly
begin
to
restore
the
company
s
morale
first
though
be
the
rapprochement
with
roy
disney
before
i
could
even
reach
out
to
him
however
the
prospect
for
peace
blew
up
within
day
after
the
announcement
of
my
promotion
be
make
roy
and
stanley
gold
sue
the
board
for
what
they
say
be
a
fraudulent
succession
process
it
be
an
absurd
charge
that
the
fix
be
in
and
it
be
a
foregone
conclusion
that
i
d
get
the
job
but
it
be
also
go
to
be
a
major
distraction
i
hadn
t
even
begin
the
job
and
i
already
have
my
first
crisis
an
ugly
public
lawsuit
over
my
legitimacy
as
ceo
i
decide
to
call
stanley
on
my
own
not
through
a
lawyer
to
see
if
he
would
be
willing
to
sit
down
and
talk
until
he
and
roy
resign
in
the
fall
of
stanley
and
i
have
serve
on
the
board
together
it
be
obvious
to
me
over
those
few
year
that
stanley
didn
t
respect
me
but
i
thought
he
would
at
least
be
willing
to
hear
me
out
he
be
less
emotional
and
more
practical
than
roy
and
i
suspect
that
i
might
be
able
to
make
him
see
that
a
long
legal
battle
with
disney
wasn
t
in
anyone
s
interest
he
agree
to
talk
and
we
met
at
the
country
club
to
which
he
belong
that
s
not
far
from
the
disney
lot
i
begin
by
describe
to
stanley
the
gauntlet
i
have
just
endure
the
many
interview
the
outside
search
firm
the
numerous
candidate
the
board
have
consider
the
six
month
of
incessant
public
scrutiny
it
be
a
thorough
process
i
say
they
devote
a
lot
of
time
to
their
decision
i
want
stanley
to
fully
grasp
that
his
lawsuit
be
without
merit
and
not
likely
to
succeed
he
go
over
all
the
old
ground
with
me
rehash
yet
again
the
litany
of
his
and
roy
s
criticism
of
michael
and
the
way
the
company
have
be
run
for
the
last
several
year
i
didn
t
debate
him
just
heard
him
out
and
reiterate
that
all
of
that
be
in
the
past
and
that
the
board
s
process
have
be
legitimate
late
in
the
conversation
stanley
become
less
argumentative
he
suggest
that
a
lot
of
this
animosity
be
because
roy
be
hurt
despite
have
preemptively
resign
in
protest
that
michael
be
invoke
our
mandatory
board
retirement
age
to
push
him
off
the
board
which
be
disrespectful
roy
s
relationship
with
the
place
he
thought
of
as
home
have
be
sever
stanley
say
roy
blame
the
board
for
not
listen
to
him
when
he
d
launch
the
campaign
to
unseat
michael
in
the
first
place
they
d
eventually
gotten
rid
of
him
but
roy
felt
that
he
too
have
paid
an
unfair
price
in
all
of
this
at
the
end
of
our
conversation
stanley
say
if
you
can
come
up
with
any
mean
of
bring
roy
back
we
ll
drop
the
lawsuit
i
never
expect
him
to
say
that
out
loud
but
i
left
the
meeting
and
immediately
call
george
mitchell
george
be
eager
to
close
this
chapter
too
and
he
implore
me
to
figure
out
a
way
to
work
something
out
i
call
stanley
back
and
told
him
i
want
to
speak
with
roy
directly
i
wasn
t
hopeful
but
i
felt
certain
that
the
only
way
forward
be
to
clear
the
air
face
to
face
roy
and
i
met
at
the
same
country
club
it
be
a
frank
and
not
especially
pleasant
conversation
i
told
him
i
be
well
aware
of
his
disdain
for
me
but
i
ask
him
to
accept
the
reality
that
i
d
be
appoint
ceo
and
that
the
process
wasn
t
rig
roy
i
say
if
i
fail
the
line
of
people
demand
my
head
will
be
a
lot
longer
than
you
and
stanley
he
make
clear
that
he
would
gladly
continue
to
wage
war
with
the
company
if
he
didn
t
think
it
be
head
in
the
right
direction
but
he
also
show
a
vulnerable
side
i
d
never
see
before
be
alienate
from
the
company
be
painful
for
him
and
the
ongoing
fight
seem
to
have
worn
him
out
he
d
age
considerably
in
the
two
year
since
he
d
left
the
board
and
he
struck
me
as
needy
and
frail
in
a
way
he
hadn
t
in
the
past
i
wonder
if
all
of
this
wasn
t
a
part
of
some
large
psychic
struggle
the
truth
be
it
wasn
t
just
michael
who
be
at
odds
with
roy
besides
stanley
not
enough
people
within
disney
have
give
him
the
respect
he
felt
he
deserve
include
his
long
go
uncle
walt
i
have
never
have
any
real
connection
to
roy
but
i
detect
vulnerability
in
him
now
there
be
nothing
to
be
gain
by
make
him
feel
small
or
insult
he
be
just
someone
look
for
respect
and
get
it
have
never
be
especially
easy
for
him
it
be
so
personal
and
involve
so
much
pride
and
ego
and
this
battle
of
his
have
be
go
on
for
decade
once
i
saw
roy
in
that
light
i
begin
to
think
that
maybe
there
be
a
way
to
appease
him
and
put
this
fight
to
rest
whatever
i
do
though
i
didn
t
want
to
allow
him
to
be
too
close
to
me
or
the
company
for
fear
that
he
would
inevitably
try
to
start
an
insurgency
from
within
i
also
couldn
t
agree
to
anything
that
would
be
see
as
disrespectful
toward
michael
or
look
like
a
validation
of
roy
s
criticism
of
him
so
a
delicate
balance
be
require
i
call
michael
and
explain
my
predicament
and
ask
his
advice
he
wasn
t
happy
to
hear
that
i
be
offering
an
olive
branch
to
roy
but
he
acknowledge
that
peace
with
him
be
important
i
trust
you
to
do
the
right
thing
he
say
but
don
t
let
him
in
too
far
i
contact
stanley
once
more
and
propose
the
follow
i
would
give
roy
an
emeritus
role
on
the
board
and
would
invite
him
to
film
premiere
and
theme
park
opening
and
special
company
event
he
wouldn
t
attend
board
meeting
however
i
d
also
give
him
a
small
consult
fee
and
an
office
on
the
lot
so
he
could
come
and
go
and
call
disney
his
home
again
in
exchange
there
would
be
no
lawsuit
no
public
proclamation
of
victory
and
no
more
air
of
criticism
i
be
stun
when
stanley
say
we
should
draw
up
an
agreement
to
be
execute
within
twenty
four
hour
just
like
that
a
crisis
that
threaten
to
loom
over
my
early
day
as
ceo
be
resolve
make
peace
with
roy
and
stanley
would
be
view
by
some
party
as
a
kind
of
capitulation
but
i
knew
the
truth
and
that
be
far
more
valuable
than
perception
the
drama
with
roy
reinforce
something
that
tends
not
to
get
enough
attention
when
people
talk
about
succeed
in
business
which
be
don
t
let
your
ego
get
in
the
way
of
make
the
best
possible
decision
i
be
stung
when
roy
and
stanley
sue
the
board
for
choose
me
as
ceo
and
i
certainly
could
have
go
to
battle
with
them
and
prevail
but
it
all
would
have
come
at
a
huge
cost
to
the
company
and
be
a
giant
distraction
from
what
really
matter
my
job
be
to
set
our
company
on
a
new
path
and
the
first
step
be
to
defuse
this
unnecessary
struggle
the
easy
and
most
productive
way
to
do
that
be
to
recognize
that
what
roy
need
ultimately
be
to
feel
respect
that
be
precious
to
him
and
it
cost
me
and
the
company
so
little
a
little
respect
go
a
long
way
and
the
absence
of
it
be
often
very
costly
over
the
next
few
year
as
we
make
the
major
acquisition
that
redefine
and
revitalize
the
company
this
simple
seemingly
trite
idea
be
as
important
as
all
of
the
data
crunch
in
the
world
if
you
approach
and
engage
people
with
respect
and
empathy
the
seemingly
impossible
can
become
real


once
the
peace
accord
with
roy
be
sign
my
next
task
be
to
explore
if
there
be
any
chance
of
repair
disney
s
relationship
with
steve
job
and
pixar
two
month
after
i
d
call
steve
to
tell
him
i
d
be
name
ceo
i
reach
out
to
him
again
my
ultimate
goal
be
to
somehow
make
thing
right
with
pixar
but
i
couldn
t
ask
for
that
initially
steve
s
animosity
toward
disney
be
too
deep
root
the
rift
that
have
open
between
steve
and
michael
be
a
clash
between
two
strong
will
people
whose
company
fortune
be
go
in
different
direction
when
michael
criticize
the
tech
industry
for
not
have
enough
respect
for
content
steve
be
insult
when
steve
suggest
disney
be
creatively
broken
michael
be
insult
michael
have
be
a
creative
executive
his
whole
life
steve
believe
that
because
he
ran
pixar
which
be
the
ascendant
animation
studio
he
knew
well
when
disney
animation
begin
to
slip
even
far
steve
become
more
haughty
with
michael
because
he
felt
we
need
him
more
and
michael
hat
that
steve
have
the
upper
hand
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
that
but
it
didn
t
matter
my
ask
steve
to
just
change
his
mind
after
he
d
so
publicly
end
the
partnership
and
excoriate
disney
would
be
far
too
simple
for
him
there
be
no
way
it
be
go
to
be
that
easy
i
have
an
idea
unrelated
to
pixar
though
that
i
thought
might
interest
him
i
told
him
i
be
a
huge
music
lover
and
that
i
have
all
of
my
music
store
on
my
ipod
which
i
use
constantly
i
d
be
think
about
the
future
of
television
and
it
occur
to
me
that
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
we
would
be
access
tv
show
and
movie
on
our
computer
i
didn
t
know
how
fast
mobile
technology
be
go
to
evolve
the
iphone
be
still
two
year
away
so
what
i
be
imagine
be
an
itunes
platform
for
television
imagine
have
access
to
all
of
television
history
on
your
computer
i
say
if
you
want
to
watch
last
week
s
episode
of
lose
or
something
from
the
first
season
of
i
love
lucy
there
it
would
be
imagine
be
able
to
watch
all
of
twilight
zone
again
whenever
you
want
to
it
be
come
i
be
certain
of
that
and
i
want
disney
to
be
in
front
of
the
wave
i
figure
the
best
way
to
do
that
be
to
convince
steve
of
the
inevitability
of
this
idea
itv
as
i
described
it
to
him
steve
be
silent
for
a
while
and
then
he
finally
say
i
m
go
to
come
back
to
you
on
this
i
m
work
on
something
i
want
to
show
you
a
few
week
later
he
flew
down
to
burbank
and
come
to
my
office
steve
s
idea
of
small
talk
be
to
glance
out
the
window
make
a
brief
comment
about
the
weather
and
then
immediately
start
talk
about
the
business
at
hand
which
be
exactly
what
he
do
that
morning
you
can
t
tell
anyone
about
this
he
say
but
what
you
re
talk
about
with
television
show
that
s
exactly
what
we
ve
be
imagine
he
slowly
withdrew
a
device
from
his
pocket
at
first
glance
it
look
just
like
the
ipod
i
d
be
use
this
be
our
new
video
ipod
he
say
it
have
a
screen
the
size
of
a
couple
of
postage
stamp
but
he
be
talk
about
it
like
it
be
an
imax
theater
this
be
go
to
allow
people
to
watch
video
on
our
ipod
not
just
listen
to
music
he
say
if
we
bring
this
product
to
market
will
you
put
your
television
show
on
it
i
say
yes
right
away
any
product
demo
by
steve
be
powerful
but
this
be
a
personal
demonstration
i
could
feel
his
enthusiasm
as
i
star
at
the
device
and
i
have
a
profound
sense
of
hold
the
future
in
my
hand
there
could
be
complication
if
we
put
our
show
on
his
platform
but
in
the
moment
i
knew
instinctively
that
it
be
the
right
decision
steve
respond
to
boldness
and
i
want
to
signal
to
him
that
there
could
be
a
different
way
of
do
business
with
disney
go
forward
among
his
many
frustration
be
a
feel
that
it
be
often
too
difficult
to
get
anything
do
with
us
every
agreement
need
to
be
vet
and
analyze
to
within
an
inch
of
its
life
and
that
s
not
how
he
work
i
want
him
to
understand
that
i
didn
t
work
that
way
either
that
i
be
empower
to
make
a
call
and
that
i
be
eager
to
figure
out
this
future
together
and
to
do
so
quickly
i
thought
that
if
he
respect
my
instinct
and
my
willingness
to
take
this
risk
then
maybe
just
maybe
the
door
to
pixar
might
crack
open
again
so
i
told
him
again
yes
we
be
in
okay
he
say
i
ll
get
back
to
you
when
there
s
more
to
discus
that
october
five
month
after
that
first
conversation
and
two
week
after
i
officially
become
ceo
steve
and
i
stood
on
a
stage
together
at
the
apple
launch
and
announce
that
five
disney
show
include
three
of
the
most
popular
on
tv
desperate
housewife
lose
and
grey
s
anatomy
would
now
be
available
for
download
on
itunes
and
for
consumption
on
the
new
ipod
with
the
video
player
i
d
essentially
broker
the
deal
myself
with
assistance
from
anne
sweeney
who
ran
abc
the
ease
and
the
speed
with
which
we
get
it
do
combine
with
the
fact
that
it
show
an
admiration
for
apple
and
its
product
blew
steve
s
mind
he
told
me
he
d
never
met
anyone
in
the
entertainment
business
who
be
willing
to
try
something
that
might
disrupt
his
own
company
s
business
model
when
i
walk
onstage
that
day
to
announce
our
apple
partnership
the
audience
be
confuse
at
first
think
why
be
the
new
disney
guy
up
there
with
steve
it
can
only
be
one
reason
i
have
no
script
but
the
first
thing
i
say
be
i
know
what
you
re
think
but
i
m
not
here
for
that
there
be
laugh
and
groan
nobody
wish
we
be
make
that
announcement
more
than
i
do


a
few
day
after
i
get
the
job
in
march
a
meeting
show
up
on
my
calendar
about
ticket
pricing
at
the
theme
park
we
would
soon
be
opening
in
hong
kong
the
request
come
from
the
office
of
peter
murphy
the
head
of
strategic
planning
i
call
the
person
who
be
run
park
and
resort
at
the
time
and
ask
him
whose
meeting
it
be
it
s
peter
s
he
say
peter
s
have
a
meeting
about
ticket
pricing
in
hong
kong
yes
i
call
peter
and
ask
why
we
have
to
make
sure
they
re
do
the
right
thing
he
say
if
they
can
t
figure
out
what
pricing
should
be
they
shouldn
t
be
in
their
job
i
say
but
if
we
believe
they
should
be
in
their
job
then
they
should
be
in
charge
of
pricing
i
have
the
meeting
cancel
and
while
it
wasn
t
a
hugely
dramatic
moment
it
be
the
begin
of
the
end
of
strat
planning
as
we
d
know
it
peter
have
a
first
rate
mind
and
an
almost
unequaled
work
ethic
and
as
i
ve
mention
michael
have
come
to
depend
on
him
almost
exclusively
as
the
company
grow
peter
consolidated
and
protect
his
burgeon
power
his
skill
and
his
intellect
often
cause
him
to
be
disdainful
of
other
senior
leader
and
as
a
result
he
be
fear
and
disliked
by
many
of
them
it
be
a
tense
and
increasingly
dysfunctional
dynamic
as
far
as
i
knew
it
hadn
t
always
be
that
way
when
michael
and
frank
well
come
in
to
run
the
company
in
the
mid
s
they
create
strat
planning
to
help
them
identify
and
analyze
a
range
of
new
business
opportunity
after
frank
s
death
in
and
the
cap
city
abc
acquisition
in
michael
need
help
manage
the
newly
expand
company
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
number
two
he
lean
heavily
on
strat
planning
to
help
him
make
decision
and
steer
disney
s
various
business
i
recognize
the
value
of
their
contribution
but
i
could
also
see
with
each
passing
year
that
they
be
grow
too
large
and
too
powerful
and
that
the
more
influence
they
wield
the
more
disempowered
the
people
who
be
run
our
individual
business
become
by
the
time
michael
name
me
coo
there
be
about
sixty
five
people
in
strat
planning
and
they
d
take
over
nearly
all
of
the
critical
business
decision
across
the
entire
company
all
of
our
senior
business
leader
knew
that
strategic
decision
about
the
division
they
ran
park
and
resort
consumer
product
walt
disney
studio
and
so
on
weren
t
actually
theirs
to
make
power
be
concentrate
within
this
single
entity
in
burbank
and
peter
and
his
people
be
view
more
as
an
internal
police
force
than
a
partner
to
our
business
in
many
respect
peter
be
a
futurist
he
felt
our
business
leader
be
old
school
manager
whose
idea
be
at
best
variation
on
the
status
quo
he
wasn
t
wrong
about
that
there
be
many
people
at
the
company
at
that
point
who
didn
t
have
the
analytical
skill
and
aggressive
attitude
exemplify
by
peter
and
his
team
you
can
t
wear
your
disdain
for
people
on
your
sleeve
though
you
end
up
either
cow
them
into
submission
or
frustrate
them
into
complacency
either
way
you
sap
them
of
the
pride
they
take
in
their
work
over
time
nearly
everyone
abdicate
responsibility
to
peter
and
strat
planning
and
michael
be
comfort
by
the
analytical
rigor
they
represent
to
my
mind
though
they
be
often
too
deliberative
pour
every
decision
through
their
overly
analytical
sieve
whatever
we
gain
from
have
this
group
of
talented
people
sift
through
a
deal
to
make
sure
it
be
to
our
advantage
we
often
lose
in
the
time
it
take
for
us
to
act
this
isn
t
to
say
that
research
and
deliberation
aren
t
important
you
have
to
do
the
homework
you
have
to
be
prepared
you
certainly
can
t
make
a
major
acquisition
without
building
the
necessary
model
to
help
you
determine
whether
a
deal
be
the
right
one
but
you
also
have
to
recognize
that
there
be
never
percent
certainty
no
matter
how
much
data
you
ve
be
give
it
s
still
ultimately
a
risk
and
the
decision
to
take
that
risk
or
not
come
down
to
one
person
s
instinct
peter
saw
no
problem
with
a
system
in
which
he
and
the
analyst
who
work
for
him
make
so
many
of
the
company
s
decision
meanwhile
business
around
us
be
adapt
to
a
world
that
be
change
at
blinding
speed
we
need
to
change
we
need
to
be
more
nimble
and
we
need
to
do
it
soon
a
week
or
so
after
that
exchange
about
hong
kong
ticket
pricing
i
call
peter
into
my
office
and
told
him
i
be
planning
to
reconstitute
strat
planning
i
say
i
want
to
drastically
reduce
the
size
of
the
group
and
begin
streamline
our
decision
make
by
put
more
of
it
in
the
hand
of
the
business
leader
we
both
knew
that
my
vision
for
the
group
wouldn
t
be
a
good
fit
for
him
and
it
didn
t
make
sense
for
him
to
stay
shortly
after
that
conversation
i
have
a
press
release
draft
say
that
peter
be
leave
and
that
strat
planning
be
be
reformulate
and
then
i
immediately
begin
dismantle
the
group
i
shrank
strat
planning
from
sixty
five
people
to
fifteen
tom
staggs
my
cfo
have
the
idea
to
bring
kevin
mayer
who
have
once
be
with
the
group
and
left
a
few
year
earlier
back
to
the
company
to
run
the
newly
lean
and
repurposed
team
kevin
would
report
to
tom
and
he
and
his
group
would
focus
on
potential
acquisition
with
a
clear
mandate
that
any
acquisition
be
in
the
service
of
our
three
core
priority
remake
strat
planning
turn
out
to
be
the
most
significant
accomplishment
of
that
six
month
period
before
i
take
over
the
company
i
knew
that
it
would
have
an
immediate
practical
effect
but
the
announcement
that
they
would
no
longer
have
such
an
iron
grip
on
all
aspect
of
our
business
have
a
powerful
instantaneous
effect
on
morale
it
be
as
if
all
the
window
have
be
thrown
open
and
fresh
air
be
suddenly
move
through
as
one
of
our
senior
executive
say
to
me
at
the
time
if
there
be
church
bell
on
the
steeple
throughout
disney
they
would
be
ring
chapter
disney
pixar
and
a
new
path
to
the
future
those
month
spent
talk
with
steve
about
put
our
tv
show
on
his
new
ipod
begin
slowly
tentatively
to
open
up
into
discussion
of
a
possible
new
disney
pixar
deal
steve
have
soften
but
only
a
little
he
be
willing
to
talk
but
his
version
of
any
new
agreement
be
still
very
one
side
in
pixar
s
favor
we
parry
a
few
time
over
what
a
deal
might
look
like
but
get
nowhere
i
ask
tom
staggs
to
join
the
discussion
and
see
if
he
could
make
progress
we
also
brought
in
a
go
between
from
goldman
sachs
gene
sykes
whom
we
trust
and
who
knew
steve
well
we
float
a
few
different
idea
to
steve
through
gene
but
steve
still
didn
t
budge
his
resistance
wasn
t
complicate
steve
love
pixar
and
he
didn
t
care
about
disney
so
any
agreement
he
d
deign
to
consider
would
have
huge
upside
for
them
and
come
at
a
steep
price
for
us
one
proposal
have
us
cede
to
pixar
the
valuable
sequel
right
to
the
film
we
d
already
release
together
like
toy
story
monster
inc
and
the
incredibles
in
exchange
for
a
percent
stake
in
their
company
we
d
get
board
seat
the
right
to
distribute
all
new
pixar
film
and
a
big
press
announcement
say
that
disney
and
pixar
would
continue
as
partner
the
financial
value
be
weight
heavily
toward
pixar
though
they
d
get
to
make
original
pixar
brand
film
and
sequel
which
they
d
own
forever
and
our
role
essentially
would
be
to
serve
as
passive
distributor
there
be
a
few
other
similar
proposal
that
i
turn
down
tom
and
i
would
look
at
each
other
after
each
round
of
negotiation
and
ask
ourselves
if
we
be
crazy
to
not
just
make
any
deal
with
steve
but
then
we
d
quickly
conclude
that
any
deal
we
make
have
to
have
long
term
value
and
an
announcement
didn
t
give
us
that
the
reality
be
steve
have
all
of
the
leverage
in
the
world
by
then
pixar
have
become
the
standard
bearer
for
inventive
sophisticated
animate
filmmaking
and
he
never
seem
worried
about
walk
away
from
us
our
only
bargaining
chip
be
that
we
currently
have
the
right
to
make
sequel
of
those
earlier
film
without
them
and
in
fact
we
d
start
to
develop
some
under
michael
when
talk
have
broken
down
two
year
before
steve
knew
we
would
struggle
to
make
anything
genuinely
great
though
give
the
state
of
disney
animation
and
he
almost
dare
us
to
try


on
september
michael
spent
his
last
day
as
ceo
of
the
company
he
d
run
for
twenty
one
year
it
be
a
sad
awkward
day
he
be
leave
with
no
ongoing
connection
to
disney
no
seat
on
the
board
no
emeritus
or
consult
role
it
be
about
as
cold
turkey
as
it
get
he
be
gracious
with
me
but
i
could
feel
the
tension
between
us
as
hard
as
the
last
few
year
have
be
michael
didn
t
want
to
leave
and
i
found
myself
at
a
loss
for
word
i
met
briefly
with
zenia
mucha
and
tom
staggs
and
alan
braverman
and
told
them
that
my
sense
be
that
it
be
well
to
let
him
be
so
we
kept
a
respectful
distance
and
give
him
some
privacy
to
leave
on
his
own
term
michael
s
wife
jane
and
one
of
their
son
come
for
lunch
and
later
that
day
he
drove
off
the
lot
for
the
last
time
i
can
t
imagine
what
he
must
have
felt
he
d
come
in
two
decade
earlier
and
save
the
company
and
now
he
be
drive
away
know
that
his
era
be
over
and
that
the
place
that
he
have
turn
into
the
large
entertainment
company
in
the
world
would
keep
go
on
without
him
it
s
one
of
those
moment
i
imagine
when
it
s
hard
to
know
who
exactly
you
be
without
this
attachment
and
title
and
role
that
have
define
you
for
so
long
i
felt
deeply
for
him
but
i
knew
there
be
little
i
could
do
to
make
it
easy
for
him
three
day
later
on
monday
october
i
officially
become
the
sixth
ceo
of
the
walt
disney
company
for
the
first
time
in
my
career
i
be
reporting
only
to
a
board
of
director
and
after
the
long
succession
process
and
the
six
month
wait
period
i
be
about
to
preside
over
my
first
board
meeting
in
advance
of
most
board
meeting
i
ve
ask
all
of
my
business
head
for
an
update
on
their
business
so
that
i
could
inform
the
board
on
business
performance
important
issue
and
challenge
and
opportunity
for
my
first
meeting
though
there
be
only
one
item
on
my
list
in
advance
of
the
meeting
i
ask
our
studio
head
dick
cook
and
his
number
two
alan
bergman
to
put
together
a
presentation
cover
the
last
ten
year
of
disney
animation
every
film
we
d
release
what
they
d
each
earn
at
the
box
office
and
so
on
they
be
both
concerned
it
s
go
to
be
ugly
dick
say
the
number
be
horrible
alan
add
it
s
probably
not
the
best
way
for
you
to
start
out
regardless
of
how
dispirit
or
even
incendiary
the
presentation
be
go
to
be
i
told
the
studio
team
not
to
worry
about
it
i
then
ask
tom
staggs
and
kevin
mayer
to
do
some
research
on
how
our
most
important
demographic
mother
with
child
under
age
twelve
view
disney
animation
versus
our
competitor
kevin
too
say
that
the
story
wasn
t
go
to
be
a
good
one
that
s
fine
i
told
him
i
just
want
a
candid
assessment
of
where
we
stand
all
of
this
be
in
the
service
of
a
radical
idea
which
i
hadn
t
share
with
anyone
but
tom
a
week
earlier
i
d
say
to
him
what
do
you
think
about
us
buying
pixar
he
thought
i
be
joking
at
first
when
i
told
him
i
be
serious
he
say
steve
will
never
sell
to
us
even
if
he
would
it
won
t
be
at
a
price
we
could
support
or
that
the
board
would
support
he
be
probably
right
but
i
want
to
make
the
case
to
the
board
anyway
and
to
do
so
i
need
a
blunt
detailed
presentation
about
the
current
state
of
disney
animation
tom
be
hesitant
in
part
because
he
be
protective
of
me
and
in
part
because
as
cfo
he
have
a
responsibility
to
the
board
and
our
shareholder
which
meant
not
always
go
along
with
whatever
the
ceo
have
in
mind


my
first
board
meeting
as
ceo
be
an
even
meeting
and
i
and
the
ten
other
board
member
take
our
place
around
the
long
conference
table
in
our
boardroom
i
could
sense
the
anticipation
in
the
air
for
me
it
be
one
of
the
most
momentous
meeting
of
my
life
for
them
they
be
hearing
from
a
new
ceo
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
two
decade
the
board
have
be
through
a
lot
in
the
last
decade
the
painful
decision
to
bring
michael
s
tenure
to
an
end
the
ongoing
fight
with
roy
and
stanley
the
hostile
takeover
attempt
by
comcast
the
shareholder
lawsuit
over
michael
ovitz
s
million
plus
severance
deal
a
legal
fight
with
jeffrey
katzenberg
over
the
condition
of
his
exit
in
the
list
go
on
they
have
be
subject
to
a
lot
of
criticism
and
along
with
me
they
d
be
put
under
a
microscope
as
the
succession
and
transition
unfolded
it
be
a
highly
charge
environment
because
they
would
soon
be
judged
on
their
decision
to
give
me
the
job
and
they
knew
there
be
still
plenty
of
skeptic
some
of
them
two
or
three
though
i
ll
never
be
exactly
sure
who
have
be
oppose
to
my
appointment
altogether
right
to
the
very
end
so
i
step
into
that
room
know
that
even
though
the
vote
have
ultimately
be
unanimous
there
be
people
seat
at
the
table
who
didn
t
expect
or
want
me
to
be
there
for
long
george
mitchell
open
the
meeting
with
a
quick
heartfelt
comment
about
the
significance
of
the
moment
he
congratulate
me
for
endure
the
process
as
he
put
it
and
then
turn
the
floor
over
to
me
i
be
so
fill
with
restless
energy
and
a
desire
to
get
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
right
away
that
i
skip
over
the
pleasantry
and
immediately
say
as
you
all
know
disney
animation
be
a
real
mess
they
d
heard
this
before
but
i
knew
that
the
reality
be
far
bad
than
any
of
them
be
aware
before
present
the
financials
and
the
brand
research
we
d
prepared
i
recall
a
moment
from
just
a
few
week
earlier
at
the
opening
of
hong
kong
disneyland
it
be
the
last
big
event
michael
preside
over
as
ceo
and
several
of
us
have
travel
to
hong
kong
for
the
opening
ceremony
which
take
place
on
a
blinding
degree
afternoon
tom
staggs
dick
cook
and
i
be
stand
together
as
the
opening
parade
come
down
main
street
float
after
float
pass
by
us
there
be
float
carry
character
from
walt
s
legendary
film
snow
white
cinderella
peter
pan
and
so
on
and
others
with
character
from
the
big
hit
of
michael
s
first
decade
the
little
mermaid
beauty
and
the
beast
aladdin
and
the
lion
king
and
there
be
float
with
character
from
the
pixar
film
toy
story
and
monster
inc
and
find
nemo
i
turn
to
tom
and
dick
and
ask
do
you
guy
notice
anything
about
this
parade
nothing
stood
out
to
them
there
be
barely
any
disney
character
from
the
last
ten
year
i
say
we
could
spend
month
analyze
what
have
go
wrong
but
there
it
be
right
in
front
of
us
the
movie
weren
t
good
which
meant
the
character
weren
t
popular
or
memorable
and
that
have
significant
ramification
for
our
business
and
our
brand
disney
be
found
on
creativity
inventive
storytelling
and
great
animation
and
very
little
of
our
recent
film
live
up
to
our
storied
past
i
finish
describe
that
scene
to
the
board
and
then
turn
down
the
light
the
room
get
quiet
as
we
project
onto
a
screen
the
list
of
film
put
out
by
disney
animation
over
the
last
decade
the
hunchback
of
notre
dame
hercules
mulan
tarzan
fantasia
dinosaur
the
emperor
s
new
groove
atlantis
lilo
and
stitch
treasure
planet
brother
bear
and
home
on
the
range
some
be
mild
commercial
success
several
be
catastrophe
none
have
be
met
with
any
critical
exuberance
over
that
stretch
animation
have
lose
nearly
million
we
d
spent
well
over
a
billion
dollar
make
those
film
and
market
them
aggressively
and
yet
we
have
little
to
show
for
the
investment
over
that
same
stretch
of
time
pixar
have
produce
success
after
success
both
creatively
and
commercially
technologically
they
be
do
thing
with
digital
animation
that
we
disney
have
only
dabble
in
more
profoundly
they
be
connect
in
powerful
way
to
both
parent
and
kid
after
painting
that
bleak
financial
picture
i
ask
tom
to
present
the
result
of
our
brand
research
among
woman
with
child
under
twelve
pixar
have
eclipse
disney
as
a
brand
mother
thought
of
as
good
for
their
family
in
a
head
to
head
comparison
pixar
be
far
more
beloved
it
wasn
t
even
close
i
notice
a
few
board
member
murmur
to
each
other
and
sense
some
anger
start
to
build
the
board
knew
animation
have
be
struggle
and
they
certainly
knew
pixar
be
on
a
tear
but
the
reality
have
never
be
present
to
them
this
starkly
they
have
no
idea
the
number
be
this
bad
and
they
d
never
contemplate
the
brand
research
when
i
be
do
a
couple
of
them
pounce
gary
wilson
who
d
be
my
most
ardent
opponent
during
the
search
say
you
be
the
coo
for
five
of
those
year
aren
t
you
accountable
for
this
there
be
nothing
to
be
gain
from
be
defensive
disney
and
michael
deserve
a
lot
of
credit
for
create
a
relationship
with
pixar
in
the
first
place
i
say
it
wasn
t
always
an
easy
collaboration
but
great
thing
come
from
it
i
say
that
after
the
acquisition
of
abc
the
company
become
more
challenge
to
manage
and
animation
receive
less
attention
than
it
should
have
this
problem
be
exacerbate
by
the
revolve
door
at
our
studio
of
senior
executive
none
of
whom
have
do
a
particularly
good
job
run
the
unit
i
then
reiterate
what
i
d
say
many
time
throughout
the
succession
process
this
can
t
be
about
the
past
there
s
nothing
we
can
do
about
bad
creative
decision
that
be
make
and
disappoint
film
that
be
release
but
there
s
a
lot
we
can
do
to
change
the
future
and
we
need
to
start
now
i
point
out
to
the
board
that
as
animation
go
so
go
the
company
in
so
many
respect
disney
animation
be
the
brand
it
be
the
fuel
that
power
many
of
our
other
business
include
consumer
product
television
and
theme
park
and
over
the
last
ten
year
the
brand
have
suffer
a
lot
the
company
be
much
small
then
before
pixar
marvel
and
lucasfilm
be
acquire
so
the
pressure
on
animation
to
perform
not
only
on
behalf
of
the
brand
but
to
enhance
almost
all
of
our
business
be
far
more
intense
i
feel
enormous
pressure
to
figure
this
out
i
say
i
knew
that
shareholder
and
analyst
be
not
go
to
give
me
a
grace
period
and
the
first
thing
they
would
judge
me
on
be
my
ability
to
turn
disney
animation
around
the
drum
be
already
beating
loudly
for
me
to
solve
this
problem
i
then
described
what
i
saw
as
three
possible
path
forward
the
first
be
to
stick
with
current
management
and
see
if
they
could
turn
thing
around
i
quickly
express
my
doubt
about
this
option
give
what
they
d
deliver
so
far
the
second
be
to
identify
new
talent
to
run
the
division
but
in
the
six
month
since
be
name
i
d
scour
the
animation
and
moviemaking
world
look
for
people
who
could
do
the
job
at
the
level
we
need
and
i
d
come
up
empty
or
i
say
we
could
buy
pixar
the
response
to
the
idea
be
so
explosive
that
if
i
be
hold
a
gavel
i
would
have
use
it
to
bring
the
court
to
order
i
don
t
know
if
they
re
for
sale
i
say
if
they
be
i
m
certain
they
ll
be
wildly
expensive
as
a
public
company
pixar
s
market
cap
be
somewhere
above
billion
and
steve
job
own
half
of
the
company
s
stock
it
s
also
highly
unlikely
steve
would
ever
want
to
sell
all
of
that
seem
to
bring
relief
to
a
few
member
but
it
provoke
others
toward
a
lengthy
discussion
about
whether
there
be
any
circumstance
that
would
justify
our
spending
billion
of
dollar
to
buy
them
buying
pixar
would
allow
us
to
bring
john
lasseter
and
ed
catmull
pixar
s
visionary
leader
along
with
steve
job
into
disney
i
say
they
could
continue
to
run
pixar
while
simultaneously
revitalize
disney
animation
why
can
t
we
just
hire
them
somebody
ask
for
one
john
lasseter
be
under
contract
at
pixar
i
say
but
they
re
also
wed
to
steve
and
to
what
they
ve
built
there
their
loyalty
to
pixar
to
its
people
and
its
mission
be
enormous
it
s
na
ve
to
think
we
could
hire
them
another
member
suggest
that
we
just
need
to
back
a
truck
fill
with
money
up
to
their
door
these
people
can
t
be
bought
that
way
i
say
they
re
different
i
immediately
sought
out
tom
and
dick
after
the
meeting
to
get
their
impression
of
how
the
presentation
have
go
we
didn
t
think
you
d
get
out
of
there
with
your
title
intact
tom
say
he
sound
as
though
he
be
kid
but
deep
down
i
knew
he
wasn
t
when
i
get
home
that
night
i
walk
into
the
house
and
willow
ask
how
it
go
i
hadn
t
told
even
her
what
i
d
be
planning
i
told
them
i
thought
we
should
buy
pixar
i
say
she
too
look
at
me
like
i
be
crazy
and
then
add
to
the
chorus
say
steve
will
never
sell
to
you
but
then
she
remind
me
of
something
she
d
told
me
not
long
after
i
get
the
job
the
average
tenure
for
a
fortune
ceo
be
less
than
four
year
at
the
time
it
be
a
joke
between
us
to
make
sure
the
expectation
i
set
for
myself
be
realistic
now
though
she
say
it
with
a
tone
that
imply
i
have
little
to
lose
by
act
fast
be
bold
be
the
essence
of
her
advice
as
for
the
board
some
be
vehemently
against
the
idea
and
make
that
very
clear
but
enough
be
intrigue
that
they
give
me
what
i
described
as
a
yellow
light
go
ahead
explore
the
idea
but
proceed
cautiously
collectively
they
conclude
it
be
so
unlikely
to
ever
happen
that
they
might
as
well
let
us
amuse
ourselves
by
explore
it
the
next
morning
i
told
tom
to
start
put
together
a
thorough
analysis
of
the
financials
though
i
also
say
there
be
no
rush
i
be
planning
to
broach
the
idea
with
steve
later
that
day
and
i
figure
there
be
a
good
chance
that
in
a
matter
of
hour
the
whole
thing
would
be
moot
i
spent
the
morning
building
up
the
courage
to
make
the
call
and
finally
do
so
in
the
early
afternoon
i
didn
t
reach
him
which
be
a
relief
but
as
i
be
drive
home
from
the
office
at
around
six
thirty
he
return
my
call
this
be
about
a
week
and
a
half
before
our
announcement
about
the
video
ipod
so
we
spent
a
couple
of
minute
talk
about
that
before
i
say
hey
i
have
another
crazy
idea
can
i
come
see
you
in
a
day
or
two
to
discus
it
i
didn
t
yet
fully
appreciate
just
how
much
steve
like
radical
idea
tell
me
now
he
say
while
still
on
the
phone
i
pull
into
my
driveway
it
be
a
warm
october
even
and
i
turn
the
engine
off
and
the
combination
of
heat
and
nerve
cause
me
to
break
out
in
a
sweat
i
remind
myself
of
willow
s
advice
be
bold
steve
would
likely
say
no
immediately
he
might
also
be
offend
at
what
he
perceive
as
the
arrogance
of
the
idea
how
dare
i
think
pixar
be
something
disney
could
just
come
along
and
buy
even
if
he
told
me
where
i
could
shove
it
though
the
call
would
end
and
i
d
be
left
exactly
where
i
already
be
i
have
nothing
to
lose
i
ve
be
think
about
our
respective
future
i
say
what
do
you
think
about
the
idea
of
disney
buying
pixar
i
wait
for
him
to
hang
up
or
to
erupt
in
laughter
the
quiet
before
his
response
seem
endless
instead
he
say
you
know
that
s
not
the
craziest
idea
in
the
world
i
d
so
brace
myself
for
rejection
that
now
even
though
i
knew
rationally
that
there
be
a
million
more
hurdle
between
this
moment
and
ever
bring
this
idea
to
fruition
i
felt
a
rush
of
adrenaline
that
it
be
even
a
possibility
okay
i
say
great
when
can
we
talk
more


people
sometimes
shy
away
from
take
big
swing
because
they
ass
the
odds
and
build
a
case
against
try
something
before
they
even
take
the
first
step
one
of
the
thing
i
ve
always
instinctively
felt
and
something
that
be
greatly
reinforce
work
for
people
like
roone
and
michael
be
that
long
shot
aren
t
usually
as
long
as
they
seem
roone
and
michael
both
believe
in
their
own
power
and
in
the
ability
of
their
organization
to
make
thing
happen
that
with
enough
energy
and
thoughtfulness
and
commitment
even
the
boldest
idea
could
be
execute
i
try
to
adopt
that
mindset
in
my
ensue
conversation
with
steve
a
couple
of
week
after
that
call
in
my
driveway
he
and
i
met
in
apple
s
boardroom
in
cupertino
california
it
be
a
long
room
with
a
table
nearly
as
long
down
the
middle
one
wall
be
glass
look
out
over
the
entrance
to
apple
campus
and
the
other
feature
a
whiteboard
probably
twenty
five
foot
long
steve
say
he
love
whiteboard
exercise
where
an
entire
vision
all
the
thought
and
design
and
calculation
could
be
drawn
out
at
the
whim
of
whoever
held
the
felt
pen
not
unexpectedly
steve
be
the
holder
of
the
pen
and
i
sense
he
be
quite
use
to
assume
that
role
he
stood
with
marker
in
hand
and
scrawl
pro
on
one
side
and
con
on
the
other
you
start
he
say
get
any
pro
i
be
too
nervous
to
launch
in
so
i
cede
the
first
serve
to
him
okay
he
say
well
i
ve
get
some
con
he
write
the
first
with
gusto
disney
s
culture
will
destroy
pixar
i
couldn
t
blame
him
for
that
his
experience
with
disney
so
far
hadn
t
provide
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
he
go
on
write
his
con
in
full
sentence
across
the
board
fix
disney
animation
will
take
too
long
and
will
burn
john
and
ed
out
in
the
process
there
s
too
much
ill
will
and
the
heal
will
take
year
wall
street
will
hate
it
your
board
will
never
let
you
do
it
pixar
will
reject
disney
as
an
owner
as
a
body
reject
a
donate
organ
there
be
many
more
but
one
in
all
cap
letter
distraction
will
kill
pixar
s
creativity
i
assume
he
meant
that
the
whole
process
of
a
deal
and
the
assimilation
would
be
too
much
of
a
shock
to
the
system
they
d
create
a
few
year
later
steve
would
propose
shut
down
disney
animation
completely
and
just
make
animate
film
at
pixar
even
john
lasseter
and
ed
catmull
hat
the
idea
and
i
reject
it
it
seem
pointless
for
me
to
add
to
his
list
so
we
move
to
the
pro
i
go
first
and
say
disney
will
be
save
by
pixar
and
we
ll
all
live
happily
ever
after
steve
smile
but
didn
t
write
it
down
what
do
you
mean
i
say
turn
animation
around
will
totally
change
the
perception
of
disney
and
shift
our
fortune
plus
john
and
ed
will
have
a
much
large
canvas
to
paint
on
two
hour
later
the
pro
be
meager
and
the
con
be
abundant
even
if
a
few
of
them
in
my
estimation
be
quite
petty
i
felt
dispirit
but
i
should
have
expect
this
well
i
say
it
be
a
nice
idea
but
i
don
t
see
how
we
do
this
a
few
solid
pro
be
more
powerful
than
dozen
of
con
steve
say
so
what
should
we
do
next
another
lesson
steve
be
great
at
weigh
all
side
of
an
issue
and
not
allow
negative
to
drown
out
positive
particularly
for
thing
he
want
to
accomplish
it
be
a
powerful
quality
of
his
steve
die
six
year
later
i
join
the
apple
board
not
long
after
his
death
every
time
i
go
to
a
meeting
there
and
look
at
that
gigantic
whiteboard
i
saw
steve
intense
energetic
engage
and
far
more
open
to
the
possibility
of
make
this
idea
and
i
suspect
many
idea
work
i
need
to
visit
pixar
i
say
i
d
never
be
there
and
toward
the
end
of
our
contract
thing
have
gotten
so
bad
there
be
so
little
collaboration
that
we
didn
t
even
know
what
they
be
work
on
there
be
one
last
film
for
us
to
distribute
car
but
no
one
at
disney
have
even
see
it
we
d
heard
they
be
work
on
a
film
about
rat
in
the
kitchen
of
a
paris
restaurant
which
people
at
disney
have
scoffed
at
communication
have
completely
cease
as
each
company
prepared
for
the
final
separation
if
i
be
go
to
make
the
case
for
buying
them
though
i
need
to
know
a
lot
more
about
how
they
work
i
want
to
meet
the
key
people
learn
about
their
project
and
get
a
sense
of
the
company
s
culture
what
do
it
feel
like
there
what
do
they
do
differently
from
us
that
lead
them
to
consistently
create
brilliance
steve
immediately
agree
to
the
visit
he
explain
to
john
and
ed
that
we
d
talk
and
while
he
d
commit
to
nothing
and
wouldn
t
commit
to
anything
without
their
be
on
board
he
thought
it
be
worth
their
while
to
show
me
around
the
place
the
follow
week
i
show
up
at
the
pixar
campus
in
emeryville
alone
john
s
assistant
greet
me
in
the
lobby
and
lead
me
into
their
cavernous
atrium
which
steve
have
help
design
din
area
stretch
along
both
side
and
at
the
far
end
be
the
main
entrance
to
their
theater
there
be
people
milling
about
and
convene
in
small
group
in
a
way
that
remind
me
more
of

vibrant
with
creative
energy
everyone
seem
happy
to
be
there
if
i
have
to
name
the
ten
best
day
i
ve
ever
have
on
the
job
that
first
visit
to
the
pixar
campus
would
be
high
on
the
list
john
and
ed
welcome
me
warmly
and
explain
that
i
would
spend
the
first
half
of
the
day
meeting
with
every
director
and
they
would
show
me
element
of

be
work
on
rough
cut
of
scene
storyboards
concept
art
original
score
and
cast
list
then
i
would
see
their
new
technology
pipeline
and
get
a
sense
of
how
the
tech
side
and
the
creative
side
work
together
john
be
up
first
he
show
me
a
virtually
finish
cut
of
car
and
i
sat
there
in
the
theater
mesmerize
by
the
quality
of
the
animation
and
by
how
far
the
technology
have
advanced
since
their
last
release
i
remember
be
awed
by
the
way
the
light
reflect
off
the
metallic
paint
on
the
race

work
in
progress
the
scorn
rat

me

most
thematically
sophisticated

narratively
original

i
then
spent
a
few
hour
with
ed
catmull
and
the
engineer
on
the
tech
side
who
described
in
detail
the
technological
platform
that
serve
the
whole
creative
enterprise
i
saw
firsthand
what
john
described
when
he
d
welcome
me
into
the
building
that
morning
he
say
the
animator
and
director
be
constantly
challenge
the
engineer
to
give
them
the
tool
with
which
they
could
fulfill
their
creative
dream
to
make
paris
feel
like
paris
for
instance
and
ed
and
his
team
on
the
engineering
side
be
always
building
tool
on
their
own
which
they
then
brought
to
the
artist
to
inspire
them
to
think
in
way
they
hadn
t
before
look
at
how
we
can
make
snow
or
water
or
mist
ed
show
me
the
most
sophisticated
animation
tool
ever
invent
technological
ingenuity
that
enable
creativity
at
its
high
form
this
yin
and
yang
be
the
soul
of
pixar
everything
flow
from
it
i
get
into
my
car
in
the
pixar
parking
lot
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
immediately
begin
scribble
note
then
i
call
tom
staggs
and
say
i
have
to
come
see
him
as
soon
as
i
land
in
l
a
i
have
no
idea
if
the
board
would
go
for
it
and
i
knew
that
steve
could
change
his
mind
on
a
whim
but
i
felt
breathless
as
i
described
to
tom
the
level
of
talent
and
creative
ambition
the
commitment
to
quality
the
storytelling
ingenuity
the
technology
the
leadership
structure
and
the
air
of
enthusiastic
collaboration
even
the
building
the
architecture
itself
it
be
a
culture
that
anyone
in
a
creative
business
in
any
business
would
aspire
to
and
it
be
so
far
beyond
where
we
be
and
beyond
anything
we
might
be
able
to
achieve
on
our
own
that
i
felt
we
have
to
do
all
we
could
to
make
this
happen
when
i
get
back
to
my
office
in
burbank
i
met
immediately
with
my
team
it
s
an
understatement
to
say
they
didn
t
share
my
enthusiasm
i
d
be
the
only
one
to
see
firsthand
what
the
essence
of
pixar
be
and
to
them
the
idea
be
still
too
impractical
there
be
too
many
risk
they
say
the
cost
would
be
too
great
they
worried
that
i
be
barely
into
my
tenure
as
ceo
and
i
be
already
put
my
future
not
to
mention
the
company
s
future
on
the
line
by
pursue
this
this
would
be
a
recur
theme
in
nearly
every
discussion
i
have
about
pixar
i
be
told
over
and
over
that
it
be
too
risky
and
ill
advise
many
people
thought
steve
would
be
impossible
to
deal
with
and
would
try
to
run
the
company
i
be
also
told
that
a
brand
new
ceo
shouldn
t
be
try
to
make
huge
acquisition
i
be
crazy
as
one
of
our
investment
banker
put
it
because
the
number
would
never
work
out
and
this
be
an
impossible
sale
to
the
street
the
banker
have
a
point
it
s
true
that
on
paper
the
deal
didn
t
make
obvious
sense
but
i
felt
certain
that
this
level
of
ingenuity
be
worth
more
than
any
of
us
understood
or
could
calculate
at
the
time
it
s
perhaps
not
the
most
responsible
advice
in
a
book
like
this
to
say
that
leader
should
just
go
out
there
and
trust
their
gut
because
it
might
be
interpret
as
endorse
impulsivity
over
thoughtfulness
gamble
rather
than
careful
study
as
with
everything
the
key
be
awareness
take
it
all
in
and
weigh
every
factor
your
own
motivation
what
the
people
you
trust
be
say
what
careful
study
and
analysis
tell
you
and
then
what
analysis
can
t
tell
you
you
carefully
consider
all
of
these
factor
understand
that
no
two
circumstance
be
alike
and
then
if
you
re
in
charge
it
still
ultimately
come
down
to
instinct
be
this
right
or
isn
t
it
nothing
be
a
sure
thing
but
you
need
at
the
very
least
to
be
willing
to
take
big
risk
you
can
t
have
big
win
without
them
my
instinct
about
pixar
be
powerful
i
believe
this
acquisition
could
transform
us
it
could
fix
disney
animation
it
could
add
steve
job
arguably
the
strong
possible
voice
on
issue
of
technology
to
the
disney
board
it
could
bring
a
culture
of
excellence
and
ambition
into
ours
that
would
reverberate
in
much
need
way
throughout
the
company
ultimately
the
board
could
say
no
but
i
couldn
t
let
go
of
this
out
of
fear
i
told
my
team
that
i
respect
their
opinion
and
i
knew
they
be
look
out
for
me
which
i
appreciate
but
i
thought
we
have
to
do
this
at
the
very
least
i
have
to
exhaust
every
possible
way
of
make
it
happen
before
i
give
in
i
call
steve
the
day
after
my
visit
to
emeryville
before
i
dial
i
told
myself
that
i
should
try
to
contain
my
enthusiasm
i
need
to
offer
praise
because
steve
s
pride
in
pixar
be
enormous
but
this
might
be
the
begin
of
a
real
negotiation
and
i
didn
t
want
him
to
feel
that
i
be
so
desperate
for
what
they
have
that
he
could
ask
for
the
moon
the
moment
i
get
steve
on
the
phone
any
semblance
of
a
poker
face
collapse
i
couldn
t
pretend
i
felt
anything
other
than
pure
enthusiasm
i
described
the
day
to
him
from
begin
to
end
and
hop
that
my
honesty
would
ultimately
serve
me
well
than
any
shrewd
pretense
anyway
it
could
have
seem
like
a
weakness
if
you
show
that
you
want
something
so
badly
you
ll
be
make
to
pay
but
in
this
case
the
genuine
enthusiasm
work
i
end
by
say
as
if
it
wasn
t
already
clear
that
i
really
want
to
try
to
make
this
happen
steve
told
me
he
would
seriously
consider
it
only
if
john
and
ed
be
on
board
after
we
talk
he
contact
them
to
say
that
he
be
open
to
a
negotiation
and
to
promise
them
that
he
would
never
make
a
deal
without
their
blessing
we
plan
that
i
would
meet
with
each
of
them
again
so
i
could
explain
in
more
detail
what
i
be
imagine
and
could
field
any
question
they
have
then
they
would
decide
if
they
be
interested
in
go
forward
with
a
negotiation
a
few
day
later
i
flew
up
to
the
bay
area
to
have
dinner
with
john
and
his
wife
nancy
at
their
home
in
sonoma
we
have
a
long
pleasant
conversation
and
immediate
chemistry
i
give
them
an
overview
of
my
career
the
wide
world
of
sport
day
and
the
experience
of
be
acquire
by
capital
city
the
year
program
abc
prime
time
and
finally
the
disney
takeover
and
the
long
road
to
become
ceo
john
talk
about
his
day
work
at
disney
animation
more
than
two
decade
earlier
before
the
michael
era
he
be
let
go
when
the
power
that
be
felt
there
wasn
t
a
future
in
computer
animation
i
know
what
it
s
like
to
be
take
over
by
another
company
i
told
him
even
in
the
best
of
circumstance
the
merger
process
be
delicate
you
can
t
just
force
assimilation
and
you
definitely
can
t
with
a
company
like
yours
i
say
that
even
if
it
isn
t
purposeful
the
buyer
often
destroys
the
culture
of
the
company
it
s
buying
and
that
destroys
value
a
lot
of
company
acquire
others
without
much
sensitivity
regard
what
they
re
really
buying
they
think
they
re
get
physical
asset
or
manufacturing
asset
or
intellectual
property
in
some
industry
that
s
more
true
than
in
others
in
most
case
what
they
re
really
acquire
be
people
in
a
creative
business
that
s
where
the
value
truly
lie
i
take
pain
to
assure
john
that
the
only
way
it
make
sense
for
disney
to
buy
pixar
be
if
we
protect
whatever
it
be
that
make
their
culture
so
unique
bring
pixar
into
our
company
would
be
a
mammoth
transfusion
of
leadership
and
talent
and
we
d
need
to
do
it
right
pixar
need
to
be
pixar
i
say
if
we
don
t
protect
the
culture
you
ve
create
we
ll
be
destroy
the
thing
that
make
you
valuable
john
say
he
be
happy
to
hear
that
and
then
i
drop
my
grand
plan
on
him
i
d
want
you
and
ed
to
run
disney
animation
too
all
these
year
later
john
say
he
be
still
smart
at
have
be
fire
from
disney
but
his
respect
for
the
heritage
of
disney
animation
be
powerful
just
as
i
have
an
impossible
time
hiding
my
enthusiasm
from
steve
john
have
an
equally
impossible
time
hiding
his
at
the
thought
of
run
disney
animation
well
that
would
be
a
dream
he
say
a
few
day
later
ed
catmull
flew
down
to
meet
with
me
in
burbank
we
have
dinner
at
a
steakhouse
near
the
disney
lot
though
neither
of
us
ate
meat
as
with
john
i
take
pain
to
explain
to
ed
my
philosophy
about
acquisition
that
the
culture
they
d
built
be
central
to
the
magic
they
be
able
to
create
and
that
i
have
zero
interest
in
force
them
to
be
anything
other
than
what
they
already
be
i
also
talk
about
the
other
opportunity
that
be
on
the
table
that
i
want
john
and
him
to
revitalize
disney
animation
if
john
be
all
emotion
and
extroversion
ed
be
the
photographic
negative
he
be
a
quiet
thoughtful
introvert
doctor
of
computer
science
who
invent
much
of
the
technology
that
make
pixar
s
digital
animation
possible
we
be
far
behind
pixar
technologically
but
there
be
other
tech
resource
in
other
part
of
disney
that
ed
be
interested
in
get
his
hand
on
in
his
understated
way
he
say
it
would
be
excite
to
see
what
we
could
do
here
steve
call
the
next
day
to
say
that
john
and
ed
have
give
him
the
go
ahead
to
negotiate
with
me
and
not
long
after
that
i
have
my
second
meeting
with
the
disney
board
this
time
in
new
york
i
told
them
about
the
visit
to
pixar
and
the
meeting
with
john
and
ed
and
that
steve
be
willing
to
negotiate
tom
staggs
who
still
have
some
misgiving
give
a
presentation
on
the
potential
economics
of
an
acquisition
include
the
question
of
issue
more
share
and
the
potential
dilution
of
disney
stock
and
his
best
guess
as
to
how
the
investment
community
would
react
which
be
mixed
to
fairly
negative
at
best
the
board
listen
intently
and
while
they
remain
largely
skeptical
by
meeting
s
end
they
give
us
permission
to
negotiate
with
steve
and
come
back
with
something
more
specific
for
them
to
consider
tom
and
i
flew
straight
from
our
board
meeting
to
san
jose
and
met
with
steve
at
apple
s
headquarters
the
next
day
i
knew
go
in
that
i
didn
t
want
the
process
to
be
drawn
out
steve
be
constitutionally
incapable
of
a
long
complicate
back
and
forth
the
prolong
acrimonious
negotiation
with
michael
be
still
fresh
in
his
memory
he
be
already
averse
to
the
way
disney
make
deal
and
i
fear
that
if
we
get
bogged
down
on
any
one
point
he
would
sour
on
the
whole
thing
and
walk
away
so
as
soon
as
we
sat
down
i
say
i
ll
be
straight
with
you
this
be
something
i
feel
we
have
to
do
steve
agree
that
we
need
this
but
unlike
in
the
past
he
didn
t
use
his
leverage
to
demand
a
wildly
impossible
number
wherever
we
land
be
go
to
be
very
good
for
them
but
he
knew
it
need
to
be
in
the
realm
of
possibility
for
us
too
and
i
think
he
appreciate
my
frankness
over
the
course
of
the
next
month
tom
and
steve
go
over
the
possible
financial
structure
in
great
detail
and
arrive
at
a
price
billion
it
be
an
all
stock
deal
disney
share
for
each
pixar
share
and
net
out
to
billion
because
pixar
have
billion
in
cash
even
if
steve
stop
just
short
of
be
greedy
it
be
still
a
huge
price
and
it
be
go
to
be
a
tough
sell
to
our
board
and
to
investor
we
also
negotiate
what
we
call
a
social
compact
a
two
page
list
of
culturally
significant
issue
and
item
that
we
promise
to
preserve
they
want
to
feel
that
they
be
still
pixar
and
everything
related
to
protect
that
feel
matter
their
email
address
would
remain
pixar
address
the
sign
on
their
building
would
still
say
pixar
they
could
keep
their
ritual
for
welcome
new
employee
and
their
tradition
of
monthly
beer
blast
a
much
more
sensitive
negotiation
take
place
over
the
branding
on
film
merchandise
and
theme
park
attraction
our
research
show
that
pixar
have
eclipse
disney
as
a
brand
a
fact
that
they
be
well
aware
of
but
i
felt
that
over
time
the
strong
branding
for
the
pixar
film
especially
since
john
and
ed
would
now
be
run
disney
animation
would
be
disney
pixar
ultimately
that
s
what
we
settle
on
pixar
s
famous
luxo
junior
animation
would
still
open
each
of
their
film
but
it
would
be
precede
by
the
disney
castle
animation


the
challenge
before
me
now
be
convincing
our
board
i
realize
my
best
shot
be
for
them
to
meet
and
hear
from
steve
and
john
and
ed
directly
no
one
could
sell
this
well
than
the
three
of
them
so
on
a
weekend
in
january
we
all
convene
in
a
goldman
sachs
conference
room
in
l
a
several
member
of
the
board
be
still
oppose
to
a
deal
but
the
moment
steve
john
and
ed
start
talk
everyone
in
the
room
be
transfixed
they
have
no
note
no
deck
no
visual
aid
they
just
talk
about
pixar
s
philosophy
and
how
they
work
about
what
we
be
already
dream
of
do
together
and
about
who
they
be
as
people
john
spoke
with
passion
about
his
lifelong
love
of
disney
and
his
desire
to
return
disney
animation
to
its
former
glory
ed
give
a
cerebral
fascinate
dissertation
about
where
technology
be
head
and
what
might
be
possible
for
both
disney
and
pixar
as
for
steve
it
s
hard
to
imagine
a
well
salesman
for
something
this
ambitious
he
talk
about
the
need
for
big
company
to
take
big
risk
he
talk
about
where
disney
have
be
and
what
it
need
to
do
to
radically
change
course
he
talk
about
me
and
the
bond
that
we
d
form
already
with
the
itunes
deal
but
also
in
the
ongoing
discussion
about
preserve
pixar
s
culture
and
his
desire
to
work
together
to
make
this
crazy
idea
a
success
for
the
first
time
watch
him
speak
i
felt
optimistic
that
it
might
happen
the
board
be
schedule
to
meet
for
a
final
vote
on
january
but
word
of
a
possible
deal
soon
leak
out
suddenly
i
be
receive
call
from
people
urge
me
not
to
do
it
among
them
be
michael
eisner
bob
you
can
t
do
this
he
say
it
s
the
stupidest
thing
in
the
world
it
be
the
same
list
of
concern
it
be
too
expensive
too
risky
bring
steve
into
the
company
would
be
a
disaster
you
can
fix
animation
michael
say
you
don
t
need
them
to
do
it
they
re
one
failure
away
from
be
an
average
performer
he
even
call
warren
buffett
think
that
if
warren
thought
it
be
a
dumb
investment
he
would
be
able
to
sway
the
people
he
knew
on
the
disney
board
warren
didn
t
weigh
in
so
michael
call
tom
murphy
to
see
if
he
would
say
something
and
then
he
reach
out
to
george
mitchell
and
ask
if
he
could
address
the
board
directly
himself
george
call
me
and
told
me
about
the
request
george
i
say
you
re
not
go
to
let
him
do
it
be
you
at
this
point
michael
have
be
out
of
the
company
for
four
month
his
connection
with
disney
have
end
on
his
last
day
at
work
i
knew
it
be
difficult
for
michael
but
i
be
offend
by
his
meddling
it
be
something
he
would
never
have
tolerate
when
he
be
ceo
it
s
cheap
george
say
just
let
it
happen
we
show
him
respect
we
hear
him
out
then
you
make
your
case
this
be
quintessential
george
after
year
in
the
senate
include
a
stint
as
majority
leader
and
after
help
to
broker
peace
in
northern
ireland
he
be
the
consummate
statesman
he
genuinely
felt
michael
deserve
the
respect
but
he
also
knew
michael
could
be
a
rogue
element
here
influence
the
board
from
outside
and
it
be
well
to
let
him
come
in
and
talk
give
me
the
chance
to
immediately
issue
a
rebuttal
in
the
same
room
it
s
the
only
thing
george
ever
do
as
chairman
that
rankle
me
but
there
be
nothing
i
could
do
but
trust
in
his
instinct
on
the
day
the
board
be
set
to
vote
michael
come
in
and
make
his
case
it
be
the
same
one
he
d
make
with
me
the
price
tag
be
too
high
steve
be
difficult
and
imperious
and
would
demand
control
animation
be
not
beyond
repair
he
look
at
me
and
say
bob
can
fix
animation
i
say
michael
you
couldn
t
fix
it
and
now
you
re
tell
me
that
i
can
before
the
meeting
george
come
into
my
office
and
say
look
i
think
you
re
go
to
get
this
but
it
s
not
a
do
deal
you
have
to
go
in
there
and
pitch
your
heart
out
you
have
to
do
the
equivalent
of
pound
your
fist
on
the
table
show
your
passion
demand
their
support
i
thought
i
d
already
do
all
that
i
say
you
have
to
do
it
one
more
time
i
enter
the
boardroom
on
a
mission
i
even
take
a
moment
before
i
walk
into
the
room
to
look
again
at
theodore
roosevelt
s
the
man
in
the
arena
speech
which
have
long
be
an
inspiration
it
be
not
the
critic
who
count
not
the
man
who
point
out
how
the
strong
man
stumble
or
where
the
doer
of
deed
could
have
do
them
well
the
credit
belongs
to
the
man
who
be
actually
in
the
arena
whose
face
be
mar
by
dust
and
sweat
and
blood
my
face
wasn
t
quite
mar
by
dust
and
sweat
and
blood
and
the
disney
boardroom
wasn
t
the
harshest
of
arena
but
i
have
to
go
in
there
and
fight
for
something
i
knew
be
a
risk
if
they
say
yes
and
it
work
i
d
be
a
hero
for
change
the
fortune
of
the
company
if
they
say
yes
and
it
didn
t
work
i
wouldn
t
be
long
in
the
job
i
spoke
with
as
much
fire
as
i
could
muster
the
future
of
the
company
be
right
here
right
now
i
say
it
s
in
your
hand
i
repeat
something
i
d
say
back
in
october
in
my
first
board
meeting
as
ceo
as
disney
animation
go
so
go
the
company
it
be
true
in
with
snow
white
and
the
seven
dwarf
and
in
with
the
lion
king
and
it
s
no
less
true
right
now
when
animation
soar
disney
soar
we
have
to
do
this
our
path
to
the
future
start
right
here
tonight
when
i
be
do
george
begin
the
voting
process
call
on
each
member
in
alphabetical
order
to
vote
aloud
and
offering
them
a
chance
to
speak
if
they
want
to
the
room
go
very
quiet
i
recall
make
eye
contact
with
tom
staggs
and
alan
braverman
they
be
confident
we
would
get
the
vote
but
now
i
wasn
t
sure
after
all
the
board
have
be
through
over
the
past
few
year
it
seem
likely
that
risk
aversion
could
rule
the
day
the
first
four
member
vote
yes
and
the
fifth
also
vote
yes
but
add
that
he
be
do
so
only
out
of
support
for
me
of
the
remain
five
two
vote
against
bring
the
final
tally
to
nine
for
and
two
against
the
deal
be
approve
there
be
a
brief
discussion
about
whether
another
vote
should
be
take
to
make
it
unanimous
but
george
quickly
shut
that
down
argue
that
the
process
have
to
be
transparent
someone
worried
about
the
public
perception
of
a
less
than
unanimous
vote
but
i
say
that
i
didn
t
care
all
anyone
have
to
know
be
that
the
disney
board
approve
it
the
vote
do
not
have
to
be
make
public
and
if
anyone
ask
whether
it
be
unanimous
we
should
respond
with
the
truth
year
later
michael
admit
to
me
that
he
be
wrong
about
pixar
which
be
gracious
of
him


on
the
day
of
the
announcement
alan
braverman
tom
staggs
zenia
mucha
and
i
travel
to
pixar
s
headquarters
in
emeryville
steve
john
and
ed
be
there
and
the
plan
be
to
release
the
announcement
right
after
the
stock
market
close
at
p
m
pst
then
hold
a
press
conference
and
a
town
hall
meeting
with
pixar
s
employee
just
after
noon
steve
found
me
and
pull
me
aside
let
s
take
a
walk
he
say
i
knew
steve
like
to
go
on
long
walk
frequently
with
friend
or
colleague
but
i
be
surprised
at
the
timing
and
suspicious
about
his
request
i
turn
to
tom
to
ask
what
he
thought
steve
want
and
we
guess
either
he
want
to
back
out
or
he
want
something
more
i
look
at
my
watch
as
steve
and
i
left
the
building
it
be
now
we
walk
for
a
while
and
then
sat
on
a
bench
in
the
middle
of
pixar
s
beautiful
manicure
ground
steve
put
his
arm
behind
me
which
be
a
nice
unexpected
gesture
he
then
say
i
m
go
to
tell
you
something
that
only
laurene
his
wife
and
my
doctor
know
he
ask
me
for
complete
confidentiality
and
then
he
told
me
that
his
cancer
have
return
he
d
be
diagnose
with
a
rare
form
of
pancreatic
cancer
a
few
year
earlier
and
after
an
operation
he
have
declare
that
he
be
completely
cure
but
now
it
be
back
steve
why
be
you
tell
me
this
i
ask
and
why
be
you
tell
me
now
i
be
about
to
become
your
big
shareholder
and
a
member
of
your
board
he
say
and
i
think
i
owe
you
the
right
give
this
knowledge
to
back
out
of
the
deal
i
checked
my
watch
again
it
be
only
thirty
minute
before
we
be
to
announce
the
deal
i
wasn
t
sure
how
to
respond
and
i
be
struggle
to
process
what
i
d
just
be
told
which
include
ask
myself
whether
what
i
now
knew
would
trigger
any
disclosure
obligation
do
i
need
to
tell
our
board
could
i
ask
our
general
counsel
he
want
complete
confidentiality
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
anything
except
accept
his
offer
and
back
away
from
a
deal
i
want
badly
and
we
need
badly
finally
i
say
steve
in
less
than
thirty
minute
we
be
set
to
announce
a
seven
plus
billion
dollar
deal
what
would
i
tell
our
board
that
i
get
cold
foot
he
told
me
to
blame
him
i
then
ask
be
there
more
that
i
need
to
know
about
this
help
me
make
this
decision
he
told
me
the
cancer
be
now
in
his
liver
and
he
talk
about
the
odds
of
beating
it
he
be
go
to
do
whatever
it
take
to
be
at
his
son
reed
s
high
school
graduation
he
say
when
he
told
me
that
be
four
year
away
i
felt
devastate
it
be
impossible
to
be
have
these
two
conversation
about
steve
face
his
impend
death
and
about
the
deal
we
be
suppose
to
be
closing
in
minute
at
the
same
time
i
decide
to
reject
his
offer
to
cancel
the
deal
even
if
i
take
him
up
on
it
i
wouldn
t
have
be
able
to
explain
why
to
our
board
which
not
only
have
approve
it
but
have
endure
month
of
my
plea
to
do
so
it
be
now
ten
minute
before
our
release
be
to
go
out
i
have
no
idea
if
i
be
do
the
right
thing
but
i
d
quickly
calculate
that
steve
be
not
material
to
the
deal
itself
although
he
certainly
be
material
to
me
steve
and
i
walk
in
silence
back
to
the
atrium
later
that
day
i
spoke
with
alan
braverman
whom
i
trust
like
a
brother
and
told
him
what
steve
have
told
me
he
endorse
the
decision
i
d
make
which
come
as
a
great
relief
that
night
i
take
willow
into
my
confidence
too
willow
have
know
steve
for
year
since
long
before
i
knew
him
and
instead
of
toast
what
have
be
a
momentous
day
in
my
early
day
as
ceo
we
cry
together
over
the
news
no
matter
what
he
told
me
no
matter
how
resolve
he
would
be
in
his
fight
with
cancer
we
dread
what
be
ahead
for
him
the
pixar
deal
be
announce
at
pst
after
steve
and
i
address
the
press
we
both
stood
on
a
platform
in
the
cavernous
pixar
atrium
john
and
ed
at
our
side
in
front
of
almost
a
thousand
pixar
employee
before
i
spoke
someone
give
me
a
luxo
lamp
as
a
present
to
commemorate
the
moment
extemporaneously
i
thanked
the
group
and
told
them
i
be
go
to
use
it
to
illuminate
our
castle
it
have
ever
since
chapter
marvel
and
massive
risk
that
make
perfect
sense
the
pixar
acquisition
serve
our
urgent
need
to
revitalize
disney
animation
but
it
be
also
the
first
step
in
our
large
growth
strategy
to
increase
the
amount
of
high
quality
brand
content
we
create
to
advance
technologically
both
in
our
ability
to
create
more
compelling
product
and
to
deliver
those
product
to
consumer
and
to
grow
globally
tom
staggs
kevin
mayer
and
i
have
a
list
of
acquisition
target
that
we
believe
could
help
us
fulfill
those
priority
and
we
decide
to
focus
first
on
intellectual
property
who
possess
great
ip
that
could
have
application
across
the
full
range
of
our
business
two
company
come
immediately
to
mind
marvel
entertainment
and
lucasfilm
we
have
no
idea
if
either
might
be
for
sale
but
for
a
variety
of
reason
among
them
that
i
believe
it
would
be
very
hard
to
convince
george
lucas
to
sell
the
company
he
d
built
himself
and
relinquish
control
of
the
star
war
legacy
we
put
marvel
at
the
top
of
our
list
i
wasn
t
steep
in
marvel
lore
but
you
didn
t
have
to
be
a
lifelong
reader
of
the
comic
to
know
it
be
a
trove
of
compelling
character
and
story
that
would
plug
easily
into
our
movie
television
theme
park
and
consumer
product
business
there
be
other
company
on
our
list
but
none
be
as
valuable
as
marvel
and
star
war
the
approach
wasn
t
without
complication
for
one
marvel
be
already
contractually
bound
to
other
studio
they
have
a
distribution
agreement
with
paramount
for
multiple
upcoming
film
they
d
sell
the
spider
man
right
to
columbia
picture
which
eventually
become
sony
the
incredible
hulk
be
control
by
universal
x
men
and
the
fantastic
four
belong
to
fox
so
even
if
we
could
acquire
everything
that
wasn
t
tie
up
by
other
studio
it
wasn
t
as
pure
an
ip
acquisition
as
we
would
ideally
have
like
we
wouldn
t
have
all
the
character
under
one
umbrella
which
would
potentially
cause
some
brand
confusion
and
some
licensing
complication
down
the
road
the
large
obstacle
though
be
that
the
person
who
ran
marvel
ike
perlmutter
be
a
mystery
to
us
ike
be
a
legendarily
tough
reclusive
character
former
israeli
military
who
never
appear
in
public
or
allow
picture
of
himself
to
be
take
he
have
make
a
fortune
by
buying
up
the
debt
of
distressed
company
and
then
use
it
to
take
control
of
them
and
he
have
a
reputation
for
be
penurious
to
the
extreme
there
be
story
of
ike
pull
paper
clip
out
of
trash
can
beyond
that
we
knew
very
little
about
him
we
have
no
idea
how
he
d
respond
to
our
overture
or
if
he
d
respond
at
all
when
we
reach
out
to
him
ike
s
connection
to
marvel
comic
go
back
to
the
mid
s
when
marvel
s
then
owner
ron
perelman
acquire
part
of
toybiz
a
company
that
ike
own
along
with
a
partner
name
avi
arad
throughout
the
comic
collect
boom
of
the
late
s
and
early
s
marvel
be
hugely
profitable
then
the
boom
end
and
loss
start
pile
up
there
be
financial
restructurings
and
a
bankruptcy
filing
and
finally
a
long
power
struggle
between
perelman
the
investor
carl
icahn
who
d
become
marvel
s
chairman
and
ike
and
avi
arad
in
ike
and
arad
wrest
control
of
the
company
away
from
both
perelman
and
icahn
the
next
year
they
fully
merge
toybiz
and
marvel
to
form
marvel
enterprise
which
eventually
become
marvel
entertainment
by
when
we
begin
look
into
them
in
earnest
marvel
be
a
publicly
trade
company
with
ike
as
its
ceo
and
control
shareholder
we
spent
about
six
month
try
to
get
a
meeting
with
him
and
get
nowhere
you
d
think
it
wouldn
t
be
that
difficult
for
the
ceo
of
one
company
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
another
but
ike
didn
t
do
anything
that
he
didn
t
want
to
do
and
because
he
be
so
secretive
there
be
no
direct
channel
to
him
if
he
be
go
to
give
us
the
time
of
day
it
would
be
because
someone
he
trust
vouched
for
us
we
do
have
one
connection
a
former
disney
executive
name
david
maisel
have
join
marvel
to
help
them
get
into
the
movie
business
david
and
i
always
get
along
and
he
checked
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
there
be
anything
we
could
do
together
he
d
push
me
several
time
to
consider
become
the
distributor
of
the
film
marvel
be
embark
on
but
i
wasn
t
interested
in
just
be
a
distributor
i
told
david
i
want
to
meet
with
ike
and
ask
if
he
have
any
advice
he
say
he
would
try
to
arrange
something
and
that
he
thought
it
be
a
great
idea
but
he
make
no
promise
and
urge
patience
meanwhile
kevin
mayer
couldn
t
stop
fantasize
about
what
disney
could
do
if
we
add
marvel
kevin
be
as
intense
and
laser
focus
as
anyone
i
ve
ever
work
with
and
when
he
set
his
sight
on
something
of
value
it
s
very
hard
for
him
to
accept
my
advice
to
be
patient
and
so
he
harangue
me
on
a
near
daily
basis
to
find
some
way
to
get
to
ike
and
i
told
him
we
need
to
wait
and
see
what
david
could
do
month
go
by
intermittently
david
would
reach
out
with
the
same
message
nothing
yet
keep
wait
and
then
finally
he
call
one
day
in
june
and
say
ike
be
willing
to
meet
david
never
explain
why
thing
have
change
but
i
suspect
he
told
ike
we
have
some
interest
in
possibly
acquire
marvel
and
that
intrigue
him
a
few
day
after
we
get
the
word
from
david
i
go
to
meet
ike
at
the
marvel
office
in
midtown
manhattan
as
with
john
and
ed
at
pixar
i
want
him
to
feel
that
i
be
there
out
of
respect
so
i
go
to
new
york
expressly
to
meet
with
him
and
show
up
by
myself
not
with
a
team
of
disney
executive
marvel
s
office
confirm
ike
s
reputation
they
be
spartan
his
own
office
be
tiny
and
unadorned
a
small
desk
some
chair
small
table
and
lamp
no
expensive
furniture
or
sweep
view
very
little
on
the
wall
you
d
never
know
that
it
belong
to
the
ceo
of
an
entertainment
company
ike
be
noticeably
wary
of
me
but
he
wasn
t
cold
or
uninviting
he
have
a
wiry
frame
and
a
powerful
handshake
when
i
sat
down
he
offer
me
a
glass
of
water
and
a
banana
from
costco
he
say
my
wife
and
i
shop
there
on
weekend
i
didn
t
know
how
much
david
have
told
him
about
me
or
what
i
want
to
talk
about
but
you
can
t
meet
someone
and
then
right
after
the
nicety
say
you
want
to
buy
his
company
so
while
i
suspect
ike
knew
there
be
likely
only
one
reason
i
be
in
his
office
we
first
chat
about
where
we
each
come
from
and
our
respective
business
he
ask
specifically
about
the
pixar
purchase
and
i
told
him
about
integrate
them
into
disney
in
a
way
that
allow
them
to
maintain
their
unique
culture
it
be
at
that
point
that
i
explain
why
i
be
there
and
raise
the
notion
of
do
something
similar
with
marvel
ike
didn
t
leap
at
it
but
he
didn
t
reject
it
either
we
talk
for
another
half
hour
and
then
he
suggest
we
meet
later
that
night
at
the
post
house
a
steak
place
he
like
in
the
east
sixty
our
dinner
conversation
be
long
and
wide
range
i
learn
about
the
various
business
ike
have
run
and
about
his
life
in
israel
before
come
to
america
he
be
as
tough
and
proud
as
advertised
and
i
didn
t
press
too
hard
on
the
idea
of
a
possible
sale
just
enough
to
share
my
vision
for
how
marvel
could
be
part
of
a
bright
future
at
disney
toward
the
end
of
the
meal
he
told
me
i
need
to
think
about
it
and
i
say
i
d
check
in
with
him
tomorrow
when
i
call
the
next
day
ike
told
me
that
he
still
have
doubt
but
he
be
intrigue
ike
s
a
shrewd
businessman
and
he
stood
to
make
a
lot
of
money
from
a
sale
to
disney
but
he
d
also
take
control
of
marvel
when
it
be
in
trouble
and
have
turn
it
around
i
think
the
notion
that
some
other
ceo
would
just
come
in
and
buy
it
up
didn
t
sit
easily
with
him
even
though
he
knew
he
d
make
a
fortune
off
of
it
ike
and
i
be
very
different
people
and
we
ve
have
our
disagreement
over
the
year
since
the
acquisition
of
marvel
but
i
genuinely
respect
where
he
d
come
from
in
his
life
he
d
arrive
in
the
united
state
with
next
to
nothing
and
by
virtue
of
his
own
smart
and
tenacity
have
become
wildly
successful
i
want
him
to
understand
that
i
appreciate
who
he
be
and
what
he
d
do
and
that
he
and
his
company
would
be
in
good
hand
however
ike
would
never
fit
easily
into
a
corporate
structure
or
respond
well
to
what
he
perceive
as
hollywood
slickness
so
if
he
be
go
to
be
comfortable
with
sell
to
disney
he
have
to
feel
like
he
be
deal
with
someone
who
be
be
authentic
and
straight
with
him
and
who
spoke
a
language
he
understood
luckily
for
me
willow
happen
to
be
in
new
york
on
business
that
week
and
so
i
suggest
to
ike
that
he
and
his
wife
join
us
for
dinner
willow
doesn
t
often
attend
business
dinner
with
me
but
her
understand
of
business
her
resum
and
her
ease
with
people
make
her
a
secret
weapon
we
met
again
at
the
post
house
at
the
same
table
ike
and
i
have
sat
at
a
few
night
earlier
ike
s
wife
laurie
be
a
smart
energetic
person
who
happens
to
be
a
competitive
bridge
player
and
she
and
willow
make
the
conversation
easy
and
relaxed
there
wasn
t
any
business
talk
it
be
just
a
chance
to
give
them
a
sense
of
who
we
be
and
what
be
important
to
us
and
for
us
to
get
a
sense
of
who
they
be
too
ike
didn
t
say
it
outright
but
i
felt
confident
by
the
end
of
the
night
that
he
be
warm
to
the
idea


this
wasn
t
the
first
time
marvel
have
be
on
disney
s
radar
early
in
my
time
work
for
michael
i
attend
a
staff
lunch
in
which
he
float
the
idea
of
acquire
them
a
handful
of
executive
around
the
table
object
marvel
be
too
edgy
they
say
it
would
tarnish
the
disney
brand
there
be
an
assumption
at
the
time
internally
and
among
member
of
the
board
that
disney
be
a
single
monolithic
brand
and
all
of
our
business
exist
beneath
the
disney
umbrella
i
sense
michael
knew
well
but
any
negative
reaction
to
the
brand
or
suggestion
that
it
wasn
t
be
manage
well
he
take
personally
among
other
thing
disney
have
a
successful
but
often
strain
partnership
with
miramax
run
by
bob
and
harvey
weinstein
which
michael
have
acquire
in
the
partnership
be
dissolve
in
when
michael
be
still
ceo
and
seven
year
later
we
sell
the
entire
business
miramax
release
around
three
hundred
film
over
those
year
many
be
critically
successful
and
profitable
but
many
others
lose
money
there
be
intense
fight
with
the
weinsteins
over
budget
and
struggle
over
the
content
of
film
particularly
michael
moore
s
documentary
fahrenheit
which
michael
eisner
didn
t
want
disney
to
distribute
there
be
one
problem
after
another
and
while
there
be
academy
award
winner
it
be
never
easy
with
them
one
example
occur
in
when
miramax
launch
talk
magazine
which
be
a
huge
money
loser
they
commit
to
the
magazine
with
tina
brown
before
michael
have
a
chance
to
bless
it
and
it
be
a
debacle
from
the
begin
i
never
have
anything
to
do
with
the
miramax
relationship
but
i
saw
how
it
take
a
toll
on
michael
internally
and
publicly
fight
with
harvey
and
bob
weinstein
be
a
constant
source
of
stress
on
top
of
deal
with
the
board
s
opinion
that
miramax
be
fiscally
irresponsible
as
the
pressure
increase
on
him
in
the
last
few
year
i
watch
michael
grow
weary
and
wary
so
when
he
get
pushback
from
some
executive
over
the
marvel
idea
his
default
be
not
to
force
the
issue
it
wasn
t
that
long
ago
that
he
d
make
the
abc
deal
after
all
so
there
be
no
great
urgency
to
acquire
another
company
my
high
priority
when
i
take
over
as
ceo
have
be
to
revive
the
disney
brand
by
revive
animation
now
that
john
and
ed
be
in
place
that
problem
be
well
on
its
way
to
be
solve
once
disney
animation
be
solid
i
be
open
to
other
acquisition
even
if
they
weren
t
obviously
disney
in
fact
i
be
much
more
conscious
of
not
want
to
play
it
safe
we
d
take
a
huge
risk
with
the
pixar
acquisition
and
it
would
have
be
easy
to
hold
our
card
for
a
while
rather
than
push
for
more
growth
three
year
after
pixar
become
part
of
disney
though
the
sand
be
shift
even
more
dramatically
under
the
entire
entertainment
business
and
it
be
important
for
us
to
keep
think
ambitiously
to
capitalize
on
our
momentum
and
expand
our
portfolio
of
brand
storytelling
if
anything
when
it
come
to
marvel
i
have
the
opposite
worry
of
those
who
be
wary
of
acquire
a
company
that
be
decidedly
edgier
than
disney
not
what
marvel
would
do
to
disney
but
how
loyal
marvel
fan
would
react
to
their
be
associate
with
us
would
we
possibly
destroy
some
of
their
value
by
acquire
them
kevin
mayer
s
team
research
that
question
and
after
several
conversation
with
kevin
i
felt
comfortable
we
could
manage
the
brand
respectfully
and
separately
that
they
could
exist
side
by
side
and
neither
would
be
negatively
affected
by
the
other
some
of
ike
s
key
creative
people
be
understandably
anxious
about
be
acquire
too
i
invite
several
of
them
out
to
burbank
and
met
with
them
myself
describe
my
own
experience
with
the
capital
city
and
disney
acquisition
and
assure
them
that
i
knew
what
it
felt
like
to
be
swallow
up
by
another
company
i
uttered
the
same
sentence
to
them
that
i
have
repeat
multiple
time
during
my
negotiation
with
steve
and
john
and
ed
it
doesn
t
make
any
sense
for
us
to
buy
you
for
what
you
be
and
then
turn
you
into
something
else


once
ike
make
clear
that
he
be
willing
to
enter
into
a
more
serious
negotiation
tom
staggs
kevin
mayer
and
their
team
begin
the
exhaustive
process
of
assess
marvel
s
current
and
potential
value
as
a
stand
alone
company
and
as
part
of
disney
in
order
to
arrive
at
an
offer
that
make
sense
it
involve
a
full
accounting
of
their
asset
and
liability
and
contractual
obstacle
as
well
as
their
personnel
and
the
issue
of
assimilate
them
into
our
company
our
team
construct
a
multiyear
scenario
of
potential
movie
release
with
project
box
office
estimate
they
also
built
into
the
model
what
we
could
do
to
grow
the
business
within
disney
in
our
theme
park
and
publishing
and
consumer
product
business
since
the
pixar
deal
with
steve
as
a
board
member
and
our
large
shareholder
whenever
i
want
to
do
something
big
i
talk
it
over
with
him
to
get
his
advice
and
support
before
take
it
to
the
full
board
steve
s
voice
matter
in
our
boardroom
they
have
such
respect
for
him
before
we
go
any
far
in
the
negotiation
i
go
up
to
cupertino
and
have
lunch
with
steve
and
walk
him
through
marvel
s
business
he
claimed
to
have
never
read
a
comic
book
in
his
life
i
hate
them
more
than
i
hate
videogames
he
told
me
so
i
brought
my
encyclopedia
of
marvel
character
with
me
to
explain
the
universe
to
him
and
show
him
what
we
would
be
buying
he
spent
about
ten
second
look
at
it
then
push
it
aside
and
say
be
this
one
important
to
you
do
you
really
want
it
be
it
another
pixar
steve
and
i
have
become
good
friend
since
we
d
make
the
pixar
deal
we
socialize
on
occasion
and
talk
a
few
time
a
week
we
vacation
at
adjacent
hawaiian
hotel
a
few
time
and
would
meet
and
take
long
walk
on
the
beach
talk
about
our
wife
and
kid
about
music
about
apple
and
disney
and
the
thing
we
might
still
do
together
our
connection
be
much
more
than
a
business
relationship
we
enjoy
each
other
s
company
immensely
and
we
felt
we
could
say
anything
to
each
other
that
our
friendship
be
strong
enough
that
it
be
never
threaten
by
candor
you
don
t
expect
to
develop
such
close
friendship
late
in
life
but
when
i
think
back
on
my
time
as
ceo
at
the
thing
i
m
most
grateful
for
and
surprised
by
my
relationship
with
steve
be
one
of
them
he
could
criticize
me
and
i
could
disagree
and
neither
of
us
take
it
too
personally
plenty
of
people
warn
me
that
the
bad
thing
i
could
do
be
let
steve
into
the
company
that
he
would
bully
me
and
everyone
else
i
always
say
the
same
thing
how
can
steve
job
come
into
our
company
not
be
a
good
thing
even
if
it
come
at
my
expense
who
wouldn
t
want
steve
job
to
have
influence
over
how
a
company
be
run
i
wasn
t
worried
about
how
he
would
act
and
i
be
confident
that
if
he
do
do
something
that
be
out
of
line
i
could
call
him
out
on
it
he
be
quick
to
judge
people
and
when
he
criticize
it
be
often
quite
harsh
that
say
he
come
to
all
the
board
meeting
and
actively
participate
give
the
kind
of
objective
criticism
you
d
expect
from
any
board
member
he
rarely
create
trouble
for
me
not
never
but
rarely
i
once
give
him
a
tour
of
a
hotel
in
orlando
call
art
of
animation
it
s
a
huge
hotel
three
thousand
room
price
more
affordably
than
many
of
our
hotel
i
be
proud
of
its
quality
for
the
price
and
when
steve
come
down
for
a
board
retreat
shortly
after
it
open
i
take
him
to
see
it
we
walk
into
the
hotel
and
steve
look
around
and
proclaim
this
be
crap
you
re
not
fake
anybody
steve
i
say
this
be
for
people
who
want
to
come
to
disney
world
with
their
kid
and
can
t
afford
to
spend
hundred
of
dollar
a
night
on
a
room
it
s
ninety
buck
and
it
s
a
decent
nice
clean
pleasant
place
i
don
t
get
it
he
bark
most
people
would
have
appreciate
the
quality
and
the
care
we
d
take
to
design
it
but
steve
wasn
t
most
people
he
be
look
at
it
through
his
own
lens
it
s
not
for
you
i
say
i
m
sorry
that
i
show
it
to
you
i
be
a
little
mad
at
his
snobbery
but
i
also
knew
that
be
just
who
he
be
he
built
thing
of
the
high
quality
not
necessarily
affordable
to
all
but
he
never
sacrifice
quality
in
order
to
attain
affordability
i
never
show
him
anything
like
that
again
when
iron
man
come
out
steve
take
his
son
to
see
it
and
call
me
the
next
day
i
take
reed
to
see
iron
man
last
night
he
say
it
suck
well
thank
you
it
s
do
about
million
in
business
it
s
go
to
do
a
huge
number
this
weekend
i
don
t
take
your
criticism
lightly
steve
but
it
s
a
success
and
you
re
not
the
audience
i
knew
iron
man
be
nobody
s
idea
of
an
oscar
winner
but
i
just
couldn
t
let
him
feel
he
be
right
all
of
the
time
not
long
after
that
at
the
disney
shareholder
meeting
alan
braverman
our
general
counsel
come
up
to
me
and
say
we
have
a
huge
no
vote
on
four
board
member
how
huge
over
a
hundred
million
share
he
say
i
be
baffle
normally
there
might
be
a
to
percent
no
vote
at
the
most
a
hundred
million
share
be
way
beyond
that
something
be
off
a
hundred
million
share
i
say
again
the
company
be
do
quite
well
by
then
and
our
board
member
be
well
respect
there
d
be
no
public
criticism
that
i
knew
of
no
warning
that
something
like
this
might
come
up
it
didn
t
make
any
sense
after
a
minute
alan
say
i
think
it
might
be
steve
he
have
all
those
share
and
he
vote
against
four
of
his
fellow
board
member
this
be
one
day
before
we
reveal
the
vote
announce
that
four
board
member
have
receive
a
gigantic
withhold
vote
would
be
a
public
relation
nightmare
i
call

you
vote
against
four
board
member
i

i
say

all
how
can
you
do
that
without

s
go
to
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
i
don
t
know
how
i
ll
explain
it
publicly
and
i
don
t
know
how
i
m
go
to
explain
it

good
board
member

waste
of
space
he
say
i
don
t
like
them
i
start
to
defend
them
then
immediately
realize
that
wasn
t
go
to
work
with
steve
i
wasn
t
go
to
convince
him
he
be
wrong

want
me
to
do

he
never

up
do
that
by
the
time
the
next
shareholder
meeting
come
around
he
be
terribly
ill
and
focus
on
other
thing
with
these
few
exception
steve
be
a
wonderful
generous
business
partner
and
wise
counsel
when
it
come
to
the
marvel
question
i
told
him
that
i
wasn
t
sure
if
it
be
another
pixar
but
they
have
great
talent
at
the
company
and
the
content
be
so
rich
that
if
we
held
the
ip
it
would
put
some
real
distance
between
us
and
everyone
else
i
ask
him
if
he
d
be
willing
to
reach
out
to
ike
and
vouch
for
me
okay
steve
say
if
you
think
it
s
right
then
i
ll
give
him
a
call
he
never
would
have
invest
in
such
a
company
himself
but
he
trust
and
want
to
help
me
more
than
he
hat
comic
book
and
superhero
movie
the
next
day
he
call
and
talk
with
ike
for
a
while
i
think
even
ike
be
impressed
and
flatter
to
be
get
a
call
from
steve
job
steve
told
him
that
the
pixar
deal
far
exceed
his
expectation
because
i
d
live
up
to
my
word
and
respect
the
brand
and
the
people
later
after
we
d
close
the
deal
ike
told
me
that
he
d
still
have
his
doubt
and
the
call
from
steve
make
a
big
difference
to
him
he
say
you
be
true
to
your
word
ike
say
i
be
grateful
that
steve
be
willing
to
do
it
as
a
friend
really
more
than
as
the
most
influential
member
of
our
board
every
once
in
a
while
i
would
say
to
him
i
have
to
ask
you
this
you
re
our
large
shareholder
and
he
would
always
respond
you
can
t
think
of
me
as
that
that
s
insult
i
m
just
a
good
friend


on
august
a
few
month
after
my
first
meeting
with
ike
we
announce
we
be
buying
marvel
for
billion
there
be
no
leak
in
advance
no
speculation
in
the
press
about
a
possible
acquisition
we
just
make
the
announcement
then
prepared
for
the
backlash
marvel
be
go
to
lose
its
edge
disney
be
go
to
lose
its
innocence
they
spent
billion
and
they
don
t
have
spider
man
our
stock
fell
percent
the
day
we
announce
the
deal
not
long
after
the
announcement
president
obama
host
a
small
luncheon
with
a
group
of
business
leader
in
the
rise
garden
brian
robert
from
comcast
be
there
and
alan
mulally
from
ford
and
a
handful
of
others
we
ate
and
chat
about
our
various
business
and
the
president
mention
he
be
a
big
marvel
fan
afterward
brian
and
i
share
a
car
from
the
white
house
where
do
you
see
the
value
with
marvel
he
ask
during
the
ride
i
say
there
be
an
endless
supply
of
ip
aren
t
they
all
spoken
for
some
of
them
be
i
say
but
there
be
a
lot
more
brian
then
told
me
he
d
be
talk
with
jeff
immelt
the
ceo
of
general
electric
which
own
nbcuniversal
at
the
time
before
long
comcast
would
buy
nbc
from
them
jeff
have
apparently
told
brian
that
our
marvel
deal
confound
him
why
would
anyone
want
to
buy
a
library
of
comic
book
character
for
billion
he
d
say
it
make
me
want
to
leave
the
business
i
smile
and
shrug
i
guess
we
ll
see
i
say
i
wasn
t
worried
about
what
other
ceo
would
say
we
d
do
our
homework
we
knew
that
time
would
prove
that
the
brand
could
easily
coexist
and
we
knew
there
be
a
depth
to
the
marvel
universe
that
most
people
weren
t
aware
of
during
our
research
we
d
put
together
a
dossier
that
contain
a
list
of
about
seven
thousand
marvel
character
even
if
we
couldn
t
obtain
spider
man
or
the
right
control
by
other
studio
we
d
still
have
more
than
enough
to
mine
the
content
be
there
and
the
talent
be
there
in
fact
the
marvel
studio
talent
lead
by
kevin
feige
described
their
long
term
vision
for
what
would
become
the
marvel
cinematic
universe
or
mcu
there
be
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
them
but
the
plan
kevin
laid
out
include
a
plan
for
intertwine
character
across
multiple
film
well
into
the
next
decade
seem
brilliant
to
me
we
assimilate
marvel
quickly
and
easily
ike
kept
run
the
business
which
include
their
publishing
television
and
movie
division
among
other
thing
from
new
york
kevin
feige
work
from
manhattan
beach
and
continued
to
report
to
ike
early
on
this
structure
seem
to
work
at
least
on
the
surface
the
movie
be
successful
and
it
be
apparent
fairly
soon
after
the
acquisition
that
unless
we
make
some
egregious
unforced
error
or
be
blindside
by
some
unforeseen
outside
event
marvel
be
go
to
be
worth
far
more
than
we
d
anticipate
as
we
come
to
understand
more
closely
how
marvel
work
we
become
aware
of
a
problematic
dynamic
between
the
new
york
office
marvel
s
home
base
and
the
film
make
business
that
kevin
oversaw
in
california
the
movie
business
can
be
both
thrill
and
madden
it
doesn
t
operate
like
other
traditional
business
it
require
make
bet
after
bet
base
on
nothing
but
instinct
everything
be
a
risk
you
can
have
what
you
think
be
a
great
idea
and
the
right
team
assemble
and
thing
can
still
get
derail
for
a
whole
host
of
reason
that
be
often
beyond
your
control
a
script
doesn
t
come
together
a
director
have
bad
chemistry
with
his
or
her
team
or
have
a
vision
for
a
film
that
run
contrary
to
yours
a
competitive
movie
come
out
that
upends
your
expectation
it
s
easy
to
get
swept
up
in
the
glamour
of
hollywood
and
lose
all
perspective
and
it
s
equally
easy
to
feel
contempt
for
it
and
lose
all
perspective
i
ve
see
both
occur
many
time
whatever
the
case
i
be
detect
a
grow
tension
between
the
marvel
team
in
new
york
and
kevin
s
team
in
l
a
the
new
york
office
be
oversee
the
film
studio
s
budget
and
therefore
experience
the
anxiety
over
cost
and
risk
but
they
be
also
remove
from
hollywood
culture
and
perhaps
less
sensitive
to
the
challenge
of
the
creative
process
put
pressure
on
movie
executive
particularly
creative
producer
to
make
well
film
for
less
money
isn
t
necessarily
a
terrible
approach
any
studio
have
to
be
aware
of
the
economic
reality
of
the
business
production
cost
do
sometimes
get
out
of
hand
hard
line
do
sometimes
have
to
be
drawn
when
it
come
to
negotiate
contract
there
s
an
endless
litany
of
financial
decision
that
have
to
be
attend
to
in
order
to
guard
against
lose
money
on
a
film
it
s
a
fine
line
though
and
i
ve
often
observe
how
the
business
side
can
sometimes
put
too
many
demand
on
the
creative
process
and
be
too
indifferent
to
the
pressure
that
the
filmmaker
be
under
and
that
strain
end
up
do
more
harm
than
good
kevin
be
one
of
the
most
talented
film
executive
in
the
business
but
my
sense
be
that
the
strain
relationship
with
new
york
be
threaten
his
continued
success
i
knew
i
have
to
intervene
and
so
in
may
i
make
the
decision
to
split
marvel
s
movie
make
unit
off
from
the
rest
of
marvel
and
bring
it
under
alan
horn
and
the
walt
disney
studio
kevin
would
now
report
directly
to
alan
and
would
benefit
from
his
experience
and
the
tension
that
have
built
up
between
him
and
the
new
york
office
would
be
alleviate
the
transition
wasn
t
an
easy
one
but
ultimately
it
defuse
what
could
have
become
an
untenable
situation


fire
people
or
take
responsibility
away
from
them
be
arguably
the
most
difficult
thing
you
have
to
do
as
a
bos
there
have
be
several
time
when
i
ve
have
to
deliver
bad
news
to
accomplish
people
some
of
whom
be
friend
and
some
of
whom
have
be
unable
to
flourish
in
position
that
i
have
put
them
in
there
s
no
good
playbook
for
how
to
fire
someone
though
i
have
my
own
internal
set
of
rule
you
have
to
do
it
in
person
not
over
the
phone
and
certainly
not
by
email
or
text
you
have
to
look
the
person
in
the
eye
you
can
t
use
anyone
else
as
an
excuse
this
be
you
make
a
decision
about
them
not
them
as
a
person
but
the
way
they
have
perform
in
their
job
and
they
need
and
deserve
to
know
that
it
s
come
from
you
you
can
t
make
small
talk
once
you
bring
someone
in
for
that
conversation
i
normally
say
something
along
the
line
of
i
ve
ask
you
to
come
in
here
for
a
difficult
reason
and
then
i
try
to
be
as
direct
about
the
issue
as
possible
explain
clearly
and
concisely
what
wasn
t
work
and
why
i
didn
t
think
it
be
go
to
change
i
emphasize
that
it
be
a
tough
decision
to
make
and
that
i
understand
that
it
s
much
harder
on
them
there
s
a
kind
of
euphemistic
corporate
language
that
be
often
deployed
in
those
situation
and
it
have
always
struck
me
as
offensive
there
s
no
way
for
the
conversation
not
to
be
painful
but
at
least
it
can
be
honest
and
in
be
honest
there
be
at
least
a
chance
for
the
person
on
the
receive
end
to
understand
why
it
s
happen
and
eventually
move
on
even
if
they
walk
out
of
the
room
angry
as
hell
in
fact
alan
horn
be
now
the
head
of
disney
studio
as
a
result
of
my
have
fire
his
predecessor
rich
ross
whom
i
d
put
into
the
job
right
after
we
d
make
the
marvel
deal
at
the
time
i
d
thought
i
be
make
a
bold
unconventional
choice
rich
didn
t
have
movie
experience
but
he
d
be
tremendously
successful
run
the
disney
channel
he
d
launch
several
franchise
show
and
coordinate
the
success
of
those
brand
across
our
division
he
d
expand
our
child
s
tv
business
into
market
all
over
the
world
but
i
d
underestimated
how
hard
a
leap
it
would
be
to
run
the
studio
in
part
because
i
still
didn
t
fully
appreciate
the
complexity
of
the
movie
business
myself
i
be
eager
to
make
a
bold
choice
and
while
rich
didn
t
have
any
experience
navigate
the
close
ranked
culture
of
hollywood
i
thought
he
could
bring
a
different
and
necessary
set
of
skill
to
the
job
i
ve
make
some
big
personnel
mistake
over
the
year
and
this
be
one
of
them
i
d
always
be
grateful
that
tom
murphy
and
dan
burke
have
bet
on
my
ability
to
succeed
in
one
business
because
i
d
succeed
in
another
i
make
that
same
gamble
with
rich
but
the
transition
be
just
too
tough
for
him
and
once
he
get
underwater
he
never
stop
struggle
after
a
couple
of
year
we
have
too
few
film
in
the
pipeline
various
powerful
partner
inside

lose
faith
in

and
be
openly
complain
about
do
business
with
him
ike
be
one
of
rich
s
most
vocal
detractor
as
i
look
at
the
studio
very
little
be
go
right
and
it
be
clear
that
my
instinct
wasn
t
go
to
work
out
rather
than
put
more
effort
into
make
it
work
or
become
defensive
about
have
do
it
i
need
to
contain
the
damage
learn
from
my
misstep
and
move
on
quickly
at
some
point
in
rich
s
brief
tenure
as
chairman
of
disney
studio
bob
daly
who
be
then
co
chair
of
warner

call
me
and
say
i
should
talk
to
alan
horn

serve
as
an
adviser
to

alan
have
be
push
out
as
president
and
coo
of
warner
bros
he
be
sixty
eight
at
that
point
and
though
he
be
responsible
for
several
of
the
big
film
of
the
past
decade
include
the
harry
potter
franchise
jeff

ceo
want
someone
young
run
his
studio
alan
be
still
contractually
bound
to
warner
bros
when
bob
raise
the
possibility
of
his
serve
as
rich
s
mentor
but
a
year
later
when
it
be
clear
to
everyone
in
the
industry
that
rich
wasn
t
long
for
the
job
bob
call
me
again
and
urge
me
to
consider
alan
i
didn
t
know
alan
well
but
i
respect
his
work
and
i
respect
what
he
stood
for
inside
and
outside
the
industry
i
be
also
aware
that
the
force
retirement
have
be
humiliate
for
him
i
ask
him
to
breakfast
and
explain
that
i
need
to
replace
rich
soon
it
be
clear
over
the
course
of
that
and
two
subsequent
meeting
that
alan
want
to
prove
he
have
another
chapter
in
him
but
he
be
also
wary
of
try
something
and
have
it
go
awry
and
add
one
more
sour
note
to
the
end
of
his
career
the
last
thing
he
need
he
say
be
to
go
to
another
place
and
have
it
not
work
out
i
can
t
afford
another
mistake
either
i
told
him
over
the
next
several
month
alan
and
i
discuss
the
possibility
of
his
become
our
new
studio
head
one
of
the
question
be
what
my
involvement
in
his
business
would
be
i
told
him
that
no
one
at
the
company
could
approve
huge
project
without
me
the
head
of
park
and
resort
can
t
build
a
two
hundred
million
dollar
ride
without
my
approval
i
say
the
same
go
for
movie
though
thing
have
end
badly
at
warner
bros
alan
be
use
to
have
more
or
less
complete
autonomy
even
if
he
want
to
be
involve
in
the
movie
business
jeff
bewkes
be
three
thousand
mile
away
in
new
york
i
m
thirty
foot
away
i
told
alan
and
i
care
about
this
a
lot
you
need
to
know
before
you
make
a
decision
that
i
ll
definitely
be
involve
in
your
business
ninety
nine
percent
of
the
time
you
ll
be
able
to
make
what
you
want
to
make
but
i
can
t
give
you
total
freedom
alan
eventually
agree
and
in
the
summer
of
he
come
on
as
the
head
of
disney
studio
what
i
saw
in
him
wasn
t
just
someone
who
at
this
late
stage
in
his
career
have
the
experience
to
reestablish
good
relation
with
the
film
community
he
also
have
something
to
prove
he
be
galvanize
and
that
energy
and
focus
transform
disney
studio
when
he
take
over
as
i
write
this
he
s
now
past
seventy
five
and
be
as
vital
and
astute
as
anyone
in
the
business
he
s
be
successful
in
the
job
beyond
all
of
my
hope
of
the
nearly
two
dozen
disney
film
that
have
earn
more
than
billion
at
the
box
office
almost
three
quarter
of
them
be
release
under
alan
and
he
s
a
decent
kind
forthright
collaborative
partner
to
everyone
he
work
with
which
be
another
lesson
to
be
take
from
his
hire
surround
yourself
with
people
who
be
good
in
addition
to
be
good
at
what
they
do
you
can
t
always
predict
who
will
have
ethical
lapse
or
reveal
a
side
of
themselves
you
never
suspect
be
there
in
the
bad
case
you
will
have
to
deal
with
act
that
reflect
badly
on
the
company
and
demand
censure
that
s
an
unavoidable
part
of
the
job
but
you
have
to
demand
honesty
and
integrity
from
everyone
and
when
there
s
a
lapse
you
have
to
deal
with
it
immediately


the
acquisition
of
marvel
have
prove
to
be
much
more
successful
than
even
our
most
optimistic
model
account
for
as
i
write
this
avenger
endgame
our
twentieth
marvel
film
be
finish
up
the
most
successful
opening
week
in
movie
history
take
together
the
film
have
average
more
than
billion
in
gross
box
office
receipt
and
their
popularity
have
be
felt
throughout
our
theme
park
and
television
and
consumer
product
business
in
way
we
never
fully
anticipate
but
its
impact
on
the
company
and
on
popular
culture
have
go
far
beyond
the
box
office
since
kevin
and
alan
and
i
and
a
few
others
have
met
quarterly
to
plot
out
future
marvel
release
we
discus
project
that
be
well
into
production
and
others
that
be
speck
of
an
idea
we
mull
potential
character
to
introduce
consider
sequel
and
franchise
that
we
might
add
to
the
expand
marvel
cinematic
universe
we
consider
actor
and
director
and
think
about
how
the
various
story
can
be
cross
pollinate
i
often
resort
to
reading
my
handy
marvel
encyclopedia
before
these
meeting
to
immerse
myself
in
the
depth
of
the
character
and
see
if
any
spark
my
curiosity
enough
to
push
them
into
development
back
when
kevin
be
still
reporting
to
ike
and
studio
decision
be
be
make
by
the
marvel
team
in
new
york
i
raise
the
issue
of
diversity
in
one
of
these
meeting
marvel
film
so
far
have
be
built
largely
around
character
who
be
white
and
who
be
men
when
i
say
that
i
thought
we
should
be
change
that
kevin
agree
but
be
worried
that
member
of
the
marvel
team
in
new
york
would
be
skeptical
i
call
the
team
to
discus
my
concern
one
of
them
told
me
female
superheroes
never
drive
big
box
office
their
other
assumption
be
that
international
audience
wouldn
t
want
to
watch
black
superheroes
i
didn
t
believe
that
those
old
truism
be
actually
true
and
so
we
start
to
discus
what
character
we
could
introduce
in
their
own
film
kevin
mention
black
panther
who
be
about
to
be
write
into
the
captain
america
civil
war
script
and
alan
and
i
be
both
intrigue
chadwick
boseman
who
d
receive
considerable
acclaim
for
play
jackie
robinson
in
be
go
to
be
cast
as
black
panther
he
be
such
a
magnetic
compelling
actor
and
i
could
easily
see
him
in
a
lead
marvel
role
around
the
same
time
dan
buckley
who
run
marvel
s
television
and
comic
book
business
told
me
that
the
writer
ta
nehisi
coates
who
i
felt
be
one
of
the
most
important
voice
in
contemporary
american
literature
be
write
a
black
panther
comic
for
us
i
ask
dan
to
send
it
to
me
and
be
amaze
by
the
elegant
storytelling
and
the
way
ta
nehisi
have
add
such
depth
to
the
character
i
devour
the
comic
and
before
i
even
finish
it
have
place
black
panther
on
the
list
of
must
do
marvel
project
in
my
mind
the
marvel
skeptic
in
new
york
weren
t
the
only
one
who
felt
that
a
black
lead
superhero
movie
couldn
t
perform
at
the
box
office
there
s
a
long
held
view
in
hollywood
that
film
with
predominantly
black
cast
or
with
black
lead
will
struggle
in
many
international
market
that
assumption
have
limited
the
number
of
black
lead
film
be
produce
and
black
actor
be
cast
and
many
of
those
that
have
be
make
have
reduce
budget
to
mitigate
the
box
office
risk
i
ve
be
in
the
business
long
enough
to
have
heard
every
old
argument
in
the
book
and
i
ve
learn
that
old
argument
be
just
that
old
and
out
of
step
with
where
the
world
be
and
where
it
should
be
we
have
a
chance
to
make
a
great
movie
and
to
showcase
an
underrepresented
segment
of
america
and
those
goal
be
not
mutually
exclusive
i
call
ike
and
told
him
to
tell
his
team
to
stop
put
up
roadblock
and
order
that
we
put
both
black
panther
and
captain
marvel
into
production
ike
heed
my
request
we
put
black
panther
into
development
immediately
and
captain
marvel
follow
soon
after
both
movie
defy
every
preconceive
notion
of
what
they
would
do
at
the
box
office
as
i
write
this
black
panther
be
the
fourth
high
gross
superhero
film
of
all
time
and
captain
marvel
the
tenth
both
have
earn
well
over
billion
both
be
extraordinarily
successful
internationally
what
they
ve
achieve
culturally
though
be
even
more
significant
the
experience
of
watch
black
panther
with
the
crowd
of
people
that
packed
the
dolby
theatre
for
the
premiere
will
remain
one
of
the
most
memorable
moment
of
my
career
until
then
i
d
only
see
it
during
screening
at
my
house
or
with
a
small
group
at
the
studio
i
knew
we
have
something
special
but
you
re
never
quite
sure
how
something
be
go
to
be
receive
still
i
couldn
t
wait
to
share
it
with
the
world
and
to
see
and
feel
their
reaction
to
it
that
night
the
energy
in
the
room
be
electric
long
before
the
light
go
down
you
could
feel
the
anticipation
that
something
unprecedented
be
about
to
happen
something
historic
and
the
film
more
than
exceed
those
expectation
afterward
i
receive
more
call
and
note
than
i
d

to
our
company
s
willingness
to
champion
bold
business
and
creative
initiative
our
ability
to
execute
an
innovative
vision
flawlessly
and
our
commitment
to
bring
extraordinary
entertainment
to
a
world
that
be
hungry
for
hero
role
model
and
unbelievably
great
storytelling
chapter
star
war
i
would
have
like
for
steve
to
have
see
what
our
investment
in
marvel
turn
into
he
probably
would
have
never
care
much
for
the
movie
although
i
think
he
would
have
appreciate
how
black
panther
and
captain
marvel
flew
in
the
face
of
industry
shibboleth
but
he
would
have
be
proud
that
he
d
be
instrumental
in
bring
ike
around
and
that
the
brand
have
flourish
so
much
under
disney
with
every
success
the
company
have
have
since
steve
s
death
there
s
always
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
my
excitement
when
i
think
i
wish
steve
could
be
here
for
this
it
s
impossible
not
to
have
the
conversation
with
him
in
my
head
that
i
wish
i
could
be
have
in
real
life
in
the
summer
of
steve
and
his
wife
laurene
come
to
our
house
in
l
a
to
have
dinner
with
willow
and
me
he
be
in
the
late
stage
of
cancer
by
then
terribly
thin
and
in
obvious
pain
he
have
very
little
energy
and
his
voice
be
a
low
rasp
but
he
want
to
spend
an
even
with
us
in
part
to
toast
what
we
d
do
year
ago
we
sat
in
our
din
room
and
raise
glass
of
wine
before
dinner
look
what
we
do
he
say
we
save
two
company
all
four
of
us
tear
up
this
be
steve
at
his
warm
and
most
sincere
he
be
convince
that
pixar
have
flourish
in
way
that
it
never
would
have
have
it
not
become
part
of
disney
and
that
disney
have
be
reenergized
by
bring
on
pixar
i
couldn
t
help
but
think
of
those
early
conversation
and
how
nervous
i
be
to
reach
out
to
him
it
be
only
six
year
ago
but
it
seem
like
another
lifetime
he
d
become
so
important
to
me
professionally
and
personally
as
we
toast
i
could
barely
look
at
willow
she
have
know
steve
much
longer
than
i
have
go
way
back
to
when
he
be
one
of
the
young
brash
brilliant
founder
of
apple
now
he
be
gaunt
and
frail
and
in
the
last
month
of
his
life
and
i
knew
how
much
it
pain
her
to
see
him
that
way
he
die
on
october
there
be
about
twenty
five
people
at
his
burial
in
palo
alto
we
gather
in
a
tight
square
around
his
coffin
and
laurene
ask
if
anyone
want
to
say
anything
i
hadn
t
prepared
to
speak
but
the
memory
of
that
walk
we
take
on
pixar
s
campus
year
earlier
come
to
mind
i
d
never
told
anyone
other
than
alan
braverman
our
general
counsel
and
willow
because
i
need
to
share
the
emotional
intensity
of
that
day
with
my
wife
i
thought
the
moment
capture
steve
s
character
though
so
i
recall
it
there
at
the
cemetery
steve
pull
me
aside
the
walk
across
campus
the
way
he
put
his
arm
around
me
and
deliver
the
news
his
concern
that
i
should
have
this
intimate
terrible
knowledge
because
it
might
affect
me
and
disney
and
he
want
to
be
fully
transparent
the
emotion
with
which
he
talk
about
his
son
and
his
need
to
live
long
enough
to
see
him
graduate
from
high
school
and
begin
his
life
as
an
adult
after
the
funeral
laurene
come
up
to
me
and
say
i
ve
never
told
my
side
of
that
story
she
described
steve
come
home
that
night
we
have
dinner
and
then
the
kid
left
the
dinner
table
and
i
say
to
steve
so
do
you
tell
him
i
told
him
and
i
say
can
we
trust
him
we
be
stand
there
with
steve
s
grave
behind
us
and
laurene
who
d
just
bury
her
husband
give
me
a
gift
that
i
ve
thought
about
nearly
every
day
since
i
ve
certainly
thought
of
steve
every
day
i
ask
him
if
we
could
trust
you
laurene
say
and
steve
say
i
love
that
guy
the
feel
be
mutual


when
i
go
up
to
cupertino
to
talk
with
steve
about
marvel
he
ask
if
i
be
look
at
anything
else
i
mention
lucasfilm
and
he
say
you
should
just
call
george
steve
have
bought
pixar
from
george
lucas
and
he
and
george
have
be
close
for
year
you
never
know
he
say
george
might
be
interested
the
two
of
us
should
go
to
his
ranch
and
have
lunch
with
him
one
day
we
never
do
make
that
lunch
steve
soon
become
too
sick
and
his
involvement
in
disney
s
business
wan
but
lucas
have
be
at
the
top
of
our
acquisition
list
ever
since
we
d
complete
the
marvel
deal
and
i
d
be
think
about
how
to
approach
george
in
a
way
that
wouldn
t
offend
him
with
the
suggestion
that
he
sell
us
the
marvelous
world
that
he
d
create
michael
eisner
have
make
a
licensing
agreement
with
george
back
in
the
mid
s
to
build
star
war
and
indiana
jones
theme
attraction
at
our
park
and
in
may
we
be
reopen
the
star
war
attraction
star
tour
they
re
call
in
disney
world
and
disneyland
after
a
yearlong
refurbish
i
knew
george
be
go
to
orlando
to
rededicate
the
attraction
as
a
favor
to
the
company
and
his
friend
in
imagineering
and
i
decide
to
join
him
with
the
occasional
exception
i
normally
leave
the
opening
of
new
attraction
to
the
head
of
park
and
resort
but
i
thought
this
might
give
me
a
chance
to
at
least
float
the
idea
with
george
and
get
some
sense
of
whether
he
d
ever
consider
sell
to
us
our
relationship
go
back
to
my
day
run
abc
entertainment
after
the
success
of
twin
peak
some
of
the
most
respect
director
in
hollywood
start
express
interest
in
make
television
series
with
us
i
met
with
george
and
he
pitch
an
idea
for
a
show
that
would
follow
a
young
indiana
jones
as
he
travel
around
the
world
each
episode
will
be
a
history
lesson
george
say
indy
would
interact
with
historical
figure
like
churchill
and
freud
and
degas
and
mata
hari
i
give
him
a
very
fast
yes
and
in
we
put
the
young
indiana
jones
chronicle
on
monday
night
as
a
lead
in
to
monday
night
football
the
show
open
to
big
number
but
over
time
the
audience
lose
interest
in
the
historical
lesson
and
rating
fell
but
george
have
deliver
everything
he
d
say
he
would
and
i
felt
that
because
of
that
and
because
this
be
george
lucas
it
deserve
a
second
season
and
another
chance
to
catch
on
with
viewer
it
never
do
but
george
have
be
grateful
at
the
time
that
i
d
give
the
show
that
chance
on
the
day
of
the
rededication
of
star
tour
in
orlando
i
set
up
a
breakfast
with
him
at
the
brown
derby
which
be
near
the
attraction
in
our
hollywood
studio
park
the
restaurant
doesn
t
normally
open
before
lunch
but
i
ask
them
to
set
up
a
table
just
for
us
so
we
would
have
privacy
when
george
and
his
fianc
e
mellody
hobson
arrive
they
be
surprised
to
see
that
no
one
be
there
but
me
we
sat
down
and
have
a
lovely
breakfast
and
about
halfway
through
it
i
ask
george
if
he
d
ever
thought
about
sell
i
try
to
be
clear
and
direct
without
offend
him
he
be
sixty
eight
year
old
at
the
time
and
i
say
i
don
t
want
to
be
fatalistic
george
and
please
stop
me
if
you
would
rather
not
have
this
conversation
but
i
think
it
s
worth
put
this
on
the
table
what
happens
down
the
road
you
don
t
have
any
heir
who
be
go
to
run
the
company
for
you
they
may
control
it
but
they
re
not
go
to
run
it
shouldn
t
you
determine
who
protects
or
carry
on
your
legacy
he
nod
as
i
talk
i
m
not
really
ready
to
sell
he
say
but
you
re
right
and
if
i
decide
to
there
isn
t
anyone
i
want
to
sell
to
but
you
he
recall
young
indiana
jones
and
how
much
he
appreciate
that
i
d
give
the
show
a
chance
even
when
it
didn
t
have
the
rating
and
then
he
brought
up
what
we
d
do
with
pixar
which
at
some
point
steve
must
have
spoken
to
him
about
you
do
that
right
he
say
you
take
care
of
them
if
i
get
around
to
it
you
re
the
only
call
i
ll
make
he
say
something
else
that
i
kept
in
mind
in
every
subsequent
conversation
we
have
when
i
die
the
first
line
of
my
obituary
be
go
to
read
star
war
creator
george
lucas
it
be
so
much
a
part
of
who
he
be
which
of
course
i
knew
but
have
him
look
into
my
eye
and
say
it
like
that
underscored
the
most
important
factor
in
these
conversation
this
wasn
t
negotiate
to
buy
a
business
it
be
negotiate
to
be
the
keeper
of
george
s
legacy
and
i
need
to
be
ultra
sensitive
to
that
at
all
time
much
to
the
chagrin
of
kevin
mayer
and
some
others
at
disney
who
be
lust
after
lucasfilm
because
like
marvel
and
pixar
before
it
it
fit
so
perfectly
into
our
strategy
i
decide
not
to
reach
out
to
george
after
our
discussion
in
florida
if
the
conversation
go
forward
it
would
have
to
be
because
he
decide
he
want
it
i
have
such
respect
and
affection
for
george
and
i
need
him
to
know
this
be
in
his
hand
so
we
wait
about
seven
month
after
that
breakfast
george
call
me
and
say
i
d
like
to
have
lunch
to
talk
more
about
that
thing
we
talk
about
in
orlando
we
met
for
lunch
at
disney
in
burbank
and
i
let
george
lead
the
conversation
he
quickly
get
down
to
business
and
say
he
d
be
think
about
our
conversation
and
be
ready
to
get
serious
about
sell
then
he
say
he
want
the
pixar
deal
i
be
thrill
he
be
open
to
explore
an
acquisition
but
i
understood
what
he
meant
by
the
pixar
deal
and
it
be
immediately
clear
that
the
negotiation
wasn
t
go
to
be
easy
we
already
sense
lucasfilm
be
potentially
quite
valuable
for
us
but
it
wasn
t
worth
billion
at
least
not
base
on
our
analysis
at
that
point
when
we
be
pursue
pixar
there
be
six
movie
already
in
vary
stage
of
production
and
a
general
sense
of
when
they
would
be
release
that
meant
they
would
generate
revenue
and
profit
quickly
pixar
also
come
with
a
big
group
of
world
class
engineer
season
director
artist
and
writer
and
a
real
production
infrastructure
lucas
have
many
talented
employee
particularly
on
the
tech
side
but
no
director
other
than
george
and
no
film
development
or
production
pipeline
as
far
as
we
knew
we
d
do
some
work
try
to
figure
out
their
value
and
kevin
and
i
have
discussion
about
what
we
might
pay
but
because
they
weren
t
a
publicly
trade
company
their
financial
information
wasn
t
accessible
and
there
be
a
lot
we
didn
t
know
or
couldn
t
see
our
analysis
be
built
on
a
set
of
guess
and
from
those
we
try
to
build
a
financial
model
value
their
library
of
film
and
television
show
their
publishing
and
licensing
asset
their
brand
which
be
dominate
by
star
war
and
their
special
effect
business
industrial
light
and
magic
which
george
have
found
year
earlier
to
provide
the
dazzle
special
effect
for
his
film
we
then
project
what
we
might
do
if
we
own
them
which
be
pure
conjecture
we
guess
we
could
produce
and
release
a
star
war
film
every
other
year
in
the
first
six
year
after
acquire
them
but
it
would
take
us
time
to
get
start
since
we
didn
t
detect
that
anything
be
in
development
this
analysis
take
place
in
early
so
we
estimate
our
first
star
war
release
would
be
in
may
if
we
could
acquire
them
quickly
other
film
would
follow
in
and
then
we
estimate
what
the
global
box
office
of
the
film
would
bring
in
which
be
even
more
conjecture
since
the
last
star
war
film
revenge
of
the
sith
be
release
in
seven
year
earlier
kevin
give
me
a
collection
of
review
from
all
of
the
previously
release
film
and
a
rundown
of
what
they
earn
and
we
settle
on
at
least
a
billion
dollar
in
global
box
office
for
our
first
three
film
next
we
tackle
their
licensing
business
star
war
remain
very
popular
with
kid
particularly
young
boy
who
be
still
assemble
lego
millennium
falcon
and
play
with
lightsabers
add
that
licensing
business
to
our
consumer
product
business
would
be
quite
valuable
but
we
have
no
access
to
the
actual
revenue
be
generate
from
licensing
lastly
we
consider
what
we
might
do
at
our
theme
park
give
the
fact
that
we
be
already
pay
lucasfilm
for
the
right
to
the
star
tour
attraction
in
three
of
our
location
i
have
big
dream
about
what
we
might
build
but
we
decide
to
ascribe
little
or
no
value
to
them
because
there
be
too
many
unknown
in
george
s
mind
lucasfilm
be
as
valuable
as
pixar
but
even
from
our
relatively
uninformed
analysis
they
weren
t
they
might
be
someday
but
it
would
take
year
of
work
to
get
it
there
and
we
d
still
have
to
make
great
film
i
didn
t
want
to
offend
him
but
i
didn
t
want
to
lead
him
on
either
the
bad
thing
you
can
do
when
enter
into
a
negotiation
be
to
suggest
or
promise
something
because
you
know
the
other
person
want
to
hear
it
only
to
have
to
reverse
course
later
you
have
to
be
clear
about
where
you
stand
from
the
begin
i
knew
if
i
mislead
george
simply
to
begin
the
bargaining
process
or
to
keep
the
conversation
go
it
would
ultimately
backfire
on
me
so
i
say
right
away
there
s
no
way
this
be
a
pixar
deal
george
and
i
explain
why
recall
my
visit
to
pixar
early
on
and
the
richness
of
creativity
that
i
discover
he
be
momentarily
take
aback
and
i
thought
the
discussion
might
end
right
there
instead
he
say
well
then
what
do
we
do
i
told
him
we
need
to
look
closely
at
lucasfilm
and
we
need
his
cooperation
we
d
sign
a
confidentiality
agreement
and
we
would
do
it
in
a
way
that
wouldn
t
raise
too
many
question
within
his
company
we
just
need
your
cfo
or
someone
who
know
the
financial
structure
to
walk
us
through
it
i
say
i
have
a
small
team
that
will
go
in
there
and
do
it
quickly
we
ll
keep
it
very
quiet
other
than
a
few
people
your
employee
won
t
know
that
we
re
snoop
around
typically
the
price
we
pay
for
asset
doesn
t
vary
much
from
what
we
believe
the
value
to
be
in
the
first
place
it
s
often
possible
to
start
low
and
hope
to
pay
far
less
than
what
you
re
value
an
asset
at
but
in
the
process
you
risk
alienate
the
person
you
re
negotiate
with
i
don
t
mess
around
when
it
come
to
these
thing
i
told
george
we
would
quickly
arrive
at
a
number
that
we
believe
his
company
be
worth
and
one
that
i
believe
i
could
sell
to
the
board
to
our
shareholder
and
to
wall
street
and
whatever
that
number
be
i
say
i
m
not
go
to
come
in
low
and
negotiate
toward
the
middle
i
m
go
to
do
it
the
way
i
do
it
with
steve
george
allow
us
the
access
we
need
but
at
the
end
of
that
process
we
still
found
ourselves
struggle
to
settle
on
a
firm
valuation
a
lot
of
our
concern
have
to
do
with
how
to
ass
our
own
ability
to
begin
make
good
movie
and
quickly
we
hadn
t
begin
to
form
a
long
term
creative
vision
because
we
have
no
creative
people
assign
to
the
task
we
have
nothing
really
which
meant
there
be
a
lot
of
creative
risk
and
hit
the
schedule
we
d
set
for
ourselves
and
which
our
financial
analysis
be
base
on
would
be
daunt
and
maybe
impossible
i
eventually
call
george
and
told
him
we
have
narrow
it
down
to
a
price
range
and
we
still
need
time
to
home
in
on
a
specific
price
it
would
be
between
billion
and
billion
george
have
come
way
down
from
his
pixar
price
but
i
could
tell
he
be
not
go
to
accept
anything
low
than
marvel
i
met
with
kevin
and
his
team
and
we
look
at
our
analysis
again
we
didn
t
want
to
falsely
raise
our
box
office
estimate
but
even
at
the
top
end
of
the
range
i
d
give
george
there
be
some
room
for
us
to
pay
more
though
it
would
put
a
lot
more
pressure
on
the
timing
and
performance
of
the
film
could
we
make
three
in
six
year
these
be
star
war
film
and
we
would
have
to
be
very
careful
ultimately
kevin
and
i
decide
we
could
afford
billion
or
slightly
above
what
we
paid
for
marvel
and
george
immediately
agree
then
the
more
difficult
negotiation
begin
over
what
george
s
creative
involvement
would
be
in
pixar
s
case
the
entire
acquisition
be
predicate
on
john
and
ed
s
continued
involvement
not
just
with
pixar
but
with
disney
animation
john
become
chief
creative
officer
but
he
still
report
to
me
with
marvel
i
d
met
with
kevin
feige
and
the
rest
of
their
team
and
i
knew
what
they
have
in
the
work
and
we
d
begin
collaborate
closely
to
determine
the
future
of
marvel
film
with
lucas
there
be
only
one
person
with
creative
control
george
he
want
to
retain
that
control
without
become
an
employee
it
would
have
be
a
dereliction
of
my
responsibility
to
spend
more
than
billion
and
then
say
essentially
this
be
still
yours
go
ahead
and
make
whatever
movie
you
want
to
make
on
whatever
timeline
you
can
make
them
few
people
in
the
film
business
command
as
much
respect
as
george
star
war
have
only
ever
be
his
no
matter
how
much
he
understood
intellectually
that
he
be
sell
the
company
and
it
didn
t
make
sense
that
he
would
retain
creative
control
his
entire
self
be
wrap
up
in
the
fact
that
he
be
responsible
for
what
be
perhaps
the
great
mythology
of
our
time
that
s
a
hard
thing
to
let
go
and
i
be
deeply
sensitive
to
that
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
be
insult
him
i
also
knew
we
couldn
t
spend
this
money
and
do
what
george
want
and
that
say
that
to
him
would
put
the
whole
deal
at
risk
that
be
exactly
what
happen
we
agree
to
a
price
quickly
but
then
we
negotiate
back
and
forth
for
several
month
over
what
his
role
would
be
it
be
difficult
for
him
to
cede
control
of
the
ongoing
star
war
saga
and
it
make
no
sense
for
us
not
to
have
it
we
go
over
and
over
the
same
ground
george
say
he
couldn
t
just
hand
over
his
legacy
me
say
we
couldn
t
buy
it
and
not
control
it
and
twice
walk
away
from
the
table
and
call
the
deal
off
we
walk
the
first
time
and
george
walk
the
second
at
some
point
in
the
process
george
told
me
that
he
have
complete
outline
for
three
new
movie
he
agree
to
send
us
three
copy
of
the
outline
one
for
me
one
for
alan
braverman
and
one
for
alan
horn
who
d
just
be
hire
to
run
our
studio
alan
horn
and
i
read
george
s
outline
and
decide
we
need
to
buy
them
though
we
make
clear
in
the
purchase
agreement
that
we
would
not
be
contractually
obligate
to
adhere
to
the
plot
line
he
d
laid
out
it
be
an
upcoming
change
in
capital
gain
law
that
eventually
salvage
the
negotiation
if
we
didn
t
close
the
deal
by
the
end
of
george
who
own
lucasfilm
outright
would
take
a
roughly
million
hit
on
the
sale
if
he
be
go
to
sell
to
us
there
be
some
financial
urgency
to
come
to
an
agreement
quickly
he
knew
that
i
be
go
to
stand
firm
on
the
question
of
creative
control
but
it
wasn
t
an
easy
thing
for
him
to
accept
and
so
he
reluctantly
agree
to
be
available
to
consult
with
us
at
our
request
i
promise
that
we
would
be
open
to
his
idea
this
be
not
a
hard
promise
to
make
of
course
we
would
be
open
to
george
lucas
s
idea
but
like
the
outline
we
would
be
under
no
obligation
on
october
george
come
to
my
office
and
we
sat
at
my
desk
and
sign
an
agreement
for
disney
to
buy
lucasfilm
he
be
do
everything
he
could
not
to
show
it
but
i
could
tell
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
look
in
his
eye
how
emotional
it
be
for
him
he
be
signing
away
star
war
after
all


a
few
month
before
we
close
the
deal
george
hire
the
producer
kathy
kennedy
to
run
lucasfilm
kathy
have
cofounded
amblin
entertainment
along
with
her
husband
frank
marshall
and
steven
spielberg
and
have
produce
e
t
and
the
jurassic
park
franchise
and
dozen
of
critical
and
commercial
hit
it
be
an
interest
move
on
george
s
part
we
be
on
the
verge
of
buying
the
company
but
he
suddenly
decide
who
be
go
to
run
it
and
ultimately
produce
the
upcoming
film
it
didn
t
upset
us
but
it
do
come
as
a
surprise
just
as
it
surprised
kathy
to
learn
that
the
company
she
be
agree
to
run
be
about
to
be
sell
kathy
be
a
legendary
producer
and
she
have
be
a
great
partner
and
this
be
one
final
way
for
george
to
put
someone
in
whom
he
trust
to
be
the
steward
of
his
legacy
the
deal
close
at
the
end
of
and
kathy
alan
and
i
begin
search
for
a
creative
team
we
eventually
convince
j
j
abrams
to
direct
our
first
star
war
movie
and
hire
michael
arndt
who
d
write
toy
story
and
little
miss
sunshine
to
write
the
script
j
j
and
i
have
dinner
soon
after
he
decide
to
take
on
the
project
we
d
know
each
other
from
back
in
the
abc
day
he
d
make
alias
and
lose
for
us
among
other
thing
and
it
be
important
to
me
to
sit
down
and
acknowledge
what
we
both
knew
that
the
stake
on
this
project
be
high
than
anything
either
of
us
have
ever
do
before
i
joked
at
some
point
during
dinner
that
this
be
a
billion
movie
meaning
that
the
whole
acquisition
depend
on
its
success
which
j
j
later
told
me
wasn
t
funny
at
all
i
know
how
he
appreciate
that
i
have
as
much
skin
in
this
one
as
he
do
though
and
we
could
share
the
burden
of
what
it
meant
to
be
responsible
for
the
first
star
war
film
not
make
by
george
lucas
in
all
of
our
interaction
from
initial
conversation
about
how
the
myth
should
unfold
to
visit
to
the
set
and
the
edit
room
i
try
to
communicate
to
j
j
that
i
be
a
partner
in
the
project
and
not
just
a
ceo
put
pressure
on
him
to
deliver
a
great
film
and
a
big
box
office
success
there
be
more
than
enough
pressure
to
go
around
for
both
of
us
and
i
want
him
to
feel
that
he
could
call
me
at
any
moment
to
discus
any
problem
he
be
wrestling
with
and
that
i
would
call
him
with
idea
that
i
have
i
be
a
resource
for
him
and
a
collaborator
but
not
someone
who
need
to
put
my
stamp
on
this
film
out
of
vanity
or
title
or
obligation
luckily
we
have
similar
sensibility
and
taste
and
we
mostly
agree
on
what
be
problematic
and
what
be
work
over
the
lengthy
development
and
production
process
in
los
angeles
and
then
at
the
pinewood
studio
in
london
in
iceland
in
scotland
and
in
abu
dhabi
j
j
prove
to
be
a
great
collaborator
and
never
lose
sight
of
the
enormity
of
the
project
or
the
tremendous
burden
it
carry
with
george
with
star
war
fan
with
the
press
and
with
our
investor
there
s
no
rule
book
for
how
to
manage
this
kind
of
challenge
but
in
general
you
have
to
try
to
recognize
that
when
the
stake
of
a
project
be
very
high
there
s
not
much
to
be
gain
from
put
additional
pressure
on
the
people
work
on
it
project
your
anxiety
onto
your
team
be
counterproductive
it
s
subtle
but
there
s
a
difference
between
communicate
that
you
share
their
stress
that
you
re
in
it
with
them
and
communicate
that
you
need
them
to
deliver
in
order
to
alleviate
your
stress
no
one
on
this
project
need
remind
of
what
be
at
stake
my
job
be
to
not
let
us
lose
sight
of
our
ambition
when
we
confront
creative
and
practical
obstacle
and
to
help
us
get
to
solution
in
the
best
possible
way
sometimes
that
meant
allocate
more
resource
sometimes
it
meant
talk
through
new
draft
of
a
script
or
watch
endless
daily
and
numerous
cut
of
the
film
often
it
just
meant
remind
j
j
and
kathy
kennedy
and
alan
horn
that
i
believe
in
all
of
them
and
there
be
no
well
hand
for
this
film
to
be
in
that
s
not
to
say
it
be
a
smooth
ride
from
the
start
early
on
kathy
brought
j
j
and
michael
arndt
up
to
northern
california
to
meet
with
george
at
his
ranch
and
talk
about
their
idea
for
the
film
george
immediately
get
upset
as
they
begin
to
describe
the
plot
and
it
dawn
on
him
that
we
weren
t
use
one
of
the
story
he
submit
during
the
negotiation
the
truth
be
kathy
j
j
alan
and
i
have
discuss
the
direction
in
which
the
saga
should
go
and
we
all
agree
that
it
wasn
t
what
george
have
outline
george
knew
we
weren
t
contractually
bound
to
anything
but
he
thought
that
our
buying
the
story
treatment
be
a
tacit
promise
that
we
d
follow
them
and
he
be
disappointed
that
his
story
be
be
discard
i
d
be
so
careful
since
our
first
conversation
not
to
mislead
him
in
any
way
and
i
didn
t
think
i
have
now
but
i
could
have
handle
it
well
i
should
have
prepared
him
for
the
meeting
with
j
j
and
michael
and
told
him
about
our
conversation
that
we
felt
it
be
well
to
go
in
another
direction
i
could
have
talk
through
this
with
him
and
possibly
avoid
anger
him
by
not
surprising
him
now
in
the
first
meeting
with
him
about
the
future
of
star
war
george
felt
betrayed
and
while
this
whole
process
would
never
have
be
easy
for
him
we
d
gotten
off
to
an
unnecessarily
rocky
start


there
be
other
struggle
on
top
of
george
s
feeling
about
the
film
michael
wrestle
with
the
screenplay
for
month
and
eventually
j
j
and
kathy
make
the
decision
to
replace
him
with
larry
kasdan
who
d
co
write
the
empire
strike
back
and
return
of
the
jedi
with
george
as
well
as
raider
of
the
lose
ark
and
the
big
chill
and
many
others
larry
and
j
j
complete
a
draft
fairly
quickly
and
we
begin
shoot
in
the
spring
of
we
d
originally
plan
to
release
the
movie
in
may
but
because
of
those
early
script
delay
and
some
other
complication
later
on
we
didn
t
release
it
until
december
this
move
it
out
of
our
fiscal
year
and
into
our
fiscal
year
my
presentation
to
the
board
prior
to
the
acquisition
and
our
disclosure
to
investor
assure
them
that
we
would
begin
to
see
a
return
on
investment
in
turn
out
not
to
be
true
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
move
out
of
one
fiscal
year
and
into
the
next
this
be
not
a
huge
deal
but
it
have
to
be
dealt
with
one
of
the
big
mistake
that
i
ve
see
film
studio
make
be
get
lock
into
a
release
date
and
then
let
that
influence
creative
decision
often
rush
movie
into
production
before
they
re
ready
i
ve
try
hard
not
to
give
in
to
calendar
pressure
it
s
well
to
give
up
a
release
date
and
keep
work
to
make
a
well
movie
and
we
ve
always
try
to
put
quality
before
everything
else
even
if
it
mean
take
a
short
term
hit
to
our
bottom
line
in
this
case
the
last
thing
we
want
to
do
be
put
out
a
movie
that
didn
t
live
up
to
the
expectation
of
star
war
fan
the
star
war
fan
base
be
so
passionate
and
it
be
vital
that
we
give
them
something
they
love
and
felt
worthy
of
their
devotion
if
we
didn
t
get
that
right
on
our
first
star
war
film
we
d
suffer
a
breach
of
trust
with
our
audience
that
would
be
very
hard
to
recover
from
just
prior
to
the
global
release
kathy
screen
the
force
awakens
for
george
he
didn
t
hide
his
disappointment
there
s
nothing
new
he
say
in
each
of
the
film
in
the
original
trilogy
it
be
important
to
him
to
present
new
world
new
story
new
character
and
new
technology
in
this
one
he
say
there
weren
t
enough
visual
or
technical
leap
forward
he
wasn
t
wrong
but
he
also
wasn
t
appreciate
the
pressure
we
be
under
to
give
ardent
fan
a
film
that
felt
quintessentially
star
war
we
d
intentionally
create
a
world
that
be
visually
and
tonally
connect
to
the
earlier
film
to
not
stray
too
far
from
what
people
love
and
expect
and
george
be
criticize
us
for
the
very
thing
we
be
try
to
do
look
back
with
the
perspective
of
several
year
and
a
few
more
star
war
film
i
believe
j
j
achieve
the
near
impossible
create
a
perfect
bridge
between
what
have
be
and
what
be
to
come
on
top
of
george
s
reaction
there
be
a
lot
of
speculation
in
the
press
and
from
die
hard
fan
about
how
we
be
go
to
disney
fy
star
war
as
with
marvel
i
make
the
decision
not
to
put
disney
anywhere
in
the
film
credit
or
the
marketing
campaign
and
to
not
in
any
way
change
the
star
war
logo
disney
pixar
make
sense
from
an
animation
branding
perspective
but
lucas
fan
need
to
be
reassure
that
we
too
be
fan
first
respectful
of
the
creator
and
look
to
expand
on
his
legacy
not
usurp
it
even
though
he
have
issue
with
the
film
i
thought
it
be
important
for
george
to
be
at
the
force
awakens
premiere
he
didn
t
want
to
come
at
first
but
kathy
with
the
help
of
george
s
now
wife
mellody
hobson
convince
him
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
among
the
last
thing
we
negotiate
before
the
deal
close
be
a
non
disparagement
clause
i
ask
george
to
agree
that
he
wouldn
t
publicly
criticize
any
of
the
star
war
film
we
make
when
i
brought
it
up
with
him
he
say
i
m
go
to
be
a
big
shareholder
of
the
walt
disney
company
why
would
i
disparage
you
or
anything
you
do
you
have
to
trust
me
i
take
him
at
his
word
the
question
now
be
how
to
handle
the
premiere
i
want
the
world
to
know
that
this
be
j
j
s
movie
and
kathy
s
movie
and
it
be
our
first
star
war
movie
it
certainly
be
by
far
the
big
film
we
d
release
since
i
become
ceo
we
held
a
gigantic
premiere
in
the
dolby
theatre
where
the
academy
award
take
place
i
go
onstage
first
and
before
i
brought
j
j
and
kathy
out
with
me
i
say
we
re
all
here
because
of
one
person
who
create
the
great
mythology
of
our
time
and
then
entrust
it
to
the
walt
disney
company
george
be
in
his
seat
he
get
a
long
rapturous
stand
ovation
willow
be
sit
in
the
row
behind
him
and
take
a
wonderful
picture
of
him
surround
by
a
few
thousand
people
all
on
their
foot
i
be
happy
to
look
at
it
later
and
see
how
pleased
and
grateful
george
be
at
the
outpouring
of
admiration
for
him
the
movie
open
and
set
a
slew
of
box
office
record
and
we
all
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
our
first
star
war
film
be
behind
us
and
the
star
war
faithful
appear
to
have
love
it
shortly
after
the
release
though
an
interview
george
have
do
a
few
week
earlier
with
charlie
rise
air
george
talk
about
his
frustration
that
we
hadn
t
follow
his
outline
and
say
that
sell
to
disney
be
like
sell
his
child
to
white
slaver
it
be
an
unfortunate
and
awkward
way
for
him
to
describe
the
feel
of
have
sell
something
that
he
consider
his
child
i
decide
to
stay
quiet
and
let
it
pas
there
be
nothing
to
be
gain
from
engage
in
any
public
discourse
or
wag
a
defense
mellody
sent
me
an
apologetic
email
explain
how
difficult
this
have
all
be
for
him
then
george
call
me
i
be
out
of
line
he
say
i
shouldn
t
have
say
it
like
that
i
be
try
to
explain
how
hard
it
be
to
let
this
thing
go
i
told
him
i
understood
four
and
a
half
year
earlier
i
d
sat
with
george
at
breakfast
and
try
to
convey
that
i
knew
how
difficult
this
would
be
for
him
but
that
when
he
be
ready
he
could
trust
me
all
of
the
negotiation
over
the
money
and
then
over
the
question
of
his
ongoing
involvement
with
star
war
be
exercise
in
balance
my
respect
for
what
george
have
do
and
how
deeply
personal
i
knew
this
be
for
him
with
my
responsibility
to
the
company
i
could
empathize
with
george
but
i
couldn
t
give
him
what
he
want
at
every
step
of
the
way
it
be
necessary
to
be
clear
about
where
i
stood
while
be
sensitive
toward
how
emotional
the
entire
process
be
for
him
look
back
on
the
acquisition
of
pixar
marvel
and
lucasfilm
the
thread
that
run
through
all
of
them
other
than
that
take
together
they
transform
disney
be
that
each
deal
depend
on
building
trust
with
a
single
control
entity
there
be
complicate
issue
to
negotiate
in
all
of
the
deal
and
our
respective
team
spent
long
day
and
week
reach
agreement
on
them
but
the
personal
component
of
each
of
these
deal
be
go
to
make
or
break
them
and
authenticity
be
crucial
steve
have
to
believe
my
promise
that
we
would
respect
the
essence
of
pixar
ike
need
to
know
that
the
marvel
team
would
be
value
and
give
the
chance
to
thrive
in
their
new
company
and
george
have
to
trust
that
his
legacy
his
baby
would
be
in
good
hand
at
disney
chapter
if
you
don
t
innovate
you
die
after
the
dust
settle
on
the
last
of
our
big
three
acquisition
we
begin
to
focus
even
more
on
the
dramatic
change
we
be
experience
in
our
medium
business
and
the
profound
disruption
we
be
feel
the
future
of
those
business
have
begin
to
seriously
worry
us
and
we
conclude
it
be
time
for
us
to
start
deliver
our
content
in
new
and
modern
way
and
to
do
so
without
intermediary
on
our
own
technology
platform
the
question
for
us
be
could
we
find
the
technology
we
need
to
accomplish
that
and
be
at
the
forefront
of
change
rather
than
simply
be
undone
by
it
do
we
have
the
stomach
to
start
cannibalize
our
own
still
profitable
business
in
order
to
begin
building
a
new
model
could
we
disrupt
ourselves
and
would
wall
street
tolerate
the
loss
that
we
would
inevitably
incur
as
we
try
to
truly
modernize
and
transform
the
company
we
have
to
do
it
i
be
sure
of
that
it
be
the
old
lesson
all
over
again
about
the
need
to
constantly
innovate
so
the
next
question
be
do
we
build
a
tech
platform
or
do
we
buy
one
kevin
mayer
warn
me
that
building
one
would
take
five
year
and
would
be
a
massive
investment
buying
one
would
give
us
the
ability
to
pivot
immediately
and
the
speed
at
which
everything
be
change
make
clear
that
patience
be
not
an
option
when
we
look
at
acquisition
google
apple
amazon
and
facebook
be
obviously
off
the
table
give
their
size
and
as
far
as
we
knew
none
of
them
be
look
to
buy
us
although
i
do
believe
that
if
steve
be
still
alive
we
would
have
combine
our
company
or
at
least
discuss
the
possibility
very
seriously
what
be
left
be
snapchat
spotify
and
twitter
they
be
all
digestible
in
term
of
size
but
who
be
potentially
for
sale
and
who
deliver
the
quality
we
need
to
reach
our
consumer
most
effectively
and
rapidly
we
land
on
twitter
we
be
less
interested
in
them
as
a
social
medium
company
than
as
a
new
distribution
platform
with
global
reach
which
we
could
use
to
deliver
movie
television
sport
and
news
in
the
summer
of
we
express
interest
to
twitter
they
be
intrigue
but
felt
they
have
an
obligation
to
test
the
market
and
so
we
reluctantly
enter
into
an
auction
to
buy
them
by
early
fall
we
d
virtually
close
a
deal
twitter
s
board
support
the
sale
and
on
a
friday
afternoon
in
october
our
board
give
their
approval
to
finalize
a
deal
then
that
weekend
i
decide
not
to
go
through
with
it
if
earlier
acquisition
especially
pixar
be
about
trust
my
instinct
that
it
be
the
right
thing
for
the
company
the
acquisition
of
twitter
be
the
opposite
of
that
something
inside
me
didn
t
feel
right
echo
in
my
head
be
something
tom
murphy
have
say
to
me
year
earlier
if
something
doesn
t
feel
right
to
you
then
it
s
probably
not
right
for
you
i
could
see
clearly
how
the
platform
could
work
to
serve
our
new
purpose
but
there
be
brand
related
issue
that
gnawed
at
me
twitter
be
a
potentially
powerful
platform
for
us
but
i
couldn
t
get
past
the
challenge
that
would
come
with
it
the
challenge
and
controversy
be
almost
too
much
to
list
but
they
include
how
to
manage
hate
speech
and
make
fraught
decision
regard
freedom
of
speech
what
to
do
about
fake
account
algorithmically
spew
out
political
message
to
influence
election
and
the
general
rage
and
lack
of
civility
that
be
sometimes
evident
on
the
platform
those
would
become
our
problem
they
be
so
unlike
any
we
d
encounter
and
i
felt
they
would
be
corrosive
to
the
disney
brand
on
the
sunday
after
the
board
have
just
give
me
the
go
ahead
to
pursue
the
acquisition
of
twitter
i
sent
a
note
to
all
of
the
member
tell
them
i
have
cold
foot
and
explain
my
reason
for
withdraw
then
i
call
jack
dorsey
twitter
s
ceo
who
be
also
a
member
of
the
disney
board
jack
be
stun
but
very
polite
i
wish
jack
luck
and
i
hung
up
feel
relieve


around
the
same
time
that
we
enter
into
the
twitter
negotiation
we
also
invest
in
a
company
call
bamtech
which
be
primarily
own
by
major
league
baseball
and
have
perfect
a
stream
technology
that
allow
fan
to
subscribe
to
an
online
service
and
watch
all
of
their
favorite
team
game
live
they
d
also
be
hire
after
hbo
fail
to
build
its
own
stream
service
to
come
in
and
under
intense
time
pressure
build
hbo
now
in
time
for
the
release
of
season
five
of
game
of
throne
in
august
we
agree
to
pay
about
billion
for
a
percent
stake
in
the
company
with
an
option
to
buy
a
control
interest
in
the
initial
plan
be
to
address
the
threat
to
espn
s
business
by
create
a
subscription
service
that
would
exist
alongside
the
program
on
espn
s
network
but
as
tech
company
invest
more
deeply
in
their
entertainment
subscription
service
the
urgency
for
us
to
create
direct
to
consumer
bundle
not
just
for
sport
but
for
television
and
movie
intensified
ten
month
later
in
june
we
held
our
annual
board
retreat
at
walt
disney
world
in
orlando
the
yearly
retreat
be
an
extend
board
meeting
in
which
we
present
our
five
year
plan
include
financial
projection
and
discus
specific
strategic
issue
and
challenge
we
decide
to
spend
the
entire
session
talk
about
disruption
and
i
instruct
each
of
our
business
leader
to
present
to
the
board
the
level
of
disruption
they
be
see
and
what
impact
they
predict
it
would
have
on
the
health
of
their
business
i
knew
the
board
would
demand
solution
and
as
a
general
rule
i
don
t
like
to
lay
out
problem
without
offering
a
plan
for
address
them
this
be
something
i
exhort
my
team
to
do
too
it
s
okay
to
come
to
me
with
problem
but
also
offer
possible
solution
so
after
detail
the
change
we
be
both
experience
and
project
we
then
present
to
the
board
a
bold
aggressive
comprehensive
solution
we
would
accelerate
our
option
to
buy
a
control
stake
in
bamtech
and
then
use
that
platform
to
launch
disney
and
an
espn
direct
to
consumer
over
the
top
video
stream
service
the
board
not
only
support
the
plan
but
urge
me
to
move
as
quickly
as
possible
say
speed
be
of
the
essence
this
be
also
an
endorsement
for
populate
board
with
people
who
be
not
only
wise
and
confident
in
their
opinion
but
also
have
direct
and
relevant
experience
of
current
market
dynamic
in
our
case
mark
parker
from
nike
and
mary
barra
from
general
motor
be
two
perfect
example
both
have
witness
profound
disruption
to
their
business
and
both
be
keenly
aware
of
the
peril
of
not
adapt
quickly
to
change
i
met
with
my
team
immediately
after
the
board
retreat
and
give
them
the
feedback
i
receive
instruct
kevin
to
move
quickly
to
purchase
control
of
bamtech
and
tell
everyone
else
to
prepare
for
a
significant
strategic
shift
into
the
stream
business
on
our
august
earnings
call
exactly
two
year
after
a
fateful
call
in
which
we
d
watch
our
stock
get
clobber
as
i
spoke
frankly
about
disruption
we
announce
that
we
be
accelerate
our
agreement
to
buy
full
control
of
bamtech
and
we
share
our
plan
to
launch
two
stream
service
one
for
espn
in
and
one
for
disney
in
this
time
our
stock
soar
investor
understood
our
strategy
and
recognize
both
the
need
for
change
and
the
opportunity
that
exist


that
announcement
marked
the
begin
of
the
reinvention
of
the
walt
disney
company
we
would
continue
support
our
television
channel
in
the
traditional
space
for
as
long
as
they
continued
to
generate
decent
return
and
we
would
continue
to
present
our
film
on
big
screen
in
movie
theater
all
over
the
world
but
we
be
now
fully
commit
to
also
become
a
distributor
of
our
own
content
straight
to
consumer
without
intermediary
in
essence
we
be
now
hasten
the
disruption
of
our
own
business
and
the
short
term
loss
be
go
to
be
significant
as
one
example
pull
all
of
our
tv
show
and
movie
include
pixar
and
marvel
and
star
war
from
netflix
s
platform
and
consolidate
them
all
under
our
own
subscription
service
would
mean
sacrifice
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
in
licensing
fee
at
some
point
over
the
year
i
refer
to
a
concept
i
call
management
by
press
release
meaning
that
if
i
say
something
with
great
conviction
to
the
outside
world
it
tends
to
resonate
powerfully
inside
our
company
the
investment
community
s
reaction
in
be
overwhelmingly
negative
but
speak
candidly
about
the
reality
puncture
our
denial
and
motivate
people
within
disney
to
conclude
he
s
serious
about
this
so
we
well
be
too
the
call
have
a
similarly
bracing
effect
the
team
knew
how
serious
i
be
about
do
this
but
hearing
it
communicate
broadly
particularly
to
investor
and
witness
the
reaction
to
it
fuel
everyone
with
the
energy
and
the
commitment
to
move
forward
before
we
d
make
the
announcement
i
d
assume
we
would
transition
to
the
new
model
in
baby
step
slowly
building
the
apps
and
determine
what
content
would
live
on
them
now
because
the
response
be
so
positive
the
entire
strategy
take
on
a
great
sense
of
urgency
there
be
now
expectation
that
we
have
to
live
up
to
that
meant
add
pressure
but
it
also
give
me
a
powerful
communication
tool
within
the
company
where
there
would
naturally
be
some
resistance
to
change
so
much
so
fast
the
decision
to
disrupt
business
that
be
fundamentally
work
but
whose
future
be
in
question
intentionally
take
on
short
term
loss
in
the
hope
of
generate
long
term
growth
require
no
small
amount
of
courage
routine
and
priority
get
disrupt
job
change
responsibility
be
reallocate
people
can
easily
become
unsettled
as
their
traditional
way
of
do
business
begin
to
erode
and
a
new
model
emerges
it
s
a
lot
to
manage
from
a
personnel
perspective
and
the
need
to
be
present
for
your
people
which
be
a
vital
leadership
quality
under
any
circumstance
be
heighten
even
more
it
s
easy
for
leader
to
send
a
signal
that
their
schedule
be
too
full
their
time
too
valuable
to
be
deal
with
individual
problem
and
concern
but
be
present
for
your
people
and
make
sure
they
know
that
you
re
available
to
them
be
so
important
for
the
morale
and
effectiveness
of
a
company
with
a
company
the
size
of
disney
this
can
mean
travel
around
the
world
and
hold
regular
town
hall
style
meeting
with
our
various
business
unit
communicate
my
think
and
respond
to
concern
but
it
also
mean
respond
in
a
timely
way
and
be
thoughtful
about
any
issue
brought
to
me
by
my
direct
report
return
phone
call
and
reply
to
email
make
the
time
to
talk
through
specific
problem
be
sensitive
to
the
pressure
people
be
feel
all
of
this
become
an
even
more
significant
part
of
the
job
as
we
embark
on
this
new
uncertain
path
we
immediately
begin
work
on
two
front
in
the
wake
of
our
august
announcement
on
the
tech
side
the
team
at
bamtech
along
with
a
group
that
be
already
in
place
at
disney
start
building
the
interface
for
our
new
service
espn
and
disney
for
the
next
several
month
kevin
and
i
met
in
new
york
and
los
angeles
with
the
team
at
bamtech
to
test
various
iteration
of
the
app
analyze
the
size
and
color
and
placement
of
the
tile
hone
the
experience
of
move
through
the
app
to
make
it
more
instinctive
and
easy
to
use
determine
how
the
algorithm
and
data
collection
would
function
as
well
as
how
our
content
and
brand
would
be
present
at
the
same
time
back
in
l
a
we
be
put
a
team
together
to
develop
and
produce
the
content
that
would
be
available
on
disney
we
have
a
vast
library
of
film
and
tv
show
though
we
have
to
buy
back
some
right
that
we
d
license
to
third
party
over
the
year
but
the
big
question
be
what
original
content
would
we
make
for
these
new
service
i
met
with
the
head
of
our
movie
studio
and
television
operation
to
determine
what
project
in
our
pipeline
would
be
release
in
theater
or
place
on
our
tv
channel
and
what
would
go
on
the
app
what
new
project
would
we
create
expressly
for
the
service
include
original
star
war
and
marvel
and
pixar
story
that
would
feel
as
ambitious
as
anything
we
make
i
brought
together
the
senior
people
from
all
of
our
studio
and
told
them
i
don
t
want
to
create
a
new
studio
to
make
product
for
disney
i
want
you
to
do
it
these
be
all
executive
who
have
be
train
for
year
to
grow
their
own
business
and
be
compensate
base
on
their
profitability
suddenly
i
be
say
to
them
essentially
i
want
you
to
pay
less
attention
to
the
business
at
which
you
ve
be
very
successful
and
start
pay
more
attention
to
this
other
thing
and
by
the
way
you
have
to
work
on
this
new
thing
along
with
these
other
very
competitive
people
from
other
team
whose
interest
don
t
necessarily
line
up
with
yours
and
one
more
thing
it
won
t
make
money
for
a
while
in
order
to
get
them
all
on
board
i
not
only
have
to
reinforce
why
these
change
be
necessary
but
i
also
have
to
create
an
entirely
new
incentive
structure
to
reward
them
for
their
work
i
couldn
t
penalize
them
for
the
purposeful
erosion
and
disruption
of
their
business
and
yet
there
be
no
early
bottom
line
metric
to
ass
success
in
the
new
business
we
be
ask
them
to
work
more
considerably
more
and
if
we
be
use
traditional
compensation
method
earn
less
that
would
not
work
i
go
to
our
board
s
compensation
committee
and
explain
the
dilemma
when
you
innovate
everything
need
to
change
not
just
the
way
you
make
or
deliver
a
product
many
of
the
practice
and
structure
within
the
company
need
to
adapt
too
include
in
this
case
how
the
board
reward
our
executive
i
propose
a
radical
idea
essentially
that
i
would
determine
compensation
base
on
how
much
they
contribute
to
this
new
strategy
even
though
without
easily
measure
financial
result
this
be
go
to
be
far
more
subjective
than
our
typical
compensation
practice
i
propose
stock
grant
that
would
vest
or
mature
base
on
my
own
assessment
of
whether
executive
be
step
up
to
make
this
new
initiative
successful
the
committee
be
skeptical
at
first
we
d
never
do
anything
like
that
i
know
why
company
fail
to
innovate
i
say
to
them
at
one
point
it
s
tradition
tradition
generates
so
much
friction
every
step
of
the
way
i
talk
about
the
investment
community
which
so
often
punishes
establish
company
for
reduce
profit
under
any
circumstance
which
often
lead
business
to
play
it
safe
and
keep
do
what
they
ve
be
do
rather
than
spend
capital
in
order
to
generate
long
term
growth
or
adapt
to
change
there
s
even
you
i
say
a
board
that
doesn
t
know
how
to
grant
stock
because
there
s
only
one
way
we
ve
ever
do
it
at
every
stage
we
be
swim
upstream
it
s
your
choice
i
say
do
you
want
to
fall
prey
to
the
innovator
s
dilemma
or
do
you
want
to
fight
it
they
likely
would
have
come
around
even
without
the
rouse
speech
i
ve
have
a
great
relationship
with
our
board
and
they
ve
be
supportive
of
nearly
everything
i
ve
want
to
do
but
while
i
be
finish
my
diatribe
one
member
of
the
committee
say
i
move
on
it
and
another
second
immediately
result
in
approval
of
my
plan
i
go
back
to
our
executive
and
explain
how
the
new
stock
plan
would
work
i
would
decide
at
the
end
of
each
year
how
much
stock
would
vest
and
that
it
be
go
to
be
base
not
on
revenue
but
on
how
well
they
be
able
to
work
together
i
don
t
want
any
politics
i
say
this
be
too
important
it
s
for
the
good
of
the
company
and
it
s
good
for
you
i
need
you
to
step
up


less
than
two
week
after
the
august
earnings
call
and
our
bamtech
announcement
i
get
a
call
from
rupert
murdoch
ask
me
to
come
by
his
house
late
one
afternoon
for
a
glass
of
wine
rupert
life
in
bel
air
in
a
beautiful
s
home
that
overlook
his
winery
moraga
vineyard
he
and
i
come
from
very
different
world
we
re
of
different
generation
we
have
different
political
view
but
we
ve
long
respect
each
other
s
business
instinct
and
i
ve
always
be
impressed
with
how
he
built
his
medium
and
entertainment
empire
from
scratch
since
when
i
become
ceo
rupert
and
i
would
occasionally
get
together
for
a
meal
or
a
drink
we
be
both
partner
in
hulu
so
sometimes
we
d
have
specific
business
to
discus
more
often
we
d
just
chat
about
the
change
medium
landscape
and
catch
up
with
each
other
when
he
invite
me
to
come
to
his
house
though
i
suspect
rupert
be
probe
whether
i
be
consider
a
run
for
the
white
house
there
be
already
a
fair
amount
of
chatter
about
my
interest
in
politics
and
the
possibility
of
my
explore
a
run
for
the
presidency
some
member
of
the
trump
administration
include
kellyanne
conway
and
anthony
scaramucci
have
raise
the
question
with
people
within
our
company
so
i
suspect
rupert
want
to
find
out
for
himself
if
this
be
true
i
have
always
be
interested
in
politics
and
policy
and
i
often
thought
about
serve
the
country
after
i
left
disney
many
people
have
plant
idea
in
my
head
over
the
year
about
what
office
i
might
run
for
include
the
presidency
which
intrigue
me
but
also
have
an
absurd
ring
to
it
before
the
election
i
be
convince
america
be
ready
to
elect
someone
from
outside
the
political
system
that
there
be
rampant
dissatisfaction
with
traditional
politics
include
our
political
party
and
like
our
business
government
and
politics
be
be
profoundly
disrupt
donald
trump
s
victory
be
proof
at
least
in
part
that
my
premonition
be
correct
at
the
time
i
met
with
rupert
i
have
in
fact
be
explore
a
run
for
the
presidency
even
though
i
knew
it
be
a
terrific
long
shot
i
d
spoken
with
a
couple
dozen
influential
people
within
the
democratic
party
a
few
former
member
of
the
obama
administration
some
member
of
congress
pollster
and
fundraiser
and
staffer
from
previous
presidential
campaign
i
also
start
study
like
crazy
reading
paper
and
article
about
everything
from
healthcare
to
taxation
from
immigration
law
to
international
trade
policy
to
environmental
issue
to
middle
eastern
history
and
federal
interest
rate
i
also
read
some
of
the
great
speech
ever
deliver
include
ronald
reagan
s
speech
on
the
fortieth
anniversary
of
d
day
robert
kennedy
s
impromptu
speech
in
indianapolis
when
martin
luther
king
jr
be
kill
franklin
roosevelt
s
and
john
f
kennedy
s
inauguration
speech
obama
s
speech
after
the
massacre
at
the
a
m
e
church
in
charleston
south
carolina
and
numerous
churchill
address
i
even
reread
the
constitution
and
the
bill
of
right
i
don
t
know
if
this
be
a
sign
that
i
should
or
shouldn
t
run
but
i
be
wake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
nightmare
about
be
on
a
debate
stage
and
feel
unprepared
i
be
also
try
not
to
be
presumptuous
the
simple
fact
that
i
ran
a
large
multinational
company
do
not
necessarily
qualify
me
to
be
president
of
the
united
state
nor
do
it
create
a
clear
or
easy
path
to
win
so
i
be
far
from
commit
to
do
it
in
actuality
i
be
skeptical
of
the
democratic
party
s
willingness
and
ability
to
support
a
successful
business
person
when
i
walk
into
rupert
s
home
we
sat
down
and
an
aide
pour
us
wine
then
the
first
thing
he
say
be
be
you
run
for
president
well
i
thought
i
be
right
about
that
but
i
have
no
desire
to
be
candid
with
rupert
about
my
think
figure
it
would
end
up
on
fox
news
so
i
say
no
i
m
not
a
lot
of
people
have
talk
with
me
about
it
and
i
have
give
it
some
consideration
but
it
s
a
crazy
idea
and
it
s
very
unlikely
i
would
ever
give
it
a
try
plus
i
say
my
wife
hate
the
thought
of
it
that
be
true
at
one
point
willow
have
joked
you
can
run
for
any
office
you
want
but
not
with
this
wife
she
knew
me
well
enough
to
know
the
challenge
would
appeal
to
me
but
she
be
terribly
worried
about
what
it
would
mean
for
our
family
and
our
life
sometime
later
she
say
that
she
d
married
me
for
well
or
bad
so
if
you
feel
you
have
to
do
it
i
ll
stand
by
you
but
with
tremendous
reluctance
i
wonder
what
rupert
and
i
would
talk
about
for
the
rest
of
our
time
together
but
he
proceed
to
spend
most
of
the
next
hour
talk
about
the
threat
to
our
respective
business
the
incursion
of
big
tech
company
the
speed
at
which
thing
be
change
how
much
scale
matter
he
be
clearly
worried
about
the
future
of
st
century
fox
we
don
t
have
scale
he
say
several
time
the
only
company
that
have
scale
be
you
as
i
say
goodbye
to
him
that
even
i
couldn
t
help
but
think
he
be
signal
an
interest
in
do
the
unthinkable
i
call
alan
braverman
on
my
drive
home
and
say
i
just
met
with
rupert
i
think
he
might
be
interested
in
sell
i
ask
alan
to
start
make
a
list
of
all
of
the
fox
asset
that
from
a
regulatory
perspective
we
could
or
couldn
t
buy
and
i
call
kevin
mayer
to
tell
him
about
the
meeting
and
get
his
initial
reaction
i
ask
kevin
to
assemble
a
list
too
and
to
start
think
about
the
feasibility
of
acquire
all
or
some
of
fox
s
asset
the
next
day
i
follow
up
with
a
phone
call
to
rupert
if
i
be
reading
you
right
if
i
say
we
be
interested
in
acquire
your
company
or
most
of
it
would
you
be
open
to
it
yes
he
say
be
you
seriously
interested
in
buying
i
told
him
i
be
intrigue
but
to
give
me
some
time
to
think
about
it
then
he
say
i
would
not
do
anything
unless
you
agree
to
remain
at
the
company
beyond
your
current
retirement
date
which
at
that
point
be
june
i
told
rupert
i
didn
t
think
our
board
would
ever
consider
an
acquisition
of
this
magnitude
unless
i
agree
to
extend
my
term
and
we
end
our
call
with
an
agreement
to
talk
again
in
a
few
week
i
suddenly
have
the
feel
that
my
life
be
about
to
change
and
a
run
for
the
presidency
wasn
t
go
to
be
the
catalyst


over
the
next
couple
of
week
alan
and
kevin
and
i
begin
to
wrap
our
mind
around
whether
a
fox
acquisition
be
possible
and
what
it
might
mean
for
us
alan
rule
out
several
fox
asset
right
away
rule
dictate
that
you
can
t
own
two
over
the
air
broadcast
network
in
the
united
state
it
s
a
little
date
and
silly
in
today
s
world
but
it
s
the
rule
so
the
fox
television
network
be
off
the
table
we
compete
with
their
two
primary
sport
network
so
own
them
would
result
in
too
much
market
share
in
the
business
so
we
wouldn
t
be
buying
them
then
there
be
fox
news
this
be
one
of
rupert
s
prize
possession
so
i
never
expect
him
to
offer
it
up
plus
i
didn
t
see
us
buying
it
if
we
ran
it
as
it
be
we
would
be
the
scourge
of
the
left
and
if
we
dare
try
to
move
it
to
the
center
we
would
be
the
scourge
of
the
right
it
didn
t
matter
what
i
thought
about
fox
news
though
since
there
be
no
way
rupert
be
ever
go
to
put
it
on
the
table
there
be
some
other
small
asset
but
those
be
the
big
one
that
be
off
limit
that
left
us
with
a
broad
portfolio
of
asset
the
movie
studio
include
fox
searchlight
picture
their
stake
in
hulu
which
would
give
us
a
majority
stake
in
that
platform
the
fx
network
the
regional
fox
sport
network
which
we
would
later
have
to
divest
a
control
stake
in
national
geographic
a
sprawl
and
varied
set
of
international
operation
particularly
in
india
and
a
percent
stake
in
sky
europe
s
large
and
most
successful
satellite
platform
kevin
be
tasked
with
do
a
financial
and
strategic
analysis
of
these
asset
in
very
basic
term
that
mean
put
together
a
team
to
do
a
painstaking
examination
of
all
of
the
business
not
only
look
at
how
they
be
perform
at
the
moment
but
project
what
they
would
do
in
the
future
and
how
they
would
perform
in
the
disruptive
world
we
be
now
witness
we
also
brought
in
our
newly
name
cfo
christine
mccarthy
who
have
not
be
involve
in
our
previous
acquisition
but
be
eager
to
pitch
in
on
this
one
and
it
be
go
to
challenge
her
to
the
extreme
once
we
get
a
sense
of
the
present
and
future
worth
of
their
business
the
next
question
be
what
be
these
two
company
worth
together
how
could
we
mine
more
value
by
combine
them
clearly
there
would
be
efficiency
by
run
them
together
for
instance
we
would
now
have
two
movie
studio
but
under
one
umbrella
they
could
be
run
more
efficiently
then
there
s
leverage
in
the
marketplace
what
improve
access
to
market
would
we
achieve
because
of
suddenly
own
more
local
asset
they
have
a
big
business
in
india
for
instance
where
we
have
only
nascent
operation
and
they
d
already
place
big
bet
on
direct
to
consumer
business
there
they
also
have
a
great
television
studio
and
have
invest
heavily
in
creative
talent
and
we
lag
far
behind
them
as
with
our
other
acquisition
we
assess
their
talent
would
bring
in
their
people
lead
to
more
success
for
our
business
the
answer
be
a
resound
yes
the
upshot
be
that
we
estimate
that
the
combine
company
would
be
worth
billion
more
than
the
two
separately
that
number
grow
even
large
when
the
corporate
tax
law
change
kevin
give
me
a
fairly
comprehensive
look
at
the
whole
thing
then
say
there
be
some
great
asset
there
bob
i
know
there
be
a
ton
of
asset
i
say
but
what
s
the
narrative
it
s
yours
kevin
say
we
hadn
t
even
begin
to
negotiate
but
the
gear
in
kevin
s
mind
be
already
turn
it
s
your
narrative
high
quality
content
technology
global
reach
it
get
even
great
he
say
when
you
view
all
of
those
asset
through
the
lens
of
our
new
strategy
they
could
be
pivotal
to
our
future
growth
kevin
alan
and
christine
all
give
me
their
support
to
move
forward
with
rupert
even
though
it
would
represent
an
acquisition
far
big
than
pixar
marvel
and
lucasfilm
combine
the
potential
felt
almost
limitless
and
so
do
the
risk
chapter
no
price
on
integrity
rupert
s
decision
to
sell
be
a
direct
response
to
the
same
force
that
lead
us
to
create
an
entirely
new
strategy
for
our
company
as
he
ponder
the
future
of
his
company
in
such
a
disrupt
world
he
conclude
the
smartest
thing
to
do
be
to
sell
and
give
his
shareholder
and
his
family
a
chance
to
convert
its
st
century
fox
stock
into
disney
stock
believe
we
be
well
position
to
withstand
the
change
and
combine
we
d
be
even
strong
it
s
hard
to
overstate
how
sweep
the
disruption
be
in
our
industry
but
his
decision
to
break
up
a
company
he
d
built
from
almost
nothing
be
as
good
a
marker
as
any
of
its
inevitability
just
as
rupert
and
i
be
enter
the
begin
phase
of
what
would
become
an
almost
two
year
journey
to
close
a
massive
deal
that
would
alter
the
medium
landscape
a
transformative
social
change
be
also
under
way
one
more
profound
than
the
mega
technology
change
we
be
experience
numerous
serious
allegation
about
thoroughly
unacceptable
behavior
specifically
in
our
industry
become
the
catalyst
for
long
overdue
action
about
sexually
predatory
behavior
and
about
equal
opportunity
and
equal
pay
for
woman
in
hollywood
and
elsewhere
specific
and
horrific
allegation
against
harvey
weinstein
open
the
floodgate
and
embolden
many
others
to
come
forward
with
their
own
claim
of
abuse
nearly
every
company
in
the
entertainment
industry
have
to
contend
with
and
adjudicate
complaint
within
their
organization
at
disney
we
always
believe
it
be
vital
to
create
and
maintain
an
environment
in
which
people
felt
safe
but
it
be
clear
now
that
we
need
to
do
even
more
to
make
sure
that
anyone
who
d
be
abuse
or
anyone
who
d
witness
abuse
could
come
forward
know
their
claim
would
be
heard
take
seriously
act
upon
and
they
would
be
protect
from
retribution
we
felt
an
urgent
need
to
ass
whether
our
standard
and
our
value
be
be
adhere
to
and
so
i
charge
our
human
resource
team
with
do
a
thorough
analysis
which
include
opening
a
dialogue
and
put
in
place
process
at
all
level
of
the
company
that
would
allow
for
candor
and
would
reinforce
our
promise
to
protect
anyone
who
come
forward
in
the
fall
of
we
heard
complaint
about
john
lasseter
from
woman
and
men
at
pixar
about
what
they
described
as
unwanted
physical
contact
everyone
knew
john
as
a
hugger
and
while
many
dismiss
this
behavior
as
innocuous
it
quickly
become
evident
the
feel
be
not
unanimous
i
d
spoken
with
john
about
this
some
year
back
but
these
new
allegation
be
more
serious
and
it
be
clear
to
me
that
he
have
to
be
confront
alan
horn
and
i
met
with
john
in
november
of
that
year
and
together
we
agree
that
the
best
course
be
for
him
to
take
a
six
month
leave
to
reflect
on
his
behavior
and
give
us
time
to
ass
the
situation
john
issue
a
statement
to
his
team
before
he
left
collectively
you
mean
the
world
to
me
he
write
and
i
deeply
apologize
if
i
have
let
you
down
i
especially
want
to
apologize
to
anyone
who
have
ever
be
on
the
receive
end
of
an
unwanted
hug
or
any
other
gesture
they
felt
cross
the
line
in
any
way
shape
or
form
no
matter
how
benign
my
intent
everyone
have
the
right
to
set
their
own
boundary
and
have
them
respect
in
john
s
absence
we
put
a
leadership
structure
in
place
at
pixar
and
disney
animation
and
we
conduct
dozen
of
interview
with
people
at
both
studio
to
determine
what
be
best
for
the
organization


the
next
six
month
work
on
our
direct
to
consumer
strategy
contend
with
high
profile
personnel
issue
and
analyze
and
negotiate
a
fox
deal
be
as
challenge
as
any
stretch
of
my
career
i
grow
increasingly
convince
that
what
fox
have
in
term
of
content
global
reach
talent
and
technology
would
be
transformative
for
us
if
we
could
acquire
them
and
integrate
them
quickly
and
smoothly
while
execute
our
direct
to
consumer
vision
a
daunt
series
of
ifs
disney
would
be
face
the
future
in
a
strong
position
than
it
have
ever
be
in
as
our
discussion
proceed
rupert
have
three
thing
in
mind
the
first
be
that
of
the
possible
company
that
might
be
interested
in
buying
fox
disney
provide
the
most
likely
path
to
regulatory
approval
the
second
be
the
value
of
disney
stock
he
could
continue
to
have
a
control
interest
in
fox
as
it
struggle
among
much
big
fish
or
he
could
have
a
piece
of
a
much
more
robust
combine
company
the
third
be
his
confidence
that
we
could
integrate
the
two
company
smoothly
and
set
the
newly
combine
company
on
a
dynamic
path
among
rupert
s
many
challenge
as
we
negotiate
throughout
the
fall
of
be
manage
the
decision
with
his
son
lachlan
and
james
they
d
watch
their
father
build
the
company
since
they
be
kid
hop
and
assume
that
someday
it
would
be
theirs
now
he
be
sell
it
to
someone
else
it
wasn
t
an
easy
situation
for
any
of
them
and
my
stance
from
the
outset
be
to
let
rupert
manage
his
family
dynamic
and
stay
focus
on
the
business
aspect
of
our
discussion
throughout
that
fall
kevin
mayer
and
i
met
several
time
with
rupert
and
his
cfo
john
nallen
we
d
determine
that
we
be
willing
to
make
an
all
stock
offer
of
a
share
or
billion
for
the
acquisition
in
the
month
after
our
initial
conversation
with
rupert
word
have
leak
that
he
be
contemplate
a
sale
which
invite
others
to
start
consider
an
acquisition
comcast
emerge
as
our
competitor
make
an
all
stock
bid
that
be
considerably
high
than
ours
we
be
confident
that
even
though
comcast
s
initial
bid
be
high
the
fox
board
would
still
favor
us
in
part
because
of
the
regulatory
challenge
comcast
be
likely
to
face
they
already
own
nbc
universal
as
well
as
one
of
the
large
distribution
business
in
the
country
and
they
be
likely
to
face
intense
regulatory
scrutiny
at
the
end
of
thanksgiving
weekend
kevin
and
i
met
rupert
and
john
once
more
at
the
winery
in
bel
air
the
four
of
us
go
for
a
long
walk
through
row
of
grapevine
near
the
end
of
the
walk
rupert
inform
us
that
he
wouldn
t
go
below
a
share
which
translate
to
about
billion
more
than
we
want
to
spend
i
suspect
that
he
thought
i
be
worried
about
comcast
s
offer
and
would
feel
the
need
to
go
high
as
much
as
i
want
to
make
the
deal
though
i
be
willing
to
walk
away
from
it
i
be
enamor
of
many
part
of
their
company
and
have
begin
imagine
in
detail
what
they
could
do
for
our
new
business
but
there
be
huge
executional
risk
involve
make
it
all
work
be
go
to
require
an
enormous
amount
of
time
and
energy
even
if
we
could
execute
a
deal
and
get
regulatory
approval
and
successfully
merge
the
two
company
there
be
still
plenty
of
unknown
in
the
marketplace
that
concerned
me
i
be
also
torn
about
remain
at
the
company
for
what
would
be
three
more
year
would
this
be
good
for
me
or
for
disney
i
wasn
t
completely
sure
but
i
didn
t
have
much
time
to
think
about
it
by
the
end
of
the
meeting
i
felt
it
be
vital
that
we
get
all
of
the
possible
value
out
of
the
deal
so
i
told
rupert
as
we
be
leave
twenty
eight
be
as
high
as
we
can
go
i
don
t
know
if
rupert
be
surprised
that
i
be
hold
my
ground
but
kevin
worried
we
would
lose
the
deal
by
not
go
up
i
felt
confident
we
would
prevail
though
that
the
risk
of
go
with
comcast
be
too
big
for
them
and
when
i
come
into
the
office
on
monday
morning
i
told
kevin
to
call
nallen
and
tell
him
we
need
an
answer
by
the
close
of
business
at
the
end
of
the
day
rupert
call
and
accepted
our
bid
and
invite
me
back
to
his
winery
lachlan
be
also
there
and
i
wonder
how
it
must
all
be
settle
with
him
to
toast
the
deal
we
spent
the
next
two
week
iron
out
fine
point
and
then
i
flew
to
london
for
the
premiere

the
last
jedi
on
december
while
there
i
go
to
rupert
s
office
to
take
a
picture
of
us
shake
hand
on
his
balcony
which
would
be

along
with
an
announcement

in
anticipation

be
about
to
unfold
finally
that
afternoon
jayne
come
into
my
office
to
have
the
conversation
that
we
d
punt
on
the
day
before
she
told
me
that
john
skipper
have
admit
to
a
drug
problem
which
have
lead
to
other
serious
complication
in
his
life
and
could
potentially
jeopardize
the
company
i
schedule
a
call
with
john
the
next
day
then
go
home
and
because
i
d
schedule
it
long
before
i
ever
could
have
know
that
all
of
these
thing
would
converge
at
the
same
time
skyped
with
a
group
of
student
at
ithaca
college
my
alma
mater
about
the
future
of
the
entertainment
and
medium
industry
the
next
morning
john
and
i
talk
he
admit
that
he
have
terrible
personal
issue
and
i
told
him
that
base
on
what
jayne
have
described
and
what
he
d
confirm
we
need
him
to
resign
the
follow
monday
i
regard
john
highly
he
be
smart
and
worldly
and
be
a
talented
loyal
executive
this
be
a
clear
example
though
of
how
a
company
s
integrity
depends
on
the
integrity
of
its
people
and
while
i
have
great
personal
affection
and
concern
for
him
he
d
make
choice
that
violate
disney
policy
it
be
a
painful
decision
to
let
him
go
but
the
right
one
even
if
it
meant
that
as
we
enter
what
be
the
most
tax
stretch
for
the
company
and
for
me
since
i
d
become
ceo
we
be
now
without
leader
in
two
of
our
most
important
business
espn
and
animation


the
agreement
with
rupert
set
the
complicate
process
of
seek
regulatory
approval
in
motion
this
involves
a
series
of
filing
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission
lay
out
the
detail
of
the
deal
the
financial
aspect
for
both
company
as
well
as
a
tick
clock
that
transparently
narrates
how
the
deal
transpire
include
in
our
case
a
description
of
the
initial
meeting
with
rupert
and
all
of
our
subsequent
conversation
once
the
sec
approves
the
filing
each
company
then
mail
a
proxy
ballot
to
its
shareholder
which
include
all
of
the
detail
in
the
filing
and
a
recommendation
from
each
company
s
board
that
its
shareholder
approve
the
deal
it
also
stipulates
a
voting
period
which
end
with
a
shareholder
meeting
at
which
all
of
the
vote
be
count
this
whole
process
can
take
up
to
six
month
and
during
this
period
other
entity
can
make
compete
bid
as
complex
as
our
deal
be
we
assume
we
have
a
clean
path
to
regulatory
approval
which
again
be
part
of
why
fox
s
board
have
approve
our
bid
over
comcast
s
in
the
first
place
and
fox
s
shareholder
would
ratify
it
at
their
meeting
that
be
schedule
for
june
there
be
only
one
possible
hitch
as
all
of
this
move
forward
a
district
court
judge
in
new
york
be
contemplate
a
lawsuit
brought
by
the
department
of
justice
against
at
t
to
block
its
acquisition
of
time
warner
comcast
be
watch
this
carefully
if
the
judge
rule
in
favor
of
the
justice
department
and
the
deal
be
block
comcast
would
conclude
that
they
too
would
face
a
similar
hurdle
and
their
hope
for
make
another
bid
for
fox
would
be
dead
if
at
t
won
however
they
could
be
embolden
to
come
back
with
a
high
offer
assume
that
fox
s
board
and
shareholder
would
no
longer
be
dissuade
by
the
regulatory
obstacle
all
we
could
do
be
go
forward
under
the
assumption
that
we
would
be
acquire
fox
and
begin
prepare
for
that
reality
shortly
after
we
agree
to
the
deal
with
rupert
i
begin
focus
on
the
question
of
exactly
how
we
would
merge
these
two
huge
company
we
couldn
t
just
add
them
to
what
already
exist
we
have
to
integrate
them
carefully
in
order
to
preserve
and
create
value
so
i
ask
myself
what
would
could
or
should
the
new
company
look
like
if
i
be
to
erase
history
and
build
something
totally
new
today
with
all
of
these
asset
how
would
it
be
structure
i
come
back
from
our
christmas
holiday
and
drag
a
whiteboard
into
the
conference
room
next
to
my
office
and
begin
to
play
around
it
be
the
first
time
i
d
stood
before
a
whiteboard
since
i
be
with
steve
job
in
the
first
thing
i
do
be
separate
content
from
technology
we
would
have
three
content
group
movie
walt
disney
animation
disney
studio
pixar
marvel
lucasfilm
twentieth
century
fox
fox
fox
searchlight
television
abc
abc
news
our
television
station
disney
channel
freeform
fx
national
geographic
and
sport
espn
all
of
that
go
on
the
left
side
of
the
whiteboard
on
the
other
side
go
tech
apps
user
interface
customer
acquisition
and
retention
data
management
sale
distribution
and
so
on
the
idea
be
simply
to
let
the
content
people
focus
on
creativity
and
let
the
tech
people
focus
on
how
to
distribute
thing
and
for
the
most
part
generate
revenue
in
the
most
successful
way
then
in
the
middle
of
the
board
i
write
physical
entertainment
and
good
an
umbrella
for
various
large
and
sprawl
business
consumer
product
disney
store
all
of
our
global
merchandise
and
licensing
agreement
cruise
resort
and
our
six
theme
park
business
i
step
back
and
look
at
the
board
and
thought
there
it
be
that
s
what
a
modern
medium
company
should
look
like
i
felt
energize
just
by
look
at
it
and
spent
the
next
few
day
refining
the
structure
on
my
own
at
the
end
of
that
week
i
invite
my
team
in
to
look
at
it
kevin
mayer
jayne
parker
alan
braverman
christine
mccarthy
and
nancy
lee
my
chief
of
staff
i
m
go
to
bounce
something
different
off
you
i
say
and
then
i
show
them
the
whiteboard
this
be
what
the
new
company
would
look
like
you
just
do
this
kevin
ask
yes
what
do
you
think
he
nod
yes
it
make
sense
the
task
now
be
to
put
the
right
name
in
the
right
place
the
moment
that
we
announce
the
deal
there
be
understandable
anxiety
throughout
both
company
about
who
would
run
what
who
would
report
to
whom
whose
role
would
expand
or
contract
and
how
throughout
the
winter
and
spring
i
travel
all
over
meeting
with
fox
executive
in
l
a
and
new
york
london
india
and
latin
america
get
to
know
them
and
their
business
fielding
their
question
and
alleviate
their
worry
and
gauge
them
against
their
disney
counterpart
once
the
shareholder
vote
assume
the
at
t
ruling
didn
t
break
comcast
s
way
i
would
have
to
make
a
lot
of
difficult
personnel
choice
very
quickly
and
i
need
to
be
prepared
to
start
restructuring
immediately


in
late
may
as
we
be
closing
in
on
the
judge
s
decision
and
soon
after
that
the
fox
shareholder
vote
i
arrive
at
my
office
a
little
before
a
m
and
open
an
email
from
ben
sherwood
the
president
of
abc
it
include
the
text
of
a
tweet
that
roseanne
barr
have
post
that
morning
in
which
she
say
that
valerie
jarrett
the
former
obama
administration
adviser
be
the
product
of
the
muslim
brotherhood
and
planet
of
the
ape
ben
s
message
read
we
have
a
serious
problem
here
this
be
completely
abhorrent
and
unacceptable
i
immediately
write
back
we
sure
do
i
m
in
the
office
i
m
not
sure
the
show
survives
this
a
year
earlier
in
may
we
d
announce
that
we
be
bring
roseanne
back
to
abc
prime
time
i
d
be
enthusiastic
about
the
idea
in
part
because
of
how
much
i
d
grown
to
like
roseanne
when
we
work
together
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
when
i
be
run
abc
entertainment
and
in
part
because
the
idea
of
the
show
that
it
would
reflect
a
range
of
political
reaction
to
the
controversial
subject
of
the
day
appeal
to
me
i
hadn
t
be
aware
of
the
controversial
tweet
that
roseanne
have
post
in
the
past
before
we
consider
bring
the
show
back
on
the
air
but
once
it
be
on
she
take
up
tweet
again
and
say
some
thoughtless
occasionally
offensive
thing
on
a
variety
of
subject
if
she
kept
it
up
it
would
be
a
problem
in
april
a
few
week
before
the
valerie
jarrett
tweet
i
have
lunch
with
her
it
couldn
t
have
be
nicer
roseanne
show
up
with
cooky
that
she
d
bake
for
me
and
she
spent
part
of
our
conversation
recall
that
i
be
one
of
the
few
people
in
her
corner
way
back
when
and
say
that
she
d
always
trust
me
near
the
end
of
the
lunch
i
say
to
her
you
ve
get
to
stay
off
twitter
the
show
be
get
incredible
rating
and
i
felt
personally
happy
to
see
her
thrive
again
you
ve
get
a
great
thing
go
here
i
say
don
t
blow
it
yes
bob
she
say
in
her
funny
drawn
out
nasal
voice
she
promise
me
that
she
wouldn
t
go
on
twitter
again
and
i
left
the
lunch
feel
reassure
that
she
understood
that
the
success
she
be
enjoy
then
be
rare
and
could
easily
go
away
what
i
d
forgotten
or
minimize
in
my
mind
be
how
unpredictable
and
volatile
roseanne
have
always
be
we
be
close
in
the
early
day
of
my
tenure
as
president
of
abc
entertainment
i
inherit
the
show
which
be
in
its
first
season
when
i
arrive
and
i
thought
she
be
wonderfully
talented
but
i
also
get
a
close
up
look
at
how
mercurial
and
volatile
she
could
be
there
be
time
when
she
be
so
depressed
she
couldn
t
get
out
of
bed
and
ted
harbert
and
i
would
sometimes
go
to
her
home
and
talk
with
her
until
she
get
go
maybe
it
be
something
to
do
with
my
father
and
his
depression
that
make
me
sympathetic
to
her
but
i
felt
the
need
to
look
out
for
her
and
she
appreciate
that
after
reading
ben
s
email
i
connect
with
zenia
alan
ben
and
channing
dungey
then
the
head
of
abc
entertainment
and
ask
them
what
they
thought
our
choice
be
they
be
consider
a
variety
of
response
which
range
from
a
suspension
and
loss
of
pay
to
a
severe
warn
and
public
rebuke
none
of
them
seem
enough
and
while
they
didn
t
mention
fire
her
i
knew
it
be
in
the
back
of
their
mind
we
don
t
have
a
choice
here
i
finally
say
we
have
to
do
what
s
right
not
what
s
politically
correct
and
not
what
s
commercially
correct
just
what
s
right
if
any
of
our
employee
tweet
what
she
tweet
they
d
be
immediately
terminate
i
told
them
to
feel
free
to
push
back
or
tell
me
i
be
crazy
but
no
one
do
zenia
draft
a
statement
that
channing
would
eventually
issue
i
call
valerie
jarrett
and
apologize
and
told
her
we
d
just
decide
to
cancel
the
show
and
would
be
make
an
announcement
in
fifteen
minute
she
thanked
me
and
then
call
back
later
to
say
she
be
schedule
to
be
on
msnbc
that
even
on
a
panel
about
racism
related
to
the
news
of
starbucks
closing
their
store
that
day
for
sensitivity
training
can
i
mention
that
you
call
me
she
ask
i
told
her
she
could
i
then
sent
an
email
to
the
disney
board
this
morning
we
all
woke
up
to
a
tweet
by
roseanne
barr
in
which
she
refer
to
valerie
jarrett
as
a
product
of
the
muslim
brotherhood
and
planet
of
the
ape
we
found
this
comment
no
matter
what
its
context
be
to
be
intolerable
and
deplorable
and
we
make
the
decision
to
cancel
roseanne
s
show
i
don
t
mean
to
stand
on
a
high
horse
but
as
a
company
we
have
always
try
to
do
what
we
felt
be
right
no
matter
what
the
politics
or
the
commerce
in
other
word
demand
quality
and
integrity
from
all
of
our
people
and
of
all
of
our
product
be
paramount
and
there
be
no
room
for
second
chance
or
for
tolerance
when
it
come
to
an
overt
transgression
that
discredit
the
company
in
any
way
roseanne
s
tweet
violate
that
tenet
and
our
only
choice
be
to
do
what
be
morally
right
a
statement
will
be
release
momentarily
it
be
an
easy
decision
really
i
never
ask
what
the
financial
repercussion
would
be
and
didn
t
care
in
moment
like
that
you
have
to
look
past
whatever
the
commercial
loss
be
and
be
guide
again
by
the
simple
rule
that
there
s
nothing
more
important
than
the
quality
and
integrity
of
your
people
and
your
product
everything
depends
on
uphold
that
principle
i
receive
a
fair
amount
of
praise
and
some
damnation
throughout
that
day
and
the
rest
of
the
week
i
take
heart
that
the
praise
come
from
many
quarter
head
of
studio

people
in

pursuit
of

century
fox
wore
on
john
lasseter
s
six
month
sabbatical
come
to
an
end
after
several
conversation
he
and
i
reach
the
conclusion
that
a
complete
exit
from
disney
be
wise
and
we
agree
to
a
high
level
of
confidentiality
regard
this
decision
this
be
the
most
difficult
and
complex
personnel
decision
i
have
manage
after
john
left
we
make
pete
docter
the
chief
creative
officer
at
pixar
and
jennifer
lee
who
write
and
direct
frozen
the
chief
creative
officer
of
walt
disney
animation
both
be
brilliant
beloved
inspire
people
and
their
leadership
have
be
a
silver
line
to
what
be
otherwise
a
painful
time
for
the
company
chapter
core
value
on
june
a
district
court
judge
in
low
manhattan
rule
in
favor
of
at
t
buying
time
warner
the
next
day
brian
robert
announce
comcast
s
new
offer
an
all
cash
bid
of
per
share
billion
to
our
per
share
not
only
be
the
number
significantly
high
but
the
all
cash
offer
would
be
attractive
to
many
shareholder
who
would
rather
have
cash
than
stock
suddenly
we
be
in
danger
of
lose
the
deal
that
we
d
be
dream
about
and
work
so
hard
on
for
the
past
six
month
the
fox
board
have
schedule
a
meeting
to
take
place
a
week
later
in
london
during
which
they
would
vote
on
the
comcast
offer
we
could
bid
again
and
we
need
to
decide
quickly
what
our
number
would
be
we
could
raise
our
bid
but
still
come
in
slightly
under
theirs
and
hope
that
their
board
would
continue
to
believe
that
the
path
to
regulatory
approval
despite
the
at
t
decision
be
still
easy
with
us
we
could
match
comcast
s
offer
and
hope
that
they
wouldn
t
scuttle
our
deal
for
an
equivalent
offer
even
if
many
investor
would
prefer
cash
over
stock
or
we
could
go
high
and
hope
that
comcast
didn
t
have
much
room
left
to
go
up
various
executive
and
banker
be
involve
in
the
discussion
all
of
them
be
advise
me
to
go
in
low
or
at
the
most
match
comcast
s
offer
and
bet
on
the
regulatory
issue
still
weigh
in
our
favor
i
decide
i
want
a
knockout
bid
and
the
board
give
me
approval
to
raise
our
number
and
do
just
that
meanwhile
alan
braverman
have
be
in
ongoing
discussion
with
the
justice
department
try
to
clear
a
way
to
regulatory
approval
should
we
prevail
in
the
bidding
war
for
fox
two
day
before
the
fox
board
be
set
to
vote
on
the
comcast
offer
i
flew
to
london
with
alan
kevin
christine
and
nancy
lee
i
make
sure
that
only
a
few
people
on
our
team
knew
what
our
bid
would
be
and
caution
everyone
that
confidentiality
be
critical
we
do
not
want
comcast
to
have
any
inkling
of
our
plan
to
bid
high
we
reserve
a
room
in
a
hotel
in
london
that
we
never
stay
in
under
different
name
i
don
t
know
if
it
s
true
but
some
people
told
us
that
comcast
sometimes
track
the
movement
of
competitor
private
jet
so
rather
than
fly
into
london
we
flew
first
to
belfast
where
we
then
charter
a
different
plane
for
the
short
jump
to
london
right
before
we
board
the
plane
to
london
i
call
rupert
and
say
i
want
to
have
a
meeting
with
you
tomorrow
late
the
next
afternoon
kevin
and
i
go
to
meet
with
rupert
and
john
nallen
at
rupert
s
office
the
four
of
us
sat
around
his
sleek
marble
table
look
out
on
the
balcony
where
he
and
i
have
pose
for
a
picture
back
in
december
i
get
right
to
the
matter
we
d
like
to
make
a
offer
i
say
half
cash
half
stock
i
told
him
that
this
be
as
far
as
we
could
go
as
for
the
price
i
suspect
that
comcast
could
possibly
go
high
than
what
they
d
already
bid
and
that
if
we
go
to
they
d
go
to
if
we
go
to
they
d
go
to
at
each
stage
convincing
themselves
that
it
s
only
a
little
more
until
eventually
we
d
go
up
to
per
share
whereas
if
we
start
at
they
d
have
to
think
hard
about
go
up
at
least
per
share
since
they
be
offering
all
cash
it
would
mean
borrowing
even
more
money
and
significantly
raise
their
debt
comcast
assume
the
fox
board
be
voting
on
their
offer
the
next
morning
instead
rupert
brought
our
new
offer
to
his
board
and
they
approve
it
when
their
meeting
end
they
inform
comcast
they
be
accept
our
new
bid
which
we
announce
jointly
and
immediately
we
need
to
explain
this
new
move
to
investor
but
we
didn
t
have
a
conference
room
set
up
in
london
because
we
didn
t
want
anyone
to
know
we
be
there
so
we
brought
a
speakerphone
into
my
hotel
room
and
held
the
investor
conference
call
from
there
it
be
a
surreal
scene
the
small
group
of
us
gather
in
a
hotel
room
as
christine
and
i
spoke
with
investor
while
on
the
television
set
in
the
background
cnbc
be
cover
the
news
we
have
just
make
shortly
after
we
make
our
final
bid
i
exhort
alan
braverman
to
see
if
he
could
reach
an
agreement
with
the
department
of
justice
regard
our
acquisition
he
knew
our
concentration
in
television
sport
and
own
the
fox
regional
sport
network
would
be
a
big
problem
we
decide
we
would
be
well
off
agree
to
divest
them
in
order
to
do
a
fast
deal
with
justice
which
be
what
happen
this
would
give
us
a
huge
advantage
over
comcast
who
could
still
have
a
complicate
and
lengthy
u
s
regulatory
process
on
top
of
their
need
to
beat
our
offer
in
a
matter
of
two
week
we
get
a
guarantee
from
the
doj
that
if
we
agree
to
sell
off
the
sport
network
they
would
not
sue
to
block
our
deal
that
guarantee
prove
to
be
crucial
after
the
fox
board
s
vote
a
new
proxy
along
with
the
board
s
unanimous
recommendation
to
vote
for
the
deal
be
sent
to
their
shareholder
the
vote
would
take
place
in
late
july
which
still
give
comcast
plenty
of
time
to
come
back
with
a
high
bid
it
be
a
nerve
rack
several
week
every
time
i
open
my
computer
or
look
at
email
or
turn
on
cnbc
i
expect
to
see
that
comcast
have
outbid
us
in
late
july
i
go
to
italy
with
kevin
for
three
day
of
meeting
and
from
there
back
to
london
we
be
in
a
car
in
london
when
i
receive
a
call
from
david
faber
the
host
of
cnbc
s
squawk
on
the
street
i
answer
the
phone
and
david
say
do
you
have
a
comment
on
this
statement
what
statement
comcast
s
statement
my
anxiety
immediately
spike
i
don
t
know
what
it
be
i
say
david
told
me
that
the
news
have
just
broken
brian
robert
announce
that
they
re
out
i
be
so
expect
him
to
say
that
they
d
topped
our
offer
that
my
instantaneous
reaction
be
holy
crap
i
pause
for
a
moment
then
dictate
a
more
formal
statement
to
him
you
can
tell
your
audience
you
told
me
i
say
which
he
do
and
he
also
told
them
i
d
say
holy
crap


before
we
could
actually
close
the
deal
we
still
need
to
contend
with
the
global
regulatory
process
outside
of
the
united
state
secure
approval
in
most
of
the
place
we
d
now
be
do
business
russia
and
china
and
ukraine
and
the
eu
india
and
south
korea
and
brazil
and
mexico
among
them
we
get
approval
one
region
at
a
time
over
the
course
of
month
until
finally
in
march
nineteen
month
after
my
first
conversation
with
rupert
we
officially
close
the
deal
and
begin
to
move
forward
as
one
company
it
all
happen
just
in
time
the
next
month
on
april
we
host
an
elaborate
highly
produce
painstakingly
rehearse
event
on
the
disney
lot
to
present
the
detail
of
our
new
direct
to
consumer
business
to
investor
it
would
have
be
a
very
different
meeting
if
we
hadn
t
close
the
fox
deal
in
time
as
it
be
though
hundred
of
investor
and
member
of
the
medium
fill
row
of
bleacher
in
one
of
our
soundstages
face
a
giant
stage
and
backdrop
we
d
promise
wall
street
that
when
we
be
ready
we
would
share
some
information
on
our
new
stream
service
that
lead
to
an
internal
debate
over
just
how
detailed
that
information
should
be
i
want
to
show
them
everything
we
d
be
candid
about
the
challenge
face
us
in
the
past
in
that
fateful
earnings
call
in
when
i
spoke
about
the
disruption
we
be
all
see
and
i
want
to
be
just
as
candid
now
about
what
we
d
do
to
face
that
disruption
to
embrace
it
and
become
disrupters
ourselves
i
want
to
show
them
the
content
we
d
create
and
the
technology
we
d
developed
to
deliver
it
it
be
also
crucial
to
demonstrate
how
fox
fit
perfectly
into
this
new
strategy
and
dramatically
fuel
it
transparency
about
how
much
this
would
cost
the
short
term
damage
it
would
do
to
our
bottom
line
and
what
we
project
the
long
term
gain
would
be
be
also
critical
i
take
the
stage
and
talk
only
for
about
a
minute
and
a
half
follow
a
beautifully
produce
film
we
d
make
to
showcase
the
history
of
these
two
newly
merge
company
disney
and
st
century
fox
it
be
our
way
of
say
we
re
move
in
a
new
direction
but
creativity
be
at
the
heart
of
what
we
do
for
year
and
year
these
two
company
have
make
extraordinary
indelible
entertainment
and
now
combine
we
would
do
that
more
emphatically
than
ever
this
gathering
be
a
bookend
to
my
first
interview
with
the
disney
board
back
in
it
be
all
about
the
future
and
our
future
depend
on
three
thing
make
high
quality
brand
content
invest
in
technology
and
grow
globally
i
couldn
t
have
anticipate
back
then
how
everything
we
would
do
would
emerge
from
that
template
and
i
could
have
never
predict
a
day
like
this
one
in
which
those
three
pillar
would
be
so
overtly
on
display
as
we
demonstrate
the
company
s
plan
for
the
future
one
after
another
the
head

now
as

of
the
fox
acquisition
we
own
the

business
in
one
of
the
most
vital
and
thrive
market
in
the
world
there
be
global
growth
when
kevin
mayer
come
onstage
to
demonstrate
how
the
app
would
work
on
a
smart
tv
on
a
tablet
on
a
phone
it
be
impossible
not
to
recall
steve
stand
in
my
office
in
hold
out
the
prototype
of
the
new
video
ipod
we
d
embrace
change
then
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
rest
of
our
industry
and
now
we
be
do
it
again
we
be
address
some
of
the
same
question
we
ask
ourselves
almost
fifteen
year
earlier
be
high
quality
brand
product
likely
to
become
even
more
valuable
in
a
change
marketplace
how
do
we
deliver
our
product
to
consumer
in
more
relevant
more
inventive
way
what
new
habit
of
consumption
be
be
form
and
how
do
we
adapt
to
them
how
do
we
deploy
technology
as
a
powerful
new
tool
for
growth
instead
of
fall
victim
to
its
disruption
and
destruction
the
cost
of
building
the
app
and
create
the
content
combine
with
the
loss
incur
by
undercut
our
own
traditional
business
meant
we
d
reduce
our
profit
by
a
few
billion
dollar
a
year
over
the
first
few
year
it
would
take
some
time
before
success
would
be
measure
in
profit
first
it
would
be
measure
in
subscriber
we
want
the
service
to
be
accessible
to
as
many
people
as
possible
around
the
world
and
we
have
settle
on
a
price
that
we
estimate
would
bring
in
somewhere
between
sixty
and
ninety
million
subscriber
in
the
first
five
year
when
kevin
announce
we
would
be
sell
it
for
a
month
there
be
an
audible
gasp
in
the
room
the
response
from
wall
street
go
far
beyond
anything
we
anticipate
in
our
stock
drop
like
a
stone
when
i
talk
about
disruption
now
it
be
soar
the
day
after
our
investor
conference
it
jumped
percent
to
a
record
high
by
the
end
of
the
month
it
be
up
nearly
percent
that
stretch
through
the
spring
of
be
as
good
as
any
in
my
tenure
as
ceo
we
release
avenger
endgame
which
would
eventually
go
on
to
become
the
high
gross
movie
of
all
time
that
be
follow
by
the
opening
of
our
new
star
war
land
galaxy
s
edge
at
disneyland
and
that
be
follow
by
an
agreement
to
purchase
comcast
s
remain
stake
in
hulu
which
will
serve
as
our
subscription
stream
service
for
the
content
that
will
not
be
on
disney
a
move
that
investor
again
reward
if
the
past
have
taught
me
anything
it
be
that
with
a
company
this
size
with
such
a
big
footprint
in
the
world
and
so
many
employee
something
unpredictable
will
always
happen
bad
news
becomes
an
inevitability
but
for
now
it
felt
good
really
good
like
the
fifteen
year
of
hard
work
have
paid
off


before
we
enter
into
the
fox
negotiation
june
be
suppose
to
have
be
my
retirement
date
from
the
walt
disney
company
i
d
have
some
previous
plan
to
retire
that
didn
t
quite
happen
as
expect
but
now
i
be
determine
to
walk
away
forty
five
year
after
i
start
at
abc
not
only
be
i
not
retire
however
i
be
work
harder
and
felt
more
responsibility
than
i
ever
have
in
my
fourteen
year
in
the
job
that
s
not
to
say
i
wasn
t
fully
engage
with
or
fulfil
by
the
work
just
that
it
wasn
t
what
i
imagine
my
life
would
look
like
at
age
sixty
eight
the
intensity
of
the
work
didn
t
fully
inoculate
me
against
a
kind
of
wistfulness
creep
in
though
the
future
that
we
be
planning
and
work
so
feverishly
on
would
happen
without
me
my
new
retirement
date
be
december
but
i
can
see
it
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
it
surface
at
unexpected
time
it
s
not
enough
to
distract
me
but
it
be
enough
to
remind
me
that
this
ride
be
come
to
an
end
as
a
joke
a
few
year
back
dear
friend
of
mine
give
me
a
license
plate
holder
which
i
immediately
attach
to
my
car
that
say
be
there
life
after
disney
the
answer
be
yes
of
course
but
that
question
feel
more
existential
than
it
use
to
i
m
comfort
by
something
i
ve
come
to
believe
more
and
more
in
recent
year
that
it
s
not
always
good
for
one
person
to
have
too
much
power
for
too
long
even
when
a
ceo
be
work
productively
and
effectively
it
s
important
for
a
company
to
have
change
at
the
top
i
don
t
know
if
other
ceo
agree
with
this
but
i
ve
notice
that
you
can
accumulate
so
much
power
in
a
job
that
it
becomes
harder
to
keep
a
check
on
how
you
wield
it
little
thing
can
start
to
shift
your
confidence
can
easily
tip
over
into
overconfidence
and
become
a
liability
you
can
start
to
feel
that
you
ve
heard
every
idea
and
so
you
become
impatient
and
dismissive
of
others
opinion
it
s
not
intentional
it
just
come
with
the
territory
you
have
to
make
a
conscious
effort
to
listen
to
pay
attention
to
the
multitude
of
opinion
i
ve
raise
the
issue
with
the
executive
i
work
most
closely
with
as
a
kind
of
safeguard
if
you
notice
me
be
too
dismissive
or
impatient
you
need
to
tell
me
they
ve
have
to
on
occasion
but
i
hope
not
too
often
it
would
be
easy
in
a
book
like
this
to
act
as
if
all
the
success
disney
experienced
during
my
tenure
be
the
result
of
the
perfectly
execute
vision
that
i
have
from
the
begin
that
i
knew
for
instance
that
focus
on
three
specific
core
strategy
rather
than
others
would
lead
us
to
where
we
be
now
but
you
can
only
put
that
story
together
in
retrospect
in
truth
i
need
to
come
up
with
a
plan
for
the
future
in
order
to
lead
the
company
i
believe
that
quality
would
matter
most
i
believe
we
need
to
embrace
technology
and
disruption
rather
than
fear
it
i
believe
that
expand
into
new
market
would
be
vital
i
have
no
real
idea
though
especially
then
where
this
journey
would
take
me
determine
principle
of
leadership
be
impossible
to
do
without
experience
but
i
have
great
mentor
michael
for
sure
and
tom
and
dan
before
him
and
roone
before
them
each
be
a
master
in
his
own
way
and
i
d
absorbed
everything
i
could
from
them
beyond
that
i
trust
my
instinct
and
i
encourage
the
people
around
me
to
trust
theirs
only
much
later
do
those
instinct
start
to
shape
themselves
into
particular
quality
of
leadership
that
i
could
articulate
i
recently
reread
the
email
i
sent
to
all
the
employee
of
disney
on
my
first
day
as
ceo
i
talk
about
the
three
pillar
of
our
strategy
go
forward
but
i
also
share
some
memory
of
my
childhood
watch
the
wonderful
world
of
disney
and
the
mickey
mouse
club
and
about
imagine
as
a
kid
what
it
would
be
like
to
someday
visit
disneyland
i
recall
my
early
day
at
abc
too
how
nervous
i
felt
start
there
in
the
summer
of
i
never
dream
i
would
one
day
lead
the
company
responsible
for
so
many
of
my
great
childhood
memory
i
write
or
that
my
professional
journey
would
eventually
bring
me
here
there
s
a
way
in
which
i
still
can
t
quite
believe
it
it
s
a
strange
thing
to
think
on
the
one
hand
that
the
narrative
of
your
life
make
complete
sense
day
connects
to
day
job
to
job
life
choice
to
life
choice
the
story
line
be
coherent
and
unbroken
there
be
so
many
moment
along
the
way
where
thing
could
have
go
differently
though
and
if
not
for
a
lucky
break
or
the
right
mentor
or
some
instinct
that
say
to
do
this
rather
than
that
i
would
not
be
tell
this
story
i
can
t
emphasize
enough
how
much
success
be
also
dependent
on
luck
and
i
ve
be
extraordinarily
lucky
along
the
way
look
back
there
s
something
dreamlike
about
it
all
how
could
that
kid
sit
in
his
living
room
in
brooklyn
watch
annette
funicello
and
the
mickey
mouse
club
or
go
with
his
grandparent
to
his
first
movie
cinderella
or
lie
in
his
bed
a
few
year
later
replay
scene
of
davy
crockett
in
his
head
find
himself
all
those
year
later
become
the
steward
of
walt
disney
s
legacy
maybe
this
be
the
case
for
many
of
us
no
matter
who
we
become
or
what
we
accomplish
we
still
feel
that
we
re
essentially
the
kid
we
be
at
some
simpler
time
long
ago
somehow
that
s
the
trick
of
leadership
too
i
think
to
hold
on
to
that
awareness
of
yourself
even
as
the
world
tell
you
how
powerful
and
important
you
be
the
moment
you
start
to
believe
it
all
too
much
the
moment
you
look
yourself
in
the
mirror
and
see
a
title
emblazon
on
your
forehead
you
ve
lose
your
way
that
may
be
the
hardest
but
also
the
most
necessary
lesson
to
keep
in
mind
that
wherever
you
be
along
the
path
you
re
the
same
person
you
ve
always
be
