within
ten
day

than
thirty
year
at

i
be
seriously
consider
for
chairman
and
ceo
i
have
never
really
aspire
to
the
job
and
never
thought
it
possible
even
though
in
the
summer
of
some
company
retiree
as
retiree
do
begin
speculate
that
daft
would
soon
be
replace
some
say
they
be
recommend
that
i
succeed
him
i
told
them
all
firmly
that
i
would
not
take
the
job
i
meant
it
and
pamela
fully
endorse
my
stance
i
be
now
sixty
year
old
and
financially
secure
i
have
lose
ten
pound
in
retirement
be
physically
fit
and
finally
find
time
to
spend
with
my
family
after
decade
of
move
all
over
the
world
and
work
countless
fifteen
hour
day
after
don
s
call
pamela
reiterate
that
she
do
not
want
me
to
take
the
chairman
s
job
worried
that
it
would
seriously
damage
my
health
and
disrupt
our
happy
retirement
what
will
happen
to
you
if
you
fail
she
ask
there
have
not
be
a
successful
chairman
since
goizueta
and
pamela
worried
that
i
would
be
the
third
in
the
line
of
those
who
try
but
fail
to
break
the
streak
however
as
always
she
promise
to
back
me
in
my
decision
if
i
do
it
i
will
not
fail
i
told
pamela
forcefully
but
agree
with
her
about
the
stress
i
have
already
experienced
an
amaze
career
and
we
be
very
happy
in
retirement
the
real
question
be
could
i
live
with
myself
if
i
turn
down
the
ultimate
challenge
the
answer
for
this
former
rugby
player
be
clearly
no
i
could
not
a
week
after
don
s
first
call
i
told
a
rather
shock

for
five
year
the
game
be
on

spent
much
of

have
lose
its
way
and
be
lose
market
share
now
i
have
the
chance
to
attempt
the
ultimate
turnaround
and
perhaps
revitalize
the
entire
company
talk
and
interview
with
all
the
board
member
progress
the
press
portrayed
heyer
as
the
front
runner
and
there
be
rumor
that
he
even
hire
a
public
relation
firm
to
promote
his
candidacy
my
name
be
rarely
mention
but
it
be
clear
to
me
that
i
be
the
lead
candidate
enter
jack
welch
welch
be
a
business
icon
have
engineer
the
remarkable
turnaround
of
general
electric
and
raise
its
market
value
from
billion
when
he
become
ceo
in
to

when
he
retire

the
wealth
builder
in

be
approach
about
the
job
of
coca
cola
chairman
and

the
job
i
have
be
all
but
offer
jack
say
he

mile
from
me
on
the
tiny
caribbean
island
as
active
negotiation
with
board
member
ensue
the
think
be
that
hire
welch
would
energize
the
company
and
prompt
an
immediate
spike
in
the
stock
price
and
i
be
sure
that
would
have
be
the
case
on
april
i
have
just
arrive
from
barbados
on
a

and
wonder
aloud
why
i
be
willing
to
leave
this
peaceful
place
to
plunge
back
into
corporate
combat
be
you

question

than
a

t
know
the
secret
formula
coca
cola
manufacture
the
secret
concoction
at
a
few
plant
around
the
world
it
be
then
blend
with
other
ingredient
to
form
a
concentrate
which
be
then
far
process
into
a
syrup
form
and
deliver
to
restaurant
and
bottle
plant
historically
coca
cola
make
most
of
its
profit
from
concentrate
sale
to
independent
bottler
but
over
the
year
the
parent
company
have
purchase
many
of
the
bottler
in
the
company
acquire
the
north
american
operation
of
its
large
bottler
coca
cola
enterprise
coke
now
own
percent
of
the
bottle
operation
in
the
united
state
and
canada
it
would
seem
that
coca
cola
be
in
many
way
the
perfect
company
it
s
profitable
sell
a
product
available
almost
everywhere
and
provide
the
customer
with
a
few
minute
of
pleasure
at
a
very
affordable
cost
however
in
today
s
world
that
be
no
longer
enough
as
you
can
see
from
the
controversy
mention
here
coca
cola
be
not
universally
revere
in
particular
among
certain
elite
it
be
blame
for
contribute
to
obesity
and
diabetes
for
destroy
the
water
supply
in
india
and
for
countless
other
malfeasance
the
more
money
we
make
the
less
welcome
we
become
coca
cola
chairman
paul
austin
lament
in
a
march
letter
to
robert
w
woodruff
leader
of
coca
cola
from
until
austin
understood
even
then
that
coca
cola
would
have
to
do
more
than
make
soft
drink
and
profit
multinational
corporation
have
become
target
blame
for
many
of
the
world
s
problem
much
be
write
these
day
about
corporate
social
responsibility
but
i
would
argue
that
this
defines
too
narrowly
the
challenge
global
company
face
as
a
college
student
in
south
africa
i
be
train
to
be
a
social
worker
but
opt
instead
for
a
business
career
i
believe
that
in
today
s
world
we
should
combine
these
two
discipline
in
a
three
way
effort
with
government
and
nonprofit
to
build
a
well
world
thus
produce
a
cleaner
planet
battling
poverty
and
disease
i
call
this
connect
capitalism
while
chairman
of
coca
cola
i
try
to
move
the
company
in
this
direction
it
s
a
work
in
progress
at
coke
and
most
global
company
and
it
s
an
important
movement
one
which
my
successor
at
coca
cola
muhtar
kent
have
embrace
i
believe
it
will
ultimately
define
capitalism
this
be
neither
a
typical
business
book
nor
a
typical
autobiography
it
s
really
a
personal
narrative
so
please
join
me
on
a
journey
inside
coca
cola
as
we
explore
my
life
story
and
the
daunt
yet
promising
and
excite
future
of
global
business
one
from
ulster

i
be
born
in

to
the
countryside
about
twenty
mile
away
until
the
war
be
over
so
it
be
in
downpatrick
where
i
first
saw
the
light
of
day
i
be
christen
in
a
little
stone
church
in

there
as
well
northern
ireland
be
then
and
be
still
part
of
the
united
kingdom
but
have
a
large
catholic
population
loyal
to
ireland
the
friction
between
protestant
and
catholic

palpable
even
to
me
at
an
early
age
there
be
protestant
neighborhood
and
catholic
neighborhood
as
well

have
the
somewhat
dangerous
view
which
i
inherit
that
ireland
should
be
one
country
but
only
through
democratic
mean
the
trouble
as
they
be
call
be
subdue
in
those
day
and
would
not
resurface
for
two
decade
yet
i
would
encounter
these
type
of
human
conflict
for
the
rest
of
my
life
the
ability
to
understand
them
and

a
key
business
skill

be
like
this
to
this
day

etch
in
my
memory
our
next
port
of
call
be
cape
town
south
africa
we
be
told
that
if
we
be
up
at
a
m
we
would
see
the
most
wonderful
sight
it
be
january
summer
in
south
africa
and
my
father
and
i
be
up
on

of
a
sudden
through
the
early
morning

piece
of
wondrous
land
emerge
from
the
seemingly
flat
sea
it
be
table
mountain
the
order
of
magnitude
be
stun
ireland
have
its
beautiful
green
hill
but
here
be
a
nearly
four
thousand
foot
mountain
jutting
out
of
the
sea
it
be
the
most
beautiful
sight
i
d
ever
see
i
fell
in
love
with
cape
town
in
my
estimation
one
of
the
three
most
beautiful
city
in
the
world
the
other
two
be
sydney
and
rio
de
janeiro
during

first
sign
of
apartheid
white
only

park
bench
it
be
a
shock
but
at
the
same
time
it
seem
to
be
the
natural
order
of
this
society
it
didn
t
seem
right
to
me
but
i
do
not
suddenly
become
a
ten
year
old
activist
i
must
say
that
i
accepted
it
but
it

make
me
uncomfortable
after
all
the
nigerian
police
officer
have
stayed
at

house
two
year
earlier
why
have

because

life
very
nearly
take
a
much
different
path
however
one
that
would
have
left
me
with
the
legacy
of
livestock
thief
not

of
coca

an

at
my
college

first
year
male
student
to
appear
in
their
underwear
early
in
the
morning
with
a

perform
in

of
the
woman

where
the
window
be
fill
with
ogle
female
all
sort
of
creature
would
appear
dog
cow
horse
it
be
a
silly
ritual
but
nevertheless
a
time
honor
one
my
friend
and
i
spot
a
few
sheep
in
a
pasture
near
campus
and
one
night
drove
in
a
beat
up
pontiac
to
retrieve
our
find
the
farmer
have
lock
up
the
sheep
for
the
night
in
a
barn
so
we
stupidly
broke
the
lock
and
stuffed
four
of
the
animal
into
the
back
of
the
old
car
from
which
we
have
remove
the
backseat
at
a
stoplight
a
woman
who
be
stand
there
wait
to
cross
the
road
look
into
the
car
and
saw
the
four
of
us
and
the
sheep
who
be
loudly
complain
over
their
plight
her
jaw
drop
at
this
very
unusual
sight
and
she
be
still
look
stun
as
the
light
turn
green
and
we
drove
away
we
return
the
sheep
early
the
next
morning
no
harm
do
we
thought
however
some
other
student
have
be
caught
attempt
to
break
into
the
zoo
the
police
after
apprehend
them
told
them
they
could
avoid
charge
if
they
told
who
purloin
the
sheep
we
honorably
therefore
own
up
without
realize
we
would
potentially
be
charge
with
steal
the
animal
eventually
as
this
very
serious
process
evolve
we
learn
that
a
judge
dismiss
the
case
we
discover
that
the
judge
have
also
be
force
as
a
first
year
student
to
endure
the
same
ritual
at

seditious
which
he
often

life
in
san
francisco
my
view
of
apartheid
sometimes
clashed
with
my
image
as
a
rugby
player
rugby
be
the
national
sport
of
the
afrikaner
and
i
remember
once
in
the
bar
of
the
main
stadium
after
a
match
a
policeman
approach
me
and
say
what
s
wrong
with
you
we
thought
you
be
one
of
us
he
simply
couldn
t
understand
how
a
rugby
player
a
member
of
the
club
could
oppose
apartheid
be
careful
we
be
watch
you
he
warn
later
that
year
my
house
be
raid
by
the
security
police
who
be
look
for
seditious
material
they
found
none
miss
my
copy
of
mao
s
little
red
book
tucked
away
in
the
back
of
an
old
bookcase
on
one
issue
related
to
apartheid
i
be
face
with
a
difficult
moral
dilemma
the
government
of
south
africa
have
decreed
that
all
dance
on
campus
have
to
be
racially
segregate
the
student
council
pass
a
resolution
to
halt
dance
until
they
could
be
open
to
student
of
all
race
the
problem
be
that
some
of
the
dance
be
fund
raiser
for
a
student
organization
shawco
that
provide
a
health
clinic
low
cost
food
and
other
assistance
for
the
poor
in
windermere
a
suburb
of
cape
town
i
knew
through
my
social
work
that
this
help
be
desperately
need
the
protest
would
have
hurt
the
people
we
be
try
to
help
while
we
continued
our
privileged
lifestyle
i
believe
we
have
to
find
other
way
to
protest
and
i
be
among
the
minority
on
the
student
council
who
vote
against
the
resolution
to
ban
all
dance
i
be
the
only
member
of
the
campus
antiapartheid
organization
to
do
so
i
resist
peer
pressure
and
go
against
the
grain
refuse
to
increase
the
suffer
of
those
we
be
try
to
help
i
be
still
unsure
to
this
day
whether
i
be
right
or
wrong
it
be
during
my
college
year
that
zambia
officially
gain
its
independence
from
great
britain
i
organize
a
party
for
the
zambian
student
at
cape
town
university
at
midnight
on
october
in
the
ballroom
of
a
local
hotel
with
the
british
ambassador
present
we
lower
the
british
flag
and
raise
the
zambian
flag
for
the
first
time
as
we
sang
its
anthem
stand
and
sing
of
zambia
proud
and
free
i
be
sure
that
the
availability
of
free
beer
for
impoverish
student
add
to
the
sense
of
history
although
i
be
training
to
be
a
social
worker
i
again
begin
to
experience
the
lure
of
a
business
career
many
of
my
friend
at
the
university
be
from
wealthy
family
in
johannesburg
and
cape
town
their
father
own
business
they
live
in
what
seem
to
me
be
palatial
home
and
arrive
at
school
drive
brand
new
car
i
didn
t
have
a
car
i
be
now
mix
with
a
different
group
of
people
i
felt
a
level
of
inferiority
sometimes
a
level
of
resentment
at
the
financial
difference
but
more
than
anything
aspiration
i
be
a
policeman
s
son
but
i
felt
like
i
could
one
day
reach
the
same
financial
status
of
my
classmate
and
their
family
in
order
to
earn
some
extra
entertainment
money
in
college
i
work
on
saturday
morning
at
a
local
clothing
store
i
be
hire
not
because
of
any
knowledge
of
clothing
but
because
i
be
a
minor
rugby
star
the
university
of
cape
town
have
many
rugby
team
with
different
level
of
competition
in
i
have
reach
a
second
league
team
but
progression
to
the
first
league
seem
unlikely
that
year
since
there
be
two
player
firmly
entrench
on
that
team
in
the
position
i
played
at
the
time
lock
forward
in
my
junior
year
i
be
offer
a
spot
on
a
first
league
club
if
i
would
leave
the
university
team
the
other
team
be
not
very
good
but
it
be
in
the
first
league
my
father
advise
against
it
i
don
t
think
there
be
any
point
in
be
a
first
league
player
with
an
inferior
club
he
say
you
know
my
dictum
to
you
always
strive
to
be
the
best
that
be
a
lesson
for
life
it
make
it
easy
over
the
year
to
turn
down
job
offer
without
even
think
about
it
from
company
that
be
not
of
the
stature
of
the
coca
cola
company
my
father
be
certainly
the
most
influential
person
in
my
life
after
take
his
advice
and
stay
with
the
university
team
and
make
the
first
team
week
later
i
be
chosen
in
for
a
team
of
player
drawn
from
south
african
university
for
a
match
against
argentina

a
taste
of
true

that
year
i

down
a
job
offer
from
mr
gersh
while
i
be
date
rayna
but
now
the
way
be
clear
and
not
conflict
i
arrive
back
in
zambia
two
year
after
the
country
have
gain
complete
independence
from
great
britain
zambia
s
first
president
kenneth
kaunda
be
both
a
socialist
and
a
humanist
he
lead
a
nonviolent
independence
movement
that
never
target
white
as
individual
but
do
blow
up
rail
line
and
power
station
to
create
disruption
kaunda
try
very
hard
not
to
be
polarize
on
race
he
be
all
about
the
human
be
in
when
i
be
sixteen
my
geography
master
invite
kaunda

we
have
lunch
with
him
i
expect
a
firebrand
yet
kaunda
be
calm
and
balance
i
remember
ask
him
why
aren
t
you
mad
at
us
we
ve
have
you
in
jail
i
can
t
remember
his
exact
word
but
basically
his
reply
be
that
we
the
white
be
the
one
who
be
make
the
mistake
right
be
on
his
side
and
there
be
no
reason
for
him
to
be
angry
he
believe
that
he
would
not
be
living
up
to
his
principle
if
he
be
influence
by
the
anger
of
the
white
who
have
imprison

there

you

i
would

petrify
at
the

i

checked
in
at
the
crest
crane
hotel
and
found
that
that
there
be
only
one
room
available
even
though
we
have
book
two
and
there
be
only
one
bed
it
be
what
you
could
call
a
queen
size
bed
but
have
be
much
use
and
be
distinctly
concave
sunken
in
the
middle
much
like
the
inside
of
a
bowl
this
meant
that
if
sandy
who
be
a
rather
large
man
and
i
be
to
share
the
bed
we
would
migrate
toward
the
center
with
great
rapidity
we
ask
if
there
be
a
mattress
that
we
could
put
on
the
dirty
concrete
floor
but
there
be
none
so
we
decide
we
be
probably
well
off
sleep
in
very
close
proximity
to
each
other
for
the
night
exhaustion
be
a
wonderful
thing
because
when
we
eventually
get
into
bed
i
don
t
think
either
of
us
move
until
the
next
morning
the
food
be
not
much
well
than
the
sleep
arrangement
before
retire
for
the
even
we
go
to
the
hotel
bar
for
a
zambian
beer
and
what
we
trust
would
be
a
good
dinner
the
menu
be
rather
limited
and
we
both
order
steak
and
chip
french
fry
the
steak
arrive
look
rather
gray
and
leaden
on
the
plate
our
attempt
to
cut
it
prove
extremely
difficult
not
because
of
the
lack
of
sharpness
of
the
knife
but
because
of
the
leathery
nature
of
the
meat
each
of
us
manage
to
detach
one
corner
the
battle
with
our
teeth
to
make
the
meat
digestible
result
in
neither
of
us
return
to
our
steak
for
nutrition
instead
beer
and
bread
fill
our
belly
the
next
morning
we
decide
to
take
another
risk
by
order
steak
egg
and
chip
very
soggy
chip
in
the
belief
that
the
steak
in
the
morning
couldn
t
be
nearly
as
bad
as
the
steak
the
night
before
yet
when
the
steak
arrive
it
look
familiar
the
corner
be
miss
the
egg
and
chip
however
be
nutritious
enough
back
on
the
road
we
take
a
thirty
mile
detour
off
the
hell
run
to
visit
the
memorial

and
while
it
be
effective
in
the
short
term
it
be
not
a
style
i
chose
to
emulate
hutch
didn
t
like
the
coca
cola
company
once
coke
sent
in
a
newly
appoint

beside

there
be
no
other
chair
in
the
office
so
cork
have
to
stand
a
clear
message
as
to
who
be
the
bos
as
the
company
rep
cork
s
job
be
to
help
the
bottler
increase
sale
however
help
from
the
front
office
be
not
always
see
as
help
on
the
receive
end
rather
than
escort
cork
personally
through
the
kitwe
marketplace
hutch
told
him
there
s
a
truck
outside
help
yourself
so
cork
rode
in
the
truck
for
three
day

the
local

be
a
game
customer
be
give
hutch
feedback
about
cork
and
cork
be
get
a
reading
from
the
customer
and
the
market
when
cork
return
to
say
good
bye
to
hutch
at
the
end
of
the
inspection
there
be
a
chair
wait
for
him
the
relationship
have
be
cement
on
hutch
s
term
although
in
many
respect
cork
have
won
later
when
he
work
for
me
cork
reflect
on
the
experience
there
be
many
way
to
skin
a
cat
when
maurice
gersh
hire
me
the
idea
be
that
in
a
few
year
i
would
run
the
franchise
from
day
one
my
immediate
bos
the
sale
manager
a
rough
and
difficult
man
resent
me
as
a
privileged
upstart
and
be
hard
on
me
whenever
he
could
be
even
though
he
himself
knew
he
would
never
aspire
to
hold
another
position
these
be
not
easy
situation
but
if
you
shine
you
can
always
get
through
them
in
the
spring
of
gersh
call
me
into
his
office
and

be
right
for
you
i
thought
i
be
about
to
be
fire
yet
gersh

tony
in

very
balance
way
point

a
warehouse
in
chipata
the
company
agree
surprisingly
i
be
allow
to
own
percent
of
the
venture
with
bank
loan
and
some
of
my
father
s
money
we
rent
a
warehouse
and
bought
two
truck
one
weekend
a
month
i
would
drive
the
three
hundred
mile
of
mostly
dirt
road
from
lusaka
to
chipata
take
stock
and
pay
the
staff
coke
sale
in
the
region
be
soon
up
percent
which
of
course
make
coca
cola
very
happy
and
meant
that
in
my
sideline
i
be
earn
a
significant
incremental
sum
meanwhile
pamela
and
i
start
a
cosmetic
business
import
a
line
call
rimmel
from
the
united
kingdom
shipping
stock
by
air
freight
into
lusaka
to
avoid
the
logistical
logjam
create
by
the
rhodesian
embargo
it
be
a
strategy
base
on
coca
cola
strategy
ensure
availability
rimmel
grow
to
become
the
second
most
popular
cosmetic
in
zambia
behind
revlon
i
also
bought
a
small
painting
company
that
specialized
in
redecorate
foreign
embassy
it
be
a
steady
reliable
business
because
the
embassy
staff
change
every
three
year
and
every
new
diplomat
want
a
fresh
coat
of
paint
for
their
office
and
house
i
soon
found
that
the
profit
from
the
side
business
be
twice
as
much
as
my
coke
salary
in
when
pamela
now
divorce
and
i
go
to
tell
my
mother
the
wonderful
news
that
she
have
agree
to
become
my
wife
my
mother
could
only
say
well
it
s
about
time
you
know
i
didn
t
approve
of
the
way
you
be
living
we
be
married
on
january
in
zambia
spending
our
honeymoon
at
lake
malawi
with
a
first
stop
at
my
coke
distribution
center
in
chipata
my
new
wife
wait
in
the
car
for
two
hour
while
i
paid
worker
take
stock
and
count
the
petty
cash
i
certainly
start
my
marriage
the
way
it
would
continue
for
decade
to
come
a
partnership
combine
hard
work
and
adventure
at
the
malawi
border
guard
detain
us
for
two
hour
hop
we
would
give
them
a
bribe
only
when
i
told
them
a
fabricate
story
that
i
have
an
appointment
the
next
day
to
see
malawi
s
president
hastings
kamuzu

through
in
coke
offer
me
a
job
in
johannesburg
a
move
engineer
by
al
killen
it
be
clear
that
this
could
likely
lead
to
promotion
worldwide
but
that
would
be
up
to
me
it
be
then
that
i
have
to
make
the
choice
stay
in
zambia
as
a
big
fish
in
a
small
pond
or
go
global
i
chose
the
latter
sell
my
side
business
trading
security
for
risk
before
move
pamela
and
i
decide
to
take
a
short
vacation
in
brazil
for
carnival
and
while
there
receive
an
ominous
telegram
inform
me
not
to
report
to
the
new
job
in
johannesburg
but
to
return
to
lusaka
i
thought
i
might
have
be
fire
and
for
the
last
two
day
of
our
vacation
we
sat
on
the
beach
try
to
think
of
anything
i
have
do
wrong
upon
return
to
lusaka
i
learn
that
there
have
only
be
a
change
in
my
job
assignment
and
that
the
transfer
have
be
delayed
not
halt
there
be
at
that
time
restriction
on
take
money
out
of
zambia
i
discover
quasilegal
loophole
around
this
i
have
arrange
for
an
argentine
rugby
team
to
travel
to
lusaka
for
a
match
with
the
zambian
team
even
though
i
have
organize
the
tour
the
zambian
team
do
not
pick
me
as
a
starter
know
that
i
would
soon
be

it
just
so
happen
that
one
of
the
argentine
player
be
injured
in
a
car
accident
and
they
couldn
t
get
a
replacement
so
i
played
for
the
argentine
which
really
upset
the
zambian
selector
particularly
after
the
argentine
side
won
then
something
dawn
on
me
the
argentine
player
be
all
there
with
their
traveler
s
check
which
i
swap
for
zambian
currency
we
then

busy
with
the
new

we

be
largely
peaceful
to
the

yet
south

one
of
the
few
country
on
the
continent
that
stubbornly
continued
to
fight

the
atmosphere
in

africa
be
so
tense
that
before
accept
the

riot
that
kill
several
hundred
people
as
a
young

i
face
the
challenge
of
somehow
succeed
in
an
increasingly
hostile
environment
it
be
a
difficult
period
and
yet
i
look
back
on
the
next
nine
year
in
south
africa
as
my
family
s
happiest
time
marked
by

in
south
africa
initially
there
be
a
cold
shoulder
from
the
afrikaner
on
the
plant
management
team
these
be
white
descendant
of
dutch
settler
and
they
view
me
as
an
englishman
not
an
irishman
the
afrikaner
have
fought
two
war
with
the
english
and
even
decade
later
there
be
still
linger
baggage
from
those
conflict
my
company
car
do
not
arrive
until
i
have
be
on
the
job
for
three
month
so
i
be
force
to
drive
around
in
a
horrible
secondhand
model
when
i
want
to
get
something
do
the
afrikaner
resist
just
to
show
me
that
they
have
a
little
bit
of
power
a
single
rugby
match
broke

club
and
two
of

in
a
match
at

against
their
favorite

the
next
day
at

a
completely
different
chemistry
with
the
afrikaner
compliment

on
my
play
and
chat
about
the
match
my
new

order
rugby
be
a
powerful
part
of
the
afrikan
psyche
nelson
mandela
understood
that
embrace
the
white
south
african
rugby
team
shortly
after
he
be
elect
president
know
that
this
would
help
unite
the
country
that
story
be
brilliantly
told
in
the
movie
invictus
in
which
the
relationship
with
the
team
captain
be
one
of
the
great
human
story
of
leadership
and
reconciliation
my
first
assignment
at
the
bottle
plant
be
to
examine
stock
control
they
have
give
me
a
tough
job
as
this
be
one
of
many
area
where
incorrect
number
could
be
insert
in
order
to
balance
the
book
in
those
day
most
of
the
coke
product
be
sell
in
glass
bottle
and
the
bottle
have
great
value
that
s
why
retailer
charge
deposit
you
paid
a
deposit
when
you
bought
a
bottle
and
then
you
get
your
money
back
when
you
return
the
empty
inside
a
bottle
plant
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
bottle
theft
with
employee
steal
empty
which
they
could
easily
convert
at
deposit
value
for
cash
there
be
also
a
certain
amount
of
breakage
during
the
production
process
and
also
during
the
load
of
truck
my
job
be
to
determine
what
be
actually
happen
to
the
bottle
and
i
dug
deep
institute
strict
procedure
such
as
a
daily
weigh
of
breakage
in
order
to
calculate
the
number
of
bottle
broken
after
three
month
i
have
uncovered
a
ring
that
be
involve
in
falsification
not
only
be
some
employee
dismiss
but
loss
be
reduce
by
percent
consider
that
each
day
the
plant
handle
nearly
a
million
bottle
this
be
real
progress
this
example
be
just
one
of
many
that
lead
me
to
describe
successful
bottler
as
those
who
chase
penny
down
the
hallway
success
on
my
first
project
help
cement
a
bond
with
the
plant
manager
fred
meyer
a
south
african
of
german
origin
far
similar
project
ensue
and
after
only
nine
month
there
be
a
major
management
shuffle
which
saw
ian
wilson
a
south
african
who
have
be
in
charge
of
coke
in
all
of
southern
africa
transfer
to
canada
he
be
succeed
by
meyer
the
new
general
manager
be
neville
kirchman
and
my
new
job
be
marketing
manager
this
be
a
huge
responsibility
and
controversial
as
normally
the
durban
or
pretoria
marketing
manager
be
promote
to
this
job
the
marketing
manager
at
durban
resign
when
i
be
promote
we
be
in
fact
still
good
friend
and
this
solve
another
problem
since
the
johannesburg
general
sale
manager
who
report
to
me
also
have
his
nose
out
of
joint
he
move
into
the
durban
slot
neville
as
kirchman
become
know
and
neville
me
soon
built
a
great
work
relationship
and
he
become
another
mentor
i
will
never
forget
the
first
time
i
address
the
complete
marketing
and
sale
team
at
the
johannesburg
plant
in
a
packed
conference
hall
the
senior
of

who
report
to
me
be
there
and
at
the
age
of
thirty
one
i
be
clearly
one
of
the
young
in
the
room
thankfully
i
spoke
from
behind
a
podium
which
i
need
to
grab
as
my
leg
be
like
jelly
as

right
leg
shook
then
my
left
one
and

over
the

by
my
frequent
visit
to
the
bathroom
before
speak
it
be
a
seemingly
uneventful
but
happy
period
of
my
career
in
retrospect

clear
example
of
how
the
business

operate
in
the
real
world
of
apartheid
i
want
to

issue
and
how
apartheid
have
to
end
i
be
sympathetic
to
those
view
and
be
get
a
valuable
political
education
from
these
business
trip
on
christmas
eve
a
group
of
us
from
the
office
repair
to
the
sunnyside
park
hotel
for
a
wind
down
christmas
season
be
extremely
busy
the
december
month
accounting
for
percent
of
annual
sale
since
it
be
a
double
peak
summer
and
christmas
much
of
that
heighten
business
activity
happens
before
christmas
so
that
night
it
be
the
year
end
and
we
be
celebrate
a
year
with
record
sale
as
other
friend
join
us
we
become
a
large
group
stand
on
the
lawn
overlook
the
beautiful
and
wealthy
suburb
of
johannesburg
the
talk
soon
turn
to
politics
some
but
not
the
majority
in
our
group
thought
there
be
tension
in
the
air
by
my
third
beer
i
venture
that
base
on
my
soweto
visit
we
be
face
another
sharpeville
when
south
african
police
in
march
open
fire
on
peaceful
black
protester
kill
more
than
sixty
of
them
i
be
challenged
with
the
question
what
be
you
go
to
do
about
it
as
i
look
over
the
rich
northern
suburb
with
their
well
manicure
garden
and
swim
pool
i
say
that
the
value
of
all
the
home
we
be
look
at
would
soon
plummet
and
that
i
be
go
to
sell
my
house
and
rent
one
instead
as
i
want
to
protect
my
gain
in
a
strong
real
estate
market
this
be
not
the
kind
of
christmas
present
one
want
to
bring
home
on
christmas
eve
although
i
do
tell
pamela
i
be
only
think
about
it
however
by
january
my
house
be
on
the
market
and
the
sale
close
on
june
four
day
later
soweto
erupt
over
a
south
african
law
mandate
that
half
the
instruction
in
segregate
black
school
should
be
in
the
afrikaans
language
as
oppose
to
completely
in
english
which
have
be
the
norm
there
be
outrage
in
the
township
over
this
since
afrikaans
be
widely
view
as
the
language
of
the
white
oppressor
i
be
in
soweto
on
june
along
with
one
of
our
salesman
on
what
we
call
route
rid
basically
observe
what
be
happen
in
the
marketplace
while
he
go
about
his
normal
sale
job
demonstration
be
escalate
and
a
school
boycott
be
strengthen
with
the
mantra
no
education
without
freedom
i
saw
a
few
group
demonstrate
in
the
distance
and
then
a
very
large
group
on
a
hill
about
a
mile
away
one
shop
owner
suggest
i
leave
immediately
since
these
be
riot
and
vehicle
be
be
burnt
we
still
have
a
few
call
to
make
and
complete
them
without
incident
our
normal
route
out
would
have
take
us
in
the
direction
of
the
protester
so
we
take
another
way
out
of
the
township
we
be
met
near
the
exit
by
a
mass
of
south
african
police
with
riot
prepared
vehicle
after
brusquely
check
my
permit
they
told
me
that
it
be
a
bad
day
and
that
i
be
crazy
to
be
there
it
be
only
when
i
watch
the
seven
o
clock
news
that
night
that
i
realize
what
have
happen
south
africa
have
change
forever
as
that
day
innocent
life
on
both
side
of
the
racial
divide
be
lose
and
the
isolation
of
south
africa
really
begin
apartheid
be
no
longer
tenable
i
only
make
shebeen
visit
every
few
month
and
on
my
next
one
there
be
a
completely
different
atmosphere
what
be
you
do
here
the
bar
owner
would
ask
me
i
could
feel
the
tension
building
i
would
argue
this
at
dinner
party
and
my
colleague
would
counter
that
i
be
not
really
a
south
african
and
have
no
way
of
know
the
situation
in
their
country
they
have
strong
view
about
what
black
people
believe
and
what
the
soweto
riot
meant
yet
when
i
ask
them
if
they
have
ever
be
to
soweto
they
reply
no
a
logical
answer
give
the
legal
prohibition
it
do
however
reflect
the
dialogue
of
the
deaf
many
white
do
not
hear
the
true
view
of
black
and
lead
themselves
to
believe
that
their
evasive
platitude
be
support
for
apartheid
the
reality
be
different
the
grow
opposition
to
apartheid
put
coca
cola
in
a
very
difficult
situation
our
truck
driver
become
target
of
the
violence
and
one
be
shot
to
death
in
a
robbery
in
soweto
i
attend
his
funeral
and
as
the
only
white
person
there
could
sense
a
mixture
of
resentment
against
me
and
support
for
take
the
risk
eventually
coca
cola
hire
contractor
to
deliver
our
product
in
unmarked
truck
to
the
township

a
huge
and
lucrative
market
and
the
company

a
massive
investment
there
in
a
corporate
movement

by

of

in
the
south
african
workforce
coca
cola
endorse
these
principle
in
late
although
the
effort
prove
later
to
be
too
little
too
late
in
after
i
have
left
the
country
coca
cola
divest
from
south
africa
as
the
government
stubbornly
clung
to
apartheid
despite
the
human
and
economic
toll
after
two
year
in
marketing
at
the
johannesburg
plant
i
be
name
head
of
marketing
over
all
three
company
own
bottle
plant
in
south
africa
johannesburg
durban
and
pretoria
a
promotion
and
clear
indication
of
have
risen
to
the
challenge
there
be
not
much
for
me
to
do
in
my
new
marketing
job
since
each
bottle
plant
have
its
own
marketing
manager
i
really
didn
t
think
my
new
job
should
exist
however
i
be
convince
by
alex
reid
former
technical
head
of
the
johannesburg
plant
and
the
new
head
of
southern
africa
bottle
operation
that
he
knew
nothing
about
marketing
and
that
part
of
my
job
be
to
help
him
understand
that
part
of
the
business
which
i
do
after
about
eight
month
however
i
felt
as
if
i
be
become
an
impediment
anything
that
need
to
be
do
in
marketing
have
to
go
through
me
before
it
go
to
the
coca
cola
company
i
wasn
t
happy
be
unproductive
in
a
way
pretend
to
work
and
i
write
a
memo
to
alex
ask
him
to
abolish
my
job
many
people
spend
their
life
write
report
but
not
actually
accomplish
anything
i
want
something
to
show
for
my
work
alex
agree
and
for
the
first
time
i
move
to
the
franchisor
side
of
the
coca
cola
company
as
deputy
marketing
manager
for
southern
africa
base
in
johannesburg
again
i
be
in
a
rather
awkward
position
i
be
the
only
person
reporting
to
the
head
of
marketing
everyone
else
in
the
office
the
head
of
advertising
sale
promotion
and
market
research
report
to
me
it
be
just
a
transitional
job
however
since
coke
have
decide
to
send
me
to
a
fifteen
week
management
course
at
harvard
university
on
my
return
i
be
to
become
the
full
fledge
marketing
manager
for
the
southern
africa
division
another
big
move
for
me
just
before
i

when
we
first
arrive
in

die
of
a
heart

at
a
young
age
and
my
father

raise
his
two
son
who
be
like
young
brother
to

rather
than
stepbrother
we
be
still
close
and
i
be
godfather
to
marie
my
stepniece
i
spent
the
fall
of
at
harvard
business
school
only
my
second
visit
to
the
united
state
the
first
be
a
training
trip
to
atlanta
earlier
that
year
i
be
immediately
impressed
with
the
size
and
sophistication
of
america
harvard
be
a
clear
step
up
for
me
into
a
world
i
knew
nothing
about
i
have
to
take
a
crash
course
in
accounting
and
finance
as
this
be
not
an
area
where
i
have
any
training
although
i
have
kept
the
book
for
our
business
in
zambia
i
be
self
taught
as
it
be
i
be
the
young
person
in
the
harvard
course
and
the
qualification
and
experience
of
my
peer
put
me
in
the
shade
most
be
specialist
who
be
be
promote
into
general
management
one
of
my
classmate
for
example
be
chief
engineer
for
missouri
pacific
railroad
for
me
the
program
for
management
development
be
a
turn
point
and
while
no
one
i
be
sure
ever
saw
me
as
a
future
ceo
of
coca
cola
i
would
put
myself
first
in
the
class
of
those
who
learn
the
most
have
enter
know
that
i
be
the
one
with
the
most
to
learn
it
be
expect
that
at
graduation
we
would
be
give
new
challenge
and
one
be
already
mapped
out
for
me
in
the
promotion
to
marketing
manager
i
be
therefore
surprised
to
receive
a
call
from
fred
meyer
by
now
head
of
coca
cola
in
southern
africa
offering
me
the
position
of
general
manager
of
coca
cola
bottle
company
of
johannesburg
i
accepted
immediately
as
this
be
truly
my
dream
job
it
be
also
more
attractive
as
a
new
venture
since
coca
cola
have
just
agree
to
purchase
the
schweppes
business
from
south
african
brewery
along
with
some
of
sab
s
own
brand
a
deal
i
have
be
involve
with
right
before
go
to
harvard
my
job
therefore
would
involve
integrate
these
new
operation
into
coca
cola
it
would
also
be
a
turnaround
challenge
since
coke
s
market
share
in
johannesburg
have
be
slip
over
the
last
year
i
quickly
call
pamela
who
be
soon
to
join
me
in
boston
for
the
thanksgiving
holiday
what
a
celebration
i
be
back
in
the
franchisee
side
of
the
business
as
a
bottler
with
no
regret
whatsoever
my
office
be
in
a
factory
in
an
industrial
area
near
the
center
of
johannesburg
sit
at
my
desk
i
could
hear
the
bottle
line
run
i
be
now
at
age
thirty
three
in
charge
of
two
factory
and
seventeen
hundred
employee
while
the
head
office
be
only
a
few
mile
away
i
be
run
my
own
business
there
be
however
a
lonely
feel
as
you
close
your
office
door
and
realize
you
be
the
leader
particularly
as
some
former
peer
all
old
than
you
now
report
to
you
coca
cola
ship
concentrate
to
our
plant
in
gallon
jar
and
we
would
use
that
to
make
the
syrup
that
would
then
be
mixed
with
carbonate
water
and
bottle
the
ingredient
that
go
into
the
concentrate
be
mixed
secretly
in
a
few
select
location
around
the
world
i
be
also
ironically
a
pepsi
bottler
as
south
african
brewery
have
discontinue
its
pepsi
franchise
pepsi
sue
on
antitrust
ground
in
the
u
s
and
a
deal
have
be
struck
that
in
order
to
ensure
access
to
the
johannesburg
marketplace
we
would
continue
to
bottle
pepsi
brand
among
the
many
challenge
i
face
as
plant
manager
there
be
two
urgent
one
the
first
be
the
integration
of
the
schweppes
business
although
technically
a
merger
coke
own
percent
of
the
share
in
the
new
company
and
coke
executive
held
nearly
all
the
key
management
job
after
the
first
round
of
job
cut
to
eliminate
duplicate
role
in
the
second
round
i
try
to
ensure
that
we
kept
some
of
the
schweppes
manager
and
in
my
view
in
one
or
two
instance
i
select
the
slightly
inferior
schweppes
manager
to
correct
what
i
perceive
might
be
my
own
coca
cola
bias
bad
mistake
only
one
of
them
survive
beyond
a
year
as
the
schweppes
cultural
fit
be
so
different
we
be
do
it
the
coca
cola
way
not
develop
as
i
would
learn
to
do
later
in
my
career
a
new
culture
that
would
accommodate
both
side
the
second
urgent
move
be
the
implementation
of
the
sullivan
code
which
coca
cola
executive
in
atlanta
have
agree
to
against
the
wish
of
most
of
the
south
african
management
one
objection
a
valid
one
be
that
what
we
be
do
be
violate
south
african
law
which
be
of
course
reverend
sullivan
s
intent
for
example
the
sullivan
code
demand
integration
of
toilet
and
canteen
facility
apartheid
theoretically
meant
separate
but
equal
facility
but
in
reality
it
be
separate
but
inferior
the
physical
part
of
comply
with
sullivan
be
the
easy
part
just
a
small
amount
of
construction
be
require
however
we
face
many
challenge
there
be
two
category
of
employee
manager
who
be
paid
monthly
and
nonmanagement
who
be
paid
weekly
while
all
the
nonmanagement
worker
be
black
the
manager
be
split
between
white
and
other
race
which
include
an
asian
contingent
the
classification
law
in
south
africa
be
so
complex
that
on
occasion
child
in
the
same
family
be
classify
differently
base
on
skin
color
and
the
curliness
of
their
hair
another
challenge
be
in
maintain
the
spirit
and
the
letter
of
the
sullivan
code
at
first
we
discover
white
female
worker
go
across
the
street
to
use
another
company
s
segregate
toilet
i
try
with
my
management
team
to
set
an
example
in
the
cafeteria
by
sit
often
create
mixed
race
table
one
day
my
head
of
human
resource
come
to
me
with
the
information
that
the
black
employee
on
the
serve
staff
have
be
bribed
to
keep
certain
plate
for
the
exclusive
use
and
separate
wash
of
one
group
i
thought
the
plate
be
reserve
for
white
employee
only
to
discover
by
track
plate
that
have
be
marked
with
nail
polish
on
the
underside
that
they
be
exclusively
use
by
the
asian
group
then
there
be
the
visit
from
the
government
inspector
who
would
demand
to
meet
with
me
to
quote
in
detail
the
apartheid
law
that
we
have
breach
and
the
potential
penalty
which
include
me
be
jail
i
would
agree
that
the
law
have
be
broken
and
we
would
shake
hand
and
await
the
next
repeat
act
apartheid
be
erode
and
the
reality
be
that
to
arrest
and
jail
a
coca
cola
executive
would
have
create
an
international
incident
there
be
also
crack
in
the
government
s
classification
of
job
reserve
for
white
as
this
be
constantly
breach
by
both
foreign
and
south
african
company
the
apartheid
government
would
pas
new
law
effectively
legalize
the
fact
on
the
ground
i
do
what
i
could
to
change
the
racial
equation
hire
coke
s
first
black
sale
manager
in
south
africa
ernest
mchunu
although
coke
have
already
begin
to
hire
black
route
salesman
all
the
sale
manager
be
white
even
those
whose
territory
include
the
black
township
ernest
and
i
have
work
together
in
a
johannesburg
clothing
chain
store
shortly
after
i
graduate
from
college
i
knew
that
he
have
management
potential
coke
after
endorse
the
sullivan
principle
have
hire
ernest
as
a
public
relation
officer
basically
to
be
the
black
face
of
the
business
he
be
trot
out
to
company
function
as
a
way
to
show
that
coke
have
black
management
and
he
have
an
impressive
title
but
no
real
power
and
no
one
work
for
him
i
thought
he
be
capable
of
do
more
so
i
recruit
him
to
be
the
sale
manager
in
soweto
for
ernest
it
be
a
tough
call
in
the
public
relation
function
he
be
eat
in
the
best
restaurant
in
johannesburg
and
meeting
the
top
coke
executive
and
visitor
when
they
travel
from
atlanta
yet
the
sale
manager
job
would
be
real
work
when
he
at
first
decline
the
offer
i
told
him
you
be
be
use
ernest
do
you
want
to
be
the
white
man
s
tame
black
face
or
do
you
want
a
real
career
if
you
don
t
come
and
get
the
experience
now
you
be
never
go
to
be
able
to
get
into
general
management
after
talk
it
over
with
his
wife
he
take
the
job
unfortunately
after
i
left
south
africa
i
be
replace
by
an
old
style
plant
manager
he
and
ernest
do
not
get
along
and
ernest
left
to
manage
pepsi
s
operation
in
uganda
have
gain
management
experience
that
make
him
far
more
valuable
in
the
beverage
industry
in
south
africa
i
experienced
government
price
control
for
the
first
time
and
saw
firsthand
the
strange
effect
of
intervention
in
the
free
market
system
the
south
african
government
have
impose
price
control
in
order
to
contain
inflation
a
key
component
of
an
effective
price
control
program
be
maintain
healthy
competition
in
the
marketplace
in
order
to
raise
price
a
company
have
to
first
submit
a
detailed
profit
loss
statement
to
government
authority
coca
cola
do
not
favor
this
system
but
strangely
we
benefit
from
it
enormously
there
be
a
number
of
small
soft
drink
company
which
control
only
tiny
share
of
the
market
one
be
call
goldberg
zeffert
and
it
have
the
up
franchise
in
south
africa
its
strategy
be
to
price
its
soft
drink
percent
below
coca
cola
s
produce
very
thin
profit
margin
as
a
result
goldberg
zeffert
be
always
the
first
to
go
to
the
government
seek
price
increase
coca
cola
s
profit
margin
be
quite
healthy
however
and
each
time
the
government
grant
a
price
increase
it
enhance
our
bottom
line
even
far
however
if
the
government
deny
a
price
increase
small
operator
such
as
goldberg
zeffert
might
well
go
out
of
business
the
decision
before
the
government
bureaucrat
be
very
simple
do
he
put
the
small
operator
out
of
business
or
do
he
grant
the
price
increase
and
ensure
the
continued
high
level
of
profitability
of
the
main
player
it
be
an
interest
conundrum
and
illustrates
what
happens
when
the
natural
order
of
the
marketplace
be
disrupt
by
government
intervention
the
effect
be
that
most
consumer
in
south
africa
paid
more
not
less
for
their
soft
drink
it
illustrates
why
in
my
opinion
government
price
control
rarely
work
i
sense
from
day
one
in
johannesburg
that
mine
be
a
transitional
job
and
that
if
it
go
well
it
would
launch
my
career
out
of
africa
onto
the
world
stage
this
be
confirm
about
a
year
after
take
the
general
manager
s
job
when
i
get
a
call
from
ian

in

as
he
do
to

to

atlanta
to
new
york
new
york
to
sydney
and
then
back
to

it
be
with
great
sadness
that
we
left
south
africa
a
country
i
still
love
a
country
where
in
many
way
i
have
become
a
real
adult
pamela
be
also
sad
to
be
leave
our
continent
after
twenty
six
year
we
still
return
to
africa
yearly
and
support
many
ngo
there
when
we
move
to
sydney
in
early
cara
be
only
two
year
old
sydney
remind
us
on
the
surface
of
south
africa
in
my
view
of
the
five
most
beautiful
city
in
the
world
sydney
and
cape
town
be
both
on
the
list
look
for
a
house
we
have
grandiose
idea
of
water
view
and
be
able
to
go
down
to
the
beach
every
morning
for
a
swim
and
the
like
yet
we
found
ourselves
half
a
million
dollar
short
of
that
goal
settle
instead
for
a
cape
cod
home
with
a
deck
and
pool
on
a
beautifully
wooded
lot
about
ten
mile
north
of
the
city
we
be
still
only
twenty
minute
away
from
the
beach
and
we
would
often
load
a
cooler
with
prawn
oyster
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
set
off
to
the
beach
to
watch
the
sunset
and
have
a
late
swim
we
attend
the
opera
the
ballet
horse
race
and
a
ball
to
raise
money
for
the
duck
bill
platypus
we
make
some
friend
the
closest
be
lyn
and
mike
hall
and
discover
some
second
and
third
cousin
living
in
australia
while
sydney
have
great
physical
beauty
we
found
it
to
be
a
very
provincial
city
and
we
be
never
really
happy
there
it
s
an
international
city
now
but
it
wasn
t
then
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
make
friend
outside
the
office
there
be
constant
labor
strike
that
disrupt
business
as
well
as
day
to
day
life
the
cost
of
living
be
about
percent
high
than
in
south
africa
and
even
more
for
any
service
that
involve
labor
such
as
gardener
babysitter
and
garbage
collection
my
new
position
be
also
particularly
difficult
because
of
harsh
tension
between
the
coca
cola
company
and
the
australian
bottler
the
man
who
ran
the
bottle
plant
in
brisbane
arch
ball
be
a
rough
character
street
smart
and
tough
but
with
absolutely
no
sophistication
or
culture
just
before
we
move
to
australia
a
group
of
australian
bottler
include
ball
just
happen
to
be
visit
johannesburg
i
host
a
dinner
for
them
at
our
house
which
be
for
sale
because
we
be
in
the
process
of
move
to
sydney
ball
corner
pamela
and
told
her
it
would
be
a
bloody
mistake
for
you
to
sell
the
house
you
ll
need
it
again
in
six
month
after
the
australian
bottler
be
finish
with
neville
he
be
serious
one
of
the
first
priority
in
a
new
country
be
very
simply
to
travel
it
and
visit
with
the
bottler
and
the
customer
it
be
also
one
of
the
most
interest
voyage
of
discovery
as
there
be
no
homogeneity
and
each
province
or
city
have
its
own
culture
define
by
its
history
location
and
climate
brisbane
the
capital
of
queensland
be
the
brashest
of
the
major
australian
city
and
queensland
s
history
as
a
sugarcane
state
give
it
a
rough
edge
only
slightly
smooth
by
the
advent
of
tourism
ball
the
bottler
general
manager
be
a
former
cane
cutter
and
proud
of
it
and
displayed
a
breadth
of
language
and
political
incorrectness
to
match
on
my
first
visit
to
brisbane
he
host
a
dinner
at
the
top
of
the
hilton
hotel
in
a
private
room
with
a
wonderful
view
the
major
customer
and
wholesaler
together
with
the
owner
of
the
large
tourism
business
and
the
owner
of

amount
of
alcohol
and
great
seafood

one
of
the
world
s
great
crustacean
they
not
too
gently
told
me
how
they
saw
the
world
and
their
distaste
for
anything
refine
or
as
they
put
it
the
world
of
the
poofters
in
a
way
it
be
an
even
of
survival
as
i
try
to
bridge
the
gap
by
discuss
sport
in
australia
this
work
like
a
charm
as
it
be
and
be
the
world
s
most
sport
obsess
nation
it
s
a
reflection
of
the
outdoors
lifestyle
and
the
love
of
life
that
make
even
the
roughest
aussie
fun
to
be
with
but
then
i
be
a
sport
nut
myself
the
party
wound
up
about
midnight
and

now
in
coke
announce
plan
to
spend
billion
in
the
philippine
over
the
next
five
year
but
at
the
time
it
be
coke
s
large
single
foreign
investment
roberto
goizueta
take
the
proposal
to
the
board
of
director
his
first
major
decision
as
ceo
and
chairman
at
that
time
it
be
very
much
a
board
of
southern
gentleman
many
of
an
advanced
age
it
be
not
unusual
as
i
be
to
experience
firsthand
eighteen
month
later
for
board
member
to
nod
off
during
meeting
i
don
t
know
how
much
trouble
roberto
have
convincing
the
board
to
invest
in
a
country
run
by
ferdinand
marcos
a
dictator
who
be
enter
the
end
of
his
reign
where
future
stability
be
questionable
roberto
do
tell
me
later
that
in
order
to
avoid
undermine
him
a
few
board
member
have
abstain
rather
than
vote
against
the
proposal
hunter
convince
the
sorianos
that
the
new
joint
venture
need
to
have
an
experienced
coca
cola
bottle
executive
as
its
president
and
controller
i
be
name
the
first
president
of
the
joint
venture
in
part
because
of
my
experience
with
two
coke
bottler
in
africa
my
executive
assistant
be
from
san
miguel
a
man
name
romy
dalandan
who
would
show
me
the
rope
but
be
also
clearly
watch
me
and
reporting
back
to
the
percent
shareholder
one
of
my
main
challenge
therefore
be
to
prove
that
i
be
independent
of
both
coke
and
the
sorianos
and
that
i
be
run
the
company
for
the
benefit
of
both
group
of
shareholder
without
be
adversarial
to
either
side
this
be
complicate
to
a
degree
since
we
be
disengage
from
central
san
miguel
service
include
sensitive
area
such
as
purchasing
from
day
one
the
philippine
be
not
expect
to
be
an
easy
assignment
coke
have
attempt
a
turnaround
there
before
and
fail
one
apparent
advantage
for
pepsi
be
that
its
bottler
in
the
philippine
be
wholly
own
by
the
parent
company
so
for
pepsi
any
return
on
investment
from
high
bottler
profit
go
entirely
back
to
headquarters
conversely
coke
would
have
to
share
a
large
portion
of
its
gain
with
the
sorianos
hunter
s
view
be
that
over
time
the
franchise
model
could
work
well
in
the
philippine
and
i
fully
agree
with
him
coke
s
profit
margin
on
the
sale
of
concentrate
be
high
than
the
margin
the
bottler
make
on
its
operation
justified
by
the
power
of
the
brand
bottle
can
be
an
excellent
business
if
well
run
the
low
profit
margin
for
the
bottler
force
them
to
operate
more
efficiently
at
the
same
time
coke
have
to
live
up
to
its
end
of
the
bargain
by
building
the
brand
conversely
the
pepsi
structure
in
the
philippine
do
not
produce
the
intense
focus
need
for
run
successful
bottle
operation
in
the
long
term
as
they
would
soon
discover
for
the
time
be
however
pepsi
be
outsell
us
to
in
some
area
of
the
country
include
manila
not
just
with
pepsi
but
with
mountain
dew
mirinda
orange
and
up
the
philippine
be
pepsi
s
number
two
market
in
the
world
and
be
feature
in
a
annual
report
as
a
prime
example
of
how
to
beat
coke
this
be
a
risky
venture
and
clearly
a
number
of
people
have
much
to
lose
include
me
i
be
told
by
many
people
inside
the
company
that
failure
be
almost
certain
ian
wilson
who
have
be
so
close
to
be
chairman
and
have
give
me
my
australia
opportunity
be
sure
this
be
a
way
of
push
me
out
the
door
for
be
his
prodigy
i
didn
t
accept
that
since
i
knew
i
have
strong
support
not
only
from
goizueta
but
from
keough
and
ayoub
goizueta
in
his
first
meeting
with
me
after
i
take
the
job
assure
me
that
he
be
put
his
own
reputation
on
the
line
as
well
as
hunter
s
however
as
the
say
go
success
have
many
father
and
failure
be
an
orphan
i
knew
the
risk
but
as
ever
the
challenge
excite
me
also
i
be
young
enough
to
take
the
risk
and
prove
not
in
the
least
to
myself
that
i
could
lead
a
large
company
in
a
complex
environment
if
i
fail
i
could
either
go
back
out
on
my
own
or
find
another
opportunity
the
other
incentive
be
a
tax
free
bonus
for
signing
up
for
five
year
a
fortune
to
me
in
those
day
but
also
an
indication
that
others
before
me
have
turn
down
the
job
offer
i
have
a
belief
system
that
when
the
good
lord
create
the
world
he
create
coke
number
one
and
pepsi
number
two
the
philippine
be
a
terrible
aberration
one
of
only
a
handful
of
market
in
the
world
where
coke
trail
pepsi
it
be
fixable
that
wasn
t
just
my
blind
faith
despite
the
fact
that
the
eighteen
coke
bottle
plant
be
run
down
and
some
should
have
be
close
the
index
measure
the
quality
of
coke
plant
in
the
country
be
on
a
scale
of
it
be
about
the
same
as
the
market
share
against
pepsi
then
i
look
at
pepsi
and
saw
they
weren
t
a
great
deal
well
in
term
of
quality
and
execution
they
be
just
more
aggressive
in
the
marketplace
but
aggressive
without
discipline
however
when
i
take
pamela
to
manila
for
three
day
to
look
over
the
place
my
chance
to
lead
the
turnaround
almost
fell
apart
rid
into
manila
from
the
airport
pamela
be
appalled
at
the
country
s
abject
poverty
the
road
unfortunately
ran
adjacent
to
a
horrible
slum
we
be
both
from
africa
but
this
be
far
bad
than
anything
in
africa
at
the
time
in
the
hot
tropical
climate
the
garbage
and
the
filth
be
start
to
emit
a
foul
odor
darling
i
don
t
think
i
can
do
this
pamela
told
me
before
we
reach
the
hotel
i
realize
we
have
a
problem
and
understood
her
reluctance
but
convince
her
that
we
should
complete
the
three
day
trip
and
then
decide
she
felt
well
as
we
enter
makati
the
manila
business
district
and
checked
into
the
peninsula
hotel
and
later
when
we
have
dinner
in
the
champagne
room
of
the
old
manila
hotel
where
general
douglas
macarthur
have
live
when
the
japanese
attack
in
pamela
agree
to
give
the
philippine
a
try
and
we
be
soon
on
our
way
the
company
provide
us
with
a
first
class
house
complete
with
a
swim
pool
three
maid
a
driver
a
gardener
and
two
security
guard
even
by
african
standard
this
be
almost
a
surplus
of
servant
our
daughter
cara
have
her
own
nanny
or
yaya
we
add
another
family

the
friendliness
of
the
people
and
our
ease
at

soon
meant
that
as
a
family
we
settle
in
rapidly
the
only
security
problem
we
have
be
when
one
of
our

shot
himself
in

while
play
with
his

of

to
the

process
that
have
not
materialize
although
the
country
still
have
enormous
potential
one
of
the
strike
feature
of
the
philippine
be
how
similar
it
be
to
mexico
in
architecture
and
design
spain
administer

the

and
vegetable

look
remarkably
like
a
standard
one
in
manila
despite
such
similarity
the
influence
of
the
united
state
on
the
philippine
be
difficult
to
ignore
a
number
of
the
television
program
and
newspaper
be
in
english
and
most
filipino
have
relative
living
in
the

this
veneer
of
u
s
culture
mixed
with
a
laissez

spanish
malay
way
of
living
creates
a
sort
of
organize
chaos
a
bubbling
cheerful
society
where
people
appear
to
be
generally
happy
even
those
who
be
poor
obviously
poverty
take
its
toll
in
many
way
but

around
food
with
snack
break
during
the
morning
and
afternoon
stop
work
in
the
office
and
be
an
important
part
of
the
culture
one
that
be
not
to
be
interfere
with
the
catholic
church

strong
in
the
philippine
and
its
voice
be
heard
in
all
moral
and
political

the
observation
of
various

each
year
at
easter
men
be
actually
hung
on
cross
and
flagellate
on
the
street
yet
as
in
any
society
in
the
philippine
there
be
a
dichotomy
in
every
town
and
particularly
evident
in
manila
be
short
term
hotel
very
profitable
business
where
normal
stay
be
for
three

heavily

around
valentine

the

your

available
as
room
service
how
do
i
know
all
of
this
well
pamela
and
i
decide
to
sample
one
as
part
of
a
desire
to
explore
which
prove
of
great
interest
when
i
relayed
the
story
one
even
at
a
friend
s
dinner
party
although
there
be
a
few
concerned
face
around
the
table
an
expat
be
able
to
live
to
a
degree
within
philippine
society
in
japan
you
go
to
a
formal
business
event
but
you
very
rarely
go
to
someone
s
home
in
the
philippine
it
be
not
unusual
to
be
invite
to
someone
s
home
there
be
a
level
of
integration
between
expat
and
filipino
that
i
have
not
see
anywhere
else
in
asia
when
we
first
arrive
president
marcos
have
just
be
reelect
to
a
new
six
year
term
and
the
political
situation
appear
to
be
stable
although
condition
would
deteriorate
steadily
during
our
time
there
george
bush
then
vice
president
under
ronald
reagan
honor
marcos
with
a
state
visit
prompt
protest
from
the
opposition
for
the
first
time
i
have
my
own
major
company
to
run
but
it
be
in
an
exotic
country
of
which
i
knew
little
for
any
global
company
there
be
no
more
important
task
than
fully
understand
the
culture
of
the
country
where
you
be
operating
this
lesson
be
ingrain
in
me
in
the
philippine
before
arrive
i
read
as
much
as
i
could
about
filipino
culture
something
i
have
fail
to
do
when
we
move
to
australia
make
the
incorrect
assumption
that
it
would
be
like
south
africa
in
the
philippine
family
allegiance
be
extremely
strong
allegiance
to
your
classmate
either
from
the
military
or
in
school
be
actually
great
than
any
allegiance
people
would
have
for
their
employer
the
cultural
trait
include
utang
na
loob
which
mean
obligation
if
i
do
you
a
favor
you
have
to
return
the
favor
some
time
in
the
future
pakikisama
mean
get
along
avoid
confrontation
when
first
meeting
someone
filipino
also
tend
to
search
for
common
lineage
with
others
all
the
way
to
a
third
cousin
and
seem
to
have
an
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
their
detailed
family
tree
in
filipino
culture
yes
often
mean
i
hear
you
not
i
agree
with
you
ensure
you
have
agreement
be
therefore
much
more
complex
the
bad
thing
to
do
be
get
annoyed
and
say
you
agree
to
do
this
in
your
view
they
do
in
their
view
they
didn
t
in
other
word
you
re
in
their
culture
and
you
need
to
understand
the
way
their
culture
work
you
can
t
impose
your
culture
on
them
of
course
you
maintain
your
standard
and
your
value
that
s
a
different
issue
yet
at
the
same
time
you
have
to
bend
with
the
cultural
wind
if
you
re
go
to
be
able
to
work
in
any
country
and
find
way
to
achieve
your
goal
within
this
frame
once
in
the
philippine
i
realize
immediately
that
i
need
to
hire
a
filipino
manager
someone
who
knew
the
business
but
could
also
be
a
cultural
interpreter
john
hunter
who
have
design
the
five
year
plan
have
already
come
to
that
same
conclusion
and
have
a
recommendation
that
man
turn
out
to
be
jesus
celdran
nickname
king
king
or
king
i
met
him
over
lunch
at
the
manila
polo
club
physically
the
two
of
us
didn
t
match
at
all
king
be
five
foot
six
and
i
m
about
a
foot
taller
eventually
our
nickname
become
mutt
and
jeff
we
be
join
at
the
hip
well
we
couldn
t
have
be
because
of
the
height
difference
but
metaphorically
we
be
with
king
king
our
basic
team
be
complete
in
addition
to
him
and
myself
be
tony
eames
an
australian
transfer
from
atlanta
to
be
manager
of
coca
cola
in
the
philippine
he
d
replace
john
hunter
who
have
be
promote
to
hong
kong
tony
and
i
be
in
our
thirty
king
king
about
twenty
year
old
we
travel
the
length
and
breadth
of
that
country
together
king
king
in
particular
be
absolutely
crucial
to
my
success
he
be
the
one
who
be
able
to
understand
what
i
be
try
to
do
strategically
he
be
able
to
say
well
i
like
your
idea
but
here
s
why
it
doesn
t
work
in
the
philippine
and
even
more
important
he
d
explain
how
we
could
make
it
work
for
example
once
we
be
discuss
sale
incentive
we
have
a
business
of
employee
my
think
be
that
we
could
leverage
the
sale
incentive
instead
of
give
employee
a
bonus
we
could
actually
give
them
a
refrigerator
that
be
worth
because
we
could
buy
the
appliance
at
cost
from
the
manufacturer
we
d
be
give
them
double
the
value
of
prize
for
the
same
cost
and
this
would
also
act
as
a
family
incentive
no
bos
that
doesn
t
work
king
king
told
me
he
explain
that
when
a
salesman
win
a
bonus
it
go
into
his
back
pocket
it
s
his
play
money
unlike
his
salary
which
he
take
home
and
give
to
his
wife
in
the
philippine
the
woman
manages
the
family
and
handle
the
money
and
basically
give
an
allowance
to
the
husband
my
plan
would
not
have
work
culturally
logic
do
not
always
prevail
in
one
of
my
first
meeting
with
senior
management
i
address
another
sensitive
cultural
issue
expat
salary
which
be
much
high
than
those
of
the
filipino
exec
i
explain
to
my
filipino
direct
report
that
this
be
necessary
to
attract
foreign
talent
and
that
i
myself
have
be
paid
less
than
an
american
in
south
africa
who
ran
the
much
small
bottle
plant
in
durban
while
i
be
not
particularly
pleased
about
that
i
understood
he
could
not
be
paid
on
the
local
pay
scale
i
ve
brought
these
people
in
i
think
we
need
that
injection
of
new
talent
i
told
the
filipino
manager
at
the
end
of
the
month
you
be
go
to
think
about
what
they
walk
away
with
and
what
you
walk
away
with
for
equal
effort
and
if
you
disagree
with
that
you
shouldn
t
be
part
of
the
team
i
don
t
want
there
to
be
a
burning
resentment
about
high
expat
salary
and
benefit
around
that
element
absent
that
one
difference
we
re
not
go
to
be
the
expat
in
one
corner
the
filipino
in
another
we
be
one
team
i
meant
that
and
live
by
it
as
do
the
three
expat
i
have
brought
in
pepsi
in
a
later
reaction
to
coke
s
resurgence
in
the
philippine
brought
in
a
new
team
of
expat
they
commit
the
sin
that
i
be
avoid
the
expat
sat
around
at
the
manila
polo
club
drank
beer
and
complain
about
the
filipino
be
lazy
that
be
what
happens
when
management
be
disconnect
from
society
it
lead
to
alienation
all
around
and
a
lack
of
understand
of
the
market
and
the
customer
from
day
one
in
the
philippine
i
begin
the
process
of
modernize
the
bottle
plant
and
energize
the
sale
force
no
one
be
more
important
in
this
process
than
tony
eames
the
region
manager
of
the
coca
cola
company
he
have
no
ego
when
it
come
to
share
decision
make
on
advertising
which
be
normally
the
purview
of
the
coca
cola
company
the
advertising
campaign
from
headquarters
at
the
time
be
have
a
coke
and
a
smile
with
pepsi
outsell
us
to
in
manila
i
thought
we
need
a
strong
message
also
pepsi
have
singer
michael
jackson
who
be
extremely
popular
in
the
philippine
in
its
ad
so
we
developed
our
own
commercial
use
filipino
star
advertising
both
the
coca
cola
brand
and
feature
our
new
packaging
it
could
have
be
interpret
as
a
violation
of
the
company
rule
since
all
brand
advertising
have
to
come
through
atlanta
yet
tony
allow
us
to
do
this
argue
that
it
be
packaging
advertising
which
be
exempt
also
with
only
one
bottler
in
the
philippine
it
make
more
sense
to
collaborate
with
us
during
our
early
stage
of
storyboard
development
he
be
right
i
reciprocate
by
allow
him
to
give
his
input
on
manufacturing
issue
which
be
normally
reserve
only
for
bottler
it
be
a
great
lesson
on
how
the
franchise
system
should
and
could
work
joe
brand
from
coca
cola
company
join
my
team
as
head
of
quality
control
to
ensure
that
the
bottle
plant
met
global
standard
coke
insist
that
joe
report
directly
to
me
and
not
to
ramon
abola
the
filipino
technical
head
i
consider
this
a
major
mistake
as
it
would
undermine
ramon
and
send
a
signal
to
the
organization
that
expat
be
special
joe
to
his
credit
saw
this
and
agree
to
report
to
ramon
this
reinforce
that
we
be
a
single
team
even
though
joe
earn
more
money
than
his
bos
joe
never
falter
and
within
three
year
quality
score
for
coke
plant
in
the
philippine
be
high
than
the
world
average

rev
up
the

hundred
of

salesman
attend
our
rally
around
the
country
they
work
six
day
a
week
in
the
tropical
heat
drive
from
one
tiny
shop
to
the
other
unload
heavy
crate
of
coke
make
sure
that
the
coca
cola
signage
be
properly
place
so
that
it
would
be
more
prominent
than
pepsi
s
and
that
the
cooler
be
work
properly
all
the
while
pitch
the
store
owner
to
buy
new
product
such
as
mello
yello
when
we
launch
mello
yello
bill
as
the
world
s
fast
soft
drink
i
would
lead
the
salesman
in
calisthenics
do
pushup
on
the
stage
then
we
d
run
around
the
plant
together
it
be
all
about
create
energy
and
drive
and
not
something
i
have
learn
at
harvard
business
school
many
people
think
the
power
of
coca
cola
be
the
strength
of
the
brand
yet
it
s
the
route
salesman
who
be
the
unsung
hero
the
one
who
do
the
real
heavy
lift
literally
and
figuratively
those
be
the
people
we
try
to
motivate
and
quickly
we
saw
the
difference
in
the
marketplace
regularly
we
d
go
out
and
tour
the
sari
sari
as
the
small
shop
be
call
don
t
expect
what
you
can
t
inspect
be
my
motto
some
of
the
shop
be
literally
tin
roofed
shack
and
at
six
foot
five
i
have
to
stoop
to
get
through
the
front
door
not
always
successfully
yet
we
begin
to
see
that
coke
be
gain
more
prominence
as
our
sign
and
product
become
much
more
visible
when
i
tour
the
bottle
plant
across
the
country
there
be
typically
a
big
lunch
and
a
script
tour
the
factory
spruce
up
for
my
visit
i
make
a
point
of
break
off
from
the
official
tour
and
inspect
the
employee
bathroom
and
locker
room
if
they
be
not
kept
clean
it
be
a
sign
that
the
company
do
not
really
care
about
the
employee
worker
be
sometimes
shock
to
see
me
the
president
of
the
company
tour
their
bathroom
which
be
often
filthy
it
sent
a
message
from
the
top
that
employee
matter
and
that
quality
meant
quality
in
everything
we
do
everything
communicates
a
message
for
example
i
would
rather
have
no
sign
than
an
old
fade
sign
one
of
the
strategy
development
method
i
have
use
on
occasion
be
to
be
sure
that
we
re
look
at
our
business
through
the
lens
of
our
competitor
in
manila
i
take
the
upper
management
team
to
a
strategy
session
at
the
intercontinental
hotel
they
enter
a
room
which
be
decorate
with
pepsi
poster
there

i
have
pepsi

they
be
obviously
shock
then
i
conduct
an
all
day
session
design
to
detect
the
weakness
in
the
coca

system
and
develop
a
strategy
to
retain
our
leadership
over
pepsi
during
such
a
session
it
take
about
an
hour
for
people
to
get
comfortable
but
eventually
thing
fall
into
place
and
worker
get
a
thoroughly
honest
assessment
of
their
own
flaw
and
strength
interpret
the
data
over
the
follow
day
clearly
help
to
build
well
business
strategy
it
s
amaze
the
brutal
honesty
that
come
from
these
session
and
how
hidden
flaw
that
most
people
be
naturally
reluctant
to
admit
to
be
uncovered

lead
a

with
that
crowd
that
day
don
later
say
in
the
philippine
my
ability
as
a
public
speaker
start
to
improve
i
could
rally
people
i
learn
how
to
control
an
audience
it
be
a
major
turn
point
for
me
visit
the
philippine
goizueta
and
keough
saw
me
in
a
totally
different
light
i
sense
that
i
be
start
to
get
on
their
radar
screen
as
the
turnaround
progress
and
i
be
later
invite
to
address
a
global
meeting
and
to
speak
to
the
company
board
of
director
in
atlanta
around
this
same
time
i
met
president
marcos
for
the
first
time
and
notice
that
he
do
not
appear
healthy
his
face
be
puffy
an
indication
of
what
would
later
be
diagnose
as
lupus
both
his
health
and
political
empire
be
in
rapid
decline
that
be
unsettle
in
the
long
term
but
in
the
short
term
we
do
not
let
that
interfere
with
our
campaign
to
defeat
pepsi
at
the
end
of
the
first
twelve
month
coca
cola
be
close
to
regain
the
lead
in
market
share
lead
by
the
energize
sale
force
and
by
new
product
such
as
mello
yello
coca
cola
have
also
purchase
a
brand
from
san
miguel
call
royal
tru
orange
which
do
much
well
than
pepsi
s
mirinda
brand
new
packaging
be
the
major
contributor
to
a
growth
surge
pepsi
have
be
sell
a
oz
bottle
for
the
same
price
as
an
oz
drink
which
i
be
sure
be
not
sustainable
even
with
cross
subsidy
from
the
concentrate
profit
san
miguel
which
have
be
operating
at
a
loss
have
lack
sufficient
capital
to
convert
to
oz
bottle
but
the
coke
investment
make
that
possible
still
san
miguel
s
glass
manufacturing
capacity
be
limited
and
import
glass
be
too
expensive
the
original
plan
have
be
to
eliminate
all
the
oz
bottle
as
pepsi
have
do
and
go
strictly
to
oz
i
decide
to
keep
the
oz
bottle
realize
there
be
a
need
for
a
low
cost
drink
in
the
market
and
that
pepsi
could
not
continue
to
sell
the
oz
at
the
current
price
as
inflation
be
deteriorate
their
profit
margin
keep
the
oz
bottle
also
save
us
money
because
it
lower
the
number
of
new
oz
bottle
we
have
to
produce
it
also
meant
few
new
crate
at
the
time
we
be
shift
from
wooden
crate
which
rot
easily
in
the
tropical
climate
to
plastic
one
much
more
important
keep
oz
bottle
meant
that
we
could
accelerate
by
at
least
a
year
the
national
rollout
of
the
new
oz
bottle
as
manufacturing
capacity
for
new
bottle
be
limited
and
therefore
constrain
our
aggressive
rollout
it
be
hard
to
imagine
now
in
the
world
of
aluminum
can
and
plastic
bottle
how
important
returnable
glass
bottle
be
in
those
day
a
large
portion
of
a
bottler
s
asset
be
tie
up
in
glass
that
s
why
company
charge
deposit
on
bottle
to
ensure
that
customer
return
them
for
reuse
instead
of
throw
them
away
one
of
the
first
thing
i
note
upon
arrive
in
the
philippine
be
that
there
be
a
game
go
on
between
pepsi
and
coke
both
company
be
steal
each
other
s
bottle
in
an
attempt
to
drain
the
competitor
s
asset
by
force
them
to
purchase
more
glass
both
company
have
mound
of
their
opponent
s
bottle
stack
in
vast
field
and
because
of
the
damp
tropical
climate
weed
soon
cover
the
field
and
rainwater
follow
soon
after
by
algae
fill
the
bottle
i
have
see
company
steal
one
another
s
bottle
in
other
part
of
the
world
but
the
extent
of
it
in
the
philippine
be
unbelievable
immediately
i
order
the
practice
stop
on
our
end
prompt
pepsi
force
to
label
king
king
tony
eames
and
me
the
boy
scout
quietly
they
begin
to
reduce
the
level
at
which
they
remove
our
bottle
as
we
try
to
figure
out
how
pepsi
be
make
a
profit
despite
the
low
price
they
be
charge
in
the
marketplace
for
large
bottle
we
begin
to
suspect
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
accounting
for
bottle
deposit
the
deposit
be
normally
set
by
agreement
between
the
two
company
it
be
not
price
fix
but
an
agreement
on
the
value
of
an
asset
the
bottle
both
coke
and
pepsi
have
be
increase
their
deposit
to
the
point
where
they
be
closing
in
on
the
full
value
of
the
bottle
normally
the
deposit
be
far
less
than
the
full
value
the
difference
between
the
deposit
and
the
full
value
of
the
bottle
be
suppose
to
be
place
on
a
company
s
balance
sheet
as
a
cost
amortize
over
the
life
of
the
bottle
and
a
debit
against
profit
for
example
if
a
bottle
cost
the
company
cent
but
the
retailer
have
paid
a
deposit
of
only
cent
then
the
company
have
experienced
effectively
a
loss
of
cent
that
it
would
list
as
a
debit
on
its
balance
sheet
spread
that
loss
over
the
anticipate
life
of
the
bottle
i
have
agree
to
one
deposit
increase
with
pepsi
just
after
i
arrive
in
the
philippine
because
with
inflation
i
be
worried
that
the
deposit
be
not
high
enough
to
motivate
consumer
to
return
the
bottle
pepsi
later
come
back
with
a
proposal
to
raise
the
deposit
price
above
the
value
of
the
bottle
that
s
when
the
penny
drop
pepsi
be
use
the
deposit
increase
to
fuel
its
profit
and
those
profit
be
funding
the
battle
with
coca
cola
when
i
refuse
another
deposit
increase
the
game
be
over
and
pepsi
s
false
profit
evaporate
what
i
have
not
realize
be
that
every
time
the
deposit
price
increase
pepsi
s
local
management
be
write
up
the
value
of
their
bottle
include
the
redundant
one
sit
in
the
field
and
they
be
show
their
gain
as
an
operating
profit
pepsi
be
force
to
take
an
million
charge
to
profit
some
of
this
related
to
mexico
where
a
similar
practice
be
be
undertaken
in
the
aftermath
with
completely
new
management
the
company
decide
to
low
its
deposit
which
instantly
take
money
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
dealer
who
held
those
bottle
in
their
store
if
a
dealer
have
paid
a
cent
deposit
for
the
bottle
he
could
redeem
it
now
for
only
cent
this
create
an
angry
network
of
retailer
in
order
to
stay
competitive
we
be
force
to
match
pepsi
s
deposit
decrease
otherwise
when
a
dealer
want
to
expand
his
inventory
pepsi
would
have
a
cost
advantage
because
of
the
low
deposit
and
therefore
low
cash
outlay
the
dealer
would
pay
in
order
to
keep
our
retailer
happy
we
decide
to
pay
them
the
old
high
deposit
for
the
bottle
they
already
have
in
stock
so
if
they
paid
a
cent
deposit
they
could
return
the
bottle
for
cent
not
the
new
low
rate
this
amount
to
a
million
loss
for
our
company
that
be
a
large
sum
since
at
that
time
we
be
make
only
million
a
year
in
profit
the
decision
however
shift
the
market
psychology
far
against
pepsi
which
lose
its
integrity
with
the
dealer
with
the
sale
growth
that
follow
our
decision
we
recouped
the
million
within
a
year
i
credit
our
filipino
treasurer
chito
gonsalves
for
push
me
to
make
this
decision
base
on
the
value
we
share
it
be
a
victory
for
integrity
another
big
mistake
make
by
pepsi
be
fail
to
attack
coke
s
market
share
on
the
island
of
mindanao
since
coke
have
a
strong
market
lead
in
mindanao
we
could
charge
high
price
those
profit
be
use
to
combat
pepsi
in
manila
where
coke
be
outsold
to
since
pepsi
have
such
a
big
lead
in
manila
it
have
to
spend
four
dollar
to
match
every
dollar
we
invest
in
the
capital
city
if
pepsi
have
apply
the
same
strategy
against
coke
in
mindanao
it
would
have
strangle
our
top
profit
center
for
some
reason
pepsi
never
seriously
challenged
us
in
mindanao
a
major
strategic
mistake
and
so
in
coke
take
the
lead
in
the
philippine
one
of
the
fast
turnaround
in
a
major
market
in
the
company
s
history
at
the
same
time
the
marcos
regime
be
look
shakier
by
the
day
with
grow
protest
and
political
upheaval
i
walk
through
one
protest
in
the
financial
district
of
makati
and
saw
a
typewriter
nearly
hit
the
mayor
of
manila
the
typewriter
have
descend
from
a
window
seventeen
floor
above
to
the
stage
where
the
mayor
be
speak
the
unrest
have
a
chill
effect
on
foreign
investment
in
the
philippine
yet
coke
continued
to
gain
over
pepsi
and
our
profit
increase
steadily
we
built
a
new
bottle
plant
in
manila
and
undertook
massive
upgrade
at
four
other
plant
the
quality
of
our
exist
plant
soon
rise
from
a
score
of
to
above
and
equal
world
average
by

meanwhile
our
family
life
be
also
undergo
some
change
cara
transfer
from
a
montessori
school
to
the
british
school
in
manila
trading
her
philippine
accent
for
a
british
one
we
spent
many
weekend
at
some
of
the
beautiful
beach
resort
in
the
philippine
in
particular
maya
maya
with
its
nipa
palm
hut
bamboo
floor
and
magnificent
view
of
the
beautiful
south
china
sea
with
profit
make
on
a
bet
on
yen
appreciation
against
the
dollar
we
bought
a
speedboat
which
allow
us
to
explore
the
coast
and
also
give
me
great
pleasure
as
i
developed
my
water
skiing
skill
then
we
use
the
bonus
for
accept
the
philippine
job
to
buy
our
first
house
in
france
take
advantage
of
the
depressed
french
economy
and
weak
franc
which
be
due
in
part
to
the
then
socialist
government
which
cohabitated
with
the
communist
our
farmhouse
be
built
in
the
eighteenth
century
with
stonewalls
a
foot
thick
that
back
up
to
a
giant
forest
although
we
love
the
philippine
we
felt
like
we
need
a
base
in
western
culture
a
place
to
return
for
three
or
four
week
each
summer
to
unwind
after
countless
fifteen
hour
workday
in
manila
one
of
the
more
tax
task
that
i
have
during
my
time
in
the
philippine
be
to
be
a
judge
along
with
the
u
s
consul
general
and
others
who
be
believe
to
have
a
fine

deflect
the
question
by
reply
my
wife

five
foot
eleven
and
therefore
there
isn
t
really
a
big
height
difference
whatsoever
she
wasn
t
go
to
buy
that
one
no
no
she
say
with
us
filipino
i
sometimes
get
myself
in
trouble
by
be
too
quick
witted
and
flippant
and
this
be
one
of
those
occasion
it
s
all
a
matter
of
perspective
i
say
with
a
big
smile
on
my
face
you
be
judging
in
the
vertical
plane
in
the
horizontal
plane
it
s
no
problem
at
all
the
next
day
my
phone
rang
some
people
thought
the
episode
be
extremely
humorous
but
others
berate
me
for
overstep
a
line
in
term
of
what
i
should
be
say
as
president
of
the
coca
cola
bottler
in
the
philippine
i
learn
a
lesson
from
that
incident
and
become
a
lot
more
discipline
as
far
as
what
i
say
in
public
one
of
our
strangest
encounter
during
our
time
in
the
philippine
be
watch
a
demonstration
of
psychic
surgery
this
be
practice
widely
in
the
philippine
and
also
brazil
pamela
and
i
be
attend
a
meeting
of
the
young
president
s
club
an
organization
for
corporate
president
under
the
age
of
forty
at
a
manila
hotel
the
psychic
surgery
demonstration
be
offer
as
part
of
the
program
s
entertainment
we
gather
in
a
hotel
room
with
dim
light
kept
back
a
safe
distance
from
the
surgeon
a
woman
who
be
a
member
of
our
group
and
a
cancer
patient
lay
on
a
bed
the
surgeon
perform
with
his
hand
only
start
by
rub
the
woman
s
stomach
she
be
conscious
the
entire
time
and
in
no
visible
pain
after
a
few
minute
the
doctor
could
be
see
use
only
his
hand
and
no
instrument
pull
blood
and
tissue
out
of
the
woman
which
he
dumped
into
a
bucket
the
woman
her
cancerous
growth
allegedly
remove
have
no
scar
but
only
a
red
stomach
from
the
surgeon
s
rub
it
s
typical
magician
stuff
although
we
ve
heard
some
people
endorse
it
and
say
that
they
felt
relief
from
their
ailment
after
the
encounter
i
tend
to
think
it
s
a
classic
case
of
mind
over
matter
the
power
of
the
mind
to
bring
about
a
cure
one
of
the
people
with
us
when
we
witness
the
surgery
actually
stole
a
bloodstained
towel
which
have
be
use
during
the
operation
on
his
wife
he
brought
it
back
to
the
united
state
and
have
it
test
the
stain
be
identify
as
human
blood
but
be
too
old
to
determine
whether
it
match
the
woman
s
blood
type
sadly
her
cancer
be
not
cure

modesty
be
not
her
strong
suit
business
continued
to
thrive
in
the
philippine
it
be
there
that
i
first
start
pay
attention
to
coke
s
multiplier
effect
on
the
local
economy
in
the
small
store
coke
represent
percent
of
the
total
business
when
you
consider
the
thousand
of
coke
employee
store
owner
and
other
vendor
the
company
have
a
massive
effect
on
the
filipino
economy
do
much
to
provide
employment
and
help
alleviate
poverty
an
effect
that
bolster
my
belief
in
the
power
of
capitalism
toward
the
end
of
my
time
in
the
philippine
pepsi
invite
me
to
breakfast
with
the
company
s
head
of
international
business
i
ve
always
believe
that
there
be
absolutely
no
harm
in
meeting
with
the
competition
provide
there
be
no
illegal
discussion
such
meeting
provide
a
chance
to
talk
about
industry
issue
and
also
help
one
get
a
good
feel
for
the
competition
s
level
of
confidence
on
individual
issue
and
they
be
good
for
both
side
which
i
knew
the
meeting
however
turn
out
to
be
different
from
what
i
thought
it
would
be
i
be
offer
ownership
of
percent
of
the
pepsi
bottle
franchise
in
cape
town
if
i
would
sign
a
management
contract
for
three
year
to
try
and
resuscitate
the
business
which
have
be
severely
weaken
by
the
forbes
family
owner
of
the
coke
bottler
there
i
turn
pepsi
down
on
the
spot
i
be
too
loyal
to
coke
secondly
i
have
a
dictum
don
t
sell
something
you
don
t
believe
in
which
be
why
i
have
over
my
career
reject
four
offer
from
cigarette
manufacturer
finally
if
i
suddenly
appear
in
cape
town
to
run
the
bottle
franchise
coke
would
do
absolutely
everything
it
could
to
make
me
fail
so
not
only
be
it
something
i
be
unwilling
to
do
it
be
something
i
would
have
be
crazy
to
even
attempt
in
after
four
year
in
the
philippine
i
be
offer
the
chance
to
move
to
west
germany
and
head
coke
in
central
europe
although
san
miguel
exec
do
not
want
me
to
leave
and
i
have
a
year
left
on
my
contract
don
keough
convince
them
to
let
me
go
i
be
off
to
a
country
i
have
never
visit
and
a
very
different
challenge
before
leave
the
philippine
we
get
in
one
last
trip
to
maya
maya
for
waterskiing
and

and
take

to

profit
the
philippine
have
a
per
caput
annual
soft

to

and
for

in
my
last
full
year
in
the
philippine

increase
by
percent
despite
a
percent
drop
in
soft

across
the
country
and
a
similar
drop
that
year
in
the
filipino
gross
domestic
product
coca
cola
be
sell
more
concentrate
to
the
joint

and
the
value
of
its
stake
in
the
venture
soar
a
decade
after
the
joint
venture

be
form
the
business
be
worth
half
a
billion
dollar
five
time
its
value
when
i
arrive
i
left
just
as
the
marcos
regime
begin
to
totally
unravel
marcos
be
force
from
power
in
february
follow
the
assassination
of
opposition

at

as
he
return

marcos
relinquish
his
presidency
san

be
the
target
of
a
boycott
by

opponent
because
of

to
the
regime
cause
a
temporary
percent
drop
in
the
value
of
san
miguel
stock
in
retrospect
the
most
important
business
lesson
i
can
impart
from
my
time
in
the
philippine
be
the
importance
the
necessity
of
learn
how
to
rally
the
troop
you
can
be
the
best
accountant
in
the
world
the
best
technician
or
global
strategist
you
can
work
one
hundred
hour
a
week
but
if
you
can
t
motivate
the
men
and
woman
who
be
the
company
s
frontline
in
the
marketplace
you
be
not
likely
to
succeed
as
a
business
leader
of
course
it
s
more
complicate
than
that
we
need
superior
strategy
and
tactic
and
a
strong
balance
sheet
and
always
the
power
of
the
world
s
great
brand
coca
cola
in
the
end
however
it
s
all
about
people
when
i
look
back
at
image
of
a
young
version
of
myself
in
the
philippine
do
pushup
on
the
stage
wear
a
general
s
uniform
rid
in
a
tank
smash
pepsi
bottle
against
the
wall
amid
the
blaring
lyric
of
eye
of
the
tiger
it
be
a
distant
world
from
the
staid
coke
boardroom
of
later
year
where
i
wore
expensive
suit
and
have
the
privilege
of
meeting
with
some
of
the
most
powerful
business
leader
of
the
world
i
now
realize
that
without
the
motivational
skill
i
developed
in
the
tropical
island
of
the
philippine
i
would
never
have
be
able
to
successfully
lead
coca
cola
or
any
other
large
company
in
retrospect
i
also
see
how
important
it
be
to
have
plunge
into
a
corporate
turnaround
battle
which
be
to
prove
valuable
when
i
become
chairman
and
ceo
of
the
company
nearly
two
decade
later
it
be
risky
yes
but
for
any
business
executive
there
be
no
great
opportunity
both
in
the
short
and
long
term
than
transform
a
money
lose
operation
into
a
profitable
one
the
philippine
make
my
career
four
stagnation
in
west
germany
there
could
not
have
be
a
great
contrast
between
the
tropical
philippine
with
its
relaxed
fun
love
atmosphere
and
the
often
cold
and
rainy
sophisticated
and
stoic
west
germany
informality
to
formality
relaxed
to
discipline
we
move
from
one
extreme
to
another
on
every
point
of
the
scale
while
back
in
atlanta
for
eight
week
of
training
technically
i
d
be
away
from
the

of
an
amaze
skill

that
contribute
greatly
to
my
career
advancement
over
the
year
then
pamela
flew
back
to
the
philippine
to
pack
up
our
belonging
for
the
move
to
germany
cara
be
only
seven
and
have
already
live
in
four
country
and
on
three
continent
i
be
the
first
non
german
since
to
head
coca
cola
in
germany
which
be
vie
with
japan
to
be
the
large
division
in
the
company

international
portfolio
while
on
a
visit
to
the
philippine
don
keough
have
offer
me
the
new
job
during
a
meeting
at
the
famous
manila
hotel
he
want
an
outsider
to
shake
up
the
business
and
energize
a
profitable
but
stagnant
market
i
be
up
for
the
challenge
even
though
i
spoke
very
little
german
despite
a
one
week
course
i
take
in
new
york
my
new
job
come
with
the
title
of
division
president
of
central
europe
with
switzerland
and
austria
also
part
of
my
territory
it
be
a
tumultuous
year
for
coca
cola
which
have
in
a
bold
move
introduce
a
new
sweeter
formula
new
coke
in
the
spring
of
consumer
backlash
be
palpable
as
i
discover
while
in
atlanta
for
my
orientation
on
germany
check
in
on
a
flight
from
atlanta
to
savannah
for
a
meeting
on
bottler
restructuring
an
airline
attendant
saw
the
coca
cola
tag
on
my
luggage
and
promptly
say
i
hate
you
you
take
my
coca
cola
away
you
ve
ruin
my
life
you
could
feel
the
tension
at
headquarters
which
be
fielding
similar
complaint
even
from
bottler
who
say
they
be
ostracize
at
their
hometown
country
club
the
coke
leadership
call
in
executive
from
all
over
the
world
tell
everyone
in
no
uncertain
term
to
stay
on
message
during
the
controversy
and
not
to
criticize
new
coke
germany
have
be
schedule
to
be
next
behind
the
u
s
to
launch
new
coke
but
it
become
clear
in
my
first
meeting
with
the
german
bottler
that
they
want
no
part
of
it
i
then
discover
that
we
be
about
to
launch
cherry
coke
in
germany
so
i
request
headquarters
to
delay
new
coke
argue
that
there
wasn
t
anything
wrong
with
new
coke
wink
wink
but
that
handle
two
launch
at
once
would
be
too
difficult
i
be
buying
time
and
it
work
new
coke
have
be
one
of
the
most
heavily
research
product
of
all
time
and
while
many
consumer
like
the
taste
the
study
never
detect
the
impact
of
kill
the
old
formula
which
over
decade
have
developed
an
extremely
strong
and
nostalgic
follow
as
keough
later
say
the
original
formula
remind
many
consumer
of
their
youth
and
coke
be
take
that
away
in
fact
some
believe
the
new
coke
fiasco
be
a
clever
marketing
trick
since
sale
actually
increase
as
lapse
user
rediscover
their
favorite
brand
keough
have
always
capture
the
truth
when
he
say
we
be
not
that
dumb
and
we
be
not
that
smart
it
be
a
great
lesson
on
market
research
you
have
to
be
sure
you
re
ask
the
right
question
in
the
right
way
in
the
right
context
no
one
research
what
the
reaction
would
be
if
the
result
of
new
coke
be
take
the
old
formula
away
it
be
also
a
much
deeper
lesson
the
brand
belongs
to
the
consumer
while
the
formula
be
under
lock
and
key
what
it
stood
for
be
lock
into
the
mind
of
consumer
the
brand
be
big
than
the
company
many
year
of
history
have
unequivocally
define
the
brand
to
its
loyal
consumer
and
even
to
its
lapse
consumer
the
old
formula
rename
classic
coke
be
resurrect
after
about
ten
week
and
new
coke
gradually
fade
away
spar
me
from
face
that
controversy
in
germany
with
that
potential
maelstrom
avert
i
begin
settle
in
to
my
new
job
and
our
new
life
it
be
not
easy
at
first
but
we
work
hard
to
connect
to
the
local
culture
while
most
of
the
expat
chose
to
live
near
the
american
international
school
where
cara
be
enrol
pamela
and
i
decide
to
live
in
an
all
german
neighborhood
this
be
somewhat
difficult
at
first
since
our
neighbor
be
not
prone
to
knock
on
the
door
and
introduce
themselves
in
fact
they
hardly
knew
each
other
shortly
after
arrive
we
held
a
dinner
party
for
my
direct
report
and
their
wife
some
of
the
wife
of
the
senior
executive
have
never
met
one
another
socialize
with
coworkers
be
not
part
of
the
culture
the
dinner
party
be
also
a
lesson
in
german
punctuality
at
ten
minute
before
the
appoint
arrival
time
we
heard
the
car
pull
up
at
two
minute
to
the
hour
we
heard
the
almost
simultaneous
opening
and
closing
of
car
door
then
the
doorbell
rang
and
there
be
everyone
stand
at
our
door
at
the
office
manager
always
kept
their
door
close
a
part
of
the
german
psyche
i
have
read
about
german
culture
and
its
do
s
and
don
t
the
classic
american
way
be
to
make
change
that
alienate
the
culture
a
big
mistake
while
the
close
atmosphere
do
not
match
my
style
the
only
change
i
make
be
to
keep
my
own
office
door
open
hop
to
set
an
example
with
the
help
of
heinz
wiezorek
my
german
equivalent
of
king
king
i
do
try
to
make
little
move
to
create
a
more
relaxed
atmosphere
senior
management
ate
lunch
each
day
in
the
executive
din
room
where
there
be
a
buzzer
just
beneath
my
place
at
the
table
in
a
robotic
procedure
symbolic
of
the
stilted
office
atmosphere
i
would
hit
the
button
when
we
be
finish
with
the
first
course
and
the
door
to
the
kitchen
would
open
almost
instantaneously
and
a
waitress
would
march
in
to
clear
the
plate
for
the
next
course
of
the
three
course
meal
after
a
while
i
decide
to
close
the
executive
din
room
require
executive
to
begin
eat
lunch
in
the
canteen
with
everyone
else
i
also
have
the
office
repaint
in
white
and
coca
cola
s
signature
red
cover
up
the
depress
dark
brown
color
scheme
we
also
eliminate
preferential
parking
spot
these
may
seem
like
minor
move
but
they
be
symbolic
of
a
more
open
culture
a
less
hierarchal
culture
that
i
be
try
to
create
my
view
be
that
people
judge
not
just
by
hearing
what
you
say
but
by
see
what
you
do
this
be
the
era
of
a
german
terrorist
group
call
the
red
army
faction
which
kill
and
kidnap
lead
business
figure
sadly
alfred
herrhausen
deutsche
bank
chairman
and
a
member
of
the
coca
cola
advisory
board
be
a
victim
of
the
red
army
faction
i
be
reliably
inform
that
my
name
be
on
the
list
our
home
be
equip
with
a
panic
button
to
the
local
police
which
we
be
force
to
use
one
day
after
a
drunk
arrive
at
our
door
shout
abuse
police
be
there
in
ninety
second
we
be
also
provide
with
a
company
driver
who
would
take
cara
to
and
from
school
each
day
always
by
varied
route
most
of
the
parent
at
the
school
come
to
believe
that
the
driver
be
actually
cara
s
father
it
take
me
quite
a
few
month
to
learn
that
although
the
driver
may
not
speak
english
well
they
understood
it
completely
this
allow
me
to
build
a
very
useful
relationship
with
them
they
would
pick
up
visitor
from
atlanta
at
the
frankfurt
airport
for
the
two
hour
drive
to
essen
as
they
sat
in
the
backseat
talk
about
the
business
and
about
me
the
driver
would
listen
understand
just
about
everything
that
be
say
it
take
about
a
year
before
they
start
relay
the
story
to
me
and
i
have
a
wonderful
accidental
espionage
operation
about
what
executive
in
atlanta
be
say
and
think
lesson
driver
have
ear
in
germany
i
face
a
completely
different
business
challenge
than
i
have
in
the
philippine
coke
overwhelmingly
dominate
the
german
market
and
profit
be
good
however
sale
be
stagnant
as
be
profit
part
of
the
solution
be
to
consolidate
the
bottler
in
west
germany
the
bottle
system
have
be
developed
after
world
war
ii
literally
with
bottle
equipment
that
have
be
use
to
ensure
that
u

have
coca

on

during

coca

remain
intact
manage
by
max

it
be
impossible
during

to
import
coca

concentrate
keith
invent
fanta
the
company
s
first
noncola
product
which
be
now
the
lead
orange
drink
in
the
world
although
the
italian
also
claim
provenance
in
the
war
s
aftermath
small
bottle
plant
make
sense
because
there
be
a
shortage
of
investment
capital
and
many
of
the
road
and
bridge
be
still
bomb
damage
the
trip
from
essen
to
d
sseldorf
now
a
twenty
minute
drive
take
two
hour
in
the
early
postwar
year
in
those
day
the
cost
of
distribution
could
actually
outweigh
the
cost
of
production
so
the
solution
have
be
to
build
many
small
bottle
plant
throughout
the
country
there
be
a
bottle
plant
in
essen
and
a
bottle
plant
in
d
sseldorf
the
german
bottle
system
precisely
because
the

germany
the
strength
of
the
coke
brand
meant
that
we
could
charge
a
premium
for
our
product
with
our
price
often
percent
high
than
pepsi
s
yet
in
the
long
term
i
knew
this
be
unsustainable
we
be
face
increase
competition
from
import
and
from
pepsi
we
as
a
system
have
to
bring
down
our
cost
as
heinz
and
i
go
about
try
to
consolidate
the
bottler
i
found
the
command
structure
in
germany
under
which
we
work
strange
and
sometimes
awkward
i
be
caught
between
three
german
klaus
putter
claus
halle
and
eric
kreusch
putter
be
head
of
coke
in
europe
and
halle
be
international
president
both
be
base
in
atlanta
but
have
a
fracture
relationship
putter
be
technically
my
bos
but
from
day
one
halle
instruct
me
to
report
to
him
directly
though
informally
as
well
as
to
putter
far
complicate
matter
be
the
fact
that
kreusch
my
predecessor
as
head
of
coke
in
germany
have
stayed
on
when
i
take
over
and
have
be
assign
to
manage
the
bottler
consolidation
this
seem
to
make
a
great
deal
of
sense
since
kreusch
knew
the
bottle
system
and
its
owner
and
the
complexity
of
german
law
kreusch
be
detach
from
the
day
to
day
operation
of
the
german
business
which
i
be
undertaking
with
heinz
in
german
management
structure
all
of
the
top
executive
be
refer
to
as
gesch
ftsf
hrer
or
business
leader
unbeknownst
to
me
kreusch
be
portray
himself
to
the
bottler
as
the
head
business
leader
the
speaker
although
he
have
be
demote
and
be
reporting
to
me
in
the
coca
cola
structure
i
be
told
he
have
set
himself
up
among
the
german
bottler
as
my
superior
i
be
force
to
go
to
atlanta
and
explain
to
halle
that
i
believe
kreusch
be
undermine
me
i
ask
for
permission
to
let
kreusch
go
and
halle
approve
i
then
sought
and
receive
putter
s
approval
it
be
a
tough
start
for
my
new
job
i
didn
t
speak
the
language
a
key
executive
be
work
behind
my
back
and
i
be
caught
between
two
boss
who
although
they
have
start
in
the
german
business
within
day
of
each
other
have
always
have
a
frosty
relationship
my
next
task
be
even
less
pleasant
i
eliminate
one
hundred
high
cost
position
in
the
head
office
which
be
overstaffed
and
over
bureaucratized
we
be
not
invest
enough
money
in
the
marketplace
hence
the
stagnation
in
order
to
free
up
fund
i
need
to
cut
cost
in
germany
it
s
very
difficult
to
fire
employee
you
have
to
go
through
the
work
council
and
the
process
be
laborious
a
number
of
people
who
work
for
me
include
the
head
of
human
resource
and
the
head
of
legal
told
me
it
would
be
impossible
within
a
year
however
it
be
do
and
the
saving
direct
to
marketing
if
there
be
one
commonality
in
my
career
it
have
be
the
cut
of
unnecessary
cost
to
fuel
marketing
i
have
see
how
management
cut
marketing
to
fuel
the
bottom
line
and
make
their
number
to
the
detriment
of
the
business
in
the
long
term
my
approach
have
to
a
degree
earn
me
the
reputation
of
not
be
tough
enough
on
marketing
cost
and
while
recognize
that
there
be
always
some
waste
in
that
area
at
the
end
of
the
day
marketing
be
the
most
important
thing
we
can
do
to
fuel
the
brand
in
my
first
speech
to
the
german
bottler
i
told
them
you
be
look
at
this
irishman
who
have
come
here
from
the
philippine
who
know
nothing
about
germany
you
re
look
at
him
and
say
who
be
this
man
and
why
be
he
here
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
be
here
i
m
here
because
this
be
a
great
business
which
be
no
longer
perform
you
be
living
in
the
past
and
we
need
to
look
to
the
future
they
thought
they
be
the
best
bottler
in
the
world
yet
there
be
no
growth
which
be
indisputable
what
be
disputable
however
be
a
belief
by
some
that
we
have
reach
the
limit
of
growth
i
ve
come
to
bring
growth
back
for
you
and
for
us
i
continued
but
i
want
to
give
you
the
good
news
and
the
bad
news
the
good
news
be
that
i
m
a
bottler
and
i
know
your
business
the
bad
news
be
that
i
m
a
bottler
and
i
know
your
business
the
bottler
bang
their
fist
on
the
table
in
a
form
of
applause
and
appreciation
thaw
the
relationship
temporarily
though
many
battle
be
yet
to
be
fought
germany
have
a
very
powerful
bottler
association
that
be
run
by
a
bottler
name
klaus
maurers
klaus
and
i
manage
to
strike
up
a
close
relationship
he
be
a
tough
negotiator
but
an
honorable
man
later
when
i
be
chairman
and
ceo
of
the
company
the
trust
we
developed
during
those
early
year
would
prove
to
be
particularly
valuable
as
heinz
and
i
begin
examine
the
bottler
consolidation
issue
we
realize
that
the
coca
cola
company
have
a
major
bargaining
chip
german
bottler
have
be
reluctant
to
invest
in
can
plant
so
coca
cola
have
built
most
of
them
instead
which
make
coca
cola
the
owner
of
can
operation
in
germany
over
the
year
can
represent
an
increase
percentage
of
overall
sale
and
the
german
bottler
regret
that
they
have
cede
this
lucrative
segment
of
the
business
essentially
the
company
have
two
profit
stream
one
from
concentrate
as
be
normal
and
the
second
from
production
of
can
product
the
bottler
only
have
a
modest
distribution
margin
on
can
although
some
do
own
share
in
some
of
the
can
plant
heinz
and
i
developed
a
plan
we
would
consolidate
the
bottler
into
one
new
company
which
would
include
the
lucrative
can
franchise
the
bottler
would
receive
share
in
the
new
concern
in
exchange
for
their
plant
the
share
would
have
be
much
more
valuable
than
the
small
bottle
plant
themselves
in
part
because
of
the
can
franchise
but
also
because
of
the
enormous
cost
saving
we
calculate
from
consolidate
the
bottle
operation
max
schmeling
the
boxing
champion
be
well
respect
and
he
and
i
have
developed
a
strong
relationship
despite
the
fact
that
his
english
be
not
very
good
and
my
german
be
weak
on
his
eightieth
birthday
i
present
max
with
a
sculpture
boxing
glove
hold
a
coca
cola
bottle
make
of
heavyweight
krupp
steel
it
encapsulate
germany
s
solidity
and
max
s
life
as
a
boxer
and
coke
bottler
i
believe
max
translate
to
the
bottler
that
i
be
sincere
in
my
consolidation
effort
in
the
summer
of
atlanta
give
me
approval
to
present
the
plan
to
the
bottler
in
our
initial
meeting
we
have
great
acceptance
than
we
anticipate
but
it
be
far
from
universal
we
felt
that
we
have
about
percent
of
the
bottler
on
board
another
percent
whom
we
could
convince
and
another
percent
who
strongly
oppose
the
plan
and
would
never
agree
despite
our
optimism
the
plan
immediately
spark
an
uproar
regardless
of
the
obvious
business
logic
and
the
fact
that
it
would
be
very
lucrative
for
the
bottler
emotion
surge
for
many
of
the
bottler
high
profit
do
not
trump
the
loss
of
control
over
their
own
company
heinz
recall
in
an
interview
for
this
book
and
some
of
the
bottler
be
already
so
wealthy
a
little
more
money
be
not
that
tempt
particularly
if
it
meant
lose
the
prestige
of
own
a
coca
cola
bottle
franchise
we
would
tell
the
bottler
today
you
make
five
million
dollar
a
year
in
profit
you
could
easily
make
seven
million
dollar
heinz
recall
the
bottler
would
say
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
with
the
five
million
dollar
my
family
be
rich
everything
be
great
what
will
i
do
with
the
additional
two
million
dollar
bottler
begin
call
atlanta
to
complain
which
we
have
expect
and
felt
we
could
manage
we
be
wrong
heinz
and
i
be
at
a
meeting
in
munich
when
halle
call
stop
he
told
me
you
re
not
to
go
any
far
you
be
to
abandon
the
plan
heinz
and
i
met
that
even
in
the
hotel
believe
our
career
be
over
that
we
have
be
totally
undermined
by
headquarters
and
that
we
need
to
resign
we
both
agree
to
do
so
the
next
morning
yet
after
sleep
on
it
we
decide
not
to
although
we
have
indeed
be
undermined
we
be
not
go
to
give
up
so
easily
we
would
now
find
another
way
to
accomplish
our
goal
soon
after
we
begin
negotiation
with
the
bottler
and
developed
a
plan
to
low
cost
while
whittle
the
number
of
bottler
down
to
not
one
as
originally
plan
we
create
a
central
sale
office
which
be
both
more
efficient
and
more
convenient
for
the
large
customer
who
would
no
longer
have
to
order
from
several
different
bottler
and
we
close
some
production
facility
and
give
the
bottler
a
piece
of
the
can
business
in
exchange
for
lower
some
of
their
product
discount
it
be
a
compromise
and
like
all
compromise
it
be
a
bit
messy
although
the
overall
strategy
be
see
as
a
success
in
atlanta
i
have
manage
to
consolidate
austria
and
switzerland
down
to
single
bottler
in
germany
it
get
us
only
halfway
to
where
we
need
to
be
halfway
wasn
t
enough
though
we
be
able
to
put
growth
back
into
the
business
and
achieve
a
material
increase
in
profitability
later
as
ceo
and
chairman
i
finish
the
job
that
need
to
be
do
today
germany
operates
under
a
single
bottler
in
another
accomplishment
which
i
view
as
significant
heinz
and
i
also
introduce
a
new
returnable
liter
plastic
bottle
which
be
still
use
in
many
country
we
invent
the
bottle
even
though
we
do
not
have
approval
from
atlanta
to
do
so
recall
heinz
who
succeed
me
as
german
division
manager
we
save
money
in
other
part
of
our
business
and
paid
for
the
development
of
the
bottle
which
be
a
lightweight
plastic
in
marketing
we
tout
it
as
the
unbreakable
bottle
the
bottle
be
extremely
successful
and
decade
ahead
of
its
time
environmentally
retailer
embrace
the
bottle
because
they
contain
percent
more
content
than
the
old
one
liter
glass
bottle
german
be
accustom
to
return
bottle
for
deposit
they
return
all
empty
bottle
soft
drink
mineral
water
and
beer
so
it
be
already
part
of
the
culture
the
new
plastic
bottle
be
wash
sanitize
and
reuse
twenty
time
greatly
reduce
the
amount
of
plastic
use
despite
these
achievement
there
be
time
when
i
worried
that
my
career
at
coca
cola
be
over
at
a
gathering
of
supermarket
executive
in
nice
france
don
keough
the
company
president
and
ralph
cooper
one
of
my
peer
in
europe
be
there
for
two
day
i
suddenly
realize
that
ralph
have
be
invite
by
don
to
a
dinner
and
i
be
ignore
i
thought
don
be
snub
me
because
of
the
bottler
restructuring
and
mention
it
to
his
executive
assistant
john
white
who
manage
to
get
me
into
one
final
lunch
still
i
believe
i
be
get
the
cold
shoulder
from
north
avenue
at
the
airport
in
nice
i
ran
into
michael
j
o
connor
a
giant
in
the
supermarket
industry
and
close
friend
of
keough
who
have
found
the
retail
research
council
in
the
u
s
i
become
good
friend
with
michael
while
serve
on
the
research
council
in
europe
and
he
be
someone
i
trust
and
confide
in
i
just
get
stiffed
by
don
i
told
michael
i
think
it
s
over
at
this
point
in
my
career
other
company
be
approach
me
to
discus
job
offer
and
some
of
the
position
be
quite
attractive
such
as
president
of
the
guinness
beer
empire
base
in
london
i
told
michael
i
might
start
look
around
michael
assure
me
that
i
have
it
all
wrong
and
that
my
career
be
on
track
you
be
part
of
the
future
of
this
company
he
say
stay
around
he
be
right
and
there
be
a
business
lesson
there
hypersensitivity
can
be
hazardous
to
your
career
as
you
advance
up
the
ladder
in
a
corporation
it
be
possible
to
see
phantom
everywhere
that
in
your
perception
be
out
to
destroy
your
career
almost
always
it
s
your
imagination
try
to
get
the
well
of
you
while
i
perceive
don
keough
as
snub
me
it
be
in
fact
a
simple
oversight
a
year
later
he
ask
me
to
lead
a
task
force
evaluate
coke
s
operation
in
brazil
then
manage
by
jorge
giganti
north
avenue
complain
that
giganti
be
not
communicate
well
with
headquarters
that
he
have
a
crazy
idea
about
sponsor
the
bankrupt
brazilian
soccer
league
behind
it
all
however
be
the
basic
fact
that
growth
be
stagnant
after
arrive
in
rio
i
ask
jorge
for
his
side
of
the
story
it
s
fine
he
say
later
add
i
only
phone
atlanta
once
a
month
within
the
first
hour
i
have
discover
the
core
of
the
problem
lack
of
communication
we
spent
the
week
there
and
validate
that
the
soccer
sponsorship
be
actually
a
good
idea
for
only
million
all
the
soccer
team
in
brazil
would
be
wear
the
coca
cola
logo
this
be
brazil
and
this
be
soccer
we
would
have
be
crazy
to
have
turn
down
that
sponsorship
a
lack
of
trust
and
a
lack
of
communication
between
giganti
and
headquarters
have
place
a
cloud
over
the
deal
i
disagreed
with
only
one
of
giganti
s
decision
which
be
to
allow
the
coke
bottler
to
also
sell
beer
a
visit
to
one
bottle
plant
convince
me
of
this
the
beer
truck
outside
the
plant
be
shiny
and
new
while
the
coca
cola
truck
be
a
disgrace
the
paint
fade
and
chipped
giganti
and
more
important
some
of
the
bottler
have
fall
in
love
with
a
new
skirt
beer
and
be
ignore
the
more
profitable
mainstay
coca
cola
i
return
to
atlanta
and
present
my
finding
to
the
company
senior
management
team
lead
by
keough
and
claus
halle
i
actually
think
this
be
very
simple
i
told
the
group
you
re
half
the
problem
and
jorge
be
half
the
problem
you
re
talk
past
each
other
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
s
as
simple
as
that
i
then
point
by
point
go
through
the
other
outstanding
issue
largely
agree
with
the
brazilian
strategy
i
told
them
far
that
jorge
have
agree
to
begin
call
atlanta
once
a
week
and
to
be
absolutely
transparent
about
what
he
be
do
i
think
it
s
go
to
work
i
add
it
do
communication
and
trust
often
drive
decision
make
as
much
as
logic
for
the
first
year
in
germany
my
family
and
i
be
miserable
but
that
would
change
totally
as
we
learn
to
appreciate
the
warmth
of
the
people
there
be
nothing
superfluous
in
german
friendship
german
friend
be
real
friend
we
end
up
make
some
really
great
friend
and
keep
in
touch
with
them
even
to
this
day
in
germany
there
be
a
tradition
that
when
you
become
close
a
family
will
literally
propose
ask
you
to
become
du
friend
du
be
the
german
word
for
you
reserve
for
family
and
close
friend
as
oppose
to
the
more
formal
sie
when
you
be
ask
to
become
a
du
friend
both
couple
link
arm
and
drink
a
toast
of
german
sekt
champagne
it
s
quite
a
big
deal
we
make
three
du
friend
in
germany
while
we
be
there
all
outside
the
coca
cola
community
on
one
occasion
we
go
with
one
of
our
du
friend
to
a
particularly
memorable
dinner
at
the
bavarian
castle
of
the
count
of
thurn
und
taxi
who
be
a
member
of
a
royal
family
that
have
make
a
fortune
develop
the
german
postal
service
the

a
successor
and
be
married
to
a
young
woman
name
gloria
von
thurn
und
taxi
who
be
totally
outrageous
and
feature
in
every
german
magazine
at
the
time
she
be
in
her
late
twenty
and
her
hair
be
dyed
pink
the
count
be
forty
year
her
senior
it
be
a
very
formal
dinner
with
ornate
candelabra
on
the
table
and
footman
wear
their
royal
livery
after
dinner
we
retire
to
the
basement
and
the
castle
bowling
alley
which
be
old
wooden
and
warp
on
the
wall
be
the
name
of
the
bowler
who
have
score
strike
date
back
to
the

with
royal
name
in
gold
commoner
in
black
the
count
be
sit
in
a
corner
rather
inebriate
with
spiffy
young
men
fawn
over
him
his
young
wife
a
singer
in
a
pop
band
decide
to
give
a
live
performance
with
a
song
to
her
husband
that
be
basically
a
sexual
taunt
the
cellar
be
fill
with
serious
business
executive
along
with
young
and
trendy
german
society
on
the
dance
floor
we
manage
to
slide
out
early
at
a
m
with
a
glimpse
of
a
side
of
german
life
that
fascinate
us
but
to
which
we
do
not
belong
we
love
the
order
and
discipline
of
germany
although
we
hat
the
fact
that
shop
close
at
noon
on
saturday
for
example
there
be
a
pond
near
our
house
and
we
d
go
there
regularly
to
buy
fresh
trout
though
never
on
sunday
when
almost
everything
be
close
our
house
in
france
be
a
twelve
hour
drive
away
so
we
be
able
to
spend
more
time
there
as
well
as
in
many
wonderful
european
city
pamela
want
a
mercedes
slc
and
we
bought
one
even
though
some
people
told
us
a
certain
lady
of
the
even
drove
the
same
model
however
we
decide
that
since
it
be
the
car
pamela
want
she
should
have
it
and
i
could
use
the
extra
tax
free
income
we
spent
some
weekend
along
the
rhine
river
with
its
absolute
picture
book
scenery
once
stay
in
a
twelfth
century
renovate
castle
with
an
owner
who
also
look
like
he
have
come
out
of
the
twelfth
century
there
be
another
memorable
weekend
on
sylt
the
fashionable
north
sea
island
that
almost
anyone
who
be
anyone
have
visit
the
people
be
easy
to
identify
and
remember
as
you
wander
the
beach
you
can
t
help
but
notice
a
complete
absence
of
any
swimwear
although
there
be
some
people
who
be
fully
clothed
include
ourselves
pamela
note
correctly
that
most
of
the
people
who
have
their
clothes
off
be
a
little
too
old
to
be
interest
i
remember
stand
suitably
clad
in
a
line
to
get
ice
cream
between
two
rather
naked
very
brown
slightly
protrude
lady
two
elderly
couple
both
stark
naked
approach
each
other
on
the
beach
apparently
friend
they
kiss
each
other
on
the
cheek
and
greet
one
another
in
the
third
person
while
their
extremity
flap
with
their
movement
despite
baring
all
they
be
not
yet
du
friend
we
be
even
able
to
make
a
day
trip
behind
the
berlin
wall
on
a
cold
winter
day
in
pamela
cara
and
i
join
a
german
colleague
at
coke
georg
fleischer
and
his
wife
and
daughter
georg
who
escape
from
east
germany
after
world
war
ii
by
jumping
over
a
barbwire
fence
be
in
charge
of
the
communist
country
in
eastern
europe
as
well
as
turkey
a
very
small
division
that
dealt
primarily
in
countertrade
since
communist
currency
be
not
convertible
on
the
world
market
under
this
arrangement
coca
cola
would
trade
for
a
product
make
by
the
communist
country
and
would
then
sell
that
product
in
the
west
create
a
credit
which
allow
the
import
of
the
concentrate
to
produce
our
brand
it
be
a
very
difficult
and
awkward
process
since
there
be
so
few
eastern
bloc
product
that
could
be
sell
easily
in
the
west
one
notable
exception
be
the
russian
vodka
stolichnaya
land
exclusively
and
unfortunately
by
pepsi
we
hire
driver
to
take
us
across
the
border
in
separate
car
georg
and
his
family
take
one
checkpoint
since
they
be
german
citizen
my
family
and
i
go
through
the
infamous
checkpoint
charlie
a
chill
experience
with
an
extensive
tense
search
that
last
nearly
forty
five
minute
all
your
money
have
to
be
convert
into
east
german
mark
and
if
the
money
be
unspent
you
be
not
allow
to
bring
it
out
of
east
germany
on
your
return
to
the
west
georg
take
us
on
a
tour
of
the
neighborhood
where
he
live
as
a
child
there
be
still
bombed
out
area
more
than
forty
year
after
the
war
georg
have
two
sister
still
living
in
east
berlin
who
be
married
to
senior
official
in
the
communist
party
theoretically
we
could
walk
around
the
corner
here
and
see
your
sister
and
brother
in
law
i
say
to
georg
what
would
you
do
if
that
happen
we
would
walk
past
each
other
he
reply
it
s
not
in
my
interest
or
coca
cola
s
interest
to
have
any
interaction
with
them
whatsoever
and
it
s
certainly
not
in
their
interest
it
be
the
most
chill
feel
the
very
idea
of
walk
past
one
s
own
sister
after
the
wall
fell
i
ask
georg
if
he
have
link
up
with
his
family
yes
he
say
but
i
do
not
see
them
anymore
and
we
have
nothing
in
common
we
be
different
people
we
tour
east
berlin
eat
lunch
at
a
lead
hotel
that
be
nevertheless
very
low
quality
and
sparse
we
want
to
spend
our
east
german
mark
before
we
return
but
there
be
very
little
to
buy
we
finally
found
some
rubbishy
souvenir
to
purchase
and
then
it
hit
me
there
be
no
economy
in
east
germany
there
be
no
advertising
it
be
gray
and
dark
with
no
ambience
how
be
that
sustainable
we
go
back
through
the
border
and
i
felt
a
tremendous
relief
at
get
out
you
really
do
feel
oppress
behind
the
berlin
wall
at
age
nine
cara
suddenly
decide
that
she
want
to
be
an
english
girl
in
an
english
boarding
school
and
enrol
in
moira
house
school
in
eastbourne
we
miss
her
dreadfully
and
visit
on
weekend
but
in
early
it
be
time
to
move
to
yet
another
continent
and
this
time
cara
trade
her
british
accent
for
a
southern
drawl
while
i
have
view
my
effort
in
germany
as
a
partial
failure
since
we
have
never
totally
consolidated
the
bottler
atlanta
apparently
felt
otherwise
in
the
fall
of
just
three
month
after
i
have
help
resolve
the
friction
between
headquarters
and
brazil
i
be
offer
a
position
in
atlanta
as
a
group
president
for
all
of
eastern
and
northern
europe
the
soviet
union
africa
and
the
middle
east
seventy
nine
country
in
all
we
be
sorry
to
leave
germany
it
have
grown
on
us
during
our
time
there
yet
for
the
first
time
since
south
africa
we
would
have
a
permanent
home
pamela
and
i
have
always
like
atlanta
when
we
d
visit
and
rat
it
as
one
of
america
s
nice
city
with
its
wonderful
warm
climate
most
of
the
year
abundance
of
tree
and
lake
and
southern
hospitality
right
before
leave
germany
georg

now
report
to
me

me
on
a
tour
of
turkey
one
of
the
country

kent
i
have
no
way
of
know
it
at
the
time
but
muhtar
would
soon
become
one
of
my
most
valuable
lieutenant
the
world
be
about
to
change
very
quickly
five
the
wall
fall
shortly
after
move
to
atlanta
i
found
myself
on
a
company

award
the

to
the

reputable
and
wealthy

the
legal

with
the
kaki

be
progress
very
slowly
geoff
unsworth
who
be
in
charge
of
coke
s
middle
eastern
operation
at
the
time
do
not
endear
himself
to
me
when
he
repeat
former
white
house
press
secretary
marlin
fitzwater
s
quote
when
you
re
deal
with
the
middle
east
two
thousand
year
be
the
normal
wait
for
something
to
happen
sorry
but
that
be
a
bit
too
long
of
a
wait
for
me
we
met
prince
faisal
in
his
office
a
huge
opulent
room
his
desk
be
on
a
raise
platform
so
we
be
literally
look
up
at
him
he
proceed
to
deliver
a
lecture
it
be
fine
for
coca
cola
to
come
in
for
the
soccer
tournament
which
prince
faisal
be
personally
direct
though
we
would
never
be
allow
to
permanently
reenter
saudi
unless
we
partner
with
the
prince
s
prefer
partner
not
the
olayans
the
prince
want
the
business
and
be
absolutely
hostile
at
time
drop
veil
threat
into
our
conversation
we
report
back
to
the
olayans
and
be
assure
by
the
company
patriarch
suliman
olayan
that
we
should
not
be
concerned
he
s
be
give
the
world
youth
tournament
to
run
because
he
s
not
really
one
of
the
influential
prince
suliman
say
this
too
will
pas
the
prince
contact
us
once
again
a
few
month
later
but
we
be
unable
to
schedule
a
meeting
and
never
heard
from
him
again
suliman
be
right
it
go
away
meanwhile
the
kaki
suit
make
its
way
torturously
through
the
saudi
court
and
at
one
point
we
have
to
appear
before
the
saudi
minister
of
justice
for
two
hour
we
sat
with
a
senior
member
of
the
olayan
family
while
the
minister
heard
all
the
other
case
some
of
them
be
rather
tragic
there
be
an
eighteen
year
old
girl
married
to
a
really
wizened
old
man
a
force
marriage
she
claimed
that
he
have
beaten
her
yet
the
minister
brusquely
sent
her
home
with
no
relief
it
be
like
a
medieval
court
when
we
be
call
the
minister
ask
us
a
few
question
and
eventually
rule
in
our
favor
the
olayan
family
have
the
bottle
franchise
to
this
day
overseen
by
suliman
s
young
daughter
lubna
while
in
saudi
arabia
we
visit
a
private
home
where
the
johnnie
walker
black
label
flow
along
with
the
best
wine
and
everyone
stood
around
the
swim
pool
drinking
the
duplicity
of
the
society
be
absolutely
apparent
not
surprisingly
there
be
two
set
of
rule
in
this
conservative
muslim
country
that
be
my
first
introduction
to
saudi
arabia
which
be
not
initially
a
positive
one
and
saudi
indeed
turn
out
to
be
a
tough
market
for
coke
pepsi
have
enter
the
israeli
market
in
only
after
the
arab
boycott
be
over
so
while
coke
be
in
exile
pepsi
have
become
deeply
entrench
in
middle
eastern
market
like
saudi
arabia
after
the
boycott
end
we
hop
to
initially
gain
a
percent
market
share
in
saudi
but
fell
short
with
only
percent
underutilizing
our
large
new
bottle
plant
it
be
a
miscalculation
on
my
part
we
be
lose
money
but
believe
that
if
we
could
attack
pepsi
s
profit
center
in
saudi
arabia
it
would
limit
pepsi
s
investment
in
other
country
in
the
region
such
as
jordan
bahrain
and
dubai
where
coke
be
also
struggle
to
rebuild
the
middle
east
be
to
provide
me
with
many
headache
over
the
next
few
year
and
even
today
coke
still
trail
pepsi
in
some
of
the
region
s
country
egypt
where
we
negotiate
the
privatization
of
the
bottler
be
one
where
we
achieve
our
vision
but
i
underestimated
the
strength
of
the
pepsi
system
in
country
such
as
saudi
arabia
egypt
have
eject
coca
cola
in
during
the
arab
boycott
but
relent
in
follow
the
camp
david
accord
the
government
still
control
the
soft
drink
industry
with
pepsi
lead
in
cairo
and
coke
ahead
outside
the
capital
egypt
later
privatize
the
industry
and
i
travel
to
cairo
to
gauge
the
challenge
and
inspect
the
asset
the
company
would
be
purchasing
from
the
government
in
a
joint
venture
with
the
alhak
family
this
be
egypt
s
first
privatization
since
the
nationalization
era
of
nasser
the
coke
bottle
plant
in
cairo
be
in
terrible
shape
more
run
down
than
those
in
the
philippine
when
i
first
arrive
there
bad
i
spot
a
building
adjoin
the
plant
that
be
adorn
with
a
coca
cola
sign
it
s
just
another
building
we
own
an
egyptian
government
official
told
me
yet
something
in
the
tone
of
his
reply
make
me
suspicious
after
far
research
i
discover
the
building
be
a
brothel
although
it
be
probably
far
more
profitable
than
the
bottle
plant
we
told
egyptian
official
the
coca
cola
company
isn
t
buying
a
brothel
we
bought
the
bottle
plant
but
not
the
brothel
property
i
focus
on
building
sale
in
both
the
middle
east
and
africa
i
believe
coca
cola
have
ignore
africa
in
particular
and
that
there
be
huge
growth
potential
there
that
prove
to
be
correct
although
it
have
take
an
enormous
amount
of
work
to
achieve
early
produce
sign
that
apartheid
in
south
africa
might
be
thaw
president
f
w
de
klerk
be
clearly
soften
his
position
though
it
be
still
a
white
only
government
and
nelson
mandela
remain
imprison
coca
cola
have
divest
in
move
the
concentrate
plant
to
nearby
swaziland
and
sign
a
licensing
agreement
with
a
newly
form
entirely
independent
south
african
company
national
beverage
service
the
contract
give
coke
a
repurchase
option
when
and
if
apartheid
fell
national
beverage
be
manage
by
a
former
coca
cola
executive
sandy
allan
an
energetic
and
knowledgeable
but
stubborn
man
who
i
felt
do
not
always
dot
all
the
i
s
or
cross
all
the
t
s
which
would
become
an
issue
later
in
his
career
in
implement
an
antitrust
settlement
with
the
european
commission
shortly
before
i
left
germany
for
atlanta
i
phone
sandy
to
tell
him
that
in
my
new
position
as
group
president
i
would
oversee
the
relationship
with
national
beverage
no
you
won
t
he
reply
nobody
do
his
boast
of
independence
slowly
soften
as
the
political
climate
in
south
africa
evolve
and
he
could
foresee
coca
cola
return
to
exercise
the
repurchase
option
in
march
of
i
ask
sandy
to
come
to
atlanta
and
conduct
a
review
of
national
beverage
i
knew
all
the
south
african
bottler
and
they
be
tell
me
that
sandy
be
too
autocratic
and
they
want
coke
to
return
with
new
management
at
the
same
time
carl
ware

and
built
valuable
and
powerful
relationship
that
would
serve
the
company
well
this
be
a
source
of
friction
with
sandy
allan
but
the
company
be
on
a
dual
track
in
prepare
for
a
new
south
africa
without
carl

on

return
to

for
a
very
emotional
visit
pamela
be
with
me
and
have
be
reluctant
to
go
back
not
want
to
see
how
zambia
have
deteriorate
in
the
sixteen
year
since
our
departure
zambia
be
indeed
run
down
and
depress
a
very
pleasant
land
with
an
economy
ruin
by
extreme
mismanagement
yet
it
be
heartwarming
to
greet
my
old
colleague
some
of
whom
broke
into
tear
i
be
shock
however
to
learn
that
so
many
friend
have
die
this
be
africa
before
the
hiv
aid
epidemic
have
fully
swept
the
continent
yet
life
expectancy
be
still
very
low
we
shouldn
t
have
be
surprised
that
so
many
of
our
old
friend
be
no
longer
there
but
it
be
still
very
very
sad
at
a
bottler
s
conference
in
nairobi
i
spoke
from
my
heart
not
as
a
coca
cola
executive
visit
from
atlanta
but
as
someone
who
live
twenty
six
year
of
his
life
in
africa
mike
hall
who
have
be
my
marketing
manager
in
australia
and
be
now
in
charge
of
africa
deliver
a
very
powerful
speech
before
mine
which
i
thought
would
be
a
tough
act
to
follow
so
instead
of
stand
behind
the
podium
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
stage
my
leg
dangle
i
m
home
i
told
the
bottler
home
be
zambia
but
home
be
africa
there
be
a
magic
about
africa
that
will
never
leave
me
it
be
encapsulate
by
that
magical
aroma
that
be
release
from
the
arid
earth
that
have
not
see
rain
in
four
month
this
be
rebirth
the
rain
have
fall
we
be
go
to
regrow
this
business
just
like
the
maize
grows
when
the
rain
fall
the
bottler
unexpectedly
broke
into
applause
it
be
a
very
powerful
moment
for
both
pamela
and
i
the
year
we
live
in
africa
those
formative
year
haven
t
make
us
african
of
course
but
in
many
way
we
feel
like
child
of
africa
hardly
a
year
go
by
without
us
take
some
vacation
time
on

after

i
suddenly
realize
that
he
be
more
nervous
than
i
be
he
told
me
he
have
never
met
a
foreign
businessman
i
start
to
feel
as
if
i
be
in
charge
of
the
meeting
and
i
could
see
afwerki
visibly
relax
as
i
talk
about
my
view
of
africa
and
how
the
continent
have
a
great
future
john
belcher
then
detailed
what
we
need
to
get
the
plant
run
in
asmara
include
spare
part
and
a
land
strip
for
the
corporate
aircraft
we
reach
agreement
shook
hand
and
happily
get
out
of
that
wall
compound
eight
week
later
we
be
manufacturing
coca
cola
in
asmara
for
coca
cola
which
operates
in
country
these
type
of
meeting
come
with
the
territory
there
be
constant
war
and
revolution
natural
and
man
make
disaster
more
often
than
not
coca
cola
be
the
last
company
to
leave
if
it
leaf
at
all
and
the
first
to
return
a
record
of
which
the
company
and
its
executive
be
quite
proud
yet
it
be
not
always
easy
to
do
this
and
be
often
accompany
by
many
anxious
moment
i
discover
that
nigeria
be
a
particularly
troubled
market
with
absolutely
abysmal
condition
at
the
bottle
plant
a
good
quality
score
be
in
the
s
but
the
plant
in
lagos
score
a
an
absolute
disgrace
andrew
david
a
greek
cypriot
whose
family
own
a
majority
interest
in
the
nigerian
bottle
franchise
dispute
those
finding
say
his
own
inspector
have
calculate
a
quality
score
in
the
s
be
you
call
my
people
liar
andrew
say
to
me
when
i
challenged
his
assertion
and
warn
him
that
i
have
the
authority
to
shut
down
the
plant
we
agree
to
inspect
the
plant
together
with
a
group
of
technician
and
as
we
be
drive
there
we
pass
two
dead
body
along
the
road
apparently
a
common
sight
since
none
of
the
driver
bother
to
stop
the
inspection
prove
andrew
s
number
wrong
and
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
he
be
stone
face
and
refuse
to
talk
to
me
as
we
tour
another
plant
i
insist
that
we
have
breakfast
together
the
next
day
and
there
be
a
breakthrough
we
developed
a
plan
for
revamp
the
business
bring
in
new
management
both
at
the
bottler
and
on
coke
s
side
andrew
and
i
become
very
close
friend
after
that
confrontation
and
i
later
work
for
him
in
europe
as
part
of
a
bottler
merger
we
undertook
i
be
one
of
those
whom
he
nominate
to
deliver
a
eulogy
at
his
funeral
in
athens
it
be
a
sad
affair
as
he
be
a
great
friend
and
great
coke
bottler
the
lesson
i
will
never
forget
from
that
confrontation
with
andrew
be
that
a
business
leader
should
never
be
frighten
by
conflict
and
should
always
find
a
good
honest
solution
that
be
pragmatic
not
bullheaded
there
be
time
in
my
career
when
i
take
the
bullheaded
approach
and
it
be
always
a
mistake
back
home
in
atlanta
our
family
adjust
quickly
and
really
like
the
american
south
cara
thrive
in
her
new
school
pace
academy
yet
we
notice
that
there
be
less
interaction
with
coca
cola
employee
outside
the
office
than
there
have
be
in
the
many
outpost
where
we
have
be
earlier
station
this
be
home
base
and
coke
employee
be
anchor
in
their
school
church
and
neighborhood
and
therefore
less
reliant
on
each
other
also
i
have
reach
a
very
high
rank
in
the
company
and
there
be
a
palpable
difference
in
how
low
level
employee
react
to
me
i
remember
that
christmas
eve
in
johannesburg
when
i
be
have
drink
and
discuss
politics
with
my
coworkers
at
the
sunnyside
park
hotel
that
type
of
camaraderie
be
often
miss
when
you
be
a
group
president
there
be
truth
to
the
adage
it
s
lonely
at
the
top
with
a
territory
that
stretch
from
iceland
to
south
africa
and
across
to
the
far
eastern
ussr
half
my
time
be
spent
away
from
atlanta
the
travel
be
brutal
and
the
time
away
from
home
difficult
for
pamela
and
cara
i
miss
you
pamela
write
in
a
message
to
me
that
she
place
in
my
diary
on
july
yet
we
try
whenever
possible
to
offset
the
travel
and
hard
work
with
family
time
and
fun
i
promise
cara
that
i
would
be
with
her
on
her
thirteenth
birthday
but
i
have
a
mandatory
meeting
in
london
that
day
so
i
arrange
for
cara
to
fly
to
london
for
the
weekend
when
cara
turn
sixteen
she
and
i
take
a
trip
to
uganda
to
see
gorilla
in
the
wild
i
make
my
first
trip
to
moscow
to
set
up
a
representative
office
there
for
coca
cola
consider
such
a
major
accomplishment
that
we
held
a
celebratory
dinner
my
accommodation
remind
me
somewhat
of
the
crest
crane
hotel
in
zambia
the
inn
where
i
have
be
force
to
share
a
bed
with
a
coworker
so
many
year
earlier
and
where
we
have
be
serve
the
same
piece
of
tough
meat
at
dinner
and
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
the
moscow
hotel
be
not
much
well
the
towel
be
good
if
you
have
an
itchy
back
but
in
term
of
absorption
of
water
very
inefficient
the
curtain
in
the
room
hardly
block
the
light
under
the
countertrade
arrangement
at
the
time
coke
would
ship
a
small
amount
of
concentrate
to
the
state
own
bottle
plant
and
would
receive
soviet
make
lada
car
that
we
would
sell
in
great
britain
for
hard
currency
the
car
be
so
poorly
construct
it
would
require
three
day
of
modification
in
great
britain
before
they
could
be
sell
pepsi
of
course
have
the
much
well
countertrade
product
stolichnaya
vodka
we
be
lose
money
in
the
soviet
union
but
maintain
a
foothold
for
the
future
this
to
a
slightly
lesser
degree
be
the
situation
throughout
the
entire
communist
bloc
in
europe
then
the
future
arrive
on
november
the
berlin
wall
fell
i
watch
the
event
on
cnn
like
most
everyone
else
heinz
wiezorek
who
have
succeed
me
as
region
manager
in
germany
be
travel
in
the
u
s
when
the
wall
fell
but
the
company
react
quickly
to
the
historic
moment
with
two
bottler
in
west
berlin
opening
their
warehouse
and
give
free
case
of
coca
cola
to
east
german
who
pour
across
the
border
in
trabis
tiny
car
literally
make
of
plastic
there
be
thousand
of
car
per
day
just
circle
the
warehouse
which
show
very
clearly
the
hunger
they
have
for
coca
cola
heinz
recall
the
question
instantly
arose
would
the
bottler
in
west
germany
service
this
vast
new
east
german
territory
or
would
the
company
create
a
new
bottler
in
the
east
old
issue
about
bottler
consolidation
resurface
i
arrive
in
berlin
in
january
retrieve
a
piece
of
the
wall
for
cara
as
a
souvenir
the
change
in
atmosphere
be
unbelievable
doug
ivester
who
be
then
head
of
coke
in
europe
and
i
met
with
senior
east
german
official
all
of
whom
have
submit
their
resignation
and
be
work
on
the
transition
on
my
visit
behind
the
wall
one
could
see
that
the
citizen
be
deeply
afraid
of
the
communist
government
now
it
be
the
communist
official
who
be
in
fear
they
be
literally
sweat
during
our
meeting
their
role
in
the
new
order
now
completely
uncertain
the
west
german
bottler
would
have
love
if
i
have
sell
them
the
east
say
heinz
however
there
be
no
west
german
bottler
who
want
to
buy
the
total
the
result
would
have
be
far
fracture
of
the
system
the
opposite
of
the
goal
both
heinz
and
i
have
be
strive
for
which
be
a
single
german
bottler
as
the
west
german
bottler
begin
sell
in
east
germany
sometimes
out
of
makeshift
tent
in
empty
parking
lot
heinz
flew
to
atlanta
and
ask
for
million
to
build
a
company
own
bottler
in
the
east
i
fully
agree
with
heinz
while
ivester
be
a
strong
proponent
there
be
some
initial
opposition
at
north
avenue
there
be
a
time
when
company
president
don
keough
say
to
me
sell
it
to
the
west
german
bottler
don
t
invest
heinz
recall
this
be
typical
of
don
s
management
style
he
would
always
ask
tough
question
before
support
a
major
investment
hop
to
reveal
any
doubt
or
flaw
in
the
plan
he
be
a
bear
at
first
but
once
the
decision
be
make
he
would
support
you
even
if
the
result
later
prove
to
be
unfavorable
it
be
a
great
lesson
and
one
i
always
try
to
follow
the
east
german
venture
which
i
hand
over
to
the
europe
group
indeed
seem
like
a
risky
one
particularly
since
there
be
no
way
at
that
point
to
convert
the
east
german
mark
and
no
way
to
predict
what
the
exchange
rate
would
be
once
the
currency
be
convertible
this
be
a
risk
we
would
have
to
take
in
all
of
the
former
eastern
bloc
country
resistance
diminish
after
don
and
other
top
coke
executive
tour
east
germany
and
saw
the
progress
the
company
have
achieve
in
only
a
few
week
vend
machine
and
fountain
dispenser
have
already
start
to
permeate
the
country
on
the
day
coca
cola
announce
the
east
german
investment
coke
stock
jumped
several
point
wall
street
s
optimism
be
justified
when
the
currency
be
finally
convert
we
have
a
huge
amount
of
money
sit
in
the
bank
recall
heinz
i
will
never
forget
one
time
when
claus
halle
come
and
say
do
you
know
you
have
seventy
three
million
east
german
mark
sit
in
your
bank
account
less
than
three
week
after
the
wall
fell
i
be
in
moscow
to
celebrate
a
new
symbol
of
the
rapidly
change
time
in
subzero
temperature
my
leg
shake
from
the
cold
i
turn
a
switch
that
illuminate
a
twenty
by
forty
foot
red
neon
coca
cola
sign
in
pushkin
square
it
be
the
first
neon
sign
in
the
soviet
union
up
to
that
point
there
have
be
no
need
for
advertising
because
all
business
be
state
own
the
future
look
brighter
indeed
on
january
i
attend
the
opening
of
the
first
mcdonald
s
in
the
soviet
union
across
pushkin
square
from
the
new
coca
cola
sign
the
opening
illustrate
more
than
any
event
before
it
the
absolute
hunger
and
thirst
citizen
of
the
eastern
bloc
have
for
the
west
thousand
of
customer
wait
outside
in
the
cold
for
hour
to
get
in
in
that
first
day
the
restaurant
serve
thirty
thousand
people
a
record
for
mcdonald
s
and
the
rush
do
not
abate
even
year
later
there
would
be
as
many
as
five
thousand
people
in
line
regardless
of
the
weather
this
be
a
huge
breakthrough
not
only
for
mcdonald
s
and
coca
cola
but
for
all
western
business
engineer
beautifully
by
a
mcdonald
s
executive
from
canada
george
cohon
after
a
chance
meeting
with
soviet
official
during
the
olympics
in
montreal
for
the
first
time
foreigner
be
allow
to
stay
at
the
president
hotel
thanks
to
cohon
s
breakthrough
it
be
an
average
hotel
by
western
standard
but
a
big
step
above
the
poorly
maintain
hotel
where
i
have
stayed
on
my
previous
visit
every
floor
have
a
woman
who
would
hand
you
a
room
key
and
record
the
time
you
left
and
return
there
be
a
room
at
the
end
of
the
hallway
and
occasionally
the
door
would
be
open
and
you
could
see
a
man
wear
headphone
clearly
monitoring
the
listen
device
plant
in
each
room
when
you
have
a
really
important
conversation
to
make
you
literally
take
a
walk
in
the
park
mcdonald
s
schedule
a
tour
of
its
new
factory
that
supply
the
new
restaurant
and
willie
van
eupen
coke
s
region
manager
in
the
soviet
union
rent
a
stretch
limo
to
transport
the
coca
cola
executive
include
company
president
don
keough
a
clearly
lavish
gesture
that
would
have
embarrass
all
of
us
before
one
of
our
large
client
mcdonald
s
there
be
no
time
to
get
another
car
so
we
halt
the
limo
two
block
away
and
trudge
through
the
snow
to
the
factory
hiding
away
the
limo
that
night
there
be
a
huge
celebratory
dinner
at
the

all
of

look

bad
for

the
large
point
be
that
relation
with
the
soviet
union
be
improve
here
we
be
have
fun
in
a
hotel
reserve
for
the
soviet
hierarchy
which
our
tour
guide
have
never
be
inside
the
opening
of
the
first
mcdonald
s
along
with
the
coca
cola
neon
sign
on
pushkin
square
be
a
harbinger
of
well
day
ahead
i
have
to
learn
quickly
how
to
endure
an
old
business
ritual
in
the
soviet
union
the
ubiquitous
vodka
toast
which
require
you
to
balance
the
vodka
glass
on
the
edge
of
one
hand
raise
the
glass
to
your
lip
and
low
it
without
drop
it
first
they
would
make
a
toast
and
you
would
knock
back
a
shot
of
vodka
then
you
would
be
expect
to
make
a
toast
and
it
would
go
on
for
a
dozen
round
or
more
the
idea
it
seem
be
to
get
you
drunk
enough
so
that
you
would
do
something
stupid
this
could
be
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
the
day
after
the
opening
of
mcdonald
s
don
keough
and
i
have
a
meeting
at
the
kremlin
with
the
minister
of
foreign
economic
affair
it
be
a
m
we
have
to
have
a
toast
the
minister
say
bring
out
brandy
from
his
desk
drawer
for
a
round
of
toast
before
breakfast
i
developed
a
survival
system
everyone
during
the
toast
have
water
as
a
chaser
i
would
ask
for
a
coke
as
well
i
would
knock
back
the
first
two
shot
of
vodka
in
the
normal
fashion
from
then
on
i
would
spit
most
of
the
vodka
back
into
the
water
glass
chase
the
toast
with
my
coke
to
make
it
appear
normal
i
be
able
to
essentially
drink
less
than
half
the
volume
of
the
others
i
remember
one
russian
compliment
me
you
can
really
drink
your
vodka
you
re
strong
the
soviet
union
be
slow
to
adapt
to
capitalism
but
progress
be
rapid
in
the
small
country
of
eastern
europe
one
absolute
gem
be
romania
which
be
virgin
territory
for
both
coca
cola
and
pepsi
just
two
month
after
the
february
overthrow
of
romania
s
communist
president
nicolae
ceau
escu
a
letter
arrive
on
roberto
goizueta
s
desk
from
ion
staminichi
who
ran
two
state
own
bottle
plant
in
romania
and
want
the
coca
cola
franchise
the
letter
be
pass
to
me
and
from
me
to
muhtar
kent
who
be
deputy
division
president
in
essen
germany
we
set
up
a
meeting
with
staminichi
and
be
impressed
staminichi
have
never
buckle
to
ceau
escu
and
yet
have
manage
to
survive
although
the
plant
he
ran
be
old
and
really
run
down
and
produce
only
flavor
drink
and
not
cola
this
be
an
opportunity
to
be
first
in
the
door
georg
fleischer
and
i
make
a
pitch
to
don
keough
for
million
for
a
joint
venture
argue
that
it
be
a
meager
investment
to
be
first
on
the
ground
in
a
european
country
of
million
people
don
pound
the
table
as
he
be
sometimes
know
to
do
you
re
ask
me
to
invest
million
of
coca
cola
s
money
in
romania
and
you
don
t
even
know
how
to
get
that
money
out
of
romania
he
say
yes
don
i
reply
i
believe
thing
will
change
for
million
to
be
first
in
against
pepsi
to
capture
that
market
be
the
right
thing
to
do
it
s
leadership
and
we
need
to
be
the
leader
don
look
at
me
and
say
ok
go
do
it
the
message
be
don
t
wilt
don
a
brilliant
manager
be
try
to
ensure
i
be
commit
in
the
end
that
be
more
important
than
don
s
own
opinion
of
the
deal
since
i
would
be
the
one
make
sure
it
work
ok
don
we
ll
deliver
i
say
romania
have
proven
to
be
a
very
profitable
market
for
coke
with
strong
leadership
over
pepsi
as
we
invest
quickly
in
one
eastern
european
country
after
the
other
muhtar
be
my
most
valuable
lieutenant
on
the
ground
we
take
some
risk
and
make
some
thing
work
fast
for
the
company
in
eastern
europe
muhtar
recall
we
make
sure
that
people
up
the
chain
knew
what
we
be
do
so
that
there
be
never
a
surprise
we
pull
the
bureaucracy
with
us
so
to
speak
they
be
hang
on
to
the
train
coke
decide
to
invest
in
romania
before
the
country
have
even
write
a
foreign
investment
law
muhtar
recall
we
be
buying
a
factory
and
we
be
go
to
put
a
two
year
supply
of
concentrate
in
as
our
equity
say
muhtar
don
ask
what
be
you
go
to
do
after
two
year
we
have
faith
we
knew
it
would
take
care
of
itself
it
be
a
very
genuine
belief
that
all
of
those
country
as
the
berlin
wall
fell
be
actually
go
to
fall
into
a
capitalist
system
sooner
or
later
one
way
or
the
other
and
they
all
need
foreign
investment
they
all
need
free
float
currency
it
be
a
risk
worth
take
every
country
have
its
own
story
its
own
leader
its
own
way
of
do
business
in
poland
there
be
no
private
ownership
of
land
say
muhtar
how
be
we
go
to
get
land
for
the
first
coca
cola
plant
in
eastern
europe
we
do
a
deal
with
the
catholic
church
because
the
church
be
the
large
land
owner
in
poland
and
have
be
for
century
even
the
soviet
no
matter
how
much
they
pressure
the
polish
government
could
not
get
the
polish
government
to
confiscate
land
from
the
church
because
it
would
have
be
consider
heresy
we
sign
a
deal
with
the
church
to
lease
land
for
the
first
bottle
plant
that
land
to
this
day
be
still
lease
from
the
church
say
muhtar
we
built
the
new
bottle
plant
in
gdynia
a
few
mile
from
poland
s
shipbuilding
center
gdansk
where
the
solidarity
movement
have
be
born
don
keough
flew
in
for
the
opening
along
with
other
executive
from
atlanta
it
be
coke
s
first
new
bottle
plant
in
eastern
europe
a
very
big
deal
that
sunday
morning
don
inform
us
that
we
be
all
go
to
mass
at
the
historic
st

which
count
among
its
parishioner

s
chaplain
they
seat
the
coke
delegation
in
the
first
row
of
the
packed
church
we
couldn
t
understand
jankowski
s
entire
sermon
but
it
be
lace
with
the
term
coca
cola
it
sound
almost
as
if
he
be
tell
member
of
the
congregation
that
if
they
didn
t
drink
at
least
one
coke
every
morning
they
would
be
sentence
to
eternal
damnation
we
learn
later
that
he
be
detail
the
economic
benefit
of
the
new
plant
in
bring
job
to
the
community
it
be
an
education
on
the
benefit
of
capitalism
straight
from
the
catholic
church
soon
it
be
time
to
collect
the
church
offering
don
an
american
catholic
place
u
s
dollar
in
the
plate
and
smile
pass
it
to
me
an
irish
protestant
i
put
my
money
in
and
hand
it
to
georg
fleischer
a
german
lutheran
next
be
andrew
david
the
greek
orthodox
bottler
who
be
scout

in
eastern
europe
he
pass
it
on
to
muhtar
an
american
born
turk
and
muslim
the
last
member
of
our
delegation
be
danny
moskovitz
an
american
jew
here
be
the
coca
cola
delegation
and
it
be
totally
ecumenical
long
before
the
burst
of
globalization
of
recent
year
this
be
why
the
coca
cola
company
be
so
fascinate
it
s
a
united
nation
a
function
and
profitable
united
nation
the
transformation
of
eastern
europe
continued
country
by
country
with
muhtar
lead
the
charge
through
unstructured
and
uncharted
territory
travel
be
often
very
difficult
muhtar
recall
i
share
a
hotel
room
with
a
chinese
guy
in
albania
i
turn
the
light
on
and
there
be
a
guy
in
the
other
bed
i
thought
i
have
the
wrong
room
and
go
down
to
the
lobby
but
they
say
no
that
s
your
room
we
be
corporate
cowboy
and
reporter
sometimes
described
me
as
the
indiana
jones
of
coca
cola
we
be
pioneer
in
an
environment
that
be
just
begin
to
become
less
hostile
to
capitalism
and
free
enterprise
say
muhtar
the
same
thing
have
happen
in
china
over
the
last
ten
year
i
believe
in
the
second
decade
of
this
century
a
similar
boom
and
opening
will
happen
in
africa
which
have
a
billion
young
people
amid
the
opening
of
eastern
europe
muhtar
and
i
face
an
ugly
stand
down
with
a
bottler
in
turkey
it
s
rare
for
coca
cola
to
revoke
a
bottler
s
franchise
only
in
extreme
circumstance
be
this
do
normally
the
company
try
to
work
with
the
bottler
to
resolve
the
problem
the
turkish
bottler
the
have
group
control
percent
of
the
volume
in
that
country
and
after
the
owner
a
renowned
and
successful
businessman
die
the
quality
of
the
operation
begin
to
deteriorate
the
owner
s
widow
put
her
partner
in
charge
and
he
be
hostile
as
we
try
to
help
him
improve
in
a
meeting
in
istanbul
with
muhtar
and
me
sit
on
the
partner
s
desk
be
a
pistol
which
i
felt
be
a
clear
attempt
at
intimidation
we
summon
the
bottler
s
owner
to
atlanta
for
a
meeting
and
i
instruct
security
to
bring
the
boyfriend
into
the
building
through
the
basement
and
give
him
a
thorough
pat
down
not
the
usual
greet
for
a
major
bottler
but
in
this
case
it
be
necessary
to
show
the
partner
that
we
didn
t
trust
him
during
this
same
time
period
muhtar
s
bmw
be
destroyed
in
an
istanbul
car
bombing
fortunately
he
be
not
injured
and
no
link
with
the
turkish
bottler
be
ever
establish
yet
these
be
tense
day
indeed
even
more
so
when
the
bottler
s
widow
begin
lobbying
the
wife
of
turkey
s
president
turgut
zal
to
intervene
on
her
behalf
muhtar
arrange
for
us
to
meet
with
the
president
and
we
arrive
at
his
office
on
january
just
as
the
u
s
begin
bombing
iraq
the
launch
of
the
first
gulf

zal

three
of
us

it
he
be

call
from
president

muhtar
recall
in
front
of
us
he
talk
to

twice
because
the
line
get
cut
the
first
time
in
between
we
be
try
to
tell
him
that
we
meant
good
for
turkey
we
be
here
to
invest
we
be
not
try
to
be
harmful
to
anyone
when
i
ask

of
that
magnitude
during
my
career
developed
in
norway
and
sweden
in
the
mid
s
i
learn
in
a
newspaper
story
that
orkla
the
bottler
in
part
of
norway
have
take
over
the

the
coke
bottler
in
sweden
coca
cola
have
never
approve
the
sale
a
clear
contractual
breach
furthermore
orkla
want
only
the
coke
franchise
in
sweden
not
fanta
and
sprite
which
they
would
replace
with
their
own
brand
we
refuse
prompt
orkla
to
launch
a
campaign
against
us
with
help
from
the
trade
union
charge
that
we
be
try
to
revoke
their
swedish
franchise
i
immediately
left

russia
where
i
have
be
visit
with
coke
s
new

and
flew
to
oslo
to
set
up
effectively
a

back
by
the

driver
take
the
drastic
step
of

we
try
to
fill
the
gap
with
other
bottler
within
norway
but
be
make
little
headway
it
be
an
attack
on
the
integrity
of
the
coca
cola
franchise
system
and
we
could
not
back
down
we
be
willing
to
pull
out
of
sweden
and
norway
if
necessary
in
this
i
have
the
full
backing
of
doug
ivester
it
just
so
happen
that
through
my
work
with
the
retail
research
council
i
knew
stein
erik
hagan
who
built
one
of
the
large
retail
chain
in
norway
and
be
a
purchaser
not
only
of
large
volume
of
coca
cola
but
also
beer
leave
it
to
me
stein
erik
told
me
i
know
exactly
how
to
solve
this
he
place
a
large
coke
order
and
when
orkla
reply
that
it
would
not
deliver
he
told
them
not
to
bother
deliver
the
beer
either
which
be
a
potentially
devastate
financial
blow
it
be
as
simple
as
that
in
the
short
term
the
problem
be
solve
and
our
product
be
return
to
the
shelf
it
demonstrate
not
only
the
power
of
the
retailer
but
also
the
power
of
good
customer
relation
stein
erik
save
the
day
in
the
long
term
we
built
our
own
bottle
plant
in
stockholm
and
oslo
revoke
the
orkla
franchise
and
settle
the
lawsuit
that
ensue
we
have
successfully
defend
the
integrity
of
the
franchise
system
which
later
help
me
as
ceo
when
i
finally
complete
consolidation
of
the
german
bottler
they
knew
that
my
soft
collaborative
side
could
be
back
by
a
hard
edge
meanwhile
business
in
the
eastern
european
country
include
hungary
czechoslovakia
and
even
the
small
former
soviet
republic
such
as
belarus
expand
rapidly
as
we
furiously
built
new
plant
and
invest
in
exist
factory
russia
remain
a
much
tougher
market
to
crack
it
start
in
with
a
mcdonald
s
in
moscow
and
the
big
red
coca
cola
neon
sign
but
not
much
else
in
russia
the
gray
area
between
communism
and
capitalism
linger
longer
than
it
do
in
other
country
the
economy
have
be
so
primitive
under
communism
that
some
vend
machine
still
dispense
coke
into
glass
cup
secure
by
a
chain
even
paper
cup
be
scarce
under
the
communist
system
the
coin
mechanism
on
the
vend
machine
often
would
be
broken
so
attendant
would
stand
there
to
take
the
customer
s
money
each
customer
would
drink
coke
from
the
glass
cup
with
the
chain
still
attach
the
next
customer
would
drink
from
the
same
unwashed
cup
clearly
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
we
struggle
to
secure
a
countertrade
deal
with
reynolds
aluminum
for
the
production
of
can
coil
with
coke
guarantee
to
purchase
million
a
year
of
coil
from
the
factory
but
the
soviet
could
never
quite
grasp
why
they
should
have
to
pay
reynolds
a
licensing
fee
for
the
use
of
its
technology
the
soviet
spoke
with
great
pride
about
how
they
have
design
and
manufacture
the
steel
for
their
nation
s
space
program
and
they
could
not
fathom
why
they
great
steel
maker
that
they
be
should
have
to
pay
a
company
for
its
proprietary
technology
the
concept
be
completely
foreign
to
them
they
really
have
a
hard
time
grasp
the
concept
of
capitalism
sell
a
product
for
a
profit
be
foreign
to
them
and
there
be
few
law
government
regulation
or
agency
at
that
time
that
could
even
accommodate
private
investment
in
early
coke
decide
to
build
a
million
company
own
bottle
plant
near
moscow
but
it
be
illegal
then
for
a
foreign
company
to
purchase
land
western
investor
normally
work
in
joint
venture
with
a
soviet
partner
which
would
provide
land
as
equity
in
the
deal
we
try
to
lease
land
on
our
own
without
a
joint
venture
partner
the
first
time
any
western
company
have
attempt
to
do
so
in
fact
a
law
regulate
the
lease
of
land
be
still
be
write
and
have
not
developed
into
anything
concrete
government
official
also
have
no
idea
who
own
the
land
be
it
the
soviet
state
the
russian
republic
the
moscow
city
council
or
the
state
own
farm
that
be
then
on
the

even
if
you
could
determine
the
rightful
owner
what
be
the
market
price
of
the
property
when
there
be
no
market
and
if
you
determine
a
value
there
be
no
way
to
pay
in
convertible
currency
without
percent
of
the

price
go
directly
to

we
push
on
despite
all
these
obstacle
negotiate
with
the
city
of
moscow
the
premise
be
we
want
to
help
you
separate
state
from
business
then
the
entire
structure
of
moscow
city
government
change
right
before
our
eye
follow
a
fail
military
coup
in
august
that
marked
the
end
of
the
old

the

have
be
completely
change
and
we
be
no
longer
sure
who
be
responsible
for
our
building
site
we
be
force
to
forge
relationship
with
the
new

the

privatization
committee
the
russian
federation
land
commission
president
boris
yelstin
s
staff
sanitation
inspector
and
community
action
group
we
use
eleven
lawyer
and
go
through
fifteen
revision
of
the
agreement
before
finally
endure
a
fourteen
hour
meeting
of
the
moscow
city
council
the
city
price
the
land
which
be
fifteen
mile
outside
moscow
at
million
plus
a
lease
payment
each
year
which
make
it
as
expensive
as
prime
office
space
in
manhattan
it
be
an
outrageous
price
and
we
walk
out
of
the
city
council
building
without
a

then
craig
cohon
whose
father
have
engineer
the

on
a
ten

the

agree
that
coca
cola
would
add
value
to
the
city
and
endorse
cut
the
initial
payment
to
from
the
outrageous
million
and
extend
the
lower
lease
payment
over
a
year
period
from
october
we
revise
the
lease
agreement
another
ten
time
decide
that
the
initial
payment
would
be
allocate
for
scholarship
at
the
international
university
of
moscow
and
for
medical
supply
at
a
child
s
clinic
more
negotiation
ensue
and
we
revise
the
lease
agreement
six
more
time
finally
get
all
the
require
signature
at
p
m
on
december
the
last
minute
of
the
last
day
before

close
down
for
the

we
be
not
finish
yet
the
land
lease
could
not
go
into
effect
until
the
land
registry
be
sign
unfortunately
there
be
no
land
registry
for
moscow
or
russia
we
spent
the
month
of
january
help
the
privatization
committee
create
a
registry
in
march
the
central
bank
of
russia
sign
the
land
registry
and
the

officially
belong
to
coca
cola
we
order
the
medical
equipment
and
transfer
money
for
the

construction
begin
however
the
saga
be
still
not
over
the
city
refuse
to
honor
the
term
of
the
deal
that
require
the
city
to
pay
for
the
connection
of
utility
coca
cola
have
to
spend
an
additional
or
face
even
more
delay
the
time
effort
and
resource
require
to
do
even
basic
business
transaction
in
the
former
soviet
union
be
enormous
yet
the
potential
be
also
enormous
pepsi
be
initially
outsell
us
to
and
be
deeply
entrench
with
the
communist
government
as
the
central
government
weaken
and
formerly
state
own
plant
be
privatize
pepsi
s
advantage
diminish
we
swoop
in
to
invest
million
in
ten
factory
where
beer
and
cognac
in
addition
to
soft
drink
be
bottle
it
be
a
roll
of
the
dice
because
our
legal
team
be
write
some
of
the
first
private
contract
in
russia
and
even
though
the
contract
be
well
fashion
there
be
no
certainty
of
a
court
system
that
would
enforce
them
in
the
event
of
a
dispute
these
be
crazy
deal
as
far
as
pepsi
be
concerned
yet
they
have
fail
to
realize
how
quickly
the
power
of
the
central
government
be
fail
no
longer
do
the
central
government
have
the
money
even
to
provide
spare
part
for
the
bottle
plant
in
the
end
we
recouped
our
investment
on
all
but
one
of
the
plant
our
only
loss
occur
after
the
plant
owner
die
of
throat
cancer
and
his
son
be
debunked
by
the
local
mafia
not
surprisingly
the
mafia
refuse
to
honor
the
contract
i
appoint
michael
o
neill
whom
i
have
first
met
in
germany
when
our

station
in
the
soviet
union
in
the
late
s
and
spoke
russian
fluently
when
i
lit
the
coca
cola
sign
at
pushkin
square
michael
be
shiver
on
the
roof
of
the
building
make
sure
the
electricity

and
that
the
sign
do
not
fall
on
the
crowd
below
michael
live
in
a
brick
dacha
built
by
german
prisoner
of

once
stayed
there
during
one
of
my
visit
to
the
dacha

really
start
to
get
a
sense
of
russia
you
be
in
this
thick
forest
of
birch
tree
it
be
winter
and
it
have
snow
but
the
sky
have
clear
and
you
could
see
the
star
there
be
the
moon
a
blanket
of
snow
the
tree
and
the
stillness
of
the
night
it
be
like
a
scene
from
dr
zhivago
whose
author
lie
bury
less
than
two
mile
away
russia
be
a
tough
land
a
hard
land
but
beautiful
at
the
same
time
you
begin
to
understand
the
russian
soul
the
depth
of
feel
for
the
earth
pamela
and
cara
would
sometimes
accompany
me
to
russia
and
one
of
their
favorite
spot
be
an
open
air
market
where
you
could
buy
delicate
rug
from
the
caucasus
at
very
low
price
cara
once
bought
two
for
and
promptly
wrap
one
of
them
around
her

bitter
russian
cold
during

be
a

believer
that

the

we
should

project
would
be
well
spent

obviously
briefed

the
opportunity
to
participate
be
one
that
be
indeed
very
excite
it
will
be
the
culmination
of
decade
of
political
struggle
and
personally
a
goal
for
which
i
have
striven
throughout
these
year
mandela
not
only
vote
in
that

he
be
elect
president

a
truly
historic
milestone
mandela
be
succeed
by

carl
then
be
in

i

nearly
a

eject
for
sell
our

in
israel
in
india
we
depart
for
an
entirely
different
reason
the
secret
formula
in
a
newly
elect
indian
government
demand
that
we
partner
with
an
indian
company
and
disclose
the
secret
formula
which
we
refuse
to
do
then
we
packed
our
bag
and
left
the

second
most
populous
country
for
those
who
believe
the
secret

be
nothing
more
than
a
marketing
myth
let
india
be
a
lesson
in
defense
of
our
secret
formula
we
walk
away
from
a

i
like
and
respect
carl

be
very
unhappy
about
this

that

situational
and
that

arrest
i
later
ran
into
pillai
at
the
oberoi
hotel
in
delhi
where
although
a
want
man
he
approach
me
as
an
old
friend
and
we
exchange
warm
greeting
he
be
as
the
irish
say
go
a
likeable
rogue
sadly
he
die
in
an
indian
jail
in
of
complication
from
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
our
attention
then
shift
to
parle
beverage
which
control
percent
of
the
indian
soft
drink
market
and
have
developed
the
wildly
successful
spicy
cola
thums
up
after
coke
s
exit
from
india
in
jay
raja
my
former
group
marketing
manager
who
be
lead
the
reentry
effort
on
the
ground
in
india
be
at
first
reluctant
to
talk
to
parle
believe
it
have
be
behind
coke
s
ejection
from
india
in
the
first
place
parle
have
also
oppose
the
indian
government
s
decision
to
allow
coke
to
return
jay
suspect
that
parle
be
also
discuss
a
joint
venture
with
pepsi
at
the
same
time
key
parle
bottler
be
approach
jay
about
defect
to
coca
cola
parle
be
own
by
two
brother
ramesh
and
prakash
chauhan
who
be
quickly
realize
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
effectively
compete
with
giant
coke
and
pepsi
when
elephant
fight
the
grass
get
trample
ramesh
told
jay
parle
be
not
an
ideal
partner
for
coke
its
bottle
plant
be
in
dire
need
of
upgrade
yet
parle
s
nationwide
system
would
provide
coke
with
a
speedy
entry
back
into
a
potentially
huge
market
and
coke
would
instantly
gain
percent
of
the
indian
soft
drink
market
a
lead
that
would
surely
grow
once
we
reintroduce
coke
product
we
make
an
offer
to
purchase
parle
for
million
which
seem
a
grand
bargain
give
the
size
of
the
country
and
parle
s
huge
market
lead
yet
india
s
soft
drink
market
be
tiny
then
the
total
amount
of
soft
drink
sell
in
india
be
about
the
amount
sell
in
the
city
of
atlanta
back
then
recall
john
heaton
my
executive
assistant
who
be
in
charge
of
execute
the
deal
many
people
in
india
just
didn
t
have
any
money
to
buy
soft
drink
they
drank
tea
coffee
milk
and
roadside
fruit
juice
annual
soft
drink
consumption
in
india
at
the
time
average
three
bottle
a
person
heaton
say
you
will
recall
that
when
i
left
the
philippine
in
the
per
caput
consumption
be
bottle
per
year
that
illustrates
how
poor
india
really
be
and
also
how
poorly
soft
drink
have
be
market
but
also
its
enormous
upside
potential
we
also
offer
the
chauhan
brother
the
bottle
franchise
in
mumbai
and
part
of
delhi
a
lucrative
proposition
we
haggle
over
the
price
eventually
settle
on
million
prakash
be
willing
to
sell
but
his
old
brother
ramesh
have
cold
foot
reluctant
to
relinquish
the
title
of
india
s
soft
drink
king
his
picture
frequently
grace
the
cover
of
magazine
ramesh
finally
relent
but
not
happily
he
and
his
wife
sobbed
at
the
contract
signing
in
atlanta
the
chauhans
graciously
host
a
party
at
their
home
in
mumbai
and
unfortunately
i
fell
ill
on
the
return
flight
immediately
take
an
antibiotic
that
i
have
with
me
for
just
this
type
of
emergency
upon
arrive
in
atlanta
i
instruct
my
driver
to
take
me
directly
to
piedmont

doctor
told
me
it
be
an
amoebic
infection
call
shigella
not
from
the
food
at
the
party
but
from
earlier
handshake
which
be
the
main
mean
of
transmission
and
i
be
out
of
commission
for
a

the

told
them
the

and
jay
handle
it
while
i
be
upstairs
work
in
my
office
the
usual
haggle
make
it
likely
that
the
astrologer
would
be
sorely
disappointed
as
midnight
approach
john
suggest
that
the
party
sign
one
of
the
shorter
document
and
complete
the
remainder
the
follow
day
we
have
capture
a
percent
market
share
a
major
coup
india
be
a
tough
market
however
where
medium
fuel
controversy
cropped
up
continuously
sometimes
over
the
small
of
matter
we
celebrate
our
first
franchise
bottler
in
india
in
late
october
in

a
huge
event

by

we
have
a
problem
one
of

told
me
a
reporter

spot
a
young
boy

the
reporter
want
to
write
a
story
that
coke
be
use
child
labor
upon
its
return
to
india
we
assure
the
reporter
that
there
be
no
child
labor
and
we
rush
to
track
down
the
boy
in
question
it
turn
out
he
be
not
a
worker
but
the
son
of
a
plant
employee
proudly
inspect
the
assembly
line
in
a
white
lab
coat
it
be
one
of
those
moment
when
i
thought
everything
be
go
to
fall
off
a
cliff
from
pride
in
reentering
india
to
absolute
disaster
over
child
labor
the
headache
be
well
worth
it
although
it
take
time
coke
s
sale
volume
in
india
jumped
percent
in
the
first
two
year
and
capture
almost
two
third
of

despite
that

who
resign
after
the
debacle
and
be
rehired

be
in
fact
lukewarm
about

many
executive

and
myself
include
believe
it
would
be
disastrous
to

even
don
keough
then
the
company
president
question
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
whether
we
should
keep
thums
up
wouldn
t
that
mean
have
two
cola
in
the
indian
market
i
reply
that
thums
up
be
not
a
cola
but
a
pepper
drink
similar
to
dr
pepper
don
ask
me
what
the
indian
customer
believe
thums
up
to
be
some
customer
believe
it
be
a
cola
i
have
to
admit
but
they
be
wrong
and
there
be
no
cola
in
the
brand
name
don
smile
and
agree
that
we
should
keep
thums
up
even
to
this
day
thums
up
be
the
top
cola
in
india
the
chauhan
brother
contribute
far
to
jay
s
headache
they
be
minority
owner
of
gujarat
bottle
company
a
coke
bottler
which
sell
its
asset
to
pepsi
so
jay
be
confront
with
a
coke
bottler
work
out
of
a
pepsi
own
bottle
plant
coke
sue
and
won
a
restrain
order
bar
gbc
from
bottle
pepsi
product
a
move
that
jay
believe
kept
pepsi
from
conduct
similar
raid
on
other
coke
bottler
in
india
yet
daft
scold
him
for
unnecessarily
damage
relation
with
the
chauhan
brother
daft
also
push
jay
to
build
a
large
scale
consolidated
bottle
system
in
india
i
will
show
you
what
a
world
class
system
look
like
by
replicate
china
in
india
jay
recall
daft
as
say
daft
s
think
be
correct
in
the
long
term
the
indian
market
be
so
price
competitive
give
the
country
s
extreme
poverty
that
it
would
only
turn
a
profit
if
the
bottle
system
be
extremely
efficient
and
low
cost
yet
jay
argue
correctly
that
india
s
infrastructure
be
not
yet
prepared
to
handle
a
large
company
own
bottle
system
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
work
with
the
franchise
bottler
to
improve
their
plant
also
jay
worried
that
abandon
the
indian
bottler
would
be
a
violation
of
the
company
s
pledge
to
the
indian
government
to
support
an
indigenous
independent
industry
meanwhile
zyman
block
jay
s
effort
to
sign
a
young
cricket
star
sachin
tendulkar
as
a
coke
spokesperson
argue
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
money
pepsi
sign
tendulkar
instead
and
he
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
best
cricket
player
of
all
time
in
early
coke
sign
him
although
he
be
now
near
the
end
of
his
career
jay
s
resignation
be
unfortunate
he
be
a
valuable
leader
and
prove
to
be
correct
on
many
crucial
point
while
lay
the
foundation
for
a
market
that
would
eventually
become
lucrative
for
coke
sale
in
india
grow
steadily
over
the
year
and
today
it
be
one
of
coke
s
fast
grow
market
hold
four
of
the
top
five
brand
thums
up
limca
sprite
and
fanta
still
it
be
not
until
that
coke
finally
make
a
profit
in
india
at
the
time
of
jay
s
departure
i
be
no
longer
in
charge
of
india
doug
ivester
have
by
then
be
name
company
president
succeed
don
keough
who
retire
as
robert
goizeuta
ushered
in
a
new
young
generation
of
executive
clearly
set
up
ivester
as
his
successor
ivester
s
promotion
effectively
end
john
hunter
s
ascension
yet
john
who
have
be
keough
s
choice
to
be
president
stayed
on
as
head
of
international
in
ivester
take
europe
out
of
hunter
s
portfolio
and
give
it
to
me
this
fracture
my
relationship
with
hunter
who
i
have
happily
work
both
for
and
with
he
have
engineer
the
philippine
deal
that
have
be
so
pivotal
to
my
career
john
believe
i
have
lobby
for
europe
which
be
not
the
case
the
new
president
ask
me
to
run
europe
and
i
accepted
it
be
as
simple
as
that
yet
it
do
mean
that
i
be
effectively
john
s
peer
reporting
directly
to
ivester
together
with
jack
stahl
the
u
s
president
we
be
the
three
operating
head
john
stayed
on
for
another
year
but
it
be
terribly
awkward
i
would
attend
the
monthly
meeting
john
have
with
his
direct
report
but
i
be
not
work
for
him
he
didn
t
like
that
at
all
i
hope
we
can
get
past
this
i
say
once
to
john
i
don
t
think
we
ever
can
be
his
reply
time
heals
of
course
and
john
and
i
be
now
good
friend
again
occasionally
have
dinner
and
socialize
together
he
would
have
be
a
strong
company
leader
but
that
be
not
to
be
with
europe
now
part
of
my
territory
i
have
by
the
mid
s
reach
a
very
high
profile
position
at
coca
cola
my
territory
generate
a
third
of
the
company
s
profit
it
be
in
this
job
that
i
soon
have
my
own
sergio
zyman

to
tell
during
a
meeting
in
madrid

go
on
a
bit
too
long
sergio
start
yawn
and
eventually
lay
on
the
floor
pretend
to
be
asleep
i
look
at
ivester
but
he
say
nothing
this
be
the
license
that
sergio
have
he
be
very
close
not
only
to
ivester
who
have
no
background
in
marketing
and
be
in
line
to
be
the
next
ceo
but
also
to
roberto
sergio
be
mexican
and
roberto
cuban
they
spoke
spanish
to
each
other
at
company
function
i
ask
to
see
ivester
after
the
meeting
and
we
go
for
a
walk
where
i
flatly
told
him
that
sergio
s
behavior
be
unacceptable
the
flea
come
with
the
dog
doug
reply
he
s
a
great
dog
we
re
just
go
to
accept
the
flea
sergio
also
clashed
with
weldon
johnson
who
ran
latin
america
sergio
push
to
have
him
remove
after
weldon
left
the
company
a
triumphant
sergio
walk
into
my
office
and
ask
me
if
i
have
a
nickel
i
fish
one
out
of
my
pocket
this
be
go
to
be
the
best
advice

nickel
sergio
told
me
resign
now
you
re
next
after
weldon
for
the
first
time
i
felt
uncomfortable
in
the
executive
suite
of
the
coca
cola
company
and
begin
think
of
how
i
could
get
out
the
ceo
s
position
be
clearly
not
in
the
card
for
me
at
lunch
one
day
in
the
north
avenue
din
room
roberto
told
me
he
plan
to
remain
as
chairman
and
ceo
for
a
long
time
eventually
ivester
would
take
over
as
ceo
and
roberto
would
stay
on
indefinitely
as
chairman
a
part
time
position
that
would
have
suit
roberto
since
he
usually
arrive
at
work
around
a
m
each
day
and
go
home
around
in
the
afternoon
he
be
a
strategist
and
a
delegator
as
part
of
this
strategy
roberto
plan
to
beef
up
the
duty
and
pay
of
the
group
president
of
which
i
be
one
give
them
a
large
role
in
run
the
company
however
i
would
still
be
part
of
a
corporate
bureaucracy
a
situation
in
which
i
never
really
flourish
while
not
politically
inept
i
be
politically
uncomfortable
and
it
sometimes
show
i
want
to
run
my
own
company
have
always
perform
the
best
in
situation
such
as
the
philippine
where
i
be
in
charge
at
the
same
time
i
begin
consider
my
retirement
which
i
plan
for
a
time
between
my
fifty
fifth
and
fifty
eighth
birthday
with
three
goal
in
mind
to
be
physically
active
stay
intellectually
engage
and
spend
time
with
pamela
i
discuss
my
future
with
roberto
and
doug
ivester
tell
them
that
in
the
last
few
year
of
my
work
career
i
want
to
run
a
publicly
trade
company
give
that
i
could
retire
at
fifty
five
and
cash
in
all
my
restrict
stock
and
stock
option
this
would
be
financially
attractive
roberto
and
doug
decide
to
create
a
company
for
me
coca
cola
beverage
which
would
be
form
by
consolidate
the
bottler
in
europe
and
would
be
trade
on
the
london
stock
exchange
it
be
just
in
time
soon
afterward
the
age
at
which
restrict
stock
option
could
be
exercise
be
raise
to
fifty
eight
as
we
work
out
the
detail
for
ccb
it
become
increasingly
obvious
that
roberto
be
ill
a
chain
smoker
roberto
never
go
to
the
doctor
for
checkup
over
time
we
d
begin
to
notice
that
he
d
become
forgetful
complain
at
monthly
management
meeting
that
we
the
senior
manager
have
fail
to
inform
him
of
key
action
and
event
when
clearly
we
have
doug
ivester
convene
an
important
meeting
of
top
executive
tell
us
roberto
be
ill
you
ve
all
see
it
we
re
go
to
have
to
help
him
but
in
effect
we
re
go
to
have
to
run
the
company
about
nine
month
later
on
october
roberto
die
of
complication
from
lung
cancer
he
be
only
sixty
five

before
he

take
care
of
my

he
told
me
roberto
have
an
incredible
seventeen
year
tenure
as
chairman
and
ceo
increase
the
company
s
market
value
from
billion
to
billion
in
alone
stockholder
saw
a
forty
six
percent
return
only
today
have
the
company
s
market
value
match
its
peak
under
roberto
s
leadership
as
expect
the
board
picked
ivester
as
the
new
chairman
and
ceo
that
fall
i
prepared
to
leave
for
london
hop
to
officially
wrap
up
my
duty
in
atlanta
by
the
end

take
until
february
for
ivester
to
name
my
replacement

we
rent

to
move
our
entire
household
again
as
we
have
so
many
time
before
since
we
believe
this
would
be
the
final
chapter
of
my
career
we
also
knew
this
be
go
to
be
a
short
assignment
probably
no
more
than
three
or
four
year
so
pamela
would
stay
put
in
atlanta
and
would
visit
me

in
june
we
gather
with
the
investment
banker
to
set
an
opening
price
in
fact
i
have
make
a
mistake
in
agree
to
a
wide
price
band
not
believe
that
the
top
of
the
band
would
attract
so
many
investor
amatil
exec
on
the
phone
in
sydney
be
so
enthuse
about
the
oversubscription
that
they
want
to
offer
the
stock
at
a
price
even
high
than
the
band
we
have
establish
make
the
share
more
expensive
and
at
the
same
time
add
pressure
on
me
the
found
ceo
to
deliver
earnings
result
to
justify
the
inflate
price
i
be
take
aside
by
the
lead
investment
banker
an
aristocratic
englishman
who
told
me
i
really
do
not
understand
how
it
all
work
this
be
your
first
ipo
be
it
not
he
ask
well
the
seller
and
the
banker
set
the
price
you
have
no
say
in
this
my
reply
be
blunt
who
be
you
go
to
get
to
run
the
company
i
ask
if
you
go
outside
the
band
i
m
not
go
to
run
it
my
job
be
to
maximize
return
for
amatil
but
not
beyond
the
price
range
upon
which
we
have
previously
agree
they
try
to
push
me
and
i
push
back
i
won
the
battle
on
july
the
stock
debut
on
the
high
end
of
the
band
with
a
market
value
of
billion
six
week
after
the
successful
and
lofty
stock
float
russia
suffer
a
severe
financial
crisis
trigger
by
the
earlier
asian
crisis
that
have
suppress
demand
for
commodity
such
as
oil
a
crucial
export
for
the
russian
economy
fortunately
ccb
have
no
business
in
russia
but
the
crisis
there
dampen
stock
price
worldwide
ccb
stock
drop
and
our
new
investor
be
very
unhappy
friend
of
mine
who
have
purchase
stock
lose
money
even
when
i
left
ccb
in
the
stock
price
have
not
recover
to
its
initial
offering
price
in
addition
to
the
russian
economic
meltdown
coke
sale
be
hurt
by
a
contamination
scare
in
belgium
in
belgium
be
not
a
ccb
bottler
and
the
scare
turn
out
to
be
just
that
with
no
contamination
ever
proven
yet
ivester
do
not
manage
the
controversy
well
his
career
be
damage
and
temporarily
sale
and
profit
in
europe
decrease
all
along
ccb
be
see
as
a
way
to
consolidate
europe
into
a
single
bottler
the
most
obvious
target
for
a
merger
be
coca
cola
hellenic
base
out
of
athens
and
own
by
the
leventis
family
the
family
bought
the
greek
bottle
franchise
from
coca
cola
in
the
s
and
turn
it
around
they
still
own
nigeria
and
also
have
plant
in
ireland
russia
romania
bulgaria
and
other
part
of
eastern
europe
andrew
david
ran
many
of
the
family
business
include
the
bottle
operation
it
be
he
whom
i
have
confront
in
nigeria
over
subpar
bottle
plant
condition
and
with
whom
i
have
subsequently
become
close
friend
andrew
have
an
affinity
for
ireland
have
attend
trinity
college
and
be
an
avid
rugby
fan
so
we
forge
a
strong
relationship
over
the
year
we
agree
that
hbc
and
hellenic
would
merge
and
i
would
run
the
joint
company
we
would
have
to
move
the
stock
listing
to
greece
otherwise
it
would
be
see
as
a
sale
rather
than
a
merger
and
the
leventis
family
would
be
subject
to
heavy
tax
the
merger
be
complete
in
august
create
a
new
company
call
coca
cola
hellenic
bottle
co
one
of
the
large
coke
bottler
in
the
world
the
leventis
family
receive
about
percent
of
the
stock
in
the
new
company
coca
cola
still
own
percent
of
cchbc
sadly
andrew
david
die
shortly
after
the
merger
his
brother
george
who
take
over
as
chairman
felt
that
i
have
out
negotiate
andrew
i
don
t
believe
i
have
but
george
and
i
be
never
close
the
other
piece
of
the
european
consolidation
puzzle
be
coca
cola
enterprise
the
atlanta
base
bottler
which
own
the
franchise
in
great
britain
early
in
the
life
of
cchbc
i
met
with
summerfield
johnson
then
ceo
of
coca
cola
enterprise
at
andrew
david
s
flat
in
london
and
we
held
a
long
discussion
summerfield
seem
interested
in
some
sort
of
merger
but
later
phone
me
to
say
the
timing
be
not
right
the
deal
be
never
consummate
hungary
be
one
particularly
tough
challenge
where
a
price
war
rag
between
coke
and
pepsi
each
time
pepsi
drop
price
the
hungarian
bottler
felt
compel
to
match
it
a
game
of
chicken
my
experience
in
the
philippine
kick
in
and
i
assure
the
hungarian
management
that
pepsi
be
hurt
as
badly
as
coke
be
and
that
pepsi
be
lower
price
only
with
the
help
of
an
unsustainable
subsidy
from
the
parent
company
we
re
go
to
lead
a
price
increase
i
told
the
hungarian
we
raise
price
and
coke
sale
be
down
for
about
three
week
before
pepsi
follow
suit
and
match
the
increase
it
be
a
nervous
three
week
for
me
meanwhile
we
realize
we
have
to
convince
coca
cola
to
low
concentrate
price
not
an
easy
task
near
the
end
of
his
life
roberto
goizueta
have
announce
to
wall
street
that
coca
cola
have
a
new
stream
of
revenue
the
buying
and
sell
of
bottler
we
be
buying
bottler
upgrade
them
and
sell
them
to
investor
for
top
dollar
for
example
the
east
european
bottler
we
have
invest
in
be
sell
to
coca
cola
amatil
arguably
for
too
much
money
but
with
a
gain
for
the
coca
cola
company
wall
street
love
it
and
in
july
coke
stock
hit
an
all
time
high
of
per
share
however
there
be
a
problem
when
a
company
such
as
coca
cola
amatil
bought
a
bottler
at
top
dollar
it
would
have
to
achieve
a
much
high
profit
margin
to
recoup
its
investment
that
would
require
raise
price
on
its
product
raise
price
temporarily
help
coca
cola
as
well
because
it
could
then
charge
more
for
concentrate
eventually
though
that
game
come
to
an
end
as
bottler
can
no
longer
raise
price
without
lose
market
share
and
the
game
do
come
to
an
end
in
hungary
and
other
eastern
european
country
in
late
in
i
flew
to
atlanta
with
andrew
david
chairman
of
cchbc
to
meet
with
douglas
daft
who
be
the
new
ceo

rarely
on
my
mind
in
august
i
get
a
call
from
a
friend
and
former
coke
bottler
now
work
as
a
consultant
he
have
be
among
those
sit
in
the
pew
with
us
that
unforgettable
sunday
morning
in
poland
s
st
brigid
s
church
when
we
have
celebrate
the
opening
of
the
first
coke
plant
in
eastern
europe
neville
a
number
of
us
have
get
together
and
we
re
go
to
start
lobbying
for
daft
to
go
and
for
you
to
come
back
and
run
the
coca
cola
company
the
consultant
say
earnings
be
down
and
coca
cola
stock
have
drop
to
less
than
half
its
peak
more
important
morale
be
really
bad
daft
in
a
way
seem
to
have
lose
interest
in
the
job
he
would
say
to
people
i
m
just
go
to
do
whatever
i
can
to
get
fire
it
would
sound
as
if
he
be
joking
but
there
be
some
truth
in
it
doug
be
obviously
exhaust
i
give
the
consultant
a
shermanesque
response
i
m
not
go
to
do
it
i
told
him
i
m
happily
retire
my
wife
love
have
me
around
you
re
go
down
a
blind
alley
i
add
that
he
have
no
mandate
from
me
to
put
my
name
forward
the
behind
the
scene
movement
to
draft
me
do
not
abate
and
i
receive
other
call
from
people
in
the
system
i
give
them
the
same
answer
i
be
definitely
not
interested
the
follow
spring
come
the
call
from
don
keough
this
time
it
be
serious
seven
at
the
helm
of
coca
cola
after
roberto
goizueta
s
death
coca
cola
begin
to
falter
for
so
many
year
the
company
have
be
bless
with
two
great
leader
goizueta
and
don
keough
however
roberto
have
die
and
don
have
retire
doug
ivester
the
company
s
first
leader
in
the
post
goizueta
keough
era
do
not
last
long
he
resign
as
chairman
and
ceo
after
slightly
more
than
two
year
daft
survive
for
more
than
four
year
although
frankly
he
probably
should
have
left
earlier
i
believe
he
stayed
as
long
as
he
do
in
part
because
the
board
do
not
want
to
face
the
grim
reality
that
two
successive
choice
for
the
top
job
have
fail
to
get
the
company
back
on
track
in
all
fairness
roberto
s
performance
be
not
sustainable
particularly
give
the
change
in
the
global
economy
he
push
us
all
to
the
absolute
limit
he
would
go
to
wall
street
and
say
we
be
go
to
be
able
to
deliver
percent
growth
in
earnings
per
share
those
of
us
on
the
front
line
thought
that
or
percent
be
more
realistic
number
and
would
attempt
to
tell
roberto
as
such
fine
roberto
would
reply
wall
street
be
expect
percent
a
company
and
its
executive
can
only
do
that
for
so
long
particularly
when
world
event
go
against
you
as
they
do
in
the
second
half
of
gary
fayard
coke
s
current
chief
financial
officer
who
be
then

gary
recall
we
have
a
huge
analyst
meeting
in
atlanta
in
may
the
analyst
be
ask
when
we
be
go
to
take
our
earnings
and
growth
target
up
i
m
sit
in
the

we
be

and
right
the
bottler
be
building
plant
borrowing
money
just
grow
everywhere
it

long
however
for
the
economic
turmoil

line
in
the
second
half
of

gary
remember
overnight

so
many
people
the
bottler

much
debt
from
building
plant
and
make
acquisition
the
bottler
be
in
a
very
bad
position
the
company
be
bloat
with
overhead
ivester
have
launch
a
project
in
later
execute
by
daft
name
the
strategic
organizational
alignment
a
code
name
for
mass
layoff
which
be
unheard
of
at
coke
where
a
job
have
almost
always
meant
a
job
for
life
coke
fire
more
than
five
thousand
people
deeply
shake
the
company
the
layoff
kill
us
gary
recall
we
lose
momentum
we
lose
morale
that
be
where
we
really
start
lose
our
way
the
company
indeed
need
to
shed
cost
yet
the
firing
be
not
implement
effectively
it
be
not
a
strategic
organizational
alignment
it
be
a
head
cut
exercise
many
of
the
head
that
be
cut
be
head
that
have
special
skill
and
deep
business
knowledge
in
some
instance
the
fire
employee
set
up
consultancy
and
provide
their
skill
back
to
coke
at
a
high
cost
i
have
met
with
daft
in
january
at
his
request
to
outline
the
process
i
have
use
to
establish
cchbc
the
merger
of
coca
cola
beverage
with
hellenic
while
it
be
not
a
perfect
process
it
be
base
on
first
define
what
work
need
to
be
undertaken
thereby
identify
where
there
be
duplication
and
redundancy
once
a
new
organization
structure
be
identify
we
only
then
fill
the
box
where
we
have
two
or
more
people
qualify
for
the
same
position
we
use
our
evaluation
process
to
select
the
right
person
this
meant
a
well
leaner
structure
and
the
placement
and
retention
of
the
best
people
doug
react
favorably
but
never
follow
up
i
wish
he
have
for
event
as
they
unfolded
may
have
be
different
when
i
take
over
as
chairman
and
ceo
there
be
still
an
atmosphere
of
fear
and
disaffection
at
coca
cola
clearly
i
have
my
work
cut
out
for
me
yet
there
be
one
immediate
fire
that
i
have
to
extinguish
quickly
on
my
first
official
day
in
office
june
it
be
so
important
that
i
be
actually
not
in
the
office
that
day
or
even
in
atlanta
i
be
in
chicago
at
the
headquarters
of
coke
s
large
fountain
client
mcdonald
s
steve
heyer
coke
s
president
who
have
be
the
only
internal
candidate
for
chairman
and
ceo
have
deeply
offend
mcdonald
s
by
gloat
over
a
new
contract
with
subway
insinuate
that
subway
get
well
term
it
wasn
t
true
but
it
come
across
that
way
and
we
have
reliable
information
that
mcdonald
s
be
hold
discussion
with
pepsi
about
sell
some
of
their
non
cola
brand
if
a
single
mcdonald
s
have
dispense
a
pepsi
product
that
likely
would
have
damage
my
newly
resurrect
career
it
would
have
be
an
unprecedented
failure
i
met
with
charlie
bell
the
ceo
of
mcdonald
s
and
look
him
straight
in
the
eye
told
him
flatly
i
will
fix
the
problem
bell
understood
what
i
meant
heyer
would
soon
be
leave
the
company
meanwhile
we
conduct
a
complete
audit
to
make
sure
we
weren
t
overcharge
mcdonald
s
and
end
up
refund
some
money
in
a
few
area
although
there
be
no
major
overcharge
i
later
bolster
the
mcdonald
s
relationship
far
by
change
management
name
jerry
wilson
to
head
the
account
he
do
a
superb
job
and
be
follow
by
roberto
s
son
javier
goizueta
javier
have
suffer
somewhat
from
the
fact
that
within
the
company
people
have
tend
to
view
him
as
the
former
chairman
s
son
overlook
his
real
talent
as
a
manager
he
end
up
perform
admirably
and
have
ensure
that
the
vital
relationship
with
mcdonald
s
remains
strong
you
have
to
earn
your
relationship
with
your
customer
each
and
every
day
and
my
visit
that
day
to
mcdonald
s
be
intend
to
send
that
message
if
you
take
a
customer
for
grant
you
do
so
at
your
own
peril
from
chicago
i
then
flew
to
the
west
coast
to
meet
with
peter
ueberroth
a
coke
board
member
and
head
of
the
audit
committee
to
seek
his
advice
and
counsel
peter
who
successfully
ran
the
los
angeles
olympics
head
the
well
name
contrarian
group
which
have
help
many
successful
company
although
i
didn
t
know
ueberroth
well
i
have
watch
him
over
the
year
when
i
present
to
the
coke
board
and
he
be
always
one
of
those
who
ask
tough
insightful
question
i
have
many
difficult
issue
to
face
and
throughout
my
tenure
he
be
someone
i
trust
totally
and
be
always
able
to
turn
to
for
sound
analysis
and
advice
as
of
course
be
my
mentor
don
keough
it
be
normal
that
the
first
one
hundred
day
mark
the
clear
enunciation
of
strategy
and
while
i
make
a
number
of
move
internally
through
major
appointment
i
declare
that
i
would
not
speak
to
the
medium
or
the
analyst
during
that
period
i
do
not
want
to
make
declaration
base
on
preconceive
idea
i
d
developed
in
barbados
as
i
watch
event
unfold
but
want
to
learn
more
by
travel
around
the
world
visit
our
operation
and
meeting
with
employee
customer
and
other
key
individual
with
whom
the
company
have
relationship
i
have
decide
that
i
be
not
go
to
immediately
have
a
president
frankly
i
simply
do
not
believe
that
there
be
anyone
in
the
company
at
the
time
who
be
qualify
for
the
job
which
illustrates
how
badly
flaw
coca
cola
s
succession
management
have
be
it
do
no
good
to
have
a
second
in
command
unless
that
person
have
the
potential
to
run
the
company
daft
have
one
vice
chairman
and
two
president
during
his
tenure
yet
coca
cola
still
languish
and
the
board
in
hire
me
out
of
retirement
be
force
to
reach
outside
the
company
for
a
new
chairman
and
ceo
some
people
advise
me
to
get
rid
of
heyer
right
away
and
clearly
i
agree
he
do
not
have
the
right
skill
to
be
president
i
want
to
ease
him
out
quietly
i
thought
that
approach
be
well
for
the
organization
and
i
also
want
to
travel
around
the
world
for
the
first
few
month
to
get
a
feel
for
the
pulse
of
the
business
i
need
someone
at
headquarters
to
maintain
the
status
quo
until
i
could
fully
understand
what
need
to
be
do
heyer
knew
his
day
at
coke
be
numbered
and
during
my
first
week
on
the
job
he
walk
into
my
office
and
hand
me
a
document
which
he
say
have
be
approve
by
daft
the
document
state
that
heyer
would
receive
million
in
severance
pay
for
leave
the
company
it
be
a
shock
to
me
and
it
be
a
shock
to
the
coke
board
of
director
clearly
daft
have
the
authority
to
approve
the
contract
but
you
would
think
that
give
the
order
of
magnitude
the
board
would
have
be
told
about
it
yet
they
hadn
t
which
be
a
shock
to
all
i
consult
with
board
member
peter
ueberroth
and
cathie
black
head
of
the
comp
committee
and
later
chancellor
of
the
new
york
city
school
system
to
work
our
way
through
it
heyer
believe
he
have
an
ironclad
commitment
and
we
decide
to
meet
it
as
hard
as
that
be
to
accept
the
last
thing
we
need
be
another
lawsuit
on
our
hand
i
first
met
heyer
during
my
first
retirement
when
as
an
international
advisor
to
the
company
i
be
ask
to
help
heyer
with
the
customer
in
europe
with
whom
he
do
not
have
any
relationship
we
have
a
very
good
discussion
in
his
office
about
what
need
to
be
do
and
the
key
need
to
build
trust
at
the
high
level
of
the
customer
organization
i
set
up
european
visit
on
agree
date
only
for
heyer
to
cancel
them
i
visit
him
again
and
we
set
new
date
they
be
also
cancel
despite
continue
effort
on
my
part
the
visit
never
take
place
i
later
become
aware
that
suffer
cancellation
of
appointment
be
not
something
that
only
i
experienced
a
former
executive
at
turner
broadcasting
inc
heyer
s
former
employer
told
me
that
he
admire
steve
as
someone
to
have
work
for
him
but
that
he
would
never
have
work
for
steve
heyer
left
august
for
a
job
as
ceo
of
starwood
hotel
and
resort
a
true
measure
of
the
man
be
that
one
of
the
first
thing
he
do
be
to
give
pepsi
a
five
year
contract
with
starwood
even
though
an
internal
starwood
review
team
recommend
renewal
of
coke
s
contract
happily
the
business
be
now
back
with
coca
cola
demonstrate
that
this
be
pettiness
on
behalf
of
steve
in
many
way
it
define
the
man
his
tenure
at
starwood
be
short
live
i
immediately
begin
the
search
for
a
new
chief
corporate
counsel
deval
patrick
have
previously
submit
his
resignation
to
daft
the
boston
globe
report
that
patrick
have
resign
after
daft
renege
on
a
promise
to
approve
an
independent
investigation
into
allegation
that
coca
cola
hire
right
wing
death
squad
to
terrorize
union
organizer
in
colombia
deval
have
a
change
of
heart
when
i
be
name
ceo
tell
me
he
would
consider
stay
but
i
told
him
there
be
too
much
water
under
the
bridge
he
and
another
top
executive
be
absolutely
at
war
with
each
other
deval
clearly
have
other
ambition
and
have
remain
a
resident
of
boston
commute
every
week
to
atlanta
we
be
able
to
work
out
his
departure
amicably
he
remain
until
the
end
of
the
year
which
meant
i
have
time
to
find
a
successor
i
believe
that
once
a
person
have
make
a
decision
to
leave
it
s
rare
that
a
change
of
mind
prof
to
be
successful
part
of
a
psychological
contract
have
be
broken
and
when
it
be
in
the
public
domain
relationship
be
already
redefine
only
two
year
after
leave
coke
deval
be
elect
governor
of
massachusetts
we
begin
the
search
for
a
new
corporate
counsel
seriously
interview
eric
holder
the
current
u
s
attorney
general
until
he
withdrew
from
consideration
we
eventually
chose
geoffrey
kelly
an
australian
and
very
able
company
insider
meanwhile
daft
have
promise
sandy
allan
who
be
in
charge
of
europe
that
he
would
also
head
north
america
work
out
of
his
office
in
london
and
commute
to
the
u
s
that
do
not
make
sense
to
me
nor
to
the
coke
board
and
i
nixed
it
though
sandy
be
disgruntle
after
learn
that
he
would
not
be
in
charge
of
nearly
half
the
world
sandy
and
i
go
all
the
way
back
to
south
africa
he
be
the
executive
who
refuse
to
meet
with
me
when
he
ran
the
independent
national
beverage
after
coke
divest
from
south
africa
as
group
president
i
have
move
him
to
the
middle
east
describe
him
to
his
face
as
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
but
generally
a
good
bull
he
didn
t
like
the
description
but
that
be
what
he
s
like
yet
even
though
he
broke
a
lot
of
china
i
view
him
as
a
good
executive
for
tough
situation
with
his
depth
of
company
knowledge
and
strong
work
ethic
i
chose
cynthia
mccague
as
coke
s
new
human
resource
director
cynthia
who
have
be
my
hr
director
at
cchbc
be
well
know
and
well
respect
within
the
company
and
provide
as
smooth
a
transition
in
her
new
job
as
any
executive
could
hope
for
give
the
momentous
task
i
hand
her
marketing
i
have
always
believe
be
the
soul
of
the
coca
cola
company
we
have
the
world
s
most
popular
brand
and
yet
with
all
the
distraction
of
the
previous
few
year
be
lose
our
marketing
edge
when
i
arrive
some
of
the
television
commercial
be
in
my
opinion
atrocious
one
particularly
poor
one
feature
a
basketball
player
with
a
coca
cola
stash
under
his
armpit
not
a
very
appeal
image
in
the
week
before
i
become
ceo
i
attend
the
launch
of
c
an
ill
conceive
midcalorie
cola
it
be
strategically
a
weak
proposition
and
the
execution
even
weaker
marketing
of
the
new
product
be
in
the
hand
of
people
who
have
no
feel
for
the
brand
within
three
week
of
become
ceo
i
name
chuck
fruit
who
originally
join
coke
from
anheuser
busch
as
chief
marketing
officer
to
replace
dan
palumbo
chuck
right
the
ship
but
sadly
ill
health
cause
him
to
retire
early
i
also
brought
in
irial
finan
my
successor
at
cchbc
to
head
a
newly
form
bottler
investment
group
to
oversee
the
company
s
wide
range
of
ownership
interest
in
bottler
worldwide
from
shanghai
to
brazil
some
of
these
bottler
report
to
group
president
others
to
the
coca
cola
executive
in
charge
of
that
country
under
the
new
structure
they
would
report
to
irial
and
irial
would
report
directly
to
me
a
body
of
opinion
within
the
company
be
that
we
should
divest
of
all
our
bottle
interest
implicit
in
that
belief
be
that
the
coca
cola
company
lack
the
skill
to
competently
run
nut
and
bolt
low
margin
bottle
company
i
of
course
have
be
run
bottler
on
and
off
for
my
entire
career
also
i
believe
divest
would
reinforce
the
bottler
s
view
that
the
company
do
not
understand
their
business
or
care
about
it
the
bottler
want
leadership
from
the
coca
cola
company
but
as
i
reassert
it
clash
arose
over
right
here
too
there
be
a
fundamental
difference
between
my
view
and
former
management
the
belief
have
be
that
by
run
the
company
with
strict
division
of
role
neither
interfere
with
the
other
the
relationship
would
be
enhance
in
the
short
term
this
be
true
as
a
bottler
i
have
strive
to
have
maximum
independence
however
the
truth
be
that
we
be
one
business
join
as
i
would
put
it
by
vein
and
artery
and
that
this
be
how
the
customer
and
consumer
saw
us
remain
in
our
seemingly
separate
silo
reduce
dispute
but
those
dispute
be
at
the
heart
of
the
benefit
of
the
franchise
structure
with
the
bottler
s
day
to
day
skill
mesh
with
the
more
long
term
strategic
view
which
be
the
role
of
the
franchisor
that
we
have
recently
take
a
short
term
view
do
not
mean
that
we
need
to
fundamentally
change
the
relationship
but
primarily
the
way
we
at
the
coca
cola
company
work
we
all
knew
this
level
of
reengagement
would
be
fractious
but
be
necessary
for
a
function
system
and
to
avoid
what
have
be
happen
a
harden
of
the
artery
that
same
summer
i
make
one
of
the
most
important
decision
of
my
tenure
one
that
will
continue
to
impact
the
company
for
year
to
come
muhtar
kent
who
have
be
so
valuable
to
me
in
eastern
europe
have
go
on
to
head
the
european
division
of
coca
cola
amatil
the
large
australian
base
bottler
his
promising
career
be
derail
after
authority
in
australia
investigate
muhtar
for
insider
trading
of
amatil
stock
muhtar
s
financial
advisor
in
late
execute
a
short
sale
of
share
of
amatil
stock
just
before
the
company
issue
an
earnings
warn
i
believe
it
be
an
honest
mistake
muhtar
s
financial
advisor
have
authority
to
execute
stock
trade
on
his
behalf
and
make
the
short
sale
essentially
bet
that
the
stock
would
soon
go
down
without
muhtar
s
knowledge
muhtar
settle
the
controversy
by
pay
and
relinquish
the
profit
from
the
short
sale
the
real
penalty
be
much
great
he
be
force
to
leave
his
high
profile
position
at
amatil
which
likely
would
have
lead
him
eventually
to
an
executive
s
job
at
coke
headquarters
in
muhtar
become
ceo
of
efes
beverage
group
a
brewer
and
the
large
shareholder
of
the
coca
cola
bottler
in
turkey
muhtar
and
i
have
always
stayed
in
touch
and
he
have
be
one
of
those
who
lobby
hard
behind
the
scene
for
me
to
become
chairman
and
ceo
after
daft
resign
shortly
after
the
board
offer
me
the
job
john
hunter
whom
i
trust
completely
flew
to
barbados
to
brief
me
on
the
state
of
the
company
i
comment
on
the
fact
that
there
be
no
clear
insider
candidate
to
be
president
and
john
agree
a
move
i
need
to
take
i
told
john
be
to
appoint
an
international
president
and
yet
there
again
be
another
void
i
could
not
envision
anyone
in
the
company
who
be
competent
to
take
that
job
either
you
should
bring
muhtar
back
john
say
i
have
be
think
about
muhtar
all
along
but
john
s
recommendation
seal
the
deal
it
be
clear
to
many
of
us
that
muhtar
be
one
of
the
most
talented
executive
in
the
coca
cola
system
we
have
work
closely
together
during
that
intense
period
after
the
wall
fell
in
when
there
be
no
margin
for
error
yet
at
the
same
time
success
demand
rapid
risk
take
it
be
the
ultimate
prove
ground
i
knew
what
muhtar
could
do
he
also
have
the
rare
talent
of
diplomacy
that
be
invaluable
in
high
level
international
business

the
invaluable
experience
of

with
the
thought
that
he
have
the
potential
to
one
day
be
a
group
president
although
very
personable
and
persuasive
siewert
be
really
very
lightweight
in
term
of
any
knowledge
of
the
soft
drink
business
he
tend
to
operate
at
the
high
social
end
of
the
managerial
scale
rather
than
get
his
hand
dirty
which
do
not
endear
him
to
me
that
s
just
not
the
way
i
operate
at
the
time
sanjay
gupta
be
in
charge
of
india
s
operation
during
a
cocktail
party

which
include
some
of
the
country
s
lead
business
leader
i
be
sideline
by
at
least
three
board
member
who
told
me
sanjay
be
just
not
up
to
snuff
the
next
day
gupta
have
a
presentation
for
me
in
the
ballroom
of
a
hotel
with
booth
display
everything
they
be
do
in
india
i
be
shock
at
the
high
cost
of
this
presentation
which
be
exclusively
for
me
i
also
couldn
t
help
but
notice
that
each
time
we
stop
at
a
booth
and
someone
start
present
sanjay
would
interrupt
and
take
over
the
presentation
i
be
a
great
one
for
watch
body
language
almost
without
exception
you
could
see
the
fear
the
employee
have
for
sanjay
that
night
sanjay
host
a
dinner
for
me
at
his
house
in
delhi
which
be
on
three
beautiful
acre
with
guest
there
be
traditional
dancer
the
best
wine
it
cost
an
absolute
fortune
and
the
company
be
pick
up
the
tab
i
later
told
mary
and
patrick
i
didn
t
think
he
be
the
right
guy
for
the
job
they
strongly
disagreed
say
he
be
a
future
group
president
with
all
the
other
task
before
me
at
the
time
i
delayed
replace
sanjay
immediately
there
be
limit
to
power
all
i
really
have
be
an
overall
gut
feel
and
a
few
observation
that
be
not
the
way
to
overrule
senior
management
then
it
be
on
to
shanghai
to
a
company
own
bottler
that
be
lose
money
the
plant
manager
be
an
old
timer
i
have
know
in
nairobi
he
be
good
at
keep
the
old
shanghai
bottle
plant
run
but
knew
very
little
about
marketing
i
go
out
in
the
marketplace
with
him
and
it
be
patently
obvious
that
he
be
not
in
control
of
his
business
he
too
would
later
be
replace
next
up
be
tense
meeting
with
bottler
in
mexico
city
and
rio
de
janeiro
both
group
of
bottler
be
unhappy
one
of
their
core
issue
be
that
we
be
not
invest
enough
money
in
the
brand
and
be
take
out
large
share
of
the
profit
the
bottler
do
not
like
the
quality
of
our
marketing
and
advertising
they
believe
we
be
not
keep
our
end
of
the
bargain
we
charge
bottler
a
premium
price
for
concentrate
but
in
exchange
we
do
the
marketing
and
we
be
suppose
to
give
bottler
superb
advertising
coca
cola
company
do
the
pull
and
the
bottler
do
the
push
when
we
don
t
do
the
pull
right
the
bottler
yell
either
because
the
quality
of
the
advertising
be
not
good
enough
or
we
be
not
spending
enough
i
have
chuck
fruit
work
in
atlanta
to
track
how
much
we
have
be
spending
on
marketing
and
advertising
in
relation
to
our
volume
and
to
inflation
medium
price
have
be
increase
over
the
year
much
faster
than
general
inflation
and
chuck
discover
that
our
spending
have
not
be
keep
pace
this
be
a
major
source
of
the
friction
with
the
bottler
it
be
affect
their
ability
to
compete
and
need
to
be
fix
my
first
board
meeting
be
july
you
ve
elect
me
to
do
two
thing
i
told
the
board
member
you
have
brought
me
here
as
chairman
and
ceo
to
run
the
company
reporting
to
the
board
of
director
i
will
undertake
that
with
due
respect
to
the
board
i
will
try
to
keep
the
board
inform
to
the
best
of
my
ability
in
regard
to
strategy
and
my
action
but
you
ve
also
elect
me
chairman
of
the
board
which
mean
you
ve
ask
me
to
lead
the
board
it
be
my
intention
to
lead
i
know
i
do
not
always
measure
up
to
that
high
standard
but
that
be
my
intent
in
august
i
met
with
another
group
of
bottler
this
time
in
spain
and
this
time
they
be
happy
a
welcome
respite
ivester
as
international
president
have
attempt
to
do
a
bottler
consolidation
but
have
pull
back
when
they
phone
goizueta
very
similar
to
the
situation
i
have
face
in
germany
spain
like
germany
be
a
very
good
and
strong
system
but
the
reality
be
it
have
stop
grow
in
the
s
because
their
cost
and
price
be
too
high
and
there
wasn
t
enough
investment
in
the
marketplace
as
group
president
i
met
with
the
spanish
bottler
try
to
rebuild
the
relationship
the
young
bottler
tough
and
on
the
brink
of
hostility
start
that
meeting
with
a
list
of
complaint
include
transshipment
into
spain
from
coca
cola
bottler
in
germany
which
be
allow
under
european
union
law
i
told
them
there
be
no
way
i
be
go
to
break
eu
law
we
then
discuss
consolidation
i
try
to
explain
that
it
be
all
about
effectiveness
and
efficiency
if
they
do
not
want
to
relinquish
their
individual
bottle
franchise
i
suggest
that
they
create
a
so
call
virtual
anchor
bottler
to
low
cost
through
joint
purchasing
and
a
centralize
computer
system
they
already
have
a
central
organization
for
sell
with
supermarket
chain
and
other
large
customer
so
they
understood
the
concept
and
saw
how
it
could
increase
efficiency
and
low
cost
if
you
do
that
and
take
the
cost
out
then
the
power
of
the
local
ownership
be
still
there
i
told
them
that
would
be
my
prefer
strategy
i
be
also
tough
tell
them
i
have
never
met
a
more
disenchant
group
of
bottler
and
if
that
be
how
they
felt
about
the
system
they
should
consider
sell
the
elder
then
suddenly
move
in
and
take
over
the
discussion
replace
the
young
exec
in
a
kind
of
good
cop
bad
cop
routine
we
have
a
very
good
dialogue
over
the
week
and
month
ahead
work
together
with
local
management
when
i
become
chairman
and
ceo
spain
have
become
an
absolute
gem
in
the
coke
system
in
europe
obviously
aid
by
the
growth
in
the
spanish
economy
and
be
lead
by
a
very
innovative
marketeer
marcos
de
quinto
i
think
some
of
my
best
relationship
and
best
friendship
be
with
the
spanish
bottler
they
be
a
true
example
of
how
the
franchise
system
could
and
should
work
i
be
thrill
when
they
won
the
woodruff
award
for
the
best
division
in
the
world
in
after
have
be
consistently
in
the
top
three
for
a
number
of
year
at
the
summer
olympics
in
athens
i
approach
the
chairman
of
coke
s
turkish
bottler
which
be
partly
own
by
efes
beverage
group
the
company
muhtar
now
ran
i
just
want
to
tell
you
that
i
m
go
to
come
knock
on
your
door
i
told
the
bottler
i
really
need
muhtar
back
he
be
devastate
you
have
hurt
me
to
my
heart
he
say
it
would
still
be
a
number
of
month
before
i
move
on
this
but
i
be
lay
the
groundwork
luckily
the
turkish
system
have
continued
to
flourish
under
the
leadership
of
michael
o
neill
also
that
august
claus
halle
pass
away
in
atlanta
he
be
the
former
president
of
international

man
with
immense
and
deep
knowledge
of
the
business
he
also
have
the
skill
of
an
international
diplomat
something
i
aspire
to
develop
and
which
i
value
in
muhtar
claus
could
mix
at
the
high
level
he
also
displayed
an
enormous
attention
to
detail
in
atlanta
claus

an
exact
replica
of

in
east

ii
he
have
the
original
plan
and
he
have
it
rebuilt
bring
in
old
style
artisan
to
do
the
work
which
he
personally
supervise
typical
of
the
man
he
have
mapped
out
his
funeral
exactly
who
would
speak
and
the
hymn
i
be
honor
to
be
on
the
list
of
those
he
want
to
deliver
eulogy
it
be
a
very
emotional
funeral
and
i
have
to
choke
back
the
tear
he
be
a
giant
of
coca
cola
and
a
great
mentor
his
life
story
deserves
a
book
of
its
own
include
the
time
he
swam
the
elbe
river
to
escape
the
advance
russian
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
and
his
begin
at
coca
cola
as
a
truck
driver
the
fall
of
brought
great
promise
on
the
product
development
side
of
the
company
the
first
really
good
news
in
a
long
while
we
have
developed
a
new
diet
cola
or
we
thought
we
have
it
be
more
truthful
to
say
we
have
a
great
name
for
a
diet
cola
coke
zero
the
name
test
very
well
with
consumer
it
portrayed
a
strong
message
than
diet
coke
which
signal
few
calorie
but
not
zero
calorie
so
we
have
this
great
moniker
what
would
we
do
with
it
the
first
test
version
of
coke
zero
include
splenda
the
artificial
sweetener
that
have
just
be
approve
for
soft
drink
however
the
research
show
that
only
splenda
loyal
consumer
like
it
and
that
the
new
soft
drink
could
be
only
moderately
successful
in
my
opinion
splenda
have
a
distinct
aftertaste
and
i
be
oppose
to
use
it
for
a
new
product
with
a
great
name
like
coke
zero
at
a
meeting
in
september
i
instruct
the
flavor
scientist
to
use
the
original
coke
formula
for
coke
zero
which
would
be
sweeten
not
with
splenda
but
with
the
best
artificial
sweetener
available
from
country
to
country
a
veteran
flavor
scientist
quickly
object
you
can
t
do
that
he
say
mr
goizueta
and
mr
woodruff
before
him
instruct
that
we
could
never
use
the
coca
cola
formula
in
anything
but
coca
cola
classic
my
reply
be
simple
when
do
you
want
a
new
letter
you
could
have
heard
a
feather
drop
coke
zero
design
to
taste
as
close
as
possible
to
coke
classic
be
the
most
successful
product
launch
since
diet
coke
attract
lapse
user
of
coca
cola
who
didn
t
like
the
taste
of
diet
coke
and
those
who
be
cut
back
on
the
number
of
coke
classic
they
consume
now
they
would
be
able
to
have
one
coke
classic
per
day
and
two
coke
zero
coke
zero
in
become
the
thirteenth
coca
cola
brand
to
achieve
more
than
billion
in
annual
retail
sale
just
as
important
diet
coke
continued
to
be
strong
and
there
be
little
cannibalization
one
very
high
profile
customer
give
coke
zero
an
early
try
i
chair
a
fundraise
campaign
for
the
kennedy
center
and
attend
an
award
ceremony
at
the
white
house
at
a
cocktail
party
afterward

but
i
have
far
less
input
on
this
one
really
only
one
word
wow
i
say
when
a
chinese
flavor
scientist
ask
me
to
taste
it
i
knew
it
would
be
huge

del

and
vitamin
water
which
be
all
launch
or
acquire
on
my
watch
have
provide
a
big
boost
to
our
bottom
line
which
we
sorely
need
but
it
take
time
meanwhile
the
bottom
line
remain
a
serious
problem
reluctantly
we
issue
a
statement
on
september
warn
that
profit
would
fall
below
analyst
s
expectation
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
send
the
stock
briefly
below
per
share
the
solution
be
complex
require
implementation
over
the
next
several
year
and
make
short
term
benefit
unlikely
we
write
in
a
statement
my
strategy
all
along
have
be
go
slow
to
go
fast
later
that
be
not
what
wall
street
want
to
hear
but
it
be
the
only
way
we
be
go
to
pull
the
company
out
of
its
deep
malaise
two
month
later
i
announce
that
we
would
spend
an
additional
million
per
year
on
advertising
and
make
a
plea
for
patience
as
we
try
to
right
the
company
the
board
back
me
solidly
bolster
by
warren
buffett
s
unequivocal
statement
i
bought
into
this
company
because
i
believe
in
the
brand
coca
cola
if
this
be
good
for
coca
cola
then
i
m
fine
with
it
wall
street
not
surprisingly
be
not
impressed
it
fail
to
see
an
immediate
gain
only
million
less
per
year
in
profit
many
analyst
believe
we
be
simply
incapable
of
regenerate
growth
the
stock
hover
barely
above
and
at
one
point
dipped
to
we
couldn
t
allow
the
stock
price
to
drive
our
long
term
strategy
but
at
the
same
time
we
have
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
it
there
be
legitimate
concern
that
if
it
drop
too
low
the
company
could
be
a
takeover
target
at
a
function
in
new
york
i
ran
into

of
the

one
of
the
world
s
large
private

he
be
talk
about
the
possibility
of
have
the
first

leveraged
buyout
in
which
investor
buy

usually
by

what
s
your
market
cap
right
now
rubenstein
ask
me
at
that
time
it
be
about
billion
well
that
s
a
bit
out
of
our
reach
for
now
say
rubenstein
in
addition
to
a
possible
threat
of
an
lbo
it
be
long
know
that
nestle
covet
coke
and
would
if
the
price
be
right
consider
a
takeover
we
have
to
grow
revenue
and
improve
the
bottom
line
to
move
our
stock
price
up
again
or
we
risk
lose
control
of
the
company
the
analyst
and
the
press
be
not
be
kind
and
as
the
pepsi
stock
price
not
market
cap
pass
the
coca
cola
price
the
wall

of
me
be
kick
by
a
pepsi
can
i
have
be
ask
and
agree
to
return
the
company
to
health
for
the
long
term
and
that
be
what
i
intend
to
do
there
be
call
for
far
cost
cut
and
while
i
preach
eliminate
waste
chase
penny
down
the
hallway
i
be
not
willing
to
take
the
knife
to
cost
largely
make
up
of
salary
and
wage
when
the
morale
of
the
employee
be
still
so
fragile
clearly
these
be
not
comfortable
time
for
me
i
be
determine
not
to
fail
and
to
maintain
our
long
term
focus
and
the
board
crucially
held
with
me
behind
the
scene
outside
of
wall
street
s
skeptical
gaze
we
begin
to
redefine
the
coca
cola
company
it
start
on
a
rainy
night
in
london
in
august
when
i
gather
all
my
direct
report
at
a
hotel
many
of
them
arrive
late
because
the
street
of
london
be
literally
flood
we
be
go
to
develop
a
total
growth
plan
for
the
company
not
just
new
strategy
and
a
mission
statement
it
would
be
a
clearly
define
path
to
growth
underpinned
by
a
strong
emphasis
on
our
culture
and
draw
from
our
heritage
but
also
relevant
to
the
future
it
would
be
a
road
map
for
how
to
get
the
company
grow
again
and
sustain
that
growth
over
the
long
term
it
would
not
be
dictate
from
on
high
but
developed
organically
by
the
company
s
top
leader
who
have
be
dishearten
by
layoff
lawsuit
a
game
of
musical
chair
in
the
ceo
s
office
and
a
linger
slump
in
profit
as
i
travel
the
world
i
detect
a
pent
up
annoyance
and
anger
we
need
to
get
everyone
in
and
get
it
all
out
on
the
table
and
then
decide
what
we
be
go
to
do
about
it
we
have
be
through
a
similar
process
at
cchbc
and
it
have
be
very
helpful
i
ask
cchbc
veteran
cynthia
mccague
and
irial
finan
to
help
as
we
repeat
that
process
on
a
much
large
scale
for
coca
cola
the
mission
statement
would
be
call
the
manifesto
for
growth
i
consider
it
my
single
most
important
accomplishment
as
chairman
and
ceo
we
already
knew
from
an
internal
survey
that
many
of
our
employee
do
not
trust
upper
management
they
just
didn
t
believe
we
have
a
strategy
or
that
we
could
grow
it
be
also
clear
that
many
of
the
executive
have
lose
faith
in
our
strong
asset
the
coca
cola
brand
in
fact
when
the
chief
financial
officer
gary
fayard
and
i
reveal
our
low
growth
target
a
number
of
executive
thought
they
be
still
too
high
i
remember
say
that
if
we
could
not
even
reach
the
lower
goal
we
should
all
pack
up
and
go
home
we
gather
of
the
company
s
top
executive
for
a
three
day
meeting
to
kick
off
the
project
as
they
walk
into
the
hotel
ballroom
the
wall
be
adorn
with
poster
of
cartoon
character
that
contain
the
verbatim
quote
from
the
internal
employee
engagement
survey
which
show
the
level
of
discontent
at
coke
to
be
far
high
than
at
our
peer
company
we
don
t
trust
management
read
one
quote
from
the
survey
our
marketing
be
terrible
read
another
we
have
no
strategy
say
another
i
go
on
stage
to
explain
that
we
be
go
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
small
group
of
a
dozen
in
order
to
validate
or
not
the
research
essentially
this
be
the
catharsis
phase
the
next
day
i
open
by
say
that
the
intellectual
capacity
to
change
the
business
be
in
this
room
and
that
together
we
would
redesign
the
company
over
the
next
four
month
during
one
of
the
first
meeting
one
executive
suggest
that
the
solution
to
coke
s
financial
problem
be
to
purchase
another
big
company
just
as
pepsi
have
do
many
year
earlier
when
it
purchase
the
snack
food
company
frito
lay
why
would
we
buy
another
company
when
we
can
t
seem
to
figure
out
how
to
run
this
one
i
ask
rhetorically
or
i
continued
do
we
need
to
buy
another
company
in
order
to
run
our
company
because
we
can
t
there
be
silence
this
be
a
necessary
intervention
on
my
part
and
the
only
occasion
when
i
come
down
hard
as
the
meeting
progress
and
the
executive
begin
to
realize
that
they
really
be
able
to
shape
the
future
of
the
company
the
enthusiasm
grow
exponentially
it
be
the
realization
of
the
manifesto
for
growth
the
manifesto
be
a
road
map
for
the
company
spell
out
for
example
that
we
would
no
longer
venture
outside
our
core
business
we
would
not
for
example
buy
another
movie
studio
or
a
snack
food
company
yet
it
also
redefine
the
company
as
something
much
more
than
an
emotionless
profit
produce
machine
it
built
on
the
power
of
brand
coca
cola
and
the
belief

assessment
of
where
we
be
as
a
company
and
where
we
need
to

there
s
something
very
special
about
the
coca

the

begin
there
s
a
sense
of
pride

of

about
the

in

of
our
purpose
as

company
the

we
ve
dealt
with
challenge
reactively

separately

we

there
s
not
a
moment
to
lose
as
we
rebuild
our
company
wall

couldn
t
have
care
less
about
the

which
tends
to
look
far
beyond
the
next
quarter
s
earnings
statement
yet
the
manifesto
absolutely
turn
the
company
around
in
a
way
that
be
invisible
from
the
outside

roll
it
out
around

the

in

impressed

with
the

she

love
it
the

provide

with
a

for

we

desperately
sought

similar
on

to
the
result
we
witness
during
those
heady
day
in
the
philippine
as
we
rally
the
employee
at
weekend
meeting
i
can
t
emphasize
this
enough
a
company
can
t
succeed
unless
it
have
its
employee
behind
it
they
have
to
be
convince
that
the
leadership
truly
have
their
best
interest
at
heart
and
can
win
for
them
now
we
have
that
at
coca
cola
it
seem
like
an
oversimplification
to
say
this
and
perhaps
it
be
but
the
manifesto
cement
the
turnaround
at
coca

for
the
first
time

ally

need
most
to
achieve

they

it

in
it

the

we
move

an
area
with
more

a
different

the

do
give
us
a
very
different
view
of
the

as
we
go
about
construct
the

we
still
have
linger
cloud
over
our

one
of
the
most

from

s
fair
to
say
that
this

be
a
direct
result
of
the
malaise
that
hit
the
company
after

and
the
sloppy
attempt
to
fix
it
through

shortly
after

told
him

coke
neither
admit
nor

the

and
the

paid
no

but
we
do
agree
to
strengthen
our
internal
disclosure
review
process
gary
be
not

and
remains
the

cfo
to
this
day
there
be
now
one
less

personally
appear
before

ask
him
to
extend
it
another

but
still
lack
adequate
commitment
to
the
large
goal
of

i
told
the

he
reply
that
he
have
never
heard
of
anyone
ask
for
an
extension
of
court
supervision
many
people
thought
i
have
take
leave
of
my
sens
however
i
believe
diversity
be
not
only
the
correct
moral
goal
it
be
good
for
business
and
would
make
coca
cola
a
strong
company
our
company
and
our
leadership
must
be
as
inclusive
as
our
brand
as
diverse
talent
proliferates
idea
and
innovation
thrive
as
well
i
write
at
the
time
we
conclude
the

a
year
later
on
an
extremely
positive
note

joint
in
atlanta
together
with
the

in
and
be
still
there
today
yet
another
legal
controversy
end
in
late
when
we
settle
the
european
commission
s
antitrust
suit
as
a
result
of
our
strong
and
hard
earn
market
position
the
commission
be
concerned
we
be
stifle
competition
in
belgium
for
example
we
have
a
percent
market
share
compare
to
percent
for
pepsi
in
france
it
be
percent
coke
percent
pepsi
in
the
settlement
we
agree
to
a
long
list
of
change
design
to
foster
competition
for
example
we
would
allow
retailer
to
devote
up
to
percent
of
the
space
in
coke
bottler
own
cooler
to
compete
product
consumer
will
generally
have
more
choice
at
caf
s
pub
and
shop
and
will
therefore
be
in
a
position
to
choose
on
the
basis
of
price
and
personal
preference
rather
than
pick
up
a
coca
cola
product
because
it
s
the
only
one
on
offer
the
eu
s
competition
commissioner
mario
monti
say
in
a
statement
i
met
personally
with
monti
before
we
announce
the
settlement
he
want
assurance
that
we
be
sincere
about
fulfil
the
agreement
our
meeting
have
be
schedule
for
thirty
minute
but
last
twice
that
long
we
discuss
not
only
the
settlement
but
also
business
philosophy
monti
and
i
warm
to
each
other
that
meeting
seal
the
deal
in
term
of
us
have
no
fine
and
admit
no
guilt
but
with
administrative
agreement
for
future
conduct
we
do
indeed
take
the
agreement
seriously
and
i
would
later
retire
sandy
allan
for
in
my
opinion
violate
the
spirit
of
that
agreement
i
advise
the
competition
commission
accordingly
after
monti
left
the
competition
commission
i
ask
him
to
join
coca
cola
s
international
advisory
board
another
sign
i
believe
of
the
goodwill
we
be
building
throughout
the
world
i
don
t
think
anyone
could
have
imagine
that
the
competition
commissioner
who
have
be
pursue
coca
cola
would
later
join
the
coca
cola
family
but
he
do
the
perception
of
the
company
be
start
to
change
for
the
well
throughout
the
world
as
the

although

greatly
boost
our
effort
one
region
of
the
world
that
rarely
give
me
any
trouble
be
latin
america
under
the
brilliant
leadership
of
pacho
reyes
who
remains
a
close
friend
and
the
many
great
bottler
include
coca
cola
femsa
just
before
i
retire
pacho
pamela
and
i
travel
to
machu
picchu
the
fifteenth
century
inca
ruin
in
peru
to
celebrate
five
great
year
together
without
the
consistent
growth
of
volume
and
profit
in
latin
america
the
turnaround
of
coca
cola
would
have
be
much
more
difficult
if
not
impossible
i
brought
muhtar
back
to
the
company
in
may
as
head
of
north
asia
eurasia
and
the
middle
east
include
japan
and
china
move
mary
minnick
to
head
of
marketing
to
replace
chuck
fruit
who
do
a
great
job
but
be
have
health
problem
and
sadly
die
just
after
i
retire
mary
be
a
brilliant
marketeer
but
be
not
a
strong
general
manager
she
be
not
aggressive
enough
in
japan
india
or
china
i
believe
initially
she
balk
at
the
marketing
job
believe
it
would
be
a
demotion
i
have
a
solution
i
have
be
consider
for
a
long
time
as
a
way
to
break
down
some
of
the
wall
that
slow
and
often
impede
bring
new
brand
and
new
idea
to
the
market
i
offer
to
give
her
technical
and
strategic
planning
in
addition
to
marketing
bring
her
back
into
the
atlanta
headquarters
in
a
very
powerful
position
although
i
also
allow
her
to
maintain
an
office
in
london
which
be
a
defensible
move
give
the
creative
idea
which
emanate
from
europe
it
also
met
mary
s
personal
need
and
demonstrate
the
flexibility
a
company
need
to
retain
top
class
female
executive
i
chose
patrick
siewert
the
former
kodak
executive
to
head
the
southern
asia
and
pacific
group
include
india
and
the
philippine
which
prove
to
be
a
mistake
patrick
do
not
work
out
i
found
him
to
be
an
inadequate
manager
i
do
not
listen
to
my
own
gut
or
some
of
the
people
around
me
but
rely
on
a
professional
evaluation
system
that
be
a
mistake
before
hire
muhtar
i
contract
an
outside
law
firm
to
compile
a
report
on
the
insider
trading
controversy
it
reinforce
my
belief
that
the
incident
be
an
honest
mistake
by
muhtar
s
financial
advisor
the
coca
cola
board
be
also
comfortable
with
the
report
and
with
my
decision
these
be
some
of
the
most
respect
business
leader
in
the
world
include
warren
buffet
and
peter
ueberroth
it
be
not
a
patsy
board
as
you
will
see
later
in
this
chapter
they
back
muhtar
despite
a
smatter
of
press
criticism
i
must
say
however
that
there
be
executive
even
within
my
inner
circle
who
question
my
decision
we
just
chose
to
disagree
my
vision
for
muhtar
at
the
time
be
for
him
to
eventually
become
international
president
and
then
we
would
see
base
on
his
performance
whether
he
would
be
a
candidate
to
succeed
me
he
have
to
earn
it
muhtar
have
no
assumption
of
eventually
become
ceo
he
would
frequently
say
i
will
leave
when
neville
leaf
he
saw
us
as
binary
and
in
a
way
we
be
mary
minnick
be
also
see
as
possible
successor
as
be
a
few
outside
candidate
we
have
identify
coca
cola
enterprise
the
company
s
large
bottler
which
have
franchise
in
north
america
and
europe
be
a
particularly
troublesome
challenge
cce
be
a
perennial
underperformer
and
its
leader
held
a
long
stand
grudge
against
the
coca
cola
company
which
have
create
the
company
in
by
merge
company
own
bottler
in
north
america
with
two
other
independent
bottler
the
john
t
lupton
franchise
and
bci
hold
corporation
s
plant
in

with
summerfield
johnson
s
family
own
company
the
chattanooga
base
johnston
coca
cola
bottle
group
inc
one
of
coke
s
old
bottler
cce
later
expand
into
europe
as
well
many
in
the
cce
rank
believe
coke
best
cce
in
the
negotiation
overcharge
them
for
the
company
own
bottle
franchise
and
leave
cce
with
a
cripple
debt
there
have
be
of
course
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller
and
more
important
these
be
perpetual
franchise
not
subject
to
periodic
renewal
by
coke
and
therefore
legitimately
price
at
a
premium
so
it
didn
t
make
much
sense
to
me
for
cce
to
complain
later
about
the
transaction
still
the
resentment
linger
and
remain
a
strong
factor
in
the
often
tense
relationship
between
coke
and
cce
there
be
some
arrogance
at
cce
in
my
early
day
with
the
company
the
u
s
bottler
be
the
gold
standard
they
be
the
source
of
new
idea
and
it
be
to
the
u
s
where
bottler
from
other
country
would
travel
to
learn
by
the
time
i
become
ceo
in
it
have
become
embarrass
to
bring
visitor
through
the
u
s
marketplace
the
execution
be
very
poor
some
of
the
private
label
cola
actually
have
well
packaging
than
cce
yet
executive
at
cce
believe
they
be
still
the
best
in
fact
bottler
in
brazil
france
spain
south
africa
and
other
country
be
the
new
gold
standard
i
met
privately
with
the
cce
board
chair
lowry
kline
in
february
and
flatly
told
him
that
john
alm
the
company
ceo
do
not
have
my
confidence
lowry
then
allow
me
to
meet
with
nonexecutive
board
member
it
be
a
tough
meeting
with
the
cce
board
member
still
maintain
the
view
that
many
of
their
problem
be
due
to
overpayment
to
coke
for
the
bottler
they
have
be
convince
that
most
of
their
problem
be
cause
by
the
coca
cola
company
at
this
point
i
be
able
to
tell
them
about
the
million
in
new
marketing
money
million
of
that
dedicate
to
north
america
which
placate
them
somewhat
then
i
raise
the
issue
of
management
i
told
them
that
while
it
be
not
my
role
to
choose
the
management
of
a
public
company
i
be
entitle
as
the
franchisor
to
a
view
about
the
quality
of
the
management
i
laid
out
a
strong
case
as
to
why
alm
should
not
be
run
the
business
the
board
disagreed
and
word
soon
leak
to
alm
about
the
meeting
it
do
not
help
the
already
strain
relationship
with
cce
one
of
the
problem
with
huge
bottle
franchise
like
cce
be
that
while
they
make
sense
economically
they
sometimes
lose
sight
of
the
interdependency
of
the
system
particularly
when
they
be
publicly
held
company
like
cce
yet
by
the
end
of
alm
be
out
and
a
new
ceo
john
brock
be
in
that
do
not
however
solve
our
problem
with
cce
brock
launch
a
series
of
retail
price
increase
try
to
boost
the
company
s
profit
margin
but
in
do
so
erode
coke
market
share
thus
reduce
our
concentrate
sale
we
have
no
choice
but
to
raise
concentrate
price
it
be
a
bitter
tit
for
tat
exchange
hop
to
find
a
solution
for
the
deep
seat
problem
in
north
america
i
present
to
cce
s
board
in
the
spring
of
a
plan
call
project
diesel
cce
in
the
u
s
would
merge
with
the
remain
independent
bottler
in
order
to
low
cost
and
increase
profit
we
have
calculate
that
we
could
pay
a
real
premium
for
the
independent
bottler
and
easily
recoup
the
investment
by
increase
the
scale
and
efficiency
of
the
bottle
operation
the
cce
board
flatly
reject
the
idea
an
outgrowth
of
the
lack
of
trust
they
have
for
coca
cola
when
the
news
leak
the
proposal
cause
a
lot
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
independent
bottler
who
thought
we
be
favor
cce
and
worried
about
the
price
they
would
receive
in
the
acquisition
don
knauss
who
have
be
appoint
head
of
coca
cola
usa
have
put
an
enormous
amount
of
time
into
this
effort
and
when
clorox
offer
him
the
job
of
chairman
and
ceo
he
move
on
it
be
then
time
i
believe
to
bite
the
bullet
and
make
a
full
fledge
move
to
buy
cce
i
go
around
to
coke
board
member
include
warren
buffet
to
sell
them
on
the
plan
the
logic
be
something
the
board
member
found
difficult
to
disagree
with
it
make
economic
sense
to
buy
cce
the
devil
however
be
in
the
detail
this
would
be
a
takeover
cce
stock
at
the
time
be
around
per
share
we
thought
we
could
make
a
bid
at
yet
our
bid
would
be
open
end
hedge
fund
and
other
investor
could
launch
a
bidding
war
drive
up
the
cce
stock
price
far
beyond
what
we
thought
we
should
pay
in
a
normal
acquisition
we
could
have
just
walk
away
if
the
bidding
get
out
of
hand
that
be
not
an
option
in
this
case
for
two
reason
we
would
have
completely
lose
credibility
if
we
walk
away
and
in
the
eye
of
cce
we
would
have
appear
incredibly
weak
also
another
bidder
might
have
acquire
the
company
leave
us
potentially
with
a
far
more
difficult
partner
than
cce
the
board
recognize
this
and
i
back
down
in
my
view
i
have
fail
yet
i
soften
the
ground
for
an
acquisition
and
in
after
i
retire
coke
do
acquire
the
north
american
business
of
cce
this
time
cce
approach
coke
no
longer
be
it
a
takeover
and
this
time
the
deal
work
i
didn
t
do
the
deal
but
i
believe
i
start
the
process
that
lead
to
the
deal
i
also
explore
other
possible
acquisition
the
moral
of
the
follow
story
be
that
personal
prejudice
and
business
strategy
sometimes
get
confuse
it
all
start
when
we
held
a
meeting
of
coke
s
top
management
in
barbados
we
played
golf
with
gary
player
a
south
african
and
one
of
the
best
golfer
of
all
time
who
have
long
be
a
close
friend
of
coca
cola
over
lunch
and
dinner
we
notice
that
gary
ate
no
meat
or
dairy
product
he
be
a
vegan
and
told
us
how
it
have
stop
the
progression
of
his
arthritis
a
few
month
later
pamela
decide
to
become
a
vegan
and
much
to
her
surprise
i
join
her
it
cause
a
great
flurry
at
coca
cola
now
i
have
to
have
vegan
food
everywhere
i
go
around
the
world
i
found
the
vegan
diet
to
be
very
good
for
me
i
lose
weight
and
my
cholesterol
drop
one
key
component
of
the
vegan
diet
be
soy
milk
and
i
begin
look
around
for
company
that
have
a
strong
market
presence
in
soy
product
we
consider
several
of
them
and
have
informal
discussion
with
coke
board
member
during
a
meeting
at
pebble
beach
california
but
they
didn
t
like
the
deal
they
thought
the
price
be
too
high
and
be
worried
that
it
would
distract
us
from
our
core
business
muhtar
be
also
oppose
to
the
acquisition
one
example
of
honest
disagreement
between
the
two
of
us
i
m
not
sure
they
would
have
vote
against
me
but
i
decide
not
to
push
the
issue
in
retrospect
the
board
be
right
the
stock
of
one
of
the
company
have
subsequently
plunge
reflect
a
serious
downturn
in
its
profitability
the
coca
cola
board
be
strongly
supportive
of
me
but
do
exercise
strong
and
appropriate
oversight
an
analyst
once
ask
me
what
i
be
go
to
do
about
my
strong
board
i
reply
i
therefore
assume
you
would
want
me
to
have
a
weak
one
there
be
no
reply
i
work
well
with
almost
all
the
board
member
include
buffett
ueberroth
former
u
s
senator
sam
nunn
of
georgia
herbert
allen
and
jim
robinson
yet
i
have
a
chill
relationship
with
bob
nardelli
ceo
of
home
depot
in
march
the
compensation
committee
be
review
bonus
for
normally
the
committee
approve
bonus
for
the
top
fifty
executive
and
management
decide
the
remainder
bob
have
call
me
and
ask
for
the
full
bonus
list
and
i
agree
it
include
a
list
of
one
thousand
bonus
all
within
plan
but
also
base
on
a
level
of
discretion
base
on
individual
performance
bob
come
to
the
meeting
with
the
big
bonus
list
well
thumbed
and
marked
with
yellow
highlighter
he
then
ask
why
two
junior
award
differ
to
which
i
reply
i
have
no
idea
i
delegate
those
kind
of
decision
and
they
be
accord
to
plan
two
very
different
management
style
have
clashed
while
i
prefer
my
own
model
both
be
effective
in
their
own
way
and
under
certain
circumstance
bob
s
work
best
in
the
short
term
bob
be
very
detail
orient
very
bright
and
extremely
hard
work
but
he
and
i
be
on
different
wavelength
and
just
never
hit
it
off
bob
to
his
credit
realize
this
and
left
the
board
in
another
board
member
j
pedro
reinhard
former
chief
financial
officer
of
dow
chemical
ran
afoul
of
that
company
s
board
for
allegedly
plot
a
leveraged
buyout
of
dow
without
authorization
from
the
board
and
without
tell
the
ceo
i
discover
that
he
never
support
my
strategy
although
he
never
raise
any
issue
directly
during
board
meeting
when
he
left
dow
he
have
to
formally
resign
from
the
coke
board
since
he
no
longer
have
the
same
position
as
when
he
be
name
a
director
when
a
director
change
job
the
coke
board
usually
allows
them
to
remain
as
a
director
however
this
time
i
persuade
the
board
not
to
renew
pedro
s
appointment
as
we
push
to
regenerate
sale
and
profit
i
try
to
instill
in
coca
cola
the
spirit
of
frugality
that
many
bottler
out
of
necessity
have
long
possess
coca
cola
with
its
traditional
high
profit
margin
have
never
be
force
to
chase
penny
down
the
hallway
we
always
do
thing
roll
royce
style
one
of
the
most
disturb
example
be
a
million
party
in
johannesburg
feature
the
rapper
snoop
dogg
after
south
africa
be
award
an
internal
prize
the
woodruff
cup
for
superior
performance
i
want
to
change
that
mindset
start
with
my
own
office
where
the
company
have
be
schedule
to
spend
million
for
renovation
i
stop
that
we
do
recarpet
but
scrounge
furniture
from
other
office
instead
of
buying
new
i
also
eliminate
expensive
wine
in
the
corporate
aircraft
these
be
small
thing
but
small
thing
that
deliver
message
in
march
klaus
maurers
the
german
bottler
with
whom
i
have
developed
a
close
friendship
come
to
see
me
we
have
a
long
detailed
discussion
of
how
we
could
accomplish
a
one
bottler
strategy
this
time
we
get
it
do
finally
the
consolidation
of
the
german
bottler
system
which
i
have
begin
in
the
mid
s
be
complete
sometimes
change
demand
extreme
patience
bottler
consolidation
have
be
a
common
story
throughout
my
career
but
bring
it
about
in
japan
have
be
extremely
difficult
japan
be
a
very
important
market
for
coca
cola
it
be
one
of
the
most
profitable
in
the
world
primarily
because
of
the
sale
of
coffee
in
can
the
one
million
coca
cola
vend
machine
be
specially
design
to
dispense
hot
drink
in
winter
and
cold
in
summer
it
s
a
really
delicate
trick
to
hold
a
really
hot
can
between
two
finger
and
sip
it
without
burning
your
lip
but
the
japanese
have
master
it
there
be
a
plethora
of
innovative
brand
in
japan
even
the
most
successful
be
only
successful
for
a
year
it
s
an
extremely
competitive
market
and
it
take
a
completely
different
mind
set
to
operate
in
japan
one
of
the
most
difficult
bottler
consolidation
challenge
involve
the
bottler
in
tokyo
own
by
the
takanashi
family
after
year
of
negotiation
the
family
decide
to
sell
a
percent
stake
to
coca
cola
in
when
i
be
ceo
and
chairman
during
final
negotiation
which
i
attend
the
family
member
ask
to
meet
again
the
next
day
that
even
they
go
to
the
grave
of
their
father
and
consult
with
him
the
next
morning
they
sign
the
agreement
slowly
with
all
the
key
piece
of
our
strategy
in
place
we
begin
to
see
strong
and
steady
spike
in
sale
profit
and
dividend
the
stock
topped
far
bolster
morale
for
employee
who
own
coca
cola
stock
and
have
stock
option
which
now
would
actually
be
worth
something
the
financial
crisis
of
set
us
back
but
only
temporarily
and
as
i
write
this
the
stock
price
have
rebound
as
profitability
increase
friction
between
the
bottler
and
north
avenue
begin
to
fizzle
it
s
like
a
marriage
when
a
marriage
be
go
badly
the
partner
fight
over
the
tiniest
of
issue
you
can
find
fault
even
with
how
your
spouse
park
the
car
when
a
marriage
be
go
well
you
might
find
the
spouse
s
car
parking
technique
quite
amuse
and
tease
them
lovingly
about
it
coca
cola
in
the
late
s
have
lose
its
way
muhtar
recall
the
bottler
and
coke
be
fight
over
a
shrink
profit
base
and
a
fading
belief
in
the
power
of
the
brand
we
become
arrogant
muhtar
continued
we
lose
touch
with
the
detail
of
what
make
this
business
work
well
neville
and
i
be
able
to
bring
back
the
belief
that
coca
cola
be
great
and
that
we
can
grow
again
when
you
believe
that
when
you
have
a
growth
model
no
one
quibble
over
try
to
split
something
that
be
shrink
there
be
time
now
and
money
to
look
beyond
profit
to
some
of
the
p
in
the
manifesto
such
as
planet
and
partnership
in
we
agree
along
with
other
beverage
company
to
halt
sale
of
full
caloried
beverage
in
u
s
public
school
an
initiative
launch
by
the
american
heart
association
and
former
president
bill
clinton
first
an
editorial
comment
i
believe
it
s
unfair
to
single
out
the
beverage
industry
for
diabetes
and
obesity
when
i
think
back
on
my
childhood
in
africa
and
the
five
mile
bike
ride
each
way
to
school
and
my
lifelong
participation
in
sport
i
can
t
help
but
believe
that
computer
video
game
television
and
the
lack
of
physical
exercise
might
be
more
responsible
than
soft
drink
for
overweight
schoolchildren
that
say
the
beverage
industry
have
push
too
far
in
the
school
actually
put
soda
machine
not
only
in
high
school
but
in
middle
school
as
well
when
child
be
in
school
their
parent
have
no
control
over
what
they
be
consume
so
in
that
respect
soda
machine
in
school
might
have
interfere
with
a
responsible
parent
s
effort
to
manage
their
child
s
diet
so
coca
cola
and
our
competitor
be
open
to
clinton
s
idea
to
address
this
issue
as
part
of
a
voluntary
program
don
knauss
as
head
of
coca
cola
usa
at
the
time
and
with
whom
i
work
well
present
me
with
a
draft
of
the
agreement
but
it
didn
t
make
sense
to
me
it
call
for
the
withdrawal
of
all
soft
drink
even
diet
soda
clearly
without
sugar
and
calorie
diet
soda
doesn
t
contribute
to
diabetes
or
obesity
at
the
same
time
school
be
go
to
allow
sport
drink
and
juice
drink
both
with
a
full
sugar
content
to
remain
along
with
snack
machine
yet
we
would
have
to
stop
sell
product
with
zero
calorie
the
problem
be
aspartame
the
artificial
sweetener
i
be
told
i
refuse
to
buy
that
argument
this
be
about
calorie
i
say
add
that
there
be
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
health
risk
from
aspartame
even
though
the
rest
of
the
industry
have
approve
the
agreement
i
told
don
i
m
not
go
to
sign
off
on
it
don
agree
to
revisit
the
issue
ten
day
later
i
present
clinton
with
the
j
william
fulbright
prize
for
international
understand
an
award
which
coca
cola
sponsor
after
clinton
arrive
and
we
be
wait
in
the
greenroom
before
go
on
stage
i
notice
the
former
president
be
drinking
a
diet
coke
as
be
his
habit
mr
president
glad
to
see
you
be
still
drinking
diet
coke
i
say
that
s
my
drink
he
reply
it
s
a
terrible
pity
that
kid
be
no
longer
go
to
be
able
to
drink
it
in
high
school
clinton
be
unaware
that
the
agreement
ban
diet
soda
he
agree
that
this
be
illogical
leave
it
with
me
and
i
will
sort
it
out
say
clinton
twenty
four
hour
later

soda
be
back
among
the
allowable
offering
there
be
time
when
as

that
you
must
stand
your
ground
but
luck

of

be
attend
a
rugby
match
between
england
and
ireland
in
dublin
s
croke

of
the

during
the
struggle
for

the
fact
that

an
english
sport
despite
the
fact
that
ireland
played
international
rugby
as
an
integrate
island
with
northern
ireland
which
be
part
of
the

as
if
the

never
take
place
even
so
for
many
year
anyone
who
played
gaelic
football
would
be
ban
from
the
game
for
life
if
caught
inside
a
british
rugby
stadium
such
be
the
complexity
of
ireland
there
be
even
opposition
in

played
there
be
absolute
dead
silence
in
the
stadium
not
a
single
note
of
dissension
among
the
eighty
thousand
fan
it
be
a
moment
of
true
reconciliation
a
truly
historic
moment
i
look
around
the
coca
cola
box
and
almost
to
a
person
everyone
be
cry
grown
men

her
and
her
husband

discuss
the
emotional
power
of
that
day
at
croke
do
you
see
me
as
i
be
leave
the
field
when
i
pause
before
walk
up
the
step
she
ask
the
reason
i
pause
wasn
t
theatrical
my
leg
be
collapse
under
me
i
didn
t
think
i
could
walk
up
the
step
i
be
so
emotional
rugby
have
help
to
change
the
mindset
just
as
it
have
in
south
africa
when
nelson
mandela
employ
it
to
help
unite
the
country
after
the
fall
of
apartheid
as
ceo
i
make
several
nostalgic
trip
back
to
south
africa
as
we
flew
down
on
the
company
plane
i
told
my
executive
assistant
john
brownlee
a
young
african
american
lawyer
that
he
would
find
that
black
and
white
in
south
africa
be
more
integrate
than
they
be
in
the
united
state
he
do
not
believe
me
whatever
bos
brownlee
recall
think
at
the
time
we
even
make
a
small
bet
yet
when
we
board
the
plane
to
return
to
atlanta
john
concede
that
i
be
correct
in
this
perception
after
tour
south
africa
for
the
first
time
he
could
see
the
true
racial
transformation
of
the
post
apartheid
era
and
more
genuine
social
interaction
between
the
race
than
he
be
use
to
he
concede
the
bet
race
continue
however
to
cast
a
shadow
over
south
africa
pamela
and
i
attend
the
academy
award
ceremony
the
year
helen

won
best
actress
for
her
role
in
the
queen
during
a
party
after
the
ceremony
a
photographer

scout
mistook
pamela
for
mirren
and
begin
lead
her
away
to
do
a
television
interview
when
i
discover
the
mistake
i
lead
the
scout
to
the
real
helen
mirren
whom
i
have
spot
a

hold
your
oscar
i
ask
mirren
she
hand
it
to
me
and
i
kiss
her
this
be
one
of
the
perk
of
the
job
and
after
all
all
work
and
no
play
make
jack
a
dull
boy
the
olympics
in
beijing
be
extremely
successful
for
both
coca
cola
and
china
three
year
earlier
i
stood
on
the
great
wall
of
china
as
coca
cola
extend
its
olympic
sponsorship
for
another
twenty
year
the
sponsorship
stretch
back
uninterrupted
to
the
beijing
olympics
however
be
not
without
controversy
i
have
to
address
concern
from
the
actress
mia
farrow
and
others
who
accuse
china
of
bankrolling
darfur
s
genocide
and
demand
coke
cancel
sponsorship
of
the
game
while
farrow
be
raise
money
to
fight
coca
cola
not
one
penny
of
it
be
to
aid
darfur
i
challenged
her
on
this
in
the
medium
but
never
receive
a
reply
china
s
critic
fail
to
realize
that
progress
be
of
necessity
an
evolutionary
process
how
long
do
it
take
for
black
and
woman
to
obtain
the
right
to
vote
in
the
u
s
it
take
generation
a
sad
commentary
on
history
it
s
unrealistic
to
expect
china
s
transformation
to
occur
overnight
as
well
isolate
china
won
t
hasten
that
transformation
during
the
beijing
olympics
as
pamela
and
i
would
leave
event
we
would
shake
the
hand
of
chinese
spectator
look
directly
into
their
eye
and
say
thank
you
the
smile
they
generate
spoke
a
thousand
word
we
become
quite
close
to
our
volunteer
driver
and
guide
a
university
professor
she
spent
a
week
with
us
and
even
brought
her
daughter
to
meet
us
she
described
it
as
the
most
wonderful
week
of
her
life
and
insist
on
give
us
a
farewell
gift
as
we
be
leave
those
be
the
one
on
one
encounter
that
happen
at
the
olympics
that
mia
farrow
never
understood
think
of
the
small
childhood
impression
we
all
have
i
still
remember
the
nigerian
police
officer
who
stayed
with
us
in
ireland
when
i
be
a
child
and
the
time
i
witness
men
flog
with
whip
in
angola
that
create
in
my
young
mind
a
point
of
view
an
enlighten
different
point
of
view
when
our
driver
s
daughter
met
us
she
perhaps
gain
a
different
perception
of
westerner
through
individual
contact
you
break
the
propaganda
machine
journalist
may
write
that
china
have
make
little
progress
in
human
right
it
s
simply
not
true
although
clearly
the
progress
be
not
sufficient
the
change
may
not
be
perceptible
from
our
perspective
but
it
be
real
and
will
quicken
over
time
my
time
as
chairman
and
ceo
begin
to
quickly
come
to
an
end
i
have
promise
pamela
that
i
would
stay
in
the
job
five
year
yet
my
plan
be
to
serve
the
last
year
as
chairman
only
turn
over
the
job
of
ceo
to
my
successor
in
early
i
name
muhtar
who
have
perform
superbly
since
his
return
to
the
company
as
president
of
coca
cola
it
be
clear
then
that
muhtar
would
be
my
successor
although
he
still
have
to
complete
extensive
interview
for
the
job
with
me
and
member
of
the
board
of
director
mary
minnick
decide
to
leave
the
company
but
do
so
with
elegance
on
her
part
and
we
still
remain
in
contact
succession
planning
be
a
crucial
but
often
difficult
challenge
for
large
corporation
one
of
the
tragedy
of
corporate
life
be
that
you
see
a
number
of
embitter
former
ceo
sometimes
it
s
because
they
have
fail
in
their
position
more
often
than
not
however
it
s
because
they
have
stayed
on
far
too
long
in
their
latter
year
they
devote
much
of
their
energy
toward
preserve
their
job
they
don
t
work
on
succession
because
succession
be
a
threat
another
problem
be
that
those
executive
who
be
capable
of
become
successful
ceo
won
t
sit
around
indefinitely
as
second
in
command
they
ll
leave
to
run
their
own
company
somewhere
else
if
their
bos
lingers
too
long
there
be
exception
of
course
such
as
don
keough
who
be
a
powerful
and
effective
leader
as
second
in
command
at
coca
cola
and
be
even
view
by
many
as
a
co
ceo
in
many
company
however
the
long
serve
second
in
command
be
more
of
an
acolyte
than
a
leader
and
be
not
really
qualify
to
take
over
when
the
bos
finally
do
step
down
thus
create
a
poor
succession
as
coca
cola
learn
all
too
painfully
that
can
set
a
company
back
for
year
since
i
have
establish
a
five
year
limit
from
day
one
i
would
not
fall
into
that
trap
of
hang
on
too
long
it
do
mean
however
that
i
have
to
start
look
for
a
successor
almost
immediately
i
be
fortunate
to
have
muhtar
he
be
part
of
the
team
that
help
me
build
the
long
term
strategy
guarantee
continuity
for
the
company
when
i
retire
he
could
take
the
strategy
and
build
it
to
the
next
level
i
retire
for
the
second
time
in
the
spring
of
return
to
the
life
we
have
plan
alternate
between

as
i
hand
over
the
rein
of
the
coca
cola
company
to
muhtar
i
be
often
ask
what
be
go
to
be
your
legacy
my
answer
be
simple
i
do
not
have
a
legacy
unless
my
successor
be
successful
two
year
later
as
i
write
this
book
i
be
confident
i
can
say
mission
accomplish
muhtar
and
i
set
out
to
make
the
transition
seamless
something
that
prove
difficult
to
say
the
least
in
many
previous
one
each
time
i
see
coke
board
member
they
thank
me
for
the
smooth
transition
thanks
to
muhtar
i
be
not
one
of
the
many
embitter
former
ceo
i
have
no
disappointment
in
what
i
achieve
or
what
i
left
behind
i
regret
that
i
do
not
complete
the
cce
merger
but
muhtar
do
and
the
company
will
reap
great
dividend
from
that
in
the
future
it
s
very
comfort
to
see
the
company
in
such
capable
hand
pamela
and
i
be
both
different
people
after
the
five
year
at
the
helm
of
coke
both
more
outwardly
focus
than
we
be
before
my
first
retirement
be
more
of
a
normal
retirement
take
it
easy
and
play
golf
and
travel
now
i
be
much
more
involve
in
world
affair
serve
on
a
number
of
board
include
the
world
wildlife
fund
general
motor
the
investment
climate
facility
for
africa
and
dgm
bank
in
barbados
from
which
i
also
run
my
investment
company
in
the
fall
of
rick
wagoner
then
chairman
and
ceo
of
general
motor
and
george
fisher
the
lead
director
approach
me
about
join
the
board
of
gm
rick
come
to
visit
me
in
atlanta
and
my
driver
met
him
at
the
airport
to
take
him
to
dinner
with
me
the
car
be
a
ford
i
be
well
aware
of
that
as
coca
cola
be
a
ford
customer
a
legacy
of
roberto
goizueta
s
long
tenure
on
the
ford
board
i
could
have
arrange
for
a
gm
car
and
hidden
the
fact
that
i
drove
around
in
a
competitor
s
product
or
let
the
fact
speak
for
themselves
it
be
the
begin
of
a
brief
relationship
with
rick
i
only
join
the
gm
board
in
august
of
as
i
do
not
feel
like
i
could
devote
the
time
i
need
to
until
i
hand
over
the
job
of
ceo
of
coca
cola
to
muhtar
the
saga
of
gm
be
well
document
so
i
will
not
take
a
chapter
of
this
book
to
write
about
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
journey
from
august
to
today
have
encompass
some
of
the
most
fascinate
and
stressful
moment
of
my
business
life
i
do
feel
rick
have
be
criticize
unfairly
in
many
quarter
i
believe
that
he
achieve
a
great
deal
within
the
framework
of
the
art
of
the
possible
however
he
do
not
manage
to
reform
the
bureaucratic
culture
of
the
old
gm
a
huge
task
as
at
least
forty
year
of
layer
by
committee
and
internal
board
meant
a
lack
of
accountability
and
a
slow
decision
make
process
with
the
financial
meltdown
the
task
clearly
become
nearly
impossible
and
much
as
we
try
to
avoid
bankruptcy
eventually
only
the
government
on
its
term
could
save
gm
that
rick
s
resignation
be
demand
by
president
obama
be
initially
something
i
felt
be
wrong
and
yet
i
have
to
recognize
that
the
new
majority
owner
have
the
right
to
demand
this
i
also
have
to
cross
a
philosophical
bridge
regard
government
ownership
of
a
private
company
this
be
a
black
swan
event
and
there
be
no
question
in
my
mind
today
that
it
be
not
only
the
right
decision
for
gm
but
also
for
the
u
s
economy
exception
sometimes
trump
rule
for
the
rule
be
drawn
for
more
normal
parameter
i
join
gm
because
it
be
an
iconic
company
like
coca
cola
and
i
be
proud
to
serve
on
its
board
today
after
the
trauma
of
bankruptcy
clearly
the
massive
change
which
gm
need
have
be
significantly
enable
by
the
leadership
of
ed
whitaker
and
now
dan
akerson
the
mission
be
simple
design
build
and
sell
the
world
s
best
car
no
mention
of
market
share
global
leadership
or
even
profit
margin
fulfill
the
mission
and
everything
fall
into
its
correct
bucket
one
final
comment
the
new
generation
of
great
car
now
appear
predate
the
bankruptcy
the
hire
of
bob
lutz
by
rick
wagoner
be
a
real
shock
to
its
system
bob
be
a
car
guy
not
a
bean
counter
as
he
put
it
he
assemble
a
great
team
with
visionary
designer
lead

that

paul

from
to
be
also
a
visionary
a
harvard
educate
lawyer
who
compete
as
a

in

austin
believe
coca

have
an
obligation
to
fight
world
hunger
he
create
the
company
s
nutrition
project
that
developed
three
protein
rich
drink
saci
samson
and

which
be
sell
in
south
america
and
africa
as
a
young
coke
employee
in
zambia
in
the
s
i
participate
in
a
trial
run
of
saci
i
be
very
enthusiastic
about
the
project
see
it
as
a
way
for
coca
cola
to
make
a
big
dent
in
world
hunger
in
a
commercial
humanitarian
government
joint
effort
i
soon
realize
however
there
be
a
few
problem
saci
be
too
expensive
and
there
be
no
way
we
could
make
a
profit
we
do
the
test
on
a
subsidize
basis
hop
in
the
future
to
find
a
low
cost
that
never
happen
because
another
lesson
be
learn
it
taste
awful
and
no
one
want
to
drink
it
it
clung
to
your
pallet
and
have
a
terrible
aftertaste
something
may
be
good
for
you
but
if
it
doesn
t
taste
good
you
re
not
go
to
consume
it
we
would
distribute
it
to
school
and
other
location
and
even
when
hand
out
free
of
charge
it
wasn
t
consume
decade
later
as
ceo
i
explore
the
possibility
that
new
technology
would
allow
us
to
create
a
similar
product
with
a
well
flavor
but
it
didn
t
work
despite
its
flaw
austin
believe
that
the
program
be
morally
correct
and
good
for
business
in
the
long
term
and
deserves
credit
for
make
the
effort
austin
also
realize
that
water
would
continue
to
be
a
worldwide
issue
for
coca
cola
the
company
under
his
leadership
purchase
aqua
chem
which
make
equipment
to
remove
salt
from
seawater
although
coca
cola
sell
aqua
chem
in
austin
be
clearly
decade
ahead
of
his
time
in
put
coca
cola
on
an
environmentally
sustainable
path
he
realize
that
coca
cola
could
not
simply
extract
profit
it
have
to
improve
the
society
in
which
its
customer
live
critic
argue
that
these
effort
be
diversion
from
coca
cola
s
core
business
mission
and
from
a
business
standpoint
they
be
correct
yet
unlike
coke
s
purchase
of
columbia
picture
austin
s
effort
be
motivate
by
large
issue
than
profit
alone
he
believe
that
coca
cola
have
the
ability
to
become
a
major
player
in
the
fight
to
clean
the
planet
and
fight
world
hunger
in
that
regard
he
be
prescient
the
more
money
we
make
the
less
welcome
we
become
austin
write
to
woodruff
in
when
i
read
that
quote
i
can
t
help
but
remember
maurice
gersh
the
coca
cola
bottler
in
zambia
who
first
hire
me
shortly
after
i
graduate
from
college
gersh
be
not
only
the
coke
bottler
in
kitwe
but
be
also
the
town
s
mayor
it
must
have
be
very
difficult
for
anyone
in
kitwe
to
feel
as
if
coca
cola
be
a
strange
foreign
company
unwelcome
in
their
town
when
the
mayor
himself
be
a
franchisee
that
kind
of
connectivity
eliminates
corporate
estrangement
a
company
can
t
easily
hide
from
society
and
its
problem
when
the
two
be
so
closely
meld
in
order
to
remain
economically
competitive
coca
cola
and
many
other
company
have
by
necessity
consolidated
many
of
these
small
outpost
which
have
those
strong
and
vital
tie
to
the
community
i
think
back
to
germany
where
i
devote
much
time
and
energy
whittle
down
the
number
of
bottler
from
more
than
a
hundred
to
one
it
have
to
be
do
if
coke
be
to
remain
competitive
as
a
company
the
small
bottler
be
built
at
a
time
when
capital
be
hard
to
come
by
most
store
be
small
and
transportation
cost
be
high
because
there
be
few
major
highway
and
many
bridge
have
be
destroyed
during
the
war
with
the
advent
of
supermarket
and
interstate
highway
small
bottler
no
longer
make
economic
sense
and
threaten
coca
cola
s
ability
to
offer
low
cost
profitable
product
the
reason
that
the
cost
of
coke
when
adjust
for
inflation
be
low
now
than
it
be
decade
ago
be
directly
related
to
the
high
efficiency
achieve
through
bottler
consolidation
while
consolidation
be
necessary
i
regret
that
we
lose
the
connection
the
bottler
have
with
their
local
community
these
connection
be
so
strong
that
even
the
promise
of
million
in
extra
profit
be
not
enough
to
convince
some
german
bottler
to
sell
their
plant
it
be
prestigious
to
be
the
coca
cola
bottler
in
your
community
and
with
that
prestige
be
the
obligation
to
be
a
civic
and
moral
leader
the
question
now
be
within
today
s
global
corporate
structure
what
be
the
opportunity
for
the
modern
day
equivalent
of
maurice
gersh
they
be
actually
far
great
than
they
be
in
maurice
s
time
as
the
mayor
of
kitwe
and
the
local
bottler
he
have
strong
tie
to
the
community
but
do
not
have
the
chance
to
participate
in
the
much
large
sweep
campaign
of
today
such
as
a
worldwide
fight
against
malaria
restore
critical
watershed
or
help
mango
farmer
in
haiti
follow
a
devastate
earthquake
today
a
corporate
executive
can
do
this
and
much
more
it
be
connect
capitalism
on
a
much
large
scale
the
corporate
leader
of
yesterday
work
closely
with
government
and
nonprofit
on
a
local
level
there
be
civic
club
and
fund
raise
drive
for
new
hospital
and
other
worthy
cause
today
s
equivalent
might
be
partnership
with
the
world
wildlife
fund
or
the
united
nation
the
project
could
be
a
local
hospital
or
one
thousand
mile
away
in
africa
so
the
corporate
option
for
affect
major
change
be
actually
far
great
than
they
be
in
the
time
of
maurice
gersh
i
be
train
in
college
to
be
a
social
worker
yet
chose
a
path
in
business
as
corporation
evolve
i
have
a
far
great
opportunity
at
coca
cola
to
affect
true
social
change
globally
than
i
ever
would
have
as
a
social
worker
in
africa
capitalism
now
provide
that
opportunity
no
longer
be
the
line
drawn
so
distinctly
much
have
be
write
about
corporate
social
responsibility
a
movement
which
have
motivate
company
to
do
many
great
thing
my
vision
for
connect
capitalism
advocate
go
much
far
to
create
a
meld
a
true
marriage
between
government
nonprofit
and
global
corporation
to
fight
disease
and
poverty
heal
the
planet
improve
education
and
ultimately
boost
private
sector
profit
corporate
social
responsibility
sometimes
involves
a
pet
project
single
out
by
the
ceo
or
the
ceo
s
spouse
these
be
often
worthy
project
but
not
always
directly
link
to
the
company
s
core
business
strategy
or
the
impact
the
business
have
on
society
connect
capitalism
be
much
broader
it
be
the
creation
of
the
socially
responsible
corporation
which
examines
the
company
s
actual
footprint
on
society
and
focus
on
how
as
part
of
a
core
business
strategy
it
can
reduce
the
negative
impact
if
you
be
make
a
profit
through
excessive
use
or
extraction
of
the
world
s
resource
you
have
an
issue
that
need
to
be
address
you
have
to
become
a
well
caretaker
of
those
resource
it
s
in
the
best
interest
of
the
shareholder
and
of
society
to
do
so
a
clear
example
be
that
neither
coca
cola
nor
the
community
where
it
operates
can
survive
for
long
without
adequate
water
their
destiny
be
directly
link
that
be
why
coca
cola
now
have
a
vice
president
for
environment
and
water
resource
jeff

currently
hold
this

position

force
and
help
negotiate
the
kyoto
protocol
the
term
corporate
social
responsibility
carry
with
it
a
slight
tone
of
penance
almost
as
if
company
owe
society
a
debt
for
make
a
profit
that
be
not
really
the
core
issue
there
should
be
no
shame
in
make
a
profit
as
long
be
it
earn
in
a
socially
responsible
way
in
my
career
i
saw
how
coca
cola
pull
million
of
people
out
of
poverty
throughout
the
world
when
other
effort
have
fail
afghanistan
be
one
tell
example
in
when
i
be
chairman
and
ceo
coca
cola
open
a
million
bottle
plant
in
kabul
create
job
a
critic
say
the
million
would
have
be
well
spent
on
a
hospital
my
question
be
this
without
job
without
business
how
would
the
hospital
be
able
to
sustain
itself
where
would
the
money
come
from
to
pay
the
doctor
and
maintain
the
building
a
thrive
coca
cola
bottle
plant
can
help
support
that
hospital
through
donation
and
through
tax
paid
by
the
company
its
employee
and
its
vendor
with
job
worker
can
afford
to
pay
for
medical
treatment
without
capitalism
the
hospital
would
rely
forever
on
handout
an
unsustainable
model
as
the
three
key
element
of
the
triangle
of
sustainability
business
nonprofit
and
government
work
more
closely
together
in
the
future
there
should
be
an
acknowledgment
of
the
strength
each
brings
to
the
table
business
brings
efficiency
and
profit
and
that
be
not
something
of
which
we
should
be
ashamed
people
be
often
amaze
at
how
coca
cola
manages
to
deliver
its
product
to
the
most
remote
location
of
the
world
i
remember
in
zambia
vendor
would
load
case
of
coke
in
dugout
canoe
and
row
deep
into
the
wilderness
where
they
would
post
a
coca
cola
sign
and
sell
cold
drink
the
secret
to
the
coca
cola
distribution
method
be
that
everyone
along
the
way
from
start
to
finish
make
a
profit
it
may
be
a
tiny
profit
but
it
be
a
profit
nonetheless
and
that
drive
efficiency
tom
mattia
who
work
for
me
as
a
senior
vice
president
when
i
be
ceo
once
tracked
a
case
of
coke
in
kenya
from
start
to
finish
the
last
transaction
be
a
goat
he
recall
they
trade
a
baby
goat
for
a
case
of
coke
in
march
melinda
gate
visit
a
coca
cola
microdistribution
center
in
nairobi
specifically
to
learn
how
the
strength
of
the
company
s
system
could
be
apply
in
the
health
care
field
she
be
amaze
with
the
efficiency
of
the
operation
and
coke
s
use
of
real
time
data
the
sale
staff
in
the
field
relay
order
by
text
message
to
the
distribution
center
and
the
information
be
store
in
a
database
what
lesson
from
this
incredible
data
gathering
could
we
apply
to
health
care
melinda
ask
in
a
blog
post
about
the
trip
there
be
lesson
to
be
learn
from
every
sector
and
we
need
to
be
willing
to
look
far
and
wide
for
solution
to
the
challenge
we
face
in
health
and
development
so
many
effort
by
nonprofit
involve
distribute
food
vaccine
and
other
vital
supply
to
the
world
s
most
remote
location
can
company
like
coke
with
their
unequalled
distribution
system
help
in
this
effort
yes
could
they
do
it
free
yes
but
that
be
not
a
sustainable
model
one
that
would
work
over
the
long
term
would
be
to
develop
a
system
that
involves
a
profit
for
everyone
in
the
chain
could
the
men
in
the
dugout
canoe
in
zambia
also
deliver
condom
and
medicine
perhaps
and
they
could
likely
make
the
delivery
at
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
a
stand
alone
delivery
system
first
however
we
have
to
embrace
business
as
part
of
the
three
way
partnership
recognize
and
respect
what
business
be
and
what
it
do
a
business
be
not
by
definition
a
philanthropic
entity
nor
should
it
be
but
be
strive
in
its
own
interest
to
be
a
generator
of
long
term
sustainable
profit
corporation
therefore
be
like
any
other
organism
they
have
to
operate
sustainably
if
they
be
to
last
coca
cola
have
be
in
business
for
year
if
it
s
to
last
for
another
year
it
have
to
maintain
a
business
strategy
that
be
sustainable
over
the
long
term
you
the
reader
have
see
in
this
book
the
many
trial
and
tribulation
of
a
modern
corporation
the
extreme
pressure
to
remain
competitive
and
how
quickly
company
can
fall
apart
think
back
to
the
comment
from
david
rubenstein
the
investment
banker
when
coke
s
market
cap
have
drop
to
billion
well
that
s
a
bit
out
of
our
reach
for
now
he
say
if
a
corporation
allows
its
stock
price
to
dip
too
low
and
becomes
the
target
of
a
leveraged
buyout
it
loses
control
of
its
own
future
and
risk
be
broken
up
and
sell
in
part
if
that
happens
the
corporation
end
up
have
to
fight
for
its
life
as
oppose
to
assist
in
the
fight
against
malaria
or
aid
or
preserve
critical
water
basin
extreme
corporate
critic
wonder
why
we
don
t
simply
donate
most
if
not
at
all
of
our
profit
to
the
world
s
great
cause
the
reason
be
simply
because
we
would
not
be
around
for
long
if
we
do
so
in
my
vision
of
connect
capitalism
you
have
both
high
profit
and
progress
the
two
do
not
conflict
in
fact
one
demand
the
other
obviously
corporate
profit
increase
over
the
long
term
if
unemployment
rate
drop
from
percent
the
current
number
in
many
country
to
even
percent
if
the
population
be
healthier
and
more
educate
yes
company
make
more
money
and
can
do
even
more
to
improve
society
remember
that
in
disease
ravage
country
local
company
also
suffer
from
the
dire
consequence
of
epidemic
lose
valuable
employee
to
such
illness
as
aid
and
malaria
company
have
a
direct
and
vested
interest
in
the
fight
against
such
disease
there
be
many
other
immediate
benefit
from
capitalism
that
be
connect
tom
mattia
recall
a
bottler
in
africa
who
realize
that
the
local
villager
be
get
sick
from
drinking
water
out
of
a
pollute
river
decide
to
drill
two
well
the
cost
be
equal
to
a
one
way
ticket
from
johannesburg
to
atlanta
tom
say
besides
be
use
for
drinking
the
well
water
be
also
use
to
irrigate
crop
as
a
result
of
the
well
sickness
decline
and
farm
income
increase
and
as
the
community
s
fortune
improve
so
do
sale
of
coca
cola
it
be
a
perfect
example
of
connect
capitalism
government
and
nonprofit
should
approach
corporate
partnership
with
this
type
of
think
company
should
not
be
consider
as
passive
partner
simply
write
check
which
they
can
then
tout
in
their
annual
report
and
press
release
just
as
corporation
should
begin
to
think
more
like
nonprofit
so
nonprofit
should
think
more
like
business
they
should
look
for
opportunity
that
will
allow
company
to
both
increase
profit
and
improve
the
world
this
be
not
just
about
money
it
s
about
skill
engagement
and
intellectual
capital
only
when
company
be
financially
healthy
and
move
in
an
upward
trajectory
can
they
seriously
engage
in
long
term
partnership
if
an
ngo
have
approach
coca
cola
in
the
early
day
of
my
tenure
as
ceo
they
would
have
come
across
a
different
far
more
stress
version
of
myself
than
in
the
later
year
when
we
do
expand
major
partnership
in
the
early
day
my
focus
be
on
right
the
ship
only
later
when
these
effort
prove
successful
could
i
seriously
entertain
the
notion
of
expand
the
company
s
involvement
in
project
such
as
dig
well
the
point
be
that
corporation
have
to
succeed
before
they
can
help
others
the
adage
to
do
good
you
must
do
well
be
entirely
accurate
it
be
vital
for
ngo
to
understand
that
and
to
approach
corporation
with
idea
and
proposal
that
be
design
with
this
in
mind
the
best
corporate
partnership
in
fact
the
only
sustainable
one
be
those
which
be
focus
on
a
company
s
core
business
for
coca
cola
the
most
important
issue
be
water
since
that
be
a
key
ingredient
in
all
of
our
product
it
be
not
difficult
even
for
stock
analyst
to
understand
the
relevance
and
importance
of
spending
million
of
dollar
on
this
issue
when
challenged
at
an
analyst
meeting
all
i
have
to
do
be
hold
up
a
can
of
coke
to
illustrate
the
importance
of
that
key
ingredient
i
be
never
challenged
again
our
bottler
also
clearly
understand
how
crucial
these
effort
be
cchbc
the
european
bottler
i
once
ran

work
to
preserve
the

why
the
river
run
through
most
of
the
country
in
the
cchbc
territory
once
a
company
have
establish
partnership
in
its
core
area
it
can
then
begin
expand
to
other

from
the

day
to

business
operation
the
new

much
different
as
carter
robert

of
the

explains
today
ngo

them
to
use
less
energy
water
and
land
and
to
reduce
carbon
emission
as
part
of
a
long
term
business
strategy
that
will
ultimately
improve
profit
it
s
not
about
throw
a
little
bit
of
money
at
an
ngo
or
an
environmental
group
carter
say
the
old
fashion

look
at

more
as
enemy
than
partner
say
carter
under
the
new

be
change
carter

step
to
do
so
in
their

i
ve
always

that
these

don

work

my

with
an
ngo
which
endorse
the
many
germinal
thought
i
have
about
business
and

work
together

for
many
year
and
be
to
become
a
good
friend
of
mine
iblf
be
a
new
model
and
a
breakout
model
it
promotes
corporate
profitability
and
community
sustainability
at
the
same
time
acknowledge
that
the
two
do
not
have
to
conflict
i
left
the
iblf
board
when
i
retire
the
first
time
in
but
return
after
much
persuasion
to
chair
the
board
in
after
i
have
return
to
coca

sadly
robert
davy
fell
ill
and
die
the
follow
year
what
have
be
for
me
a
role
of
support
a
dynamic
leader
and
attend
two
board
meeting
a
year
one
with
prince
charles
become
a
very
stressful
experience
as
i
be
then
chairman
and
ceo
of
the
coca
cola
company
robert
have
present
to
the
board
a
new
logo
design
which
reduce
the
profile
of
the
word
prince
of
wale
he
d
convince
us
that
the
change
come
with
the
blessing
of
the
prince
and
that
he
be
happy
for
the
iblf
to
start
take
a
more
independent
route
i
be
later
told
by
another
participant
in
a
meeting
with
the
prince
that
this
be
not
in
fact
the
case
at
the
same
time
the
private
secretary
of
the
prince
have
begin
an
exercise
in
examine
the
many
disparate
organization
the
prince
have
found
not
only
to
allow
the
prince
to
focus
more
closely
on
his
philanthropic
enterprise
but
also
to
improve
the
profile
of
the
extensive
interest
and
commitment
he
displayed
i
attend
a
few
workshop
with
leader
of
the
other
organization
and
an
effective
model
be
develop
i
be
shock
however
to
receive
a
letter
from
the
prince
say
he
want
to
merge
the
iblf
with
business
in
the
community
an
organization
he
d
found
in
the
united
kingdom
that
promotes
corporate
social
responsibility
the
iblf
have
be
split
off
from
business
in
the
community
when
it
be
decide
they
be
very
different
organization
they
still
be
very
different
iblf
operates
solely
outside
the
uk
in
develop
market
and
have
a
somewhat
rural
focus
work
with
major
multinational
company
business
in
the
community
be
uk
base
and
mostly
urban
with
a
medium
size
industry
base
one
of
the
issue
with
merge
the
group
be
that
some
of
the
uk
base
company
be
member
of
both
organization
a
merger
would
obviously
significantly
reduce
revenue
since
those
company
would
not
pay
the
fee
twice
the
prince
be
determine
to
make
the
merger
happen
in
the
meeting
i
have
with
him
and
a
far
one
with
the
head
of
the
board
of
trustee
of
business
in
the
community
sir
stuart
rise
then
the
executive
chairman
of
retailer
mark
spencer
i
achieve
an
agreement
to
have
a
major
consult
firm
evaluate
the
proposal
the
study
clearly
show
that
the
financial
risk
be
too
great
and
that
the
original
logic
for
separate
organization
still
held
the
operating
head
of
business
in
the
community
who
would
ultimately
run
the
merge
organization
told
me
he
could
not
disagree
with
the
study
but
still
believe
that
the
merger
should
take
place
it
be
clear
the
prince
s
office
be
apply
a
great
deal
of
pressure
on
him
to
complete
what
i
believe
be
in
fact
a
takeover
i
thought
however
that
i
have
the
support
of
sir
stuart
who
endorse
the
study
in
a
meeting
at
his
office
and
state
that
he
would
support
the
recommendation
a
week
later
sir
stuart
phone
me
to
say
he
have
change
his
mind
there
be
additional
tension
with
the
prince
his
office
oppose
the
person
select
by
the
iblf
search
committee
to
succeed
robert
davy
i
endorse
the
candidate
the
iblf
board
go
ahead
and
appoint
him
anyway
despite
the
prince
s
objection
which
be
fully
within
their
right
since
the
trustee
have
complete
oversight
of
the
charity
and
not
the
prince
however
it
have
be
customary
for
the
prince
to
give
his
nod
on
major
decision
as
we
disagreed
this
time
it
make
for
another
unhappy
meeting
with
prince
charles
during
my
last
formal
meeting
with
the
prince
he
told
me
his
wish
be
that
the
merger
take
place
i
told
him
my
board
of
trustee
could
not
vote
for
it
there
be
a
rather
chilly
and
formal
farewell
and
a
few
week
later
a
letter
arrive
in
which
prince
charles
inform
me
he
be
withdraw
his
patronage
we
be
now
the
international
leader
business
forum
no
prince
of
wale
this
i
believe
in
retrospect
be
where
robert
davy
be
head
but
i
would
not
have
support
him
as
i
still
favor
prince
charles
s
involvement
my
opposition
to
the
merger
as
i
try
to
point
out
to
the
prince
be
something
i
believe
passionately
be
in
his
interest
for
me
to
have
agree
would
have
be
very
easy
with
all
that
i
have
on
my
plate
at
coca
cola
one
less
involvement
would
have
be
welcome
oppose
the
merger
also
ate
up
a
large
amount
of
my
time
and
be
an
unwelcome
diversion
the
prince
in
my
view
be
very
well
meaning
and
while
i
do
not
agree
with
him
on
every
issue
he
continue
to
be
see
as
be
ahead
of
his
time
particularly
on
environmental
issue
however
he
be
a
future
king
very
strong
will
and
very
use
to
get
his
own
way
those
surround
him
be
evaluate
on
how
they
meet
his
need
and
in
my
view
do
not
always
challenge
him
enough
the
old
way
of
the
court
still
hold
i
suppose
i
should
also
say
that
i
have
a
stubborn
streak
myself
so
ours
be
a
relationship
in
which
two
will
collide
needle
to
say
my
christmas
card
from
the
prince
be
no
more
i
take
no
pleasure
in
this
story
in
that
the
struggle
to
keep
the
identity
of
the
iblf
be
difficult
some
member
left
as
a
result
of
the
removal
of
the
royal
patronage
but
the
situation
have
since
stabilize
in
i
hand
over
the
leadership
to
mark
foster
who
work
in
london
i
d
found
it
difficult
to
manage
the
organization
from
the
distance
of
barbados
in
retrospect
the
big
and
most
stressful
point
in
my
tenure
at
iblf
which
really
complicate
everything
be
that
robert
davy
s
replacement
whom
i
support
do
not
work
out
on
that
issue
the
prince
have
be
right
and
i
have
be
wrong
what
s
the
message
from
the
previous
story
in
high
profile
high
stake
partnership
conflict
come
with
the
territory
and
you
must
be
able
to
get
through
them
without
jeopardizing
the
great
mission

often
the
partnership
that
address
climate
change
and
other
broad
issue
be
large
and
extensive
then
there
be
the
much
small
but
also
very
important
effort
that
connect
company
ngo
and
government
many
of
which
do
not
involve
money
at
all
just
as
ngo
and
government
have
large
toolbox
of
knowledge
and
expertise
so
do
corporation
in
the
marriage
that
be
connect
capitalism
these

around

understands
the
value
of
what

could
offer
after
all

just
like
corporation
have
to
remain
efficient
and

they

in

darfur
and
indonesia
care
allow
ups
executive
full
access
to
its
operation
an
unusual
openness
that
at
the
same
time
drew
the
two
organization
closer
together
herzog
discover
that
care
have
no
computerize
database
of
its
supply
which
be
store
all
over
the
world
instead
each
care
office
maintain
its
own
inventory
list
on
spreadsheet
which
be
locate
on
the
hard
drive
of
individual
computer
herzog
also
found
that
care
need
to
expand
the
scope
of
its
centralize
purchasing
system
for
supply
such
as
tent
and
bottle
water
the
agency
have
no
program
for
prepositioning
those
supply
throughout
the
world
so
that
they
could
be
transport
more
easily
to
disaster
site
more
trouble
to
herzog
be
the
fact
that
care
have
very
little
unrestricted
funding
that
could
be
use
not
for
a
particular
disaster
such
as
an
earthquake
in
haiti
but
to
increase
the
company
s
long
term
efficiency
for
example
care
have
little
money
to
buy
supply
at
volume
discount
long
before
a
disaster
hit
which
would
have
lower
cost
tremendously
since
price
of
supply
always
jump
immediately
follow
a
catastrophe
donor
however
normally
want
their
money
sent
directly
to
the
disaster
they
be
watch
unfold
on
their
television
screen
it
s
harder
to
raise
fund
for
longer
term
project
with
help
from
aidmatrix
a
texas
base
ngo
herzog
and
care
developed
a
computer
system
that
would
allow
it
to
track
supply
worldwide
in
real
time
ups
have
also
donate
money
to
aidmatrix
care
s
new
database
be
test
in
sri
lanka
and
haiti
and
be
now
be
roll
out
worldwide
herzog
and
care
be
expand
the
centralize
purchasing
system
why
would
i
have
seventy
country
buying
fifteen
toyota
each
when
you
could
buy
all
of
them
at
one
time
and
maybe
get
a
big
discount
ask
herzog
interestingly
as
care
and
ups
work
together
in
a
partnership
that
be
not
center
around
money
the
relationship
strengthen
and
ups
increase
its
cash
donation
from
a
year
to
million
that
be
the
power
of
engagement
some
of
the
extra
dollar
will
go
toward
the
prepositioning
of
relief
supply
deem
so
important
but
at
the
same
time
so
difficult
to
fund
through
donor
dollar
how
do
ups
benefit
from
its
connection
with
care
it
be
now
deeply
involve
in
the
humanitarian
relief
arena
which
be
constantly
shipping
supply
worldwide
there
be
billion
of
dollar
of
freight
move
and
maybe
percent
of
the
shipping
be
donate
say
herzog
there
be
a
corporate
citizenship
within
ups
that
just
want
to
do
what
s
right
we
can
help
people
in
way
that
many
people
can
t
there
s
also
a
commercial
aspect
of
this
it
s
a
large
space
that
ups
have
not
be
in
it
be
reasonable
to
expect
that
as
ups
build
its
reputation
in
the
humanitarian
relief
community
through
its
work
with
care
that
ups
s
profit
will
also
increase
and
its
profit
be
be
use
to
help
fund
care
the
relationship
be
circular
a
wonderful
example
of
connect
capitalism
and
like
all
successful
partnership
it
continue
to
grow
currently
the
partner
be
work
on
a
paperless
distribution
system
for
relief

it

the

why
capitalism
why
do
these

the

in
two
word
sustainability
and

donation
come
and
go
but
if
a
company
be
well
run
profit
will
be
always
be
there
and
will
sustain
the
effort
over
the
long
term
with
billion
people
in
the
world
living
without
electricity
private
investment
capital
make
it
much
faster
for
d
light
to
attack
the
problem
broadly
and
quickly
cheng
tozun
say
ngo
have
be
try
to
address
this
for
a
quite
a
number
of
year
now
and
have
do
the
best
they
could
with
the
resource
they
have
she
say
really
no
nonprofit
organization
that
be
address
light
in
the
develop
world
have
be
able
to
scale
they
be
able
to
do
little
project
here
and
there
with
maybe
one
village
or
a
few
hundred
home
and
then
they
run
out
of
money
we
really
felt
like
that
if
we
want
to
address
this
need
on
a
global
scale
at
a
level
at
which
we
could
actually
make
an
impact
we
need
a
business
model
to
be
sustainable
to
not
rely
on
donation
dollar
and
to
be
scalable
investment
capital
allow
the
company
to
launch
very
quickly
and
to
build
a
factory
in
china
to
produce
lantern
in
large
volume
which
allow
an
economy
of
scale
that
then
make
the
product
less
expensive
the
company
open
sale
office
in
india
and
tanzania
within
a
few
month
of
its
launch
in
in
less
than
three
year
of
operation
d
light
have
serve
three
million
customer
sell
the
lantern
rather
than
give
them
away
also
change
the
dynamic
with
the
customer
in
a
positive
way
cheng
tozun
add
when
you
have
an
ngo
that
be
provide
free
service
or
even
very
heavily
subsidize
service
then
the
customer
become
passive
recipient
she
say
our
customer
be
empower
we
need
to
give
them
exactly
the
kind
of
product
that
they
need
and
want
and
be
willing
to
pay
for
if
we
don
t
make
the
product
they
want
they
be
go
to
vote
with
their
dollar
we
provide
warranty
on
our
product
we
have
customer
service
line
we
have
center
set
up
so
that
if
they
have
a
problem
with
our
product
they
can
come
in
and
get
it
fix
or
exchange
it
we
feel
like
that
be
a
much
healthier
dynamic
than
if
we
be
an
ngo
d
light
do
work
with
ngo
to
distribute
lantern
for
disaster
relief
and
in
area
where
the
people
be
simply
too
poor
to
buy
them
yet
the
majority
of
the
company
s
sale
be
through
open
market
channel
i
have
include
the
story
of
d
light
not
to
denigrate
in
any
way
the
great
work
that
ngo
be
do
throughout
the
world
but
only
to
illustrate
that
capitalism
can
also
work
wonder
particularly
when
company
and
ngo
combine
their
effort
government
however
be
in
many
case
lag
behind
corporation
and
nonprofit
in
forge
partnership
many
government
still
believe
that
the
way
to
solve
problem
be
simply
to
pas
more
law
they
have
not
learn
that
the
most
effective
strategy
be
to
work
together
with
business
and
ngo
to
develop
program
that
benefit
all
three
party
that
be
start
to
change
i
cochair
along
with
benjamin
mkapa
former
president
of
tanzania
a
nonprofit

to
improve
the

climate
in

and
foster

growth
it
be
work
i
have
witness
the
result
of
the
effort
firsthand
you
can
now
register
a

as

rwanda
be

it

a
one

and
you

also
register
your

online
we
have
also
work
to
improve
commercial
court
of

in
africa
so
that
business
can
have
a
fast
efficient
venue
for
resolve
dispute
we
have
help
government
convert
their
court
from
paper
to
digital
technology
increase
accuracy
and
speed
and
greatly
reduce
backlog
a
land
transfer
in
burkina
faso
once
require
something
like
seventeen
signature
it
now
require
only
seven
these
be
example
of
accomplishment
that
can
be
duplicate
around
the
world
with
partnership
with
connect
capitalism
critic
will
point
to
disaster
such
as
the
british
petroleum
oil
spill
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
as
an
example
of
how
capitalism
be
rapacious
and
put
profit
above
the
planet
and
all
else
bp
after
all
be
big
on
sustainability
it
spent
billion
to
promote
low
carbon
alternative
to
oil
such
as
biofuels
and
wind
power
yet
the
benefit
of
those
effort
and
a
company
s
credibility
can
be
wipe
out
instantly
with
a
major
mistake
such
as
the
gulf
oil
spill
connect
capitalism
be
not
a
front
that
forgives
all
other
corporate
sin
the
compact
demand
that
all
participant
government
ngo
and
business
act
responsibly
or
the
partnership
will
collapse
act
responsibly
be
also
something
that
corporation
must
do
to
ensure
their
own
long
term
survival
and
the
survival
of
the
capitalist
system
that
allows
them
to
flourish
bp
and
its
stockholder
paid
dearly
for
the
oil
spill
both
financially
and
in
the
damage
to
the
brand
the
mistake
played
directly
into
the
hand
of
those
who
oppose
capitalism
and
be
look
for
any
excuse
to
attack
it
company
have
to
be
see
as
add
value
to

otherwise
you
have
populist
politician
who
stand
up

do
what
hugo
ch
vez
do
in
venezuela
the
reason
there
be
a
ch

be
that
the

leader
in
venezuela
be
essentially
robber
baron
they
do
not

cuba

and
there
be
many
other
example
frankly
it
would
have
be
difficult
to
find
many
people
to
stand
up
in
support
of
bp
after
the

in

some

i
have
see
the
system
that
could
not
even
produce
paper
cup
for
soda
machine
and
the
mind
set
of
well
meaning
and
hardworking
citizen
who
yearn
for
a
well
life
for
themselves
and
their
child
but
be
so
beaten
down
by
the
system
that
their
talent
and
energy
be
largely
waste
i
have
also
see
socialism
s
toll
on
my
beloved
africa
if
capitalism
fails
it
will
be
because
we
the
capitalist
have
let
the
people
down
it
will
happen
only
if
we
allow
our
company
to
become
disconnect
from
the
society
they
serve
in
the
future
corporation
will
increasingly
be
judged
not
only
by
customer
but
by
investor
not
just
on
the
quality
of
our
product
or
their
profit
but
also
on
our
value
and
how
we
holistically
add
value
to
the
world
that
be
go
to
be
a
significant
measure
stick
as
to
whether
or
not
people
invest
in
a
company
this
will
not
necessarily
be
motivate
by
a
desire
by
investor
to
solve
world
social
problem
instead
it
will
prompt
by
a
grow
belief
among
investor
that
in
order
to
survive
long
term
as
profitable
concern
corporation
will
have
to
start
think
and
act
in
a
socially
responsible
way
investor
be
realize
that
if
company
alienate
the
society
in
which
they
operate
if
they
destroy
the
environment
sap
precious
natural
resource
and
ignore
major
social
problem
they
will
alienate
their
customer
and
ultimately
fail
a
broad
range
of
investor
be
go
to
say
for
the
longevity
of
your
business
i
want
to
be
sure
you
be
sustainable
as
a
business
and
you
be
operating
in
a
sustainable
manner
only
in
that
way
will
we
be
able
to
attract
consumer
and
remain
viable
company
over
time
and
just
as
society
expect
big
corporation
to
do
more
so
will
the
big
company
expect
more
from
their
supplier
prompt
a
chain
reaction
the
answer
be
neither
socialism
nor
the
reckless
capitalism
that
lead
to
the
world
financial
collapse
in
and
the
bp
oil
spill
in
the
answer
be
connect
capitalism
eighteenth

philosopher
adam

once
say
it
be
not
from
the
benevolence
of
the
butcher
the
brewer
or
the
baker
that
we
expect
our
dinner
but
from
their
regard
for
their
own
interest
in
the
complex
economy
of
the
future
business
interest
and
society
s
interest
will

more
closely

will
have
to
be
connect
or
it
will
not
survive
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
say
that
write
this
book
have
be
a
positive
catharsis
it
have
make
me
realize
how
truly
lucky

born
to
the
most
care

who
create
the
opportunity
to
explore
the
world
both
physically
and
intellectually

eight

a
wonderful
nuclear
family

and
our
real
joy
our
grandson

i
have
visit
country
met
and
sup
with
men
and
woman
of
history
and
just
as
important
spent
time
with
people
of
many
culture
at
every
level
of
economic
status
it
be
a
life
i
could
live
all
over
again
even
with
the
odd
bad
moment
and
the
regret
i
have
truly
live
on
the
coke
side
of
life
happy
optimistic
and
to
the
degree
that
it
be
in
any
way
possible
innocent
my
final
career
be
well
underway
as
i
try
to
give
back
just
a
little
to
those
less
fortunate
who
have
be
so
kind
to
me
afterword
this
memoir
pen
by
my
husband
be
also
about
a
life
share
you
the
reader
might
be
as
surprised
as
i
be
that
my
husband
ask
me
to
write
this
foreword
during
the
past
many
month
as
he
write
this
book
he
wracked
my
brain
for
the
perfect
person
to
introduce
him
but
he
decide
that
this
honor
must
rest
on
my
shoulder
i
assume
that
part
of
his
reason
be
that
obviously
i
know
him
best
this
must
be
true
our
have
be
married
for
forty
one
year
and
before
that
living
in
sin
for
two
year
in
what
be
then
refer
to
as
zambia
the
small
country
where
we
met
we
be
consider
very
avant
garde
at
the
time
but
it
be
the
swing
sixty
and
so
we
be
just
ahead
of
the
trend
and
have
prove
to
naysayer
that
our
relationship
be
a
last
one
even
when
i
first
met
neville
i
knew
he
be
the
one
i
want
to
marry
and
as
we
get
to
know
each
other
in
those
first
week
and
month
i
discover
his
amaze
work
ethic
perseverance
and
of
course
ambition
over
the
year
i
have
watch
him
grow
but
he
make
me
grow
also
and
rise
to
the
occasion
as
well
and
i
believe
that
i
be
the
soft
cushion
he
could
return
to
after
a
stressful
day
we
realize
early
on
that
our
personality
really
complement
each
other
s
neville
be
a
definite
gemini
he
be
gregarious
fun
love
and
adventurous
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin
he
can
be
serious
compassionate
as
well
as
stubborn
i
believe
that
by
be
a
quiet
and
steady
companion
i
have
be
the
anchor
in
our
relationship

be
enormous
fun
as
i

over
again
and
found
it
fascinate
to
look
back
through
the
mist
of
memory
and
re
remember
so
many
thing
i
must
admit
that
i
also
shed
a
tear
or
two
over
the
low
but
they
be
few
and
far
between
i
can
assure
you
and
we
face
them
together
the
low
be
his
constant
travel
and
focus
on
the
job
at
hand
and
i
sometimes
felt
second
best
but
this
help
me
develop
a
very
strong
bond
with
our
daughter
cara
as
she
be
my
constant
companion
when

travel
to
country
and
place
that
i
would
never
have

golden
life

focus
man

the
time

the
world
whenever
neville
be

a
new
position
we
would
always
discus
it
in
depth
and
if
it
be
in
another
country
we
would
get
out
the
atlas
and
pore
over
the
map
especially
before
we
move
to
the
philippine
as
i
do
not
at
the
time
know
where

a
new
language
to
contend
with

in
our
family
who
suffer
from
all
our
globe
trot

different
country

live
on
five
continent
and
attend
six
school

very
disruptive
during
her

happily
married
and
she
and
zak
her
husband

with

beloved
grandson
rory
in
today
s
increasingly
global
business
world
these
be
challenge
many
family
will
face
neville
and
i
hope
that
our
story
will
offer
some
guidance
to
those
face
similar
adventure
which
be
fascinate
but
not
always
easy
while
reading
neville
s
memoir
i
be
full
of
admiration
for
the
way
he
quietly
face
the
many
crisis
and
confrontation
during
his
career
that
i
knew
nothing
about
he
kept
his
equilibrium
every
time
one
thing
i
always
appreciate
be
that
neville
would
insist
on
take
his
holiday
every
year
come
what
may
this
be
very
important
to
him
and
our
family
and
we
always
enjoy
be
able
to
get
away
and
relax
we
have
never
expect
that
he
would
become
ceo
and
chairman
of
coca
cola
and
have
be
look
forward
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
our
life
together
in
a
well
earn
retirement
when
the
call
come
that
would
change
both
of
us
and
our
life
forever
my
main
worry
be
over
neville
s
health
our
relationship
and
how
this
new
challenge
might
change
it
and
his
ability
to
tackle
the
daunt
job
of
run
coca
cola
what
if
he
fail
i
would
be
left
to
pick
up
the
piece
reason
won
the
day
and
now
i
blush
at
the
thought
that
i
try
to
keep
him
from
this
pinnacle
of
success
five
wonderful
year
pass
and
i
saw
him
continue
to
grow
become
even
more
confident
and
relish
all
the
difficult
situation
thrown
at
him
almost
daily
as
well
as
thrive
at
increase
his
knowledge
of
geopolitics
i
also
learn
to
appreciate
him
in
a
different
way
he
be
able
to
include
me
in
so
many
trip
and
it
be
a
pleasure
to
know
that
he
really
want
me
by
his
side
and
consider
us
a
team
when
he
step
down
as
chairman
in
i
fear
that
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
relinquish
all
the
trapping
that
go
with
the
job
but
he
take
this
in
his
usual
stride
and
be
happy
to
pas
the
baton
on
to
our
dear
friend
muhtar
kent
and
bow
out
from
the
stage
and
spotlight
neville
always
have
a
plan
for
retirement
to
be
intellectually
engage
and
stimulate
and
to
live
to
at
least
eighty
with
me
beside
him
now
i
look
forward
to
all
these
promise
i
hope
you
enjoy
reading
this
memoir
as
much
as
i
have
enjoy
living
through
it
