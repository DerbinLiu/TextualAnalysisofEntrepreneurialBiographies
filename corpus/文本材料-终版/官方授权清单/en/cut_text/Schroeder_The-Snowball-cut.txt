because
they
be
the

they

believingthat

have
make

about

why
for

would

besides
he

these
would
be

that
the

have
shift
toward
the

that
be
so
even
though
herbert

himself
thought
the

for

technology

stock
base
on
click
and

and
projection

rather
than
a

be
bunk
new
paradigm
he
sniffed
it
s
like

there
just
isn

any
such

the
next

the

early
for
he
would
be
the

invariably
he
turn
down
request
to
speak
at

by
other

but
when
herbert
allen
ask
himto
speak
at

he
always
say
yes
the
saturday
morningclosingtalk
be
the
keynote
event
of
the

so
instead
of
headingstraight
to
the

or
grabbinga
fishing
rod
almost
everyone
go
to
the
breakfast
buffet
at
the
sun

inn
then
settle
into
a
seat
today
buffett
would
be
talkingabout
the
stock
market
in
private
he
have
be
critical
of
the
gunslinging
promoter
driven
market
that
have
sent
technology
stock
gallopingtoward
delirious
height
all
year
the
stock
of
his
company
berkshire
hathaway
languish
in
their
dust
and
his
rigid
rule
of
not
buyingtechnology
stock
seem
outmode
but
the
criticism
have
no
influence
on
how
he
invest
and
to
date
the
only
statement
he
have
make
in
public
be
that
he
never
make
market
prediction
so
his
decision
to
get
up
at
the
podium
in
sun
valley
and
do
just
that
be
unprecedented
perhaps
it
be
the
time
buffett
have
a
firmconviction
and
an
overwhelmingurge
to
preach
he
have
spent
week
preparingfor
this
speech
he
understood
that
the
market
be
not
just
people
trading
stock
as
though
they
be
chip
in
a
casino
the
chip
represent
business
buffett
thought
about
the
total
value
of
the
chip
what
be
they
worth
next
he
review

pullingfroman
exhaustive

explain
during

seventeen
year
the
size
of
the
economy
grow
fivefold
the
sale
of
the

grow
more

during
these
seventeen

the

go
exactly
nowhere
he
back
up
a
step
or
two
what
you
re
do
when
you
invest
be
defer
consumption
and
lay
money
out
now
to
get
more
money
back
at
a
later
time
and
there
be
really
only
two
question
one
be
how
much
you
re
go
to
get
back
and
the
other
be
when
now
aesop
be
not
much
of
a
finance
major
because
he
say
something
like
a
bird
in
the
hand
be
worth
two
in
the
bush
but
he
doesn
t
say
when
interest
rate
the
cost
of
borrowing
buffett
explain
be
the
price
of
when
they
be
to
finance
as
gravity
be
to
physic
as
interest
rate
vary
the
value
of
all
financial
asset
house
stock
bond
change
as
if
the
price
of
bird
have
fluctuate
and
that
s
why
sometimes
a
bird
in
the
hand
be
well
than
two
bird
in
the
bush
and
sometimes
two
in
the
bush
be
well
than
one
in
the
hand
in
his
flat
breathy
twang
the
word
comingso
fast
that
they
sometimes
ran
over
one
another
buffett
related
aesop
to
the
great
bullmarket
of
the
s
which
he
described
as
baloney
profit
have
grown
much
less
than
in
that
previous
period
but
bird
in
the
bush
be
expensive
because
interest
rate
be
low
few
people
want
cash
the
bird
in
the
hand
at
such
low
rate
so
investor
be
payingunheard
of
price
for
those
bird
in
the

casually
buffett
refer
to
this

they
felt
terrific
about
that
it
be
a
new

this
dawningof
the
internet

their
attitude
be
that
buffett
have
no
right
to
callthemgreedy
warren
who
d
hoard
his
money

buffett
continued
there
be
only
three
way
the
stock
market
could
keep
risingat
ten

more
a

one
be
if

the

be
if
the

and
other
thing
rise
above
its
already
historically
high

or
he
say
the
economy
could
start
growingfaster
than
normal
he
call
it
wishful
think
to
use
optimistic
assumption
like
these
some
people
he
say
be
not
thinkingthat
the
whole
market
would
flourish
they
just
believe
they
could
pick
the
winner
fromthe
rest
swinginghis
arm
like
an

he
succeed
in
puttingup
another
slide
while
explainingthat
although
innovation
might
lift
the
world
out
of

people
who
invest
in

historically
have
not

afterward
this
be
half
of
a
page
which
come
from
a
list
seventy
page
long
of
all
the
auto
company
in
the
united
state
he
wave
the
complete
list
in
the
air
there
be
two
thousand
auto
company
the
most
important
invention
probably
of
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
it
have
an
enormous
impact
on
people
s
life
if
you
have
see
at
the
time
of
the
first
car
how
this
country
would
develop
in
connection
with
auto
you
would
have
say
this
be
the
place
i
must
be
but
of
the
two
thousand
company
as
of
a

few
year
ago
only
three
car
company
survive
and
at
one
time
or
another
all
three
be
sell
for
less
than
book
value
which
be
the
amount
of
money
that
have
be
put
into
the
company
and
left
there
so
auto
have
an
enormous
impact
on
america
but
in
the
opposite
direction
on
investor
he
put
down
the
list
to
shove
his
hand
in
his
pocket
now
sometimes
it
s
much
easy
to
figure
out
the
loser
there
be
i
think
one
obvious
decision
back
then
and
of
course
the
thing
you
should
have

frankly
i

kind
of
disappointed
that
the
buffett

be
not

throughout
this
entire
period
there
be
always
loser

of
the

albeit
faintly
their
company
might
be

but
in
their

beat
a
conviction
that
they
be

the

of
a
momentous

appear
now
the
other
great
invention
of
the
first
half
of
the
century
be
the
airplane
in
this
period
from
to
there
be
about
two
hundred
company
imagine
if
you
could
have
see
the
future
of
the
airline
industry
back
there
at
kitty
hawk
you
would
have
see
a
world
undreamed
of
but
assume
you
have
the
insight
and
you
saw
all
of
these
people
wish
to
fly
and
to
visit
their
relative
or
run
away
from
their
relative
or
whatever
you
do
in
an
airplane
and
you
decide
this
be
the
place
to
be
as
of
a
couple
of
year
ago
there
have
be
zero
money
make
from
the
aggregate
of
all
stock
investment
in
the
airline
industry
in
history
so
i
submit
to
you
i
really
like
to
think
that
if
i
have
be
down
there
at
kitty
hawk
i
would
have
be
farsighted
enough
and
public
spirit
enough
to
have
shot
orville
down
i
owe
it
to
future
capitalist
another
light
chuckle
some
be
gettingtired
of
these
musty
old
example
but
out
of
respect
they
let
buffett
get
on
with
it
now
he
be
talkingabout
their
business
it
s
wonderful
to
promote
new
industry
because
they
be
very
promotable
it
s
very
hard
to
promote
investment
in
a
mundane
product
it
s
much
easy
to
promote
an
esoteric
product
even
particularly
one
with
loss
because
there
s
no
quantitative
guideline
this
be
goringthe
audience
directly
where
it
hurt
but
people
will
keep
come
back
to
invest
you
know
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
that
story
of
the
oil
prospector
who
die
and
go
to
heaven
and
st
peter
say
well
i
checked
you
out
and
you
meet
all
of
the
qualification
but
there
s
one
problem
he
say
we
have
some
tough
zone
law
up
here
and
we
keep
all
of
the
oil
prospector
over
in
that
pen
and
as
you
can
see
it
be
absolutely
chock
full
there
be
no
room
for
you
and
the
prospector
say
do
you
mind
if
i
just
say
four
word
st
peter
say
no
harm
in
that
so
the
prospector
cupped
his
hand
and
yell
out
oil
discover
in
hell
and
of
course
the
lock
come
off
the
cage
and
all
of
the
oil
prospector
start
head
right
straight
down
st
peter
say
that
s
a
pretty
slick
trick
so
he
say
go
on
in
make
yourself
at
home
all
the
room
in
the
world
the
prospector
pause
for
a
minute
then
say
no
i
think
i
ll
go
along
with
the
rest
of
the
boy
there

might
be
some
truth
to
that
rumor
after
all
well
that
s
the
way
people
feel
with
stock
it
s
very
easy
to
believe
that
there
s
some
truth
to
that
rumor
after
all
this
get
a
mild
laugh
for
a
half
second
which
choked
off
as
soon
as
the
audience
caught
on
to
buffett
s
point
which
be
that
like
the
prospector
they
might
be
mindless
enough
to
follow
rumor
and
drillfor
oilin
hell
he
close
by
returningto
the
proverbialbird
in
the
bush
there
be
no
new
paradigm
he
say
ultimately
the
value
of
the
stock
market
could
only
reflect
the
output
of
the
economy
he
put
up
a
slide
to
illustrate
how
for
several
year
the
market
s
valuation
have
outstrip
the
economy
s
growth
by
an
enormous
degree
this
meant
buffett
say
that
the
next
seventeen
year
might
not
look
much
well
than
that
longstretch
from
to
when
the
dow

go
exactly
nowhere
that
be
unless
the
market
plummet
if
i
have
to
pick
the
most
probable
return
over
that
period
he
say
it
would
probably
be
six
percent

and
self
delusion
in
their
view
be
the
major
cause
of

they

to
ponder
the
reason
for

as
a
way
of
deduce
the

i
have
longlooked
for
insight
by

the
intense
manner
counsel
by
the
great
algebraist
carl
jacobi
munger

always

he
illustrate
this
with
the
story
of
a
wise
peasant
who
say
tell
me
where
i
mgoingto
die
so
i
won
t
go
there
but
while
munger
meant
this
figuratively
buffett
take
it
more
literally
he
lack
munger
s
subtle
sense
of
fatalism
particularly
when
it
come
to
the
subject
of
his
own
mortality
both
men
however
be
infect
by
the
urge
to

munger
described
himself
as
didactic

labor
over

on
the

which
struck

finally

he
grow
so
enthuse
deliveringthese
speech
that
on
a
few
occasion
he
become
self
intoxicate
as
buffett
put
it
and
have
to
be
drag
from
the
stage
in
private
munger
tend
to
lecture
either
himself
or
his
audience
makingconversations
with

sittingin

while
he
consider
himself

and
do
not
hesitate
to
expound
on

and
the
ideal
distance
between

munger
be
nonetheless
wary
of
venturingvery
far
from
what
he

some

i
have
always
sense
it
would

like

he
have
his

while
munger
chose
his

selectively

have
trouble

buffett
could

an
illustrate

of
his
belief
which
be
why
munger
refer
to
it
as
buffett
s
didactic
enterprise
the
two
men
have
be
each

eventually
they
could
read
each
other
s
mind
stop
talk
and
carry
on
by
telepathy
but
by
then
their

have
expand
to

the

for

his

by
the

that
stock
very
well
when
i
bought
it
he
say
he
knew
only
that
it
be
a
favorite
stock
that
howard
have
sell
to
his

felt
terribly
responsible
so
when
the
stock
finally
recover
he
sell
at
nettinga
profit
for
the
two
of
them

three
lesson
and
would
call
this
episode
one
of
the
most
important
of
his
life
one
lesson
be
not
to
overly
fixate
on
what
he
have
paid
for
a
stock
the
second
be
not
to
rush
unthinkingly
to
grab
a
small
profit
he
learn
these
two
lesson
by
broodingover
the
he
would
have
make
have
he
be
more
patient
it
have
take
five
year
of
work
since
he
be
six
year
old
to
save
the
to
buy
this
stock
base
on
how
much
he
currently
make
from
sellinggolf
ball
or
peddlingpopcorn
and
peanut
at
the
ballpark
he
realize
that
it
could
take
year
to
earn
back
the
profit
he
have
lose
he
would
never
never
never
forget
this
mistake
and
there
be
a
third
lesson
which
be
about
investingother
people
s
money
if
he
make
a
mistake
it
might
get
somebody
upset
at
him
so
he
didn
t
want
to
have
responsibility

howard
now
come
to

in

desperate
gamble
roosevelt
and
his

chief

george

have
decide
that
the
only
way

be
to
get
the

to

us
say

and
not
tip
off
the
people
at

this
belief
be

be
strikingly
firmin
his

the

at

at
all
his

might
not

by

apparently
he
felt
an

i
be
out
of

i
felt
very
inept
with
girl
at
that
time
and
socially
in
general
but
with
old
people
i
be
fine
not

howard
s
friend

one
of
those
old
people
call
fromomaha
he
want
to
talk
to
warren
warren
he
say
i
m
in
a
terrible
jam
the
board
of
director
told
me
to
get
rid
of
our
washington
d
c
warehouse
this
be
a
real
problem
for
me
we
have
hundred
of
pound
case
of
stale
cornflakes
and
case
of
barbecubes
dog
biscuit
i
m
in
a
real
pickle
i
m
twelve
hundred
mile
away
and
you
re
the
only
businessman
i
know
in
washington
so
he
say
i
know
i
can
count
on
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
told
our
warehouse
men
to
deliver
these
cornflakes
and
barbecubes
dog
biscuit
to
your
house
whatever
you
get
for
them
send
me
half
you
keep
the
rest
and
all
of
a
sudden
these
huge
truck
come
up
and
fill
our
garage
fill
our
basement
everything
now
my

couldn
t

now
i
ve
get

try
to
figure
out
who
it
would
be
useful
to
you
know
and
obviously
the
dog
biscuit
would
be
useful
to
a
kennel
the
cornflakes
be
not
fit
for
human
consumption
anymore
so
i
figure
they
might
be
good
for
some
animal
i
sell
the
cornflakes
to
some
poultry
guy
i
make
probably
a
hundred
buck
for

percent
to
mr

and
pull

and

sleepily
aboard
the

i
didn
t
know
how
the
number
system
work
or
anything
i
sat
there
for
hour
and
hour
sort
and
bundling
the
paper
i
be
short
paper
in
the
end
because
people
just
take
them
from
the
bundle
as
they
left
for
church
the
whole
thing
be
a
disaster
i
thought
what
the
hell
have
i
gotten
into
it
take
until
ten
or
eleven
in
the
morning
to
finish
up
but
i
stumble
my
way
through
and
it
get
well
and
i
get
good
very
fast
it
be
easy
warren
race
out
of
his
house
to
catch
the
first
n
bus
over
to
the
westchester
at
cathedral
avenue
every
morning
often
he
have
bus
pas
number
the
first
person
buyinga
bus
pas
each
week
the
driver
get
use
to
lookingout
for
himif
he
be
runninga
little
late
he
would
jump
off
the
bus
and
run
the
couple
of
block
over
to
the
westchester
he
have
figure
out
the
most
efficient
route
and
turn
what
could
have
be
a
boringand
repetitive
job
deliveringhundreds
of
newspaper
each
day
into
a
competition
with
himself
see
the
paper
be
a
little
thinner
in
those
day
because
of
newsprint
ration
a
thirty
six
page
paper
be
a
pretty
good
size
paper
i
d
stand
at
one
end
of
the
hallway
with
a
bundle
and
pull
off
a
paper
fold
it
over
flat
and
tuck
it
to
make
a
pancake
or
roll
it
into
a
biscuit
then
i
smack
it
against
my
thigh
and
i
d
twist
it
against
my
wrist
to
put
some
spin
on
it
and
slide
it
down
the
hall
i
could
slide
that
thing
fifty
even
a
hundred
foot
it
be
kind
of
a
test
of
skill
because
the
apartment
door
be
at
different
length
down
the
hallway
i
d
do
the
long
one
first
but
the
trick
be
to
be
able
to
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
they
d
all
come
to
rest
a
few
inch
from
the
door
and
sometimes
people
would
have
milk
bottle
which
make
it
more
interest
he
also
sell
calendar
to
his
newspaper
customer
and
he
developed
another
sideline
too
he
ask
all
his
customer
for
their
old
magazine
as
scrap
paper
for
the
war
effort
then
he
would
check
the
label
on
the
magazine
to
figure
out
when
the
subscription
be
expire
usinga
code
book
he
have
gotten
frommoore
cottrell
the
publishingpowerhouse
that
have
hire
him
as
an
agent
to
sell
magazine
he
make
a
card
file
of
subscriber
and
before
their
subscription
expire
warren
would
be
knockingat
their
door
sellingthem
a
new
magazine
because
the
westchester
have
so
much
turnover
in
wartime
warren
s
big
dread
be
customer
who
skip

and
didn
t
pay
leavinghimstuck
with
the
cost
of
their

after
a
few
people
skip

on
him
he
start
tippingthe
elevator
girl
to
let
him
know
when

be
about

then
the

thought
that
she
should
have
a
little
more
empathy
for
her
paperboy
since
she
own
her
own

he
begin
to
worry
that

you
can
do
something
in

if
you

ve
get
a

get
a

if
he
s
willing
to
pull
the

and
i
have
some
moral
compunction
against
do
it
he

right

this
have
change
everything

how
men
think
it
put
a
fuse
to
the

of
the

now
it
may
be
a
long
fuse
and
there
may

way
to
interrupt
it

once
that
metaphorical
bomb
have
a
dozen
fuse
all
burning
the
problem
becomes
a

sort

no

be
lit
i
be
only
fourteen

it

me
just
totally

some
of

he
continued
to

the

with
others
unlike
most
people
who
read
carnegie
s

although
no
one
have
ever
put
pinballmachines
in

before
they
present
their
proposition
to
mr
erico
who
bit
the
boy
take
the
leg
off
the
pinball
machine
put
it
in

father
s
car
and
haul
it
over
to
mr
erico
s
barbershop
where
they
instal
it
sure
enough
the
very
first
even
when
warren
and
don
come
back
to
check
gee
zip
warren
say
four
buck
worth
of
nickel
have
found
their
way
into
the
machine
mr
erico
be
delighted
and
the
pinballmachine
stayed
after
a
week
warren
empty
the
machine
and
scoop
the
nickel
into
two
pile
mr
erico
he
say
let
s
not
bother
goingone
for
you
one
for
me
just
pick
the
pile
you
want
it
be
like
the
old
fashion
way
of
dividingcake
one
child
cut
the
other
child
chooses
after
mr
erico
swept
one
pile
over
toward
his
side
of
the
table
warren
count
out
the
other
and
found
in
his
pile
that
be
enough
to
buy
another
pinball
machine
pretty
soon
seven
or
eight
of
mr
wilson
s
pinballmachines
be
sittingin
barbershop
around
town
warren
have
discover
the
miracle
of
capital
money
that
work
for
its
owner
as
if
it
have
a
job
of
its
own
you
have
to
get
along
with
the
barber
that
be
crucial
i
mean
these
guy
could
all
go
buy
these
machine
for
twenty
five
buck
themselves
so
we
would
always
convince
them
that
it
take
someone
with
a
four
hundred
iq
to
repair
pinball
machine
now
there
be
some
pretty
unsavory
character
in
the
pinball
business
and
they
all
hung
out
at
a
place
call
silent
sale
that
be
our
hunt
ground
silent
sale
be
in
the
block
of
d
street
right
near
the
gayety
burlesque
house
on
the
seedy
side
of
downtown
these
character
at
silent
sale
be
amuse
by
us
sort
of
danly
and
i
would
go
down
there
and
we
d
look
at
these
machine
and
buy
whatever
we
could
for
twenty
five
buck
new
machine
cost
about
three
hundred
dollar
i
use
to
subscribe
to
billboard
magazine
in
those
day
to
keep
track
of
what
be
go
on
in
pinball
machine
the
guy
at
silent
sale
taught
us
some
thing
there
be
some
illegal
slot
machine
around
and
they
show
us
how
to
pour
beer
into
them
to
make
a
fifty
cent
piece
get
stuck
in
the
mechanism
and
you
could
just
keep
pull
the
handle
until
it
paid
they
show
us
how
to
disable
the
electric
cutoff
for
the
coin
operate
soda
machine
at
the
movie
theater
so
if
you
stuck
a
nickel
in
then
immediately
pull
the
plug
you
could
empty
the
whole
machine
these
guy
would
explain
all
this
stuff
to
us
and
we
d
just
eat
it
up
my
dad
probably
suspect
the
kind
of
character
we
be
hang
out
with
but
he
always
felt
i
d
turn
out
okay
warren
and
don
be
already
makinggood
money
with
single
pinballmachines
in
barbershop
but
then
they
found
a
gold
mine
our
home
run
of
all
time
be
down
near
griffith
stadium
which
be
the
old
baseball
park
in
the
middle
of
washington
s
bad
slum
they
found
a
seven
chair
black
barbershop
there
be
a
lot
of
dude
down
there
after
we
put
a
pinball
machine
in
we
would
come
back
to
collect
and
these
guy
have
drill
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
machine
and
rig
the
tilt
mechanism
it
be
a
real
contest
of
will
but
that
be
our
mother
lode
our
best
location
by
far
the
guy
who
played
at
these
barbershop
be
constantly
implore
us
to
adjust
the
tilt
mechanism
so
you
could
shove
the
machine
harder
without
make
it
tilt
listen
we
be
not
judgmental
about
our
customer
if
anything
they
be
probably
tryingto
pick
up
more
idea
like
the
scam
the
guy
at
silent
sale
have
taught
them
and
those
they
be
inventingon
their
own
one
time
we
be
down
in
danly
s
basement
play
with
my
coin
collection
to
make
collect
on
the
paper
route
more
interest
i
use
to
collect
different
kind
of
coin
so
i
have
these
whitman
coin
board
with
slot
for
the
coin
i
say
to
don
it
look
to
me
like
we
could
take
these
coin
board
and
use
them
as
mold
for
cast
slug
danly
be
the
brain
of
the
operation
and
so
sure
enough
he
learn
how
to
pour
these
mold
for
cast
slug
and
i
supply
the
coin
board
we
would
try
to
use
the
slug
for
vend
machine
for
soda
pop
and
thing
like
that
our
basic
formula
be
to
have
our
income
in
currency
and
our
outgo
in
slug
one
time
danly
s
father
come
down
in
the
basement
and
say
what
be
you
boy
do
we
be
pour

into
these
thing
and
it

usingkerlin
for
their
new
venture
we
have
give
up
steal
the
golf
ball
from
sears
but
we
get
this
idea
that
we
be
go
to
retrieve
lose
golf
ball
from
the
lake
on
golf
course
around
washington
and
now
we
saw
a
position
for
kerlin
because
neither
one
of
us
want
to
retrieve
the
golf
ball
they
create
an
elaborate
scenario
for
how
kerlin
would
do
this
it
border
on
an
evilprank
but
school
be
out
in
a
couple
of
month
so
what
the
hell
we
go
down
again
to
ninth
and
d
where
the
army
surplus
store
be
locate
right
by
silent
sale
and
bought
a
gas
mask
and
then
we
get
this
garden
hose
and
we
hooked
them
up
and
test
this
thing
in
a
bathtub
by
put
our
face
in
three
inch
of
water
doingwhat
he
call
his
tomsawyer
routine
warren
say
to
kerlin
this
be
your
chance
we
re
go
to
deal
you
in
we
told
him
that
we
would
go
out
at
four
in
the
morning
to
some
golf
course
in
virginia
and
that
he
would
wear
the
gas
mask
in
the
lake
and
retrieve
the
ball
and
we
d
split
the
money
three
way
kerlin
say
how
do
i
stay
down
on
the
bottom
i
say
oh
i
ve
get
that
all
work
out
what
we
will
do
be
you
ll
strip

my
washington
post
newspaper
bag
and
we
ll
put
barbell
plate
in
the
newspaper
bag
so
that
you
ll
stay
on
the
bottom
so
we
go
out
to
this
golf
course
and
all
the
way
kerlin
be
express
some
doubt
and
danly
and
i
say

but
you
know

then
analyzingit

warren

first
put
this
into
practicaluse
as
a

down
at

you
get
all
these
people
who
d
never
see
a
race
except
in
the

and
they
d
think
that
if
your
horse
come
in
second
or
third
you
didn
t
get
paid
because
all
the

so
they
d
throw
away
place
and
show

the
other
time
you
would
hit
it
big
be
when
there
be
a

that
little

would
go
on

by
that
time
some
people
have
thrown
away
their

meanwhile
we
be
just
gobble
them
up
we
wouldn
t
even
look
at
them
when
we
be
work
at
night
we
d
go
through
them
it
be
awful
people
would
spit
on
the
floor
but
we
have
great
fun
if
i
found
any
win
ticket
my
aunt
alice
who
didn
t
care
anything
at
all
about

would
cash
them
in
for

because
they
wouldn
t
cash
them
for
kid
warren
want
to
go
to
the
race
all
the
time
when
mr

t
takinghim
my
dad
would
never
go
to
the
race
say
buffett
he
do
not
believe
in
the
race
instead
his
parent
let
his
great
uncle
frank
the
oddballof
the

take

refer
to
as
the
gold
digger
he
have
no
particular
interest
in
the
horse
but
he
take
warren
to

because
his
great
nephew
want
to
go
at
ak

warren
have
learn
somethingabout
how
to
read
the
tip
sheet
and
it
open
up
a
whole
new
world
handicappinghorses
combine
two
thing
he
be
very
very
good
at
collectinginformation
and
math
it
be
not
unlike
countingcards
at
blackjack
except
that
the
winninghand
have
four
leg
and
ran
around
a
track
soon
he
and
rus
knew
enough
to
put
out
their
own
tip
sheet
the
cannily
name
stable
boy
selection
we
get
away
with
it
for
a
while
they
weren
t
the
hottest
seller
in
the
world
i
mean
a
couple
of
little
kid
sell
this
thing
we
typed
up
in
my
basement
on
an
old
royal
typewriter
the
limit
factor
be
carbon
in
those
day
you
could
probably
only
get
in
five
or
so
carbon
but
i
get
on
the
royal
and
bob
russell
and
i
doped
out
the
horse
and
then
we
typed
up
this
thing
we
be
in
the
track
yell
get
your
stable
boy
selection
but
the
blue
sheet
be
the
number
one
tip
sheet
and
the
racetrack
be
get
a
commission
on
it
the
blue
sheet
sell
for
a
little
more
at
twenty
five
cent
we
be
a
cut
rate
product
they
shut
down
the
stable
boy
selection
fast
because
they
be
get
a
cut
on
everything
sell
in
the
place
except
for
us
when
the
buffetts
move
to
washington
d
c
the
only
plus
for
warren
be
the
chance
to
upgrade
his
handicappingskills
the
one
thing
i
knew
about
congress
be
that
congressman
have
access
to
the
library
of
congress
and
the
library
of
congress
have
everything
that
have
ever
be
write
so
when
we
get
to
washington
i
say
pop
there
s
just
one
thing
i
want
i
want
you
to
ask
the
library
of
congress
for
every
book
they
have
on
horse
handicap
and
my
dad
say
well
don
t
you
think
they
re
go
to
think
it
s
a
little
strange
if
the
first
thing
a
new
congressman
asks
for
be
all
the
book
on
horse
handicap
i
say
pop
who
be
out
there
at
the
county
fair
stump
for
your
election
who
be
down
there
at
the
packinghouse
ready
to
get
to
the
cop
if
something
happen
i
say
and
you
re
come
up
for
reelection
in
two
more
year
you
re
go
to
need
me
so
this
be
payoff
time
and
he
get
me
hundred
of
book
on
horse
handicap
then
what
i
would
do
be
read
all
these
book
i
sent
away
to
a
place
in
chicago
on
north
clark
street
where
you
could
get
old
race
form
month
of
them
for
very
little
they
be
old
so
who
want
them
i
would
go
through
them
use
my
handicap
technique
to
handicap
one
day
and
see
the
next
day
how
it
work
out
i
ran
test
of
my
handicap
ability
day
after
day
all
these
different
system
i
have
in
my
mind
there
be
two
kind
of
handicapper
there
be
speed
handicapper
and
class
handicapper
speed
handicapper
figure
out
the
horse
with
the
best
time
in
the
past
the
fast
horse
will
win
class
handicapper
feel
that
the
horse
that
s
run
against
ten
thousand
dollar
horse
and
do
well
and
now
be
run
against
the
five
thousand
dollar
horse
will
beat
them
because
they
say
the
horse
run
just
fast
enough
to
win
in
horse
race
it
pay
to
understand
both
type
of
handicap
but
back
then
i
be
basically
a
speed
guy
i
be
a
quantitative
guy
to
start
with
as
he
test
thought
and
observe
warren
discover
the
rule
of
the
racetrack
nobody
ever
go
home
after
the
first
race
you
don
t
have
to
make
it
back
the
way
you
lose
it
the
racetrack
count
on
people
to
keep
bettinguntil
they
lose
couldn
t
a
good
handicapper
turn
these
rule
around
and
win
the
market
be
a
racetrack
too
but
i
be
not
develop
elaborate
theory
in
those
day
i
be
just
a
little
kid
bettingin
washington
be
ubiquitous
i
would
go
down
to
my
dad
s
office
fairly
often
and
there
be
actually
a
bookie
in
what
be
then
call
the
old
house
office
building
you
could
go
to
the
elevator
shaft
and
yell
sammy
or
something
like
that
and
this
kid
would
come
up
and
take
bet
now
i
use
to
do
a
little
bookmaking
too
for
guy
who
want
to
bet
on
the
preakness
or
something
like
that
that
s
the
end
of
the
game
i
like
the
fifteen
percent
take
with
no
risk
my
dad
you
know
be
struggle
somewhat
to
keep
this
under
control
he
be
amuse
by
it
to
some
extent
but
he
could
also
see
how
it
could
veer
off
in
the
wrong
direction
duringsummer

ask

the

his

say
he
need
permission
the
next

dwyer

and
early
he
come

with
a
note
from
his
mother
sayingit
be
all
right
to
go
to
the

so
dwyer
write
warren
some
phony
excuse
to
get
out
of
class
and
then
they
take
the
chesapeake
ohio
fromsilver
spring
maryland
over
to
the
racetrack
in

west
virginia
goingto
the
race
with
a
teacher
polished
warren
s
sophistication
about
handicap
dwyer
taught
warren
advanced
skill
in
readingthe
most
important
tip
sheet
the
daily
race
form
i
d
get
the
daily
race
form
ahead
of
time
and
figure
out
the
probability
of
each
horse
win
the
race
then
i
would
compare
those
percentage
to
the
odds
but
i
wouldn
t
look
at
the
odds
first
to
avoid
prejudice
myself
sometimes
you
would
find
a
horse
where
the
odds
be
way
way
off
from
the
actual
probability
you
figure
the
horse
have
a
ten
percent
chance
of
win
but
it
s
go
off
at
fifteen
to
one
the
less
sophisticated
the
track
the
well
you
have
people
bet
on
the
jockey
s
color
and
you
have
them
bet
on
their
birthday
you
have
them
bet
on
the
horse
name
and
the
trick
of
course
be
to
be
in
a
group
where
practically
no
one
be
analytical
and
you
have
a
lot
of
data
so
i
would
study
the
form
like
crazy
when
i
be
a
kid
one
grade
behind
warren
at
woodrow
wilson
but
slightly
old
bill
gray
go
to
a
few
horse
race
with
him
he
be
very
sharp
with
number
very
talkative
very
outgo
we
would
discus
baseball
batting
average
sport
he
knew
which
horse
he
be
goingto
pick
the
minute
he
get
off
the
train
he
would
go
down
to
the
track
and
say
well
this
horse
be
too
much
weight
or
this
horse
where
he
s
come
in
the
last
few
race
have
not
be
good
enough
or
his
time
be
not
good
enough
he
knew
how
to
judge
the
horse
warren
make
six
to
ten
dollar
bet
sometimes
on
the
nose
he
only
bet
bigif
the
odds
look
good
but
he
have
a
way
of
riskingsome
of
his
hard
earn
paper
route
money
on
the
right
horse
he
might
change
his
mind
as
the
different
race
come
forward
say
gray
but
for
a
sixteen
year
old
that
s
not
so
common
you
know
then
one
time
warren
go
to
charleston
by
himself
and
he
lose
in
the
first
race
but
he
didn
t
go
home
he
kept
on
bettingand
he
kept
on
lose
untilhe
have
lose
more
than
and
his
pocket
be
strip
nearly
bare
i
come
back
i
go
to
the
hot
shoppe
and
i
treat
myself
to
the
big
thing
they
offer
a
giant
fudge
sundae
or
something
and
there
go
all
the
rest
of
my
money
while
i
ate
i
figure
out
how
many
newspaper
i
have
to
deliver
to
make
up
what
i
have
lose
i
be
go
to
have
to
work
more
than
a
week
to
make
back
the
money
and
i
d
do
it
for
dumb
reason
you
re
not
suppose
to
bet
every
race
i
d
commit
the
bad
sin
which
be
that
you
get
behind
and
you
think
you
ve
get
to
break
even
that
day
the
first
rule
be
that
nobody
go
home
after
the
first
race
and
the
second
rule
be
that
you
don
t
have
to
make
it
back
the
way
you
lose
it
that
be
so
fundamental
you
know
do
he
realize
that
he
d
make
an
emotional
decision
oh
yeah
oh
i
be
sick
it
be
the
last
time
i
ever
do
anything

at
the
dormfor
breakfast
then
head
off

finally
found
one
class

like
professor

discuss
different
industry
and
the
nut
and
bolt
of
runninga
business
it
be
textile
it
be
steel
it
be
petroleum
i
can
still
remember
that
book
i
get
a
lot
of
stuff
from
it
i
can
remember
talk
about
the
law
of

in
petroleum
and
the
bessemer
process
in
steel
i

his
suitemate
harry

who
sweat
through
hockenberry
s
class
alongside
warren
resent
the
way
he
toboggan
ahead
effortlessly
it
be
the
same
in
business
law
taught
by
professor
cataldo
who
have
very
close
to
a
photographic
mind
he
would
quote
case
at
length
i
can
still
remember
hadley
versus
baxendale
and
kemble
versus
farren
so
i
would
do
the
same
thing
back
to
him
on
the
exam
which
entertain
him
to
no
end
i
would
quote
from
his
stuff
in
answer
question
whether
applicable
or
not
and
he
just
ate
it
up
help
by
his
prodigious
memory
warren
be
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
for
much
of
the
day
at
lunchtime
he
drop
by
the
alpha
sighouse
an
old
three
story
mansion
with
a
spiral
staircase
where
kelsen
the
black
houseman
cooked
clean
and
in
his
white
jacket
give
the
place
a
degree
of
dignity
a
bridge
game
go
on
twenty
four
hour
a
day
in
a
corner
alcove
and
warren
would
sit
down
and
play
a
few
hand
his
taste
for
practical
joke
continued
unabated
he
occasionally
enlist
one
of
his
fraternity
brother
lenny
farina
to
pose
for
attention
gettingphotographs
out
on
the
street
while
he
pretend
to
pick
lenny
s
pocket
or
shine
his
shoe
meanwhile
in
a
scamreminiscent
of
sendingpoor
old
kerlin
into
a
water
trap
naked
wearinga
gas
mask
he
and
clyde
have
told
their
third
roommate
george
that
he
look
run
down
and
puny
and
would
never
attract
girl
unless
he
developed
muscle
they
finally
maneuver
george
into
buyinghimself
some
barbell
and
then
we
use
to
bang
these
barbell
up
and
down
while
harry
beja
be
study
down
below

we
have
great
fun
taunt
him
by
banging
these
barbell
on
the
floor
by
college
however
the
evidence
have
become
convincing
warren
have
begin
to
give
up
on
the
idea
of
becominga
strongman
after
a
while
i
decide
my
bone
be
wrong
my
clavicle
be
not
long
enough
it
s
your
clavicle
that
determine
how
broad
shoulder
you
ll
be
and
you
can
t
do
much
about
your
clavicle
that
s
why
i
get
disgust
and
eventually
quit
i
decide
that
if
i
be
go
to
have
girl
like
muscle
anyway
then
to
hell
with
it
girl
like
muscle
do
not
attract
girl
and
warren
have
still
not

in
the
springof
warren
be
close
to

after
three
year
of

he
only
need
to
take
a
few
class
at
summer
school
to
graduate
and
then
he
make
a
decision
that
completely
reverse
his
path
to
date
after
high
school
he
have
felt
fully
qualify
to
achieve
his
goal
of
becominga
millionaire
by
age
thirty
five
with
no
far
education
but
now
that
he
be
close
to

at
the
point
when
most

do

he
have
fix
his
ambition
on
attendingthe
harvard
business
school
throughout
his
entire
educational
history
he
have
show
little
interest
in
formal
school
as

to
learn

largely
self
taught
harvard
however
offer
himtwo
important
thing
prestige
and
a
network
of
future
connection
he
have
just
see
his
father
thrown
out
of
congress
and
his
career
as
a
stockbroker
crush
in
part
because
he
have
tend
to
isolate
himself
by
sacrificingrelationships
for
the
sake
of
rigid
ideal
so
perhaps
it
be
not
surprisingthat
warren
chose
harvard
he
be
so
certain
that
harvard
would
choose
himthat
he
be
already
urginghis

he

go
unscratched
and
his
son

as

warren
be
relyingon
his
knowledge
of
stock
to
make
a
good
impression
in
the
interview
so
far
his
experience
have
be
that
whenever
he
start
talkingabout
stock
people
could
not
help
but
listen
his
relative
his
teacher
his
parent
friend
his
fellow

all
want
to
hear
himdiscourse
on
this

he
have
misunderstood
harvard
s
mission
which
be
to
turn
out
leader
when
he
arrive
in
chicago
and
introduce
himself
to
the
interviewer
the
man
saw
past
his
confidence
as
a
prodigy
in
a
single
subject
straight
through
to
his
self
consciousness
his
shaky
inner
core
i
look
about
sixteen
and
emotionally
be
about
nine
i
spent
ten
minute
with
the
harvard
alumnus
who
be
do
the
interview
and
he
assess
my
capability
and
turn
me
down
warren
never
get
the
chance
to
show
off
his
knowledge
of
stock
the
man
fromharvard
told
him
gently
that
he
would
have
a
well
chance
in
a
few
year
warren
be
naive
it
do
not
quite
sink
in
what
this
meant
when
the
letter
arrive

he
be

his
first

these

their
memory
have
drain
away
and
yet
warren
would
later
come

when
you
be

who
know
what
i
write
i
probably
write
that
i
just
found
this
catalog
at
the
university
of
omaha
and
it
say
that
you
and

i
m
sure
it
be
not
a
very
conventional

it
be
probably
fairly
personal

in
a

however
unconventional
warren
could
shape
the
impression
he
make
more
successfully
than
in

the

by

he
ask

a

up

be
the
first
annual
meeting
i
ever
attend
they
held
their
meeting
in
jersey
city
new
jersey
probably
so
few
shareholder
would
attend
warren
s
vision
of
shareholder
meeting
rise
fromhis
conception
of
the
nature
of
a
business
he
have
recently
sell
his
tenant
farm
doublinghis
money
over
five
year
duringthe
time
he
have
own
it
he
and
his
tenant
farmer
have
share
the
profit
on
the
crop
but
his
tenant
didn
t
share
the
profit
fromsellingthe
land
as
the
capitalist
warren
put
up
the
money
and
take
the
risk
and
then
he
get
the
gain
if
there
be
any
warren
thought
of
all
business
this
way
the
employee
who
manage
the
business
share
in
the
earnings
that
their
labor
produce
but
they
be
accountable
to
their
owner
and
it
be
the
owner
who
get
the
gain
as
the
value
of
the
business
increase
of
course
if
the
employee
bought
stock
themselves
they
become
owner
too
and
partner
with
the
other
capitalist
but
no
matter
how
much
stock
they
own
as
employee
their
job
require
themto
report
to
the
owner
on
how
well
they
have
do
thus
warren
saw
a
shareholder
meetingas
a
time
of
accountingfor
the
stewardship
of
the
manager
this
vision

of
a
couple
of
employee
workingfor
his
idol
ben
graham
and
his
partner
jerry
newman
warren
found
himself
instinctively
drawn
to
walter
not
just
for
his
enviable
job
but
also
because
of
the
story
of
his
gritty
disadvantage
background
at
the
marshall
well
meeting
warren
also

a

who
be
a

in
a
small
but
respect
security
firm
stryker
brown
and
an
ally
of
ben
graham
s
together
green
graham
and
jerry
newman
hunt
for
company
whose
stock
be
cheaper
than
a

full
of
stale
barbecubes

they
try
to
buy
enough

thus
influence
management
warren
be
mightily
impressed
by
lou
green
and
want
to
make
a
good
impression
so
he
struck
up
a
conversation
with
him
and
he
and
stanback
and
green
rode
back
together
on
the

from

green
offer
to
take
the
two
youngmen
to
lunch
that
be
like
hittingthe
jackpot
warren
discover
green
be
tightfisted
a
man
after
his
own
heart
this
guy
be
enormously
wealthy
and
we
go
to
some
cafeteria
or
something
like
that
at
lunch
green
begin
explainingwhat
it
be
like
to
be
pursue
by
woman
who
be
after
his
money
as
he
be
somewhat
past
middle
age
his
technique
for
dealingwith
this
be
to
confront
the
woman
s
motif
directly
you
like
these
false
teeth
how
about
my
bald
head
or
the
pot
belly
warren
be
enjoyingthe
conversation
untilgreen
suddenly
change
the
subject
and
put
himon
the
spot
he
say
to
me
why
do
you
buy
marshall
well
and
i
say
because
ben
graham
bought
it
true
grahamwas
already
his
hero
even
though
the
two
have
never
met
and
since
the
inspiration
for
buying
marshall
well
have
indeed
come
from
security
analysis
warren
may
have
felt
he
have
to
be
scrupulous
about
how
he
have
learn
of
it
but
in
fact
he
have
good
reason
to
own
marshall
well
beyond
its
mention
in
security
analysis
reputedly
the
large
hardware
wholesaler
in
north
america
marshall
well
be
earningso
much
money
that
if
it
have
paid
out
those
earnings
to
shareholder
as
a
dividend
they
would
have
gotten
a
share
the
stock
trade
at
around
a
share
owninga
marshall
well
share
be
somethinglike
owninga
bond
one
that
paid
thirty
one
percent
interest
the
earnings
on
a
share
at
that
rate
in
three
year
warren
would
have
nearly
two
dollar
of
value
for
every
dollar
he
have
invest
in
marshall
well
even
if
the
company
didn
t
pay
the
money
out
the
stock
would
have
to
rise
eventually
you
would
be
crazy
to
pas
up
such
a
stock
but
warren
do
not
explain
any
of
this
to
lou
green
instead
he
say
because
ben
graham
bought
it
lou
look
at
me
and
say
strike
one
i
ll
never
forget
the
way
he
look
at
me
when
he
say
it
it
dawn
on
him
warren
think
for
yourself
he
felt
foolish
we
re
sit
in
this
little
cafeteria
i
m
with
this
impressive
character
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
m
strike
out
he
do
not
want
to
make
any
more
mistake
like
this
and
he
do
want
to
find
more
stock
like
marshall
well
so
as
graham
s
seminar
approach
warren
start
memorizingeverythinghe
could
find
out
about
ben
graham

or
geico
this
stock
be
not
mention
in
security
analysis
when
he
look
in
the
moody

manual
he
found
that
the
graham
newman
corporation
have
own
fifty
five
percent
of
it
but
have
recently
give
out

in
his
humblest
manner
whether

to
a

graham
s
he
would
waste
a
few
minute
of
his
valuable
time
but
he
say
after
about
ten
to
twelve
minute
of
his
question
i
realize
that
i
be
talkingto
a
highly
unusual
youngman
the

sixteen
that
he
have
file

grapple
with
the

how
do
company
make

a

like

it

to
go
out

find
a
way
to
keep
a
roof
over
its
employee
and

head
he
grasped
that
because
geico
sell
insurance
at
the
cheapest
price
the
only
way
it
could

would

it
be
an
extraordinary
move
for
the
normally
cautious

that
be

true
because
at

that

graham
go
on
to

the

into
one
of
the

although
far
from

the

pushingup

and
makingit
more
expensive
for
graham

to
buy
this
drove
jerry

crazy
why
make
the

harder
by

they

as

if
he
have
as

as
he
felt
he
need
anything

be
totally
immaterial
to
him
over
the
twenty

that

sound
trifle

compound
for

it
meant
that

wound

he

be
the

his

his

to
use
real

trick
in

he
would
ask

question
one
at

his

thought
they
knew
the
answer
to
the
first
but
when
the
second
come
along
it
make
themrealize
that
maybe
they
didn
t
he
would
put
up
description
of
two

one
in
terrible
shape
practically
bankrupt
another
in
fine
form
after
askingthe

to

them
he
would
reveal
that
they
be
the

at

when

many

kept

he

it
wasn

even

later
of

it

someone
it

warren
who
idolize
his

have
to
accept
that
graham
view
himimpersonally
so
much
so
that
he
would
not
overrule
a
principle
even
for
the
best
student
who
have
ever
take
his

there
be
no
appeal
at

for
now
chagrin
he
stayed
through

then
once
again
he
pull
himself
together
and
step
aboard
a
train
he
have
two
consolation
he
would
be
back
in
omaha
where
he
felt
he
belong
and
it
would
be
much
easy
to
pursue
his
love
life
there
for
he
have
met
an
omaha
girl
and
be
now
smitten
as
usual
the
girl
he
want
be
not
smitten
with
him
but
this
time
he
be
determine
to
change
her
mind

missnebraska
new
york
city
and
omaha
warren
have
always
be
a
washout
with
girl
he
long
to
have
a
girlfriend
but
the
very
thing
that
make
him
different
hinder
his
quest
nobody
be
more
shy
than
i
be
with
girl
he
say
but
my
reaction
to
that
be
probably
to
turn
into
a
talk
machine
when
he
ran
out
of
word
about
stock
or
politics
he
resort
to
grunt
he
be
afraid
to

he
summon
the
nerve
when

girloccasionally
do
somethingthat
make
him

he
wouldn
t
get

in
general
his
attitude
be
why
would
they
want
to
go
out
with
me
thus
he
didn
t
go
on

when
he
do
somethingalways

wrong
on
a

to
a
baseballgame
with
a

the
high
point

after
that
what
be
there
to

on
a

with
a
shy

like

decision
after

to

he
would
be
livingin
his
parent
home
since
they
be
away
in
washington
but
he
would
have
to
spend
part
of
that
first
summer
after
his
return
fulfillinghis
obligation
to
the
national
guard
though
he
wasn
t
particularly
wellsuited
to
the
guard
it
be
well
than
the
alternative
goingoff
to
fight
in
korea
the
guard
require
himto
attend
trainingcamp
in

severalweeks
every
year
however
trainingcamp
do
nothingto
help
himmature
in
the
national
guard
at
first
the
guy
be
very
suspicious
of
me
because
my
dad
be
in
congress
they
thought
i
be
go
to
be
some
kind
of
prima
donna
or
something
but
that
didn
t
last
long
it
s
a
very
democratic
organization
i
mean
what
you
do
outside
doesn
t
mean
much
to
fit
in
all
you
have
to
do
be
be
willing
to
read
comic
book
about
an
hour
after
i
get
there
i
be
reading
comic
book
everybody
else
be
reading
comic
book
why
shouldn
t
i
my
vocabulary
shrank
to
about
four
word
and
you
can
guess
what
they
be
i
learn
that
it
pay
to
hang
around
with
people
well
than
you
be
because
you
will
float
upward
a
little
bit
and
if
you
hang
around
with
people
that
behave
bad
than
you
pretty
soon
you
ll
start
slide
down
the
pole
it
just
work
that
way
the
experience
give
warren
incentive
to
make
good
on
another
vow
just
as
soon
as
he
get
back
from
national
guard
camp
i
be
terrify
of
public
speak
you
can
t
believe
what
i
be
like
if
i
have
to
give
a
talk
i
be
so
terrify
that
i
just
couldn
t
do
it
i
would
throw
up
in
fact
i
arrange
my
life
so
that
i
never
have
to
get
up
in
front
of
anybody
when
i
come
out
here
to
omaha
after
graduate
i
saw
another
ad
and
i
knew
i
be
go
to
have
to
speak
in
public
sometimes
the
agony
be
such
that
just
to
get
rid
of
the
pain
i
sign
up
for
the
course
again
that
be
not
his
only
mission
to
win
the
heart
of
susan
thompson
he
knew
he
would
have
to
be
able
to
converse
with
her
as
well
the
odds
against
succeedingwith
susie
be
long
but
he
would
do
anythingto
improve
them
and
this
summer
might
be
his
last
chance
the
dale
carnegie
class
met
down
at
the
rome
hotel
a
favorite
of
the
cattleman
i
take
a
hundred
buck
in
cash
and
give
it
to
wally
keenan
the
instructor
and
say
take
it
before
i
change
my
mind
there
be
about
twenty
five
or
thirty
of
us
in
there
we
be
all
just
terrify
we
couldn
t
say
our
own
name
we
all
stood
there
and
wouldn
t
talk
to
each
other
meanwhile
one
thing
that
impressed
me
be
that
after
meeting
all
those
people
once
wally
could
rattle
off
all
our
name
from
memory
he
be
a
good
teacher
and
he
try
to
teach
us
the
memory
association
trick
but
i
never
learn
that
part
they
give
us
this
book
of
speech
keynote
speech
election
speech
lieutenant
governor
s
speech
and
we
be
suppose
to
deliver
these
thing
every
week
the
way
it
work
be
that
you
learn
to
get
out
of
yourself
i
mean
why
should
you
be
able
to
talk
alone
with
somebody
five
minute
before
and
then
freeze
in
front
of
a
group
so
they
teach
you
the
psychological
trick
to
overcome
this
some
of
it
be
just
practice
just
do
it
and
practice
we
really
help
each
other
through
and
it
work

practically
threw
susie
at

who
need
her
suffer
the
injustice
of
beinga
jew
from
literally
the
wrongside
of
the

he
be
all
the
more

because
he
be
the

her

couldn
t
stand
that
summer
brown
be
workingin

have
to
acknowledge
that
because
of
her
father
they
be
off
and
on
she
spent
the
summer
in
tear
meanwhile
despite
her
initial
lack
of

in

susie
could
never

be
wrong
he
be
not
the

i
be
a
wreck
he
recall
he
be
jitteringon
the
brink
of
a
nervous
breakdown
i
felt
odd
i
be
socially
inept
but
beyond
that
i
hadn
t
found
a
cruise
speed
in
life
even
her
friend
notice
the
vulnerability
that
lay
beneath
his
veneer
of
self
assurance
susie
gradually
recognize
how
worthless
he
felt
inside
all
that
confident
chatter
about
stock
the
aura
of
a

in
a
shroud
of
desolation
i
be
a

it
be
incredible
the
way
susie
saw
through
to
some
of
that
indeed
somebody
who
felt
like
a
wreck
and
a
mess
be
catnip
to
susie

later
say
of
her
need
to
turn
himinto
a
cause
that
he
be
jewish
enough
for

a
long
sad
letter

he
knew
she
have
be
out

some
date
with

but
have
no
idea
it
be
anythingserious
warren
go
to
talk
to
susie
s
father
to
get
his
blessing
this
he
already
knew
would
be
easily
have
but
doc
thompson
take
a
while
quite
a
while
to
get
to
the
point
he
start
by
explainingthat
harry
truman
and
the
democrat
be
sendingthe
country
straight
to
hell
pouringmoney
into
europe
after
the
war
through
the
marshall
plan
and
the
berlin
airlift
be
just
proof
that
the
policy
of
that
devil
roosevelt
be
stillin
place
and
that
truman
be
sendingthe
country
straight
into
bankruptcy
look
at
how
the
soviet
get
hold
of
the
atomic
bomb
right
after

have
dismantle

everywhere
the

downright
ineffectual
or
bad
when
it
come
to
dealingwith
communism
truman
have
lose
china
for

he
would
never
be
forgiven
for
firingthe
heroic
general

for
insubordination
after
he
make
repeat

to
go
around
truman
and
get
approval
to
attack
the
chinese
commie
in

but
it
be
probably
too
late
for
even

to

it
in

fromthe

he
want

with
his

to
he
have
earn
seventy
five
percent
in
a
single
year
as
a
matter
of
course
however
he
consult
his
father
and
ben
graham
to
his
surprise
both
say
maybe
you
should
wait
a
few
year
graham
as
always
thought
the

be

high
howard
pessimistic

miningstocks
and

stock
and
other

design
to
protect
against
inflation
he
didn
t
think
any
other
kind
of
business
would
be
a
good
investment
and
he
worried
about
his
son
s
future
that
didn
t
make
sense
to
warren
since
the
value
of
business
have
grown
substantially
it
be
absolutely
the
reverse
effect
of
what
you
saw
in
other
time
when
the
market
be
staggeringly
overvalue
i
have
look
at
company
i
just
couldn
t
see
why
you
wouldn
t
want
to
own
them
it
be
on
a
micro
level
not
an
assessment
of
the
growth
of
the
economy
or
anything
like
that
and
i
be
work
with
micro
money
but
it
just
seem
to
me
that
it
be
crazy
not
to
own
them
on
the
other
hand
here
s
ben
with
his
two
hundred
iq
and
all
experienced
tell
me
to
wait
and
my
dad
who
if
he
told
me
to
walk
out
a
window
i
would
have
do
it
still
to
make
this
decision
to
defy
the
advice
of
his
two
great
authority
his
father
and
ben
graham
be
an
enormous
step
for
him
it
require
himto
consider
the
possibility
that
his
judgment
might
be
superior
to
theirs
and
that
the
two
men
whomhe
most
deeply
respect
be
not
thinkingrationally
yet
he
be
certain
he
be
right
he
might
have
walk
out
a
window
if
his
father
told
himto
but
not
if
it
meant
leavinga
moody
s
manual
fullof
cheap
stock
behind
in
fact
the
opportunity
he
saw
be
so
plentiful
that
they
justified
borrowingmoney
for
the
first
time
he
be
willingto
take
on
debt
equal
to
a
quarter
of
his
net
worth
i
be
already
run
short
of
money
to
invest
if
i
be
enthuse
about
a
stock
i
would
have
to
sell
something
else
to
buy
it
i
have
an
aversion
to
borrowing
money
but
i
get
a
loan
for
five
thousand
dollar
or
so
from
the
omaha
national
bank
i
be
under
twenty
one
and
my
dad
have
to
cosign
the
loan
mr

the
banker
conduct
it
as
a
rite
of
passage
he
say
something
like
you
re
go
into
manhood
now
and
refer
to
this
five
thousand
dollar
say
it
s
a
solemn
obligation
and
we
know
you
ve
get
the
kind
of
character
to
pay
it
back
this
go
on
for
half
an
hour
while
i
be
sit
there
next
to
this
big
desk
howard
probably
felt
both
proud
and
a
little
silly
cosigninga
loan
for
his
son
who
have
be
a
full
fledge
businessman
for
at
least
a
dozen
year
since
warren
have
make
up
his
mind
howard
be
also
willingto
take
him
on
at
his
own
firm
buffett
falk
though
only
after
suggestingthat
he
interview
at
a
prominent
local
firm
kirkpatrick
pettis
co
to
see
what
the
best
of
omaha
stockbrokinghad
to
offer
i
go
to
see
stewart
kirkpatrick
and
say
during
the
interview
that
i
want
intelligent
customer
i
be
go
to
try
to
look
for
people
who
could
understand
thing
and
kirkpatrick
say
in
effect
don
t
worry
about
whether
they
re
intelligent
worry
about
whether
they
re
rich
which
be
okay
you
can
t
knock
him
for
that
but
i
wouldn
t
have
want
to
work
anyplace
but
at
my
dad
s
firm
at
buffett
falk
warren
be
instal
in
one
of
its
four
private
unair
condition
office
next
to
the
cage
a
glass
in
area
where
a
clerk
handle
the
money
and
security
he
start
out
sellinghis
favorite
stock
to
the
safest
people
he
knew
his
aunt
and
his
college
friend
includinghis
first
roommate
at
wharton
chuck
peterson
who
be
now
in
the
real
estate
business
in
omaha
and
with
whomhe
d
reconnected
my
aunt
alice
be
the
first
call
i
make
and
i
sell
her
a
hundred
share
of
geico
she
make
me
feel
good
about
myself
she
be
interested
in
me
and
after
that
fred
stanback
chuck
peterson
and
anybody
i
could
get
to
buy
it
but
mostly
i
get
myself
to
buy
it
because
when
other
people
didn
t
buy
it
i
d
just
figure
out
a
way
to
buy
five
more
share
myself
i
have
this
big
ambition
i
be
go
to
own
one
tenth
of
one
percent
of
the
company
it
have
share
outstanding
and
i
figure
if
the
company
would
become
worth
one
billion
dollar
someday
and
i
own
that
much
i
would
be
worth
a
million
dollar
so
i
need

share
yet

the
meantime

up

warren
who

such
confidence
in

no

narrow
it
down

put
most
of

as
if

she

which
in

she

with
affection
and

one
thingshe
be
firm
about

be
the

of
his
bondingwith

warren
be
not
the
type
to
play
peekaboo
or
take
over

change
but
he
would
singto
little
susie
every
night
i
sang
over
the
rainbow
all
the
time
it
get
to

hypnotic
almost
like
pavlov
s
dog
i
don
t
know
whether
it
be
too
boring
or
what
but
she
d
fall
asleep
as
soon
as
i
start
i
d
put
her
up
on
my
shoulder
and
basically
she

just
sort
of
melt
in
my
arm
havinghit
on
a
reliable
system
warren
never
mess
with
it
while
sing
he
could
easily
be
off

with

well
odds

so
that
his

to

obviously

more
important
to

to
the

to
the
fact
that

it
be
bigsusie
who
jumped
to
the
sound
of

since

have
grown
up
between
a

and
a
mother
who
alternate
grotesque
rage
with
pitter
patter
chatter
perhaps
it
be
not
surprisingthat
he
have
learn
to
shut

in
his
little

in
the

s
third
bedroom
he
could
lose
himself
for
hour
in
his
thought
at
work
he
have
become
absorbed
in
a
complicate
new
project
that
would
become
a
seminal
event
in
his
career
shortly
after
warren
join
graham
newman
the
price
of
cocoa
suddenly
spike
froma
nickel
to
more
than
fifty
cent
a
pound
over
in
brooklyn
rockwood
co
a
chocolate
maker
of
limited
profitability
face
a
dilemma
its
number
one
product
be
rockwood
chocolate
bit
the
kind
of
nugget
use
in
chocolate
chip
cooky
and
the
company
couldn
t
raise
its
price
much
on
this
grocery
item
so
it
begin
runninga
huge
loss
however
with
cocoa
bean
price
so
high
rockwood
also
have
a
chance
to
unload
the
cocoa
bean
it
already
own
to
reap
a
windfall
profit
unfortunately
the
ensuingtax
bill
would
eat
up
more
than
half
those
profit
rockwood
s
owner
approach
graham
newman
as
a
possible
buyer
of
the
company
but
graham
newman
wouldn
t
pay
the
askingprice
so
they
turn
instead
to
the
investor
jay
pritzker
who
have
spot
a
way
to
avoid
the
huge
tax
bill
what
he
realize
be
that
the
u
s
tax
code
say
that
if
a
company
be
reducingthe
scope
of
its
business
it
could
pay
no
tax
on
such
a
partialliquidation
of
its
inventory
so
pritzker
bought
enough
stock
to
take
controlof
rockwood
choosingto
keep
the
company
goingas
a
maker
of
chocolate
bit
and
to
get
out
of
the
cocoa
butter
business
he
attribute
thirteen
million
pound
of
cocoa
bean
to
the
cocoa
butter
side
of
the
business
the
amount
of
bean
that
would
be
liquidate
rather
than
sellthe
bean
for
cash
however
pritzker
offer
themto
the
other
shareholder
in
exchange
for
stock
he
do
so
because
he
want
their
share
to
increase
his
ownership
of
the
company
so
he
offer
them
a
good
deal
as
an
incentive
worth
of
bean
for
share
that
be
tradingat
graham
spot
a
way
to
make
money
fromthis
offer
graham
newman
could
buy
rockwood
stock
and
swap
it
to
pritzker
for
cocoa
bean
it
could
sell
to
make
a
profit
on
every
share
this
be
arbitrage
two
nearly
identical
thing
tradingat
a
different
price
which
enable
a
canny
trader
to
simultaneously
buy
one
and
sellthe
other
and
profit
on
the
difference
with
virtually
no
risk
in
wall
street
the
old
proverb
have
be
reword
as
buffett
write
later
give
a
man
a
fish
and
you
feed
himfor
a
day
teach
a
man
to
arbitrage
and
you
feed
himforever
pritzker
would
give
graham
newman
a
warehouse
certificate
which
be
just
what
it
sound
like
a
piece
of
paper
that
say
the
holder
own
so
many
cocoa
bean
it
could
be
trade
like
a
stock
by
sellingthe
warehouse
certificate
graham
newman
would
make

of

neither
knew
which
way

thus
the

its

time

warren
recognize
the

even
more
financialfireworks
than
graham
newman
have
unlike
ben
graham
he
do
not
do
the

thus
he
do
not
need
to
sell
cocoa
future
either
instead
he
bought
share
of
rockwood
stock
for
himself
and
simply
kept
it
warren
have
thought
through
pritzker
s
offer
carefully
when
he
divide
all
the
bean
rockwood
own
not
just
the
bean
attribute
to
the
cocoa
butter
business
by
the
number
of
rockwood
share
it
amount
to
more
than
the
eighty
pound
per
share
that
pritzker
be
offering
so
people
who
do
not
turn
in
their
share
would
end
up
with
stock
worth
more
cocoa

per

not
only
that
all
the
extra
bean
left
on
the
table
by
those
who
do
turn
in
their
stock
would
bump
the
number
of
bean
per
share
even
more
those
who
kept
their
stock
would
also
profit
because
they
wound
up
with
a
share
of
the
company
s
plant
its
equipment
money

fromcustomers
and
the
rest
of
the
rockwood
business
that
be

beingshut
down
warren
have
invert
the
situation
thinkingabout
it
from
pritzker
s
point
of
view
if
jay
pritzker
be
buying
he
wonder
why
do
it
make
sense
to
sell
and
after
doingthe
math
he
could
see
that
it
didn
t
make
sense
the
side
to
play
on
be
jay
pritzker
s
warren
have
look
at
the
stock
as
a
little
slice
of
the

with
few

outstanding
his
slice
be
worth
more
he
be
takingmore
risk
than
have
he
simply
do
the

but
he
be
also
makinga
calculate

with
odds
heavily
in
his
favor
the
profit
from
the

be

to
earn

and
riskless
when
the

a

however
turn
out
to
be
a

call
those
who
played
the

like
graham

make
their
a

rockwood
stock
which
have
trade
for
before
pritzker

shot
up

it

instead

later
he

could
open
up
a

he
could
about

played
to
his

impress

he
also

he
might

thought
it

even
though
it

he
felt
that

grahamwanted

everyone
followinghis
own
instinct
however
warren
decide
to
visit
the
union
street
railway
on
a
weekend
i
get
up
at
about
four
a
m
and
drove
up
to
new
bedford
mark
duff
be
very
nice
polite
just
as
i
be
about
ready
to
leave
he
say
by
the
way
we
ve
be
think
of
have
a
return
of
capital
distribution
to
shareholder
that
meant
they
be
goingto
give
back
the
extra
money
and
i
say
oh
that
s
nice
and
then
he
say
yes
and
there
s
a
provision
you
may
not
be
aware
of
in
the
massachusetts
statute
on
public
utility
that
you
have
to
do
it
in
multiple
of
the
par
value
of
the
stock
the
stock
have
a
par
value
so
that
meant
it
would
be
payingout
at
least
per
share
and
i
say
well
that
s
a
good
start
then
he
say
bear
in
mind
we
re
think
of
use
two
unit
that
meant
they
be
go
to
declare
a
fifty
dollar
dividend
on
a
stock
that
be
sell
at
thirty
five
or
forty
dollar
at
that
time
so
if
you
bought
a
share
you
get
allyour
money
back
right
away
and
then
some
and
afterward
you
still
own
the
slice
of
the
business
represent
by
your
share
of
stock
i
get
fifty
buck
a

and
i
still
own
stock
in
the
place
and
there
be

in
it
the

where
they

there
precipitate
that

not
the
conflict
wary
buffett
by
now
have
hone
to
a
fine
edge
the
skill
of
gettinghis

without
askingfor

out
loud
thus

might

he
could
not
be

what
have
prompt
duff

what

to

that
he
get
the
result
he
want
without
a

he
have
make
about
on
this
trade
who
knew
there
be
so
much
money
in

nobody
in
the
history
of
the
buffett
family
have
ever
make
on
one
idea
in
that
be
several
time
more
than
the

person
earn
for
a
whole
year
s
work
doublingyour
money
and
then
some
for
a
few
week
work
be
spectacular
and
yet
what
be
more
important

jerry

jerry

son
mickey
would
stay
on
in
the
springof
graham
give
notice
to
his

but
first
he
offer
warren
the
opportunity
to
become
a
generalpartner
in
the
firm
that
he
would
choose
someone
of
warren

age
and
experience
show
how
valuable
he
have
make
himself
in
such
a
short
time
nevertheless
if
i
have
stayed
i
would
have

of
the
ben
graham
of
it
and
mickey
would
have
be
the
jerry
newman
of
it
but
mickey
would
have
be
the
senior
partner
by
mile
it
would
have
be
call
newman
buffett
even
though
warren
be
flatter
he
have
go
to
graham
newman
to
work
for
ben
it
wasn
t
worth
it
to
him
to
stay
not
even
to
be
thought
of
as
graham
s
intellectual
heir
moreover
all
the
while
that
he
be
carryingout

all
the
time
above
all
he
be
not
cut
out
to
work
with
a

of
all
as
someone

he
turn

down

hiddensplendor
omaha
ihad
about
and
i
be
go
to
retire
i
rent
a
house
at
underwood
in
omaha
for
a
month
we
d
live
on
a
year
my
capital
would
grow
in
retrospect
it
would
strike
people
as
odd
that
at
the
age
of
twenty
six
warren
use
the
term
retire
maybe
it
be
a
way
to
downplay
expectation
or
maybe
it
refer
to
his
notion
of
capital
as
money
that
work
as
a
sort
of
servant
to
make
you
rich
the
overseer
of
capital
be
not
an
employee
mathematically
speak
warren
could
theoretically
retire
on
his
own
money
and
still
reach
his
goal
of
beinga
millionaire
by
age
thirty
five
since
enteringcolumbia
with
he
have
grown
his
money
by
more
than
sixty
one
percent
a
year
but
he
be
in
a
hurry
and
it
would
require
a
very
aggressive
compoundingrate
to
meet
his
goal
therefore
he
have
decide
to
start
a
partnership
like
graham
newman
s
sister
hedge
fund
newman
graham
it
be
possible
that
he
do
not
think
of
this
as
havinga
job
in
fact
it
be
a
near
perfect
way
of
not
havinga
job
he
would
have
no
bos
could
invest
from
his
house
and
could
put
friend
and
relative
into
the
same
stock
that
he
would
have
bought
for
himself
if
he
take
a
quarter
of
every
dollar
he
earn
for
these
partner
as
a
fee
and
then
reinvested
that
in
the
partnership
he
could
be
a
millionaire
much
faster
arm
with
ben
graham
s
method
of
buyingstocks
and
a
graham
like
hedge
fund
he
have
every
reason
to
think
of
himself
as
a
rich
man
there
be
only
one
problemwith
his
idea
he
couldn
t
tolerate
it
if
his
partner
criticize
himbecause
the
stock
go
down
but
warren
have
figure

manage
the

i
be
brimming

i
be
not

actually
by
most
of
the

warren
be
brimmingwith

but
he
view
the

as
a

once
money
go
into
it
he
do
not
intend
to
make
withdrawal
so
he
need
to

the
a

would
live
on
from
the

of
his

above
a
four
percent
threshold
and
i
take

myself
so
if
i
broke
even
i
lose

arrangement
he
could
have
invite
gottschaldt

elberfeld
into
the

but
he
felt
that
it

that
you
paid

and
howard
s

hayden
be
buyingits

for
around

thus
as
with
the
rarest
and
most
attractive
of
the
cheap
stock
that
warren
stalk
the
ahmansons
could
pay
virtually
the

out
of
one
year
s

from
that
single

national

be
the
cheapest
stock
warren
have
ever
see
except
for
western

and
it
be
a
nice
little
company
too
not
a
soggy
cigar
butt
i
try
to
buy
the
stock
for
a
long
time
but
none
of
it
be
get
to
me
because
there
be
a
security
dealer
in

and
hayden
have
give
this
guy
the
shareholder
list
this
stockbroker
he
regard
me
as
a
punk
kid
but
he
have
the
list
and
i
didn
t
have
the
list
so
he
be
buying
the
stock
at
thirty
for
hayden
s
account
cash
on
the
barrelfromhayden
ahmanson
sound
good
to
some
of
the
farmer
compare
to
their
worthless
certificate
though
they
have
paid
around
per

many
year
before
and
be
only
receive
many
of
themhad
gradually
convince
themselves
that
they
be
well
off
without
the

warren
be
determine
i
look
it
up
in
some
insurance
book
or
something
if
you
go
back
to
the
twenty
you
could
see
who
be
the
director
they
make
some
of
these
big
stockholder
the
director
from
the
town
they
work
the
hardest
for
sale
there
be
a
town
call
ewing
nebraska
which
have
get
no
population
at
all
but
somebody
sell
a
lot
of
stock
out
there
and
that
s
how
they
probably
get
the
local
banker
on
the
board
thirty
five
year
earlier
so
dan
monen
warren
s
partner
and
proxy
go
off
to
the
countryside
carryingwads
of
warren
s
money
and
some
of
his
own
he
cruise
around
the
state
in
a
red
and
white
chevrolet
showingup
in
rural
county
courthouse
and

casually
askingwho
might
own

he
sat
on

porch
drinkingiced
tea
eatingpie
with

their
wife
and
offeringcash
for
their
stock
certificate
i
didn
t
want
howard
to
know
because
i
be
top
his
price
he
have
be
pick
it
off
at
thirty
buck
and
i
d
have
to
raise
the
price
some
the
shareholder
have
be
listen
for
probably
ten
year
at
thirty
buck
so
it
be
the
first
time
the
price
move
the
first
year
warren
paid
each
for
five
share
of
the
stock
the
farmer
ear
pricked
up
now
they
realize
that
buyer
be
competingfor
the
stock
they
begin
to
think
maybe
they
weren
t
well
off
without
it
the
price
have
to
keep
movingup
finally
toward
the
end
i
paid
a
hundred
that
be
the
magic
number
because
it
be
what
they
d
paid
in
the
first
place
a
hundred
buck
i
knew
would
bring
out
all
the
stock
and
sure
enough
one
guy
come
in
when
dan
monen
be
do
this
and
he
say
we
bought
this
like

sheep
and
we
re
sell
it
like
sheep
that
they
be
many
have
sell
at
less
than
three
time
the
a
year
the
company
be
earn
monen
eventually
accumulate
two
thousand

ten
percent
of
national
american

stock
warren
kept
it
in
the

with
a
power
of
attorney
attach
that
give
himcontrol
rather
than
transferringit
into
his
name
that
would
have
tipped
howard
off
to
the
fact
that
i
be
out
there
compete
with
him
he
didn
t
know
or
if
he
do
he
have
insufficient
information
i
just
kept
collect
share
then
the
day
i
walk
into
hayden
s
office
i
plopped
them
all
down
and
say
i
want
to
transfer
them
to
my

and
he
say
my

s
go
to
kill
me
but
in
the
end
he
transfer
the

the

have
be
more
than
just
the

as

to

he
have
always
thought
this
way
a

ala
this
voracious
instinct
could
steer
himawry
on

tomknapp
who
have
go
to
work
for
a
small

tweedy
browne
and
reilly
after
helpingjerry
newman
close
down
the
remnant
of
graham
newman
come
out
to
visit

and
to
go
hear
ben
graham
give
a
speech
in
beloit
wisconsin
drive
through
the
iowa
cornfield
on
the
way
knapp
mention
that
the
u
s
government
be
about
to
take
the
four
cent
blue
eagle
stamp
out
of
circulation
the
cash
register
ding
in
warren
s
head
let
s
stop
at
a
few
post
office
and
see
if
they
have
any
four
cent
stamp
he
say
on
the
way
back
knapp
go
into
the
first
post
office
and
return
to
say
that
it
have
twenty
eight
stamp
go
buy
them
say
buffett
they
talk
about
it
some
more
and
decide
to
write
to
post
office
after
they
return
home
to
offer
to
buy
their
stamp
inventory
the
stamp
start
comingin
a
few
thousand
at
a
time
then
denver
reply
and
say
they
have
twenty
pad
a
pad
be
a
hundred
sheet
of
a
hundred
stamp
that
meant
denver
have
two
hundred
thousand
stamp
we
might
as
wellcontrol
the
issue
warren
say
they
spent
and
bought
the
pad
and
that
be
our
mistake
say
knapp
we
should
have
let
the
denver
post
office
send
them
back
to
washington
to
reduce
the
supply
through
expendingenormous
effort
to
become
virtual
post
office
themselves
with
most
of
the
work
do
by
knapp
they
gather
more
than
six
hundred
thousand
blue
eagle
stamp
collectively
spendingroughly
for
warren
that
be
a
lot
consideringhis
attitude
about
money
and
his
net
worth
they
store
the
pile
of
stamp
in
their
basement
and
then
they
realize
what
they
have
do
they
have
laboriously
acquire
basement
full
of
stamp
that
would
never
be
worth
more
than
four
cent
apiece
when
you
have
so
many
stamp
knapp
explains
there
be
not
many
collector
so
the
next
task
become
disposingof
the
stamp
warren
expertly
delegate
the
problemof
gettingrid
of
worth
of

tom
then
he
simply
put
it
out
of
his
mind

for
the
funny
story
and
instead
turn

to
consider
invest
with

afterward

meetingwith

a
sunday

about
an
hour
i
say

look
about
twenty
year
old
at
the
time

more
like
eighteen
accordingto
eddie
davis
his
collar
be
open
his
coat
be
too
big
he
talk
so
very
fast
at
the
time
warren
go
around
omaha
wearinga
mangy
sweater
which
one
person
observe
probably
should
have
be
give
to
goodwill
an
old
pair
of
pant
and
scuffed
shoe
i
act
immature
for
my
age
buffett
recall
the
kind
of
thing
i
talk
about
be
what
you
would
expect
from
a
much
young
person
in
fact
there
be
still
more
than
a
trace
of
the
hand
drum
mammy
singingboy
frompenn
you
have
to
overlook
a
lot
back
then
yet
not
when
he
be
talkingabout
the
partnership
warren
be
not
there
to
sellthe
davis
he
laid
out
his
ground
rule
he
want
absolute
control
over
the
money
and
would
tellhis
partner
nothingabout
how
it
be
invest
that
be
the
stickingpoint
not
for
him
be
ben
graham
s
handicap
of
people
ridingon
his
coattail
and
his
solution
to
the
problemof
people
beingdisappointed
be
that
he
wasn
t
goingto
give
them
the
score
after
every
hole
only
once
a
year
after
playingeighteen
hole
they
would
get
an
annual
summary
of
his
performance
and
they
could
put
money
in
or
withdraw
it
only
on
december
the
rest
of
the
year
their
money
would
be
lock
into
the
partnership
all
the
while
eddie
paid
no
attention
to
me
dorothy
davis
listen
very
intently
ask
good
question
eddie
be
over
in
the
corner
do
nothing
he
seem
like
a
very
old
guy
to
me
but
he
be
not
yet
seventy
when
we
get
all
the
way
through
dorothy
turn
to
eddie
and
say
what
do
you
think
eddie
say
let
s
give
him
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
in
a
much
more
polite
way
i
say
dr
davis
you
know
i
m
delighted
to
get
this
money
but
you
weren
t
really
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
me
while
i
be
talk
how
come
you
re
do
it

and
he
say
well
you
remind
me
of
charlie
munger
i
say
well
i
don
t
know
who
charlie
munger
be
but
i
really
like
him
but
the
other
reason
the
davis
be
so
willingto
invest
with
warren
be
because
to
their
surprise
he
knew
more
about
arthur
wiesenberger
than
they
do
they
also
like
the
way
he
laid
out
his
term
clear
and
transparent
so
they
knew
whose
side
he
be
on
he
would
win
or
lose
alongwith
them
as
dorothy
davis
put
it
he
s
smart
he
s
bright
and
i
can
tell
he
s
honest
i
like
everythingabout
this
young
man
on
august
the
money
fromthe
davis
and
their
three
child
seed
the
fifth
partnership
with
it
be
call
dacee
with
dacee
warren
s
business
jumped
another
legupward
he
could
now
land
big
position
in
large
stock
in
his
personalportfolio
he
still
played
with
thing
like
the
penny
uraniumstocks
that
have
be
in
vogue
a
few
year
earlier
when
the
government
be
buyinguranium
these
be
now
fantastically
cheap
warren
bought
company
like
hidden
splendor
stanrock
northspan
there
be
some
attractive
issue
it
be
shoot
fish
in
a
barrel
they
weren
t
huge
fish
but
you
be
shoot
them
in
a
barrel
you
knew
you
be
go
to
make
good
money
it
be
minor
the
big
stuff
i
be
put
in
the
partnership
havingnew
partner
meant
more
money
of
course
but
it
also
meant
that
the
number
of
stock
certificate
and
amount
of
paperwork
managingthe
five
partnership
plus
buffett
buffett
increase
substantially
he
have
to
hustle
but
it
felt
good
the
shortfall
as
always
be
money
he
never
seem
to
have
enough
the
kind
of
company
he
be
researchingoften
have
market
value
of
one
to
ten
million
dollar
so
he
want
as
much
as
to
get
a
significant
position
in
their
stock
gettingmore
money
to
manage
be
key
by
this
time
dan
monen
be
ready
to
get
back
into
the
partnership
and
he
and
his
wife
mary
ellen
form
the
nucleus
of
warren
s
sixth
partnership
mo
buff
on
may
thanks
mostly
to
nationalamerican
the
monens
who
have
have
only
to
invest
two
year
earlier
be
now
able
to
put
in
at
the
time
warren
buffett
probably
understood
the
potential
of
money
management
to
beget
more
money
well
than
anyone
on
wall
street
every
dollar
add
to
a
partnership
would
net
hima
share
of
what
he
earn
for
his
partner
each
of
those
dollar
reinvested
would
generate
earnings
of
its
own
those
earnings
reinvested
would
beget
stillmore
earnings
the
well
his
performance
the
more
he
would
earn
and
the
large
his
share
of
the
partnership
would
grow
enablinghimto
earn
even
more
his
talent
for
investingcould
exploit
that
potential
of
managingmoney
to
the
hilt
and
despite
warren
s
apparent
awkwardness
he
be
indisputably
successful
at
merchandisinghimself
even
though
he
be
nearly
invisible
in
the
investingworld
the
snowballwas
startingto
roll
with

him
warren
realize
it
be
time
to
leave
a

where
there
be
barely
roomfor
a
family
with
two
youngchildren
one
an
unusually
energetic
three
and
a
half
year
old
and
a
third
on
the
way
the

folly
in
his
mind
be
a
million
dollar
after
compoundingfor
a
dozen
year
or
so
because
he
could
invest
it
at
such
an
impressive
rate
of
return
thus
he
felt
as
though
he
be
spendingan
outrageous
million
dollar
on
the
house
just
before
the

but
with
a
very
different
connotation
as
soon
as
howie
could
walk
say
buffett
he
become
peripatetic
he
dugup
the
garden
with
his
tonka
toy
and
susie
take
them
away
then
he
tore
the

apart
to
find
them
once
he
do
he
dugthe

up
again
susie
snatch
away
the
front
loader
and
the
battle
repeat
itself
a
week
after
arrivingat

and
just
a
day
before
the
mo

be
born

second
son

arrive
fromthe
start
he
be
a
quiet
easy
baby
but
shortly
after
his
birth
susie
come
down
with
a
kidney
infection
since
her
rheumatic
fever
and
ear
infection
as
a
child
she
have
always
consider
herself
healthy
the
kidney
infection
do
not
concern
her
as
much
as
shieldingwarren
from
dealingwith
it
his
discomfort
around
illness
be
so
great
that
she
have
train
the
family
to
pay
attention
to
him
whenever
somebody
get
sick
as
if
he
too
be
illand
require
care
her
real
focus
be
on
havinga
home
of
her
own
at
last
even
illness
and
the
demand
of
caringfor
a
new
baby
and
two
smallchildren
could
not
suppress
her
urge
to
decorate
as
it
sprangto
life
she
redid
the
house
in
cheery
contemporary
style
with
chrome
and
leather
furniture
and
huge
bright
modern
painting
coveringthe

almost
half
of
what
the

have
cost
which
just
about
kill
warren
accordingto
bob
billig
a
golfingpal
he
didn
t
notice
color
or
respond
to

and
so
be
indifferent
to
the
result
seeingonly
the
outrageous
bill
do
i
really
want
to
spend
for
this
haircut
be
his
attitude
if
susie
want
to
spend
some
trifle
sum
of
money
he
would
say
i
mnot
sure
i
want
to
blow
that
way
but
since
susie
want
to
spend
money
that
he
want
to
withhold
and
since
he
want
susie
to
be
happy
and
she
want
to
please
him
their
personality
be
gradually

of

illness
almost
unbearable
the
loneliness

let
himself
dwell
on
the
negative
that
could
come
across
as
pragmatic
or
even
callous
but
he
view
it
as
keepingthe

his
method
of
analyzingthe

make
him
pessimistic
however
charlie

beneath
the

him
a
genuine
humility
that

be
crucial
in

with
the

he
be
about
to

as
soon
as

the

sanborn

almost
entirely
of

its
big
customer
so
it
operate
more
like
a

that
the

more
than

at
the
meeting
warren
propose
that
the

distribute
the

longdisappeared
the
board
respond
to
the
idea
of
separatingthe
investment

fromthe

as
preposterous
then
toward
the
end
of
the

the

broke
out
the

around

have
already
submit

to

the
stickingpoint

it
would
have

buffett
rode
back
to

lookingat

three
day
later
he
threaten

the

unless
the
director
take
action
by
october
his
patience
have
run
out
now
the
board
have
no
choice
it
agree
to
split
the
two
business
even
so
the
issue
remain
of
how
to
deal
with
the
tax
one
of
the
insurance
men
say
let
s
just
swallow
the
tax
and
i
say
wait
a
minute
let
s
let
s
be
a
contraction
it
mean
let
us
who
be
this
us
if
everyone
around
the
table
want
to
do
it
per
caput
that
s
fine
but
if
you
want
to
do
it
in
a
ratio
of
share
own
and
you
get
ten
share
worth
of
tax
and
i
get
twenty
four
thousand
share
worth
forget
it
he
be
talk
about
swallow
two
million
dollar
worth
of
tax
just
because
he
didn
t
want
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
do

the
share
buyback
i
remember
the
cigar
get
pass
around
i
be
pay
for
thirty
percent
of
every
one
of
those
cigar
i
be
the
only
guy
not
smoking
cigar
they
should
have
paid
for
a
third
of
my
bubble
gum
in
the
end
however
the
board
capitulate
thus
through
force
of
energy
organization
and
will
early
in

won
the

the

deal
set
a
new
high

mark
buffett
could
use
his

his

to
alter
the

as

he
felt
he
could
not
rightly
urge
other
investor
to
sellwhen
he
be
buying
he
even
bent
over
backward
to
warn
themthat
he
thought
dempster
stock
would
do
well
nevertheless
money
and
human
nature
could
be
count
on
to
do
their
job
people
convince
themselves
that
they
would
rather
have
the
cash
than
a
thinly
trade
stock
of

therefore
dempster
make
up
twenty
one
percent

in
july
warren
write

have
invest
in
a

company
that
might
prove
to
be
a

it
give
strong
promise
of
superior
result
over
a
several
year
period
he
name
dempster

the

about
it
in

the

prescient
than
he
expect
during
buffett
coached
lee
dimon
and
try
to
explain
to
himhow
to

dimon
seem
to
think
he
could
just
keep

no
matter
how
many
windmill
dempster
sell
as
a
former

he
knew
how
to

so
he
do

himself
it
s
no
coincidence
that
the
year
he
start

be
the
same
year
he
start
his
new
law
firm
the
partner
at
the

found
it
abhorrent
that
a

in

would
want
to
be

sat

that
they

would
come
when
every

have
a

this
be
probably
apocryphal

you
can
easily
picture
charlie
deliver
that
message
to
them
as
a
part
shot
at
their

twenty
five
percent
the

as
a
prescriptionist
by
the
time
munger
met
him
the
lean
handsome
guerin
have
learn
to
roll
his
crisp
shirt
cuff
down
over
his
tan
forearmto
cover
his
tattoo
he
seem
to
have
a
great
number
of
friend
as
well
as
a
tinge
of
hollywood
in
his
blood
one
day
he
brought
his
friend
the
actor
charlton
heston
down
to
the
exchange
for
a
tour
he
do
the
tradingfor
wheeler
munger
and
say
he
immediately
recognize
that
munger
have
a
money
mind
and
begin
to
cultivate
him
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
d
be
on
the
wrongside
of
the
wheeler
deal
right
away
and
begin
to
emulate
munger
and
buffett
with
the
goal
of
forminghis
own
investingpartnership
with
some
the
idea
of
buying
dollar
bill
for
forty
cent
take
and
with
some
it
doesn
t
take
it
s
like
an
inoculation
it
s
extraordinary
to
me
if
it
doesn
t
grab
them
right
away
i
find
that
you
can
talk
to
them
for
year
and
show
them
record
you
can
do
everything
and
it
just
doesn
t
make
any
difference
i
ve
never
see
anyone
who
become
a
convert
over
a
ten
year
period
with
this
approach
it
s
always
instant
recognition
or
nothing
whatever
it
be
i
ve
never
understood
it
but
with
a
fellow
like
rick
guerin
no
business
background
in
term
of
study
it
but
he
saw
it
like
that
he
understood
what
it
s
about
and
he
be
apply
it
five
minute
later
and
rick
be
smart
enough
to
know
that
you
should
get
a
great
teacher
which
be
what
i
be
lucky
enough
to
do
with
ben
graham
as
the
day
progress
at
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange
munger
would
sit
lose
in
thought
usually
reading
charlie
charlie
ed
anderson
would
shout
from
the
next
desk
munger
would
say
nothing
or
grunt
somethingin
response
eventually
anderson
learn
to
make
munger
respond
clearly
to
question
erasingambiguity
a
simple
grunt
be
not
sufficient
but
it
take
time
and
experience
for
most
people
to
figure
out
that
munger
s
mind
and
mouth
often
go
their
separate
way
guerin
do
not
know
this
yet
one
day
he
come
into
the

be
an
object
lesson
say
anderson
munger
bought
cigar
butt
do
arbitrage
even
acquire
smallbusinesses
much
of
this
in
buffett
s
style
but
he
seem
to
be
headingin
a
slightly
different
direction
than
buffett
periodically
he
say
to
ed
anderson
i
just
like
the
great
business
he
told
anderson
to
write
up
company
like
allergan
the
contact
lens
solution
maker
anderson
misunderstood
and
write
a
grahamian
report
emphasizingthe
company
s
balance
sheet
munger
dress
himdown
for
it
he
want
to
hear
about
the
intangible
quality
of
allergan
the
strength
of
its
management
the
durability
of
its
brand
what
it
would
take
for
someone
else
to
compete
with
it
munger
have
invest
in
a
caterpillar
tractor
dealership
and
saw
how
it
gobble
up
money
which
sat
in
the
yard
in
the
formof
slow
sellingtractors
to
grow
the
business
have
to

munger
want
to
own
a
business
that
do
not
require
continualinvestment
and
spat
out
more
cash
than
it
consume
but
what
be
the
quality
of
such
a
business
and
what
give
such
a
business
an
endure
competitive
advantage
munger
be
always
askingpeople
what
s
the
best
business
you
ve
ever
heard
of
but
he
be
a
man
of
no
great
patience
and
inclined
to
think
that
people
could
read
his
mind
his
impatience
stood
out
more
than
any
theory
that
be
emerginginside
his
head
he
want
to
get
really
rich
really
fast
he
and
roy
tolles
make
bet
on
whose
portfolio
would
be
up
more
than
one
hundred
percent
in
a
year
and
he
be
willingto
borrow
money
to
make
money
whereas
buffett
have
never
borrow
a
significant
sum
in
his
life
i
need
three
million
dollar
munger
would
say
on
one
of
his
frequent
visit
to
the
union
bank
of
california
sign
here
the
bank
would
reply
with
these
huge
sum
munger
do
enormous
trade
like
british
columbia
power
which
be
sellingat
around
and
beingtaken
over
by
the
canadian
government
at
a
little
more
than
munger
put
not
just
his
whole
partnership
but
all
the
money
he
have
and
all
that
he
could
borrow
into
an
arbitrage
on
this
single
stock
but
only
because
there
be
almost
no
chance
that
this
dealwould
fallapart
when
the
transaction
go
through
the
deal
paid
off
handsomely
yet
despite
their
different
approach
munger
regard
buffett
as
the
kingof
invest
and
saw
himself
as
merely
a
friendly
pretender
to
the
throne
vivian
get
me
warren
he
shout
severaltimes
a
day
to
whichever
secretary
have
come
to
occupy
vivian
s
desk
he
cultivate
buffett
like
a
garden
he
be
tend
buffett
explain
his
philosophy
you
ve
get
to
coattail
he
say
but
he
do
not
want
his
friend
to
coattail
him
and
consider
it
unethical
when
they
do
hence
while
munger
cultivatingbuffett
be
open
about
his
trade
he
get
buffett
into
his
british
columbia
power
deal
for
example
buffett
always
kept
his
trade
to
himself
unless
he
be
workingan
idea
with
a
partner
by
the
early
s
the
buffetts
have
begin
to
vacation
in
california
so
that
warren
could
spend
more
time
with
graham
and
munger
once
warren
and
susie
take
the
kid
on
a
longtrip
up
and
down
the
coast
but
usually
when
they
come
to
visit
they
d
settle
into
a
motel
on
santa
monica
boulevard
and
he
and
munger
would
talk
stock
for
hour
the
difference
in
their
philosophy
make
for
longconversations
while
buffett
make
many
of
the
same
investment
he
would
forgo
the
chance
of
profit
any
day
to
avoid
too
much
risk
and
view
preservinghis
capitalas
an
almost
holy
imperative
munger
have
the
attitude
that
unless
you
be
already
wealthy
you
could
afford
to
take
some
risk
if
the
odds
be
right
to
get
rich
his
audacity
put
him
in
a
different
category
fromallthe
others
who
cultivate
buffett
for
his
deference
to
buffett
be
limited
by
his
high
opinion
of
himself
charlie
would
get
so
excite
by
his
own
word
that
he
d
hyperventilate

that
he
consider
the

more
fraught
with
hazard
than
ripe
with

the

have
by
then
become
arguably
the
world
s
most
important
and
legitimate
dealer
in
soybean
oil
it
apparently
struck
de
angelis
one
day
that
no
one
actually
knew
how
much
oilwas
in
his
warehouse
he
be
usingthe

as

frombanks
as
longas
nobody
knew
how
much

in
the

why
not
goose
up
the
number
a
little
bit
so
he
could
borrow
more
money
the

sat
in
a
warehouse
in
bayonne
new

which
be
manage
by
a
tiny
subsidiary
that
be
an
almost
invisible
part
of
the
gigantic
empire
of
american

this

issue
warehouse
receipt
document
that
certify
how
much
oil
be
in
a
tank
and
could
be
bought
and
sell
just
like
the

receipt
for
cocoa

that
graham
newman
have
bought
fromjay

in

use
them

fifty

furthermore
american

stood
as

of

those

as
for
the

they
be
connect
by
a
systemof
pipe

and
de
angelis
found
that
the
soybean
oilcould
be
slosh
and
shunt
around
from
one
tank
to
another
thus
a
gallon
of
oilcould
pull
double
or
triple
or
quadruple
duty
as
collateralfor
a
loan
pretty
soon
the
loan
guaranteed
by
warehouse
receipt
be
secure
by
a
small
and
small
amount
of
soybean
oil
eventually
it
occur
to
de
angelis
that
in
fact
very
little
oilwas
need
indeed
just
enough
to
fool
the
inspector
would
do
the
trick
so
the
tank
be
fill
with
seawater
and
oilwas
place
inside
a
little
tube
that
the
inspector
use
to
guide
their
measuringsticks
they
do
not
notice
the

or
think
to

they
be

the

graham

have

to

in
the
price
of

for
a

or
two
per

de

at

the

thus

american

have
do
wrong
and
he

that
the

the

it

our

that
three

four
year
from

this

may
well
have
add
to

which
be

but
american

wasn
t
offeringthe

that
an
american

that
take

paid
the

to

would
be

more

for

he

in

he

not

warren

fromthe

buffett
say
of
this
his
favorite
approach
the
more
sure
money
tends
to
be
make
on
the
obvious
quantitative

but
the
method
have
a
couple
of
drawback
the
number

have
have
what
he
would
later
calla
high

insight
about
american

that
confound
ben

that
could
be

and
if

liquidate
american

have
little
more
than

that
charlie

have
be
talk
about
when
he
spoke
of
the
great

this
be
the
method
of
the
class
handicapper
of
phil
fisher
and
it
involve
qualitative
as
oppose
to
quantitative
assessment
buffett
would
later
write
to
the
partner
that
buying
the
right
company
with
the
right
prospect
inherent
industry
condition
management
etc
mean
the

will
take

this
be
what
cause
the

to
really
sing
however
it
be
an
infrequent
occurrence
as

usually

of
course
no
insight

on
the
quantitative
side
the
figure
should
hit
you
over
the
head
with
a
baseball
bat

so
the
really
big
money
tends
to
be
make
by
investor
who
be
right
on
qualitative
decision
this
new
emphasis
on
a
qualitative
approach
paid
off
in
the
stupendous
result
buffett
be
able
to
announce
to
his
partner
at
the
end
of
when
buffett
make
his
annual
report
to

he
compare
the
huge
gain
to
an
earlier
prediction
that
he

ten

a

naturally
no

publicly
humiliate
by
such
a
mistake
it
be
unlikely
to
be
repeat
despite
the
irony
he
have
begin
a
tradition
of

high
expectation
as
his

some

this
be
exactly
what

predicate
on
the
theory
that
eventually
seabury

buy
him
out
he
want
the
berkshire

not

in

seabury

have
so
far
withstood
the

of

and
hurricane
carol
instead
of

gettingbuffetted
there
be
a
chance
that
buffett
could
get

eventually
warren
drove
up
to
new
bedford
to
see
the
place
for
himself
for
once
he
be
not

and
up
the

he
saw
that
there

this
clearly
be
a

to
summoningpeople

himwhile
he
sat
behind
his
desk
and
direct
them
what
to

the
two
men
seat
themselves
at
the
uncomfortable
rectangular
glass
conference
table
in
a
corner
and
buffett
ask
where
stanton
stood
on
the

stanton
look
at
himthrough
the

glass
perch
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
he
be
reasonably
cordial
but
then
he
say
we
ll
probably
have
a
tender
one
of
these
day
and
what
price
would
you
sell
at
mr
buffett
or
word
to
that
effect
the
stock
at
the
time
be
sell
at
something
like
or
a

i
say
i
d
sell
at
a

on
a
tender
offer
if
they
have
one
and
he

well
will
you
promise
me
that
if
we
have
a
tender

you
ll

i
say
well
you
know
if
it
s

reasonably
near
future
but
not
if
it
s
twenty
year
from
now
but
i
say
fine
so
now
i
be
frozen
i
felt
that
i
couldn
t
buy
any
more
stock
because
i
knew
too
much
about
what
he
might
do
so
i
go
home
and
not

long
after
a

the

and
stanton
deny

he
told
cowin
that
it
be

have
always
felt
she
have
let
the
whole

down
with
her
divorce
from

the
contrast
between

only
reinforce

shortly
before
his

howard
have
told
her
that
she
must
remarry
to

person
who
ask
her
he
be
a
lovable
man
but
doris
felt
coerce
into
remarry
which
augur
poorly
for
the
union
s
prospect
bertie
always
the
least
troubled
by
her
mother
s
behavior
and
the

dependent
on
her
father
now
found
her
life
the
least
change
by
her
father
s
death
like
warren
however
her
relationship
with
money
both
trigger
her
anxiety
and
give
her
a
sense
of
control
she
kept
record
of
every
dollar
she
spent
and
when
she
felt
stress
she
paid
bill
to
relax
allof
the
buffetts
have
issue
with
money
that
ran
so
deep
none
of
themreally
notice
what
an
unusual
family
they
be
after
howard
s
death
warren
and
susie
naturally
assume
leadership
of
the
family
partly
because
of
their
money
but
also
through
the
force
of
their
personality
leila
and
doris
and
bertie
look
to
warren
and
susie
for
support
and
so
do
virtually
everyone
else
warren
s
uncle
fred
buffett
and
his
wife
katie
who
now
own
the
grocery
store
give
warren
a
run
for
his
money
in
the
family
s
cheapskate
contest
they
be
especially
attach
to
warren
and
susie
and
grow
more
so
as
their
nephew
s
stature
and
wealth
increase
leila
who
have
always
be
jealous
of
her
sister
in
law
fixate
on
an
incident
many
year
before
in
which
ernest
have
dance
with
the
vivacious
katie
and
not
her
at
a
rotary
club
dance
now
she
grow
even
more
jealous
of
katie
and
susie
who
be
trust
by
everyone
have
to
juggle

to
separate

give
allthe
work
to
separate
leila
from

fromkatie
susie
be
an
expert
juggler
by
the
time
she
have
nurse
howard
through
his
finalillness
perhaps
it
be
not
surprising
therefore
that
warren
s
aunt
alice
his
favorite
relative
since
childhood
have
grown
to
trust
susie

it

that

that

a

who

he
start

a

therefore
socialconsciousness
clashed
with
the
need
to
make
a

warren
however
saw
himself
as
workingfor
his

and
as
someone
whose
business
acumen

money
help
the

so
he
could
focus

these

translate

but
the
concept
of
great
business
have
not

sunk

closer

have
ever
actually
be

would
be
he
be
determine
to

its
proprietor
the
kohn
family
drove
old

and
live
modestly
just
the
kind
of
people
buffett
like
martin

ceo
have
call
gottesman

probably
accept
a
discount
price
the
kohns
take
enormous
pride
in
this
store
say
gottesman
but
if
it
have
a
good
dress
department
they
never
bought
a

there
it
be
too
expensive
for
them
when
charlie

be
in
omaha
he
buffett
and
gottesman
usually
played
a

although
they
like
the
same
kind
of
stock
the
three
have
never
partner
on
a
deal
this
time
gottesman
call
buffett
and
told
himthe
part
about
hochschild
kohn

after

characteristically
do
not

how

little
old
hochschild
kohn
he
have
never
borrow
any
significant
money
to
buy
a

they
figure
the
margin

rate
be
cheap
at
the
time
profit

be
thin
but
as
those
profit
grow
over
the

the
interest
on
the

would
stay
the

would
flow
to
themselves
if
the

grow
over

buyinghochschild

strategized
with

he
be
already

of
louis

he
be
as
high

a

that
you
could
ever
imagine
have
an
iq
way
up
there
very
decent
guy
and
he
come
into
the
partnership
when
we
bought
hochschild

i
love
the

the

be
another

for

with
meaningthat

and
kohn
could
talk

while
susie
entertain
kohn
s
wife
the
buffetts
social
life
by
now
include
a
significant
number
of
people
who
live
outside
of
omaha
people
they
usually
saw
on
one
of
warren
s
business
trip
or
as
now
when
friend
visit
the
buffetts
in
california
but
buffett
begin
to
grow
concerned
on
his
next
trip
to
baltimore
when
kohn
show
hima
plan
the
company
have
be
developingfor
some
time
to
build
two
new
store
one
in
york
pennsylvania
the
other
in
maryland
the
idea
be
to
capitalize
on
the
exodus
from
city
to
suburb
that
be
sendingpeople
to
suburban
shoppingmalls
they
d
be
planning
those
two
store
for
a
couple
of
year
the
guy
that
have
the
men
s
furnishing
department
have
his
section
laid
out
he
knew
exactly
how
he
be
go
to
decorate
it
the
woman
who
ran
the
high
price
dress
department
have
hers
all
plan
too
buffett
didn
t
like
confrontation
and
dread
disappointingpeople
but
he
and
charlie
agree
that
neither
of
these
location
make
sense
he
spike
the
york
store
and
the
hochschild
kohn
employee
and
management
resist
lackingthe
stomach
for
a
fight
warren
give
in
but
he
drew
the
line
at
the
columbia
maryland
store
i
end
up
kill
that
and
everybody
die
they
just
die
then
more
sign
of
trouble
arrive
in
the
formof
number
comingfrombaltimore
revealingthat
every
time
one
of
the
four
department
store
downtown
put
in
an
elevator
the
other
three
have
to
do
the
same
every
time
one
store
upgraded
its
window
display
or
bought
new
cash
register
system
the
others
have
to
follow
suit
buffett
and
munger
come
to
callthis
standingon
tiptoe
at
a
parade
once
anybody
do
it
everybody
have
to
do
it
still
for
the
first
time
buffett
and
munger
have
found
somethingthey
could
partner
on
through
diversified
retailing
they
and
gottesman
have
in
effect
create
a
separate
company
specifically
to
own
retailer
but
hochschild
kohn
be
the
beginningof
a
pattern
that
would
recur
more
than
once
in
frothy
market
buffett
have
lower
his
standard
to
justify
an
investment
that
he
have
do
it
at
a
time
when
he
be
havingmore
and
more
trouble
findingwhat
he
consider
to
be
good
investment
in
the
stock
market
be
no
coincidence
in
this
case
we
be
enough
influence
by
the
graham
ethos
say
munger
that
we
thought
if
you
just
get
enough
asset
for
your
dollar
somehow
you
could
make
it
work
out
and
we
didn
t
weigh
heavily
enough
the
intense
competition
between
four
different
department
store
in
baltimore
at
a
time
when
department
store
no
longer
have
an
automatic
edge
within
the
first
couple
of
year
at
hochschild
kohn
buffett
have
figure
out
that
the
essentialskillin
retailing
be
merchandising
not
finance
he
and
his
partner
also
have
learn
enough
about
retailingto
understand
that
it
be
a
lot
like
the
restaurant
business
a
wearyingmarathon
in
which
every
mile
fresh
aggressive
competition
could
leap
in
and
race
ahead
of
you
when
the
three
have
the
opportunity
to
acquire
another
retailer
through
drc
this
one
very
different
and

before
with
people
who
be
talkingthemselves
into
thinkingthey
be
well

anythingthat
would
interfere
he
s
talk
about
sell
his
business
that
he
s
built
up
all
his
life

t
stand
it
and
he
can
t
stand
her
he

just
a
total
mess
so
charlie

with
me
and
after
about
half
an
hour
ben
be

but
rosner
told
him
that
he
would
stay
only
untilthe
end
of
the
year
then
turn
the
business
over
to
the
new
owner
buffett
could
see
however
that
just
as
the
business
couldn
t
carry
on
without
rosner
fortunately
rosner
couldn
t
carry
on
without
the
business
he
love
it
too
much
to
quit
he
kept
a
duplicate
set
of
store
record
in
the
bathroom
so
that
he
could
look
at
them
while
he
be
sit
on
the
can
he
have
this
rival
milton

lightbulb
how
much
do
you

up
and
that
s
all
ben
could
talk
about
finally
he
say
to
milton
how

and
milton
say

a
bit
cheaper
and
he
knew
that
you

milton
say

in
long
island
and
start
tear
open
carton
of
toilet
paper
and
counting
the
sheet
because
he
be
suspicious
he
knew
that
milton
could
not
be
pay
too
much
by
that
wide
a
margin
and
therefore
that
he
must
be
get
screw
himself
somehow
on
toilet
paper
and
sure
enough
the
vendor
be
say
there
be
five
hundred
sheet
per
roll
in
one
of
these
thing
and
there
weren

buffett
knew
that
he
want
to
be
in

with
the
kind
of
guy
who
would
leave
a
black
tie
party
to
count
sheet
of
toilet
paper
a
guy
who
might
screw
the
guy
across
the
table
but
never
his
own
partner
he
make
a
dealwith
rosner
for
million
to
make
sure
that
rosner
would
stay
on
the

after
he
bought
the

he
flatter

otherwise
left

at
one
with
the
ben
rosners
of
the

saw
in
their
relentlessness
the

saw
it
it
wasn

enough

the
number
come
in

the
only

buffett
refuse
to

it
would
be

sat

swivel
his

and
thought
about
it
then
thought
about
it
some
more
the
irony
be
that
the

risen

they
push

never

see

buffett
begin
sellingdown
his

it

accountingfor
two

but
he
didn
t
want
to
plow
that

back
into

hathaway
rather
his
most
important
task
that
year
be
to
find

he
could
hitch

his
first
break
have
come
when
a

ask
him
to

that
a

presume
murder
would
not

the

he
have

the

just
good
lawyering
not

still
the
lawyer
couldn
t
say
whether

on
the

croaked
louder

the

wouldn

that
be
okay
ringwalt
say
all
the
other
offer
have
be
too
low
how
much
do
you
want
buffett
ask
fifty
dollar
a
share
say
ringwalt
fifteen
dollar
more
than
warren
thought
it
be
worth
i
lltake
it
buffett
say
so
we
make
a
deal
in
that
fifteen
minute
zone
then
jack
have
make
the
deal
really
didn
t
want
to
do
it
but
he
be
an
honest
guy
and
wouldn
t
back
out
of
a
deal
however
he
say
to
me
after
we
d
shaken
hand
well
i
suppose
you
ll
want
audit
financial
statement
and
if
i
d
have
say
yes
he
would
ve
say
well
that
s
too
bad
then
we
don
t
have
a
deal
so
i
just
respond
i
wouldn
t
dream
of
look
at
audit
financial
statement
they
re
the
bad
kind
then
jack
say
to
me
i
suppose
you
ll
want
me
to
sell
my
insurance
agency
to
you
as
well
it
would
have
be
naturalfor
buffett
to
want
the
agency
they
control
relationship
with
some
of
the
customer
who
do
business
with
nationalindemnity
i
just
say
jack
i
wouldn
t
buy
those
agency
under
any
circumstance
if
i
d
say
yes
that
i
want
him
to
sell
the
agency
to
berkshire
he
would
ve
say
well
i
can
t
do
that
warren
we
must
ve
misunderstood
each
other
so
we
go
through
about
three
or
four
iteration
like
this
and
finally
jack
give
up
and
sell
me
the
business
though
i
don
t
think
he
really
want
to
do
it
buffett
want
himto
do
it
because
berkshire
hathaway
be
a
lousy
business
that
he
have
partially
liquidate
and
this
be
his
chance
to
swap
those
fund
for
a
great
business
since
he
knew
that
ringwalt
would
be
havingsecond
thought
while
away
in
florida
he
move
fast
to
seal
the
deal
before
ringwalt
could
change
his
mind
both
men
want
a
contract
no
more
than
one
page
long
buffett
have
finalpapers
drawn
up
quickly
and
the
fund
deposit
in
the
u
s
nationalbank
when
ringwalt
return
fromflorida
a
week
later
buffett
freight
train
himwith
a
deal
ready
to
close
but
ringwalt
show
up
to
the
closingmeetingten
minute
late
buffett
and
heider
would
later
explain
this
by
sayingthat
ringwalt
be
drivingaround
the
block
lookingfor
a
parkingmeter
with
time
left
on
it
ringwalt
always
say
he
be
just
late
but
maybe
he
d
realize
he
wasn
t
actually
well
off
without
it
and
be
dragginghis
foot
sorry
at
havingbowwowed
himself
into
thinkinghe
be
well
off
without
national
indemnity
buffett
of
course
knew
full
wellthat
the
partnership
be
well
off
with
it
national
indemnity
be
the
chance
to
give
his
fortune
a
gigantic
push
a
short
time
later
he
write
a
paper
on
the
subject
under
the
dull
title
thought
regardingcapitalrequirements
for
insurance
company
the
word
capital
money
be
an
important
hint
at
what
buffett
be
thinkingwhen
he
acquire
national
indemnity
for
capital
be
his
partnership
s
lifeblood
he
be
pullingcapitalfrom
berkshire
and
it
need
to
be
put
to
work
nationalindemnity
take
a
lot
of
risk
and
need
gob
of
capital
to
do
so
by
most
standard
he
write
national
indemnity
be
pushingits
capitalquite
hard
it
be
the
availability
of
additional
resource
in
berkshire
hathaway
that
enables
us
to
follow
the
policy
of
aggressively
usingour
capital
which
on
a
long
range
basis
should
result
in
the
great
profitability
within
national
indemnity
berkshire
hathaway
could
put
additionalcapitalinto
national
indemnity
should
underwritingturn
sour
buffett
have
figure
out
a
whole
new
type
of
business
if
national
indemnity
make
money
he
could
send
those
profit
out
to
buy
other
business
and
stock
instead
of
leavingthemto
hibernate
in
national
indemnity
s
vault
but
if
the
lion
ate
the
lion
tamer
national
indemnity
might
need
money
to
pay
the
lion
tamer
s
weepingfamily
then
the
money
could
come
back
home
to
nationalinsurance
from
the
other
business
graftingthe
insurance
business
onto
berkshire
hathaway
the
mess
of
a
textile
mill
make
its
capital
homeostatic
it
could
respond
internally
to
the
environment
at
buffett
s
command
rather
than
hibernate
like
a
lizard
when
it
get
cold
or
runningout
when
the
sun
shone
to
find
a
rock
on
which
to
sun
itself
the
key
be
to
price
the
risk
right
thus
he
need
jack
ringwalt
who
have
talk
himself
into
sellinghis
own
business
to
stick
around
buffett
paid

handsomely

of

to
restrain

with

just
rumble
that
out

then
go

often
told
her

that
october
in

he
have
write

the

which
show
that
somethingin
his

have
change
this
letter
go
out
a
little
earlier
than
the
annualreport
he
write
to
the
partner
each
year
and
it
laid
out
his
strategy
without
revealingthe

s
pendingresults
after
describingthe
hyper
reactive
pattern
of
market
behavior
against
which
my

have

he
go
on
to
say
my
own
personal

dictate
a
less
compulsive
approach
to
superior
investment
result
than
when
i
be
young
and
leaner
i
be
out
of
step
with
present
condition
on
one
point
however
i
be
clear
i
will
not
abandon
a
previous
approach
whose
logic
i
understand
although
i
find
it
difficult
to
apply
even
though
it
may
mean
forgo
large
and
apparently
easy
profit
to
embrace
an
approach
which
i
don
t
fully
understand
have
not
practice
successfully
and
which
possibly
could
lead
to
substantial
permanent
loss
of
capital
he
also
brought
up
another
reason
for
this
less
compulsive
approach
personalgoals
he
say
have
begin
to
intrude
i
would
like
to
have
an
economic
goal
which
allows
for
considerable
noneconomic
activity
i
be
likely
to
limit
myself
to
thing
which
be
reasonably
easy
safe
profitable
and
pleasant
buffett
then
stun
his
partner
by
droppinghis
state
goal
of
beatingthe
market
by
ten
point
a
year
to
beatingit
by
just
five
point
a

or
to
earningnine

whichever
be
less
if
they
could
find
well
result
elsewhere
he
say
they
should
go
and
he
wouldn

blame
them
he
knew
that
this
be
takinga
risk
some
of

be
doingmuch
well
than
the

doublingtheir

in

each

the

add

to
the

his

in

the

produce
an
unusually

of
the

shaken
by
the

roil
have
advise
him
to
sell
stock
he
paid
attention
neither
to
the

nor
to

and
the

beat
the

by

in
its
ten

history
if

it
be
not

the
chance
to
take
their
money

one
side
effect
of
this
strategy
would
be
to

their
trust
in
him
they
would
be

without
knowingthe
actualresults
of

for
he
be
about
to
report
his
second
stellar
year
in
a
row
if
they
stayed
in
it
would
be
because
of
that

and
because
they

by

point
a

buffett

nine

put
a
floor
on
their

that
be

two

or
more
well
than
own
an

that

year

and

so
safely
nevertheless
by
loweringhis

buffett
have
just
take
his
partner
down
a
peg
psychologically
and
the
result
reflect
that
for
the
first
time
instead
of
investor
rushingto
put
more
money
into
the

they
pull
out
a
net
million
of
capital
in
january
yet
it
be
a
fraction
of
what
might
have
be
less
than
one
in
thirty
dollar
have
go
elsewhere
and
when
he
report
his
result
a
few
week
later
buffett
partnership
ltd
have
advanced
thirty
six
percent
versus
the
nineteen
percent
rise
in
the
dow
thus
in
two
year
a
dollar
in
buffett
s
stewardship
grow
more
than
sixty
cent
while
a
dollar
in
the
dow
be
still
a
measly
dollar
he
wish
the

godspeed
with
what
might
be
perceive
as
the
subtlest
trace
of
irony
this
make
good
sense
for
them
since
most
of
them
have
the
ability
and
motivation
to
surpass
our

as
kenneth
galbraith
would
later
say
now
buffett
have
more
time
to
pursue
the
personalinterests
he
have
spoken
about
and
less
pressure
at

in

after

naturally

go

when

he
have
six
kid
and
no

of
i
don
t
think
bill
left
to
get
rich
i
think
he
left
because
he
just
felt
frustrate
everything
have
to
go
to
new
york
to
get
approve
and
come
back
and
aunt
katie
and
uncle
fred
want
to
put
a
few
buck
in
control
data
there
right
at
the
start
bill
didn
t
have
any
money
nobody
have
any
money
in
a

well
except
warren
and
susie
i
could
have
finance
half
the
thing
if
i
d
want
i
be
very
negative
on
it
i
told
them
it
doesn
t
sound

like
much
to
me
who
need
another
computer
company
but
since
billwas
katie
s
brother
for
once
she
and
fred
have
ignore
warren
s
advice
and
invest
anyway
buyingthe

at
sixteen
cent
a

that
control

geyser
investor
with

hadn

opinion
about

many
of
the
other

that
have
start
at

have
fail
as
much
out
of

for

as
for
any
other
reason
however
buffett
sign
off
on
a

for
grinnell
we
be
bet
on
the
jockey
not
the
horse
as
he
saw
it
but
more
important
rosenfield
provide
the
margin
of
safety
by
guaranteeingthe
college
s

and
as
much
as
buffett
admire
noyce
he
do
not
buy
intel
for
the

thus
passingon
one
of
the
great
investingopportunities
of
his
life
while
he
have
lower
his
investingstandards
in
difficult
environment
and
would
do
so
again
one
compromise
he
would
never
make
be
to
give
up
his
margin
of
safety
this
particular
quality
to
pas
up
possible
rich
if
he
couldn

what

as
he
later
explain
it
be
a

market
and
yet
i
couldn

find
a
way

intelligently
i

i
recognize
intuitively
that
warren
understood
the

in

there
be
a
new
highway
about
to
come
through

i
would
have
have
to
borrow
a
whole
lot
of
money
to
buy
a
new

i
didn
t
like
the

prospect

i
knew
that
warren
have
enough

that
the

t
suffer
because
of
the

do
i
figure
we
d
pay
a

a

take
out
a

thousand
a

buffett
say
this
return
be
eight
percent
about
as
much
as

provide
less
far
less
than
he
expect
to
earn
on

and
the
long

suggest
that

would
decline
not

the

and
oh
god
say
peter
as
an

it
reek
of
the
potentialfor
failure
there
be
his
instinct
as
a
hard
businessman

his
philanthropic
good

instinct
on
the

they

clearly
at

he

that
the

enough
he
have
know
from
the

it
would
not

even
with

buffett

now
pursuingthe
personalconcerns
of
which
he
have
spoken
in
his

the

continued
to
dry
up
and
deprive

opportunity

of
his
time
as
a

no

adjustingto
that
reality
whatever
else
occupy
him
he
remain
wholly
commit
to
the
partnership
too
and
it
turn
out
that
a
less
compulsive
approach
to
investingwas
not
in
his
nature
so
he
start
to
figure
out
the
best
way
to
wind
down
the
partnership
he
say
he
receive
offer
from
a
couple
of
people
to
buy
the
management
firm
which
would
have
meant
the
opportunity
to
sell
at
a
large
profit
but
he
thought
this
be
not
right
it
be
unusualfor
a
money
manager
to
forgo
a
large
sumof
money
even
in
those
day
and
so
far
buffett
have
show
no
inclination
to
avoid
gettingricher
but
he
have
always
stayed
on
the
same
side
as
his
partner
harnessinghis
avarice
to
their
benefit
as
well
as
his

buffett

the

rabbit
all
my
life
the
only
way
to
slow
down
be
to
stop
and
then
he
deliver
his
bombshell
he
announce
he
would

i
don

the
fountainhead
of
allthis
generosity
she
be
startingto
need
a
little
attention
too
it
wouldn
t
have
take
much
accordingto
her
friend
just
an
ounce
of
effort
on
her
husband
s
part
she
disagreed
that
makingmoney
be
life
s
purpose
she
felt
impoverish
denyingherself
travel
museum
theater
art
and
most
other
form
of
culture
because
of
his
lack
of
interest
warren
praise
her
effusively
in
public
but
when
at
home
or
work
lapse
into
his
normal
preoccupy
state
if
he
would
make
an
effort
by
goingto
an
art
gallery
with
her
now
and
then
or
take
her
on
a
trip
just
because
she
want
to
go
it
would
make
a
difference
she
say
but
while
he
do
sometimes
show
up
when
ask
if
she
have
to
ask
it
be
a
favor
not
a
gift
now
that
susie
realize
that
warren
be
never
goingto
take
off
to
italy
for
week
on
end
she
begin
to
travel
on
her
own
or
with
her
woman
friend
sometimes
to
visit
family
such
as
bertie
who
now
live
in
california
and
sometimes
to
attend
personal
growth
seminar
one
day
at
the
chicago
airport
a
man
stop
in
front
of
her
as
she
sat
on
a
bench
be
you
susie
thompson
he
ask
she
look
up
embarrass
to
have
be
caught
with
a
mouth
fullof
hot
dog
it
be
milt
brown
her
high
school
sweetheart
whom
she
have
not
see
in
year
he
sat
down
and
they
begin
to
get
reacquaint
susie
who
be
always
reachingout
for
emotional
connection
would
later
say
that
her
husband
wasn
t
lackingin
emotion
he
be
just
cut
off
fromhis
own
feeling
and
it
certainly
seem
as
though
his
strong
emotionalbonds
be
with
his
friend
and
partner
to
whom
he
felt
an
intense
obligation
and
with
whom
he
have
create
a
de
facto
family
the
other
buffetts
could
not
help
but
notice
the
way
he
lit
up
in
their
company
in
contrast
to
the
dutiful
but
preoccupy
manner
he
displayed
while
attendinghis
own
family
event
thus
even
now
that
he
be
preparingto
close
the
partnership
that
have
consume
most
of
his
wakinghours
for
the
last
thirteen
year
he
remain
fully
engage
with
his
partner
and
seem
a
little
reluctant
to
let
go
of
his
connection
to
them
he
go
to
extreme
to
help
themplace
their
money
in
good
hand
writingthem
another
letter
describingtheir
option
in
meticulous
detail
explaininghis
dedication
to
them
he
say
the
question
of
find
other
adviser
be
a
tough
one
when
i
wound
up
my
partnership
i
have
these
partner
that
have
count
on
me
and
i
be
go
to
be
distribute
a
lot
of
money
i
felt
an
obligation
to
at
least
suggest
some
alternative
for
them
this
be
unusual
behavior
for
a
money
manager
to
say
the
least
even
ben
grahamhad
only
say
oh
buy
at
t
when
ask
and
mention
buffett
offhandedly
to
a
few
people
but
buffett
make
elaborate
effort
to
shepherd
his
partner
on
to
their
future
investinglife
some
of
themwere
already
in
the
munger
partnership
and
buffett
sent
one
or
two
more
to
him
but
munger
be
queasy
about
the
market
who
want
to
be
around
people
when
you
re
disappointingthem
he
say
particularly
when
you
suck
them
into
the
relationship
he
also
lack
buffett
s
genius
for
promotion
i
recommend
two
people
to
the
partner
whom
i
knew
be
exceptionally
good
and
exceptionally
honest
sandy
gottesman
and
bill
ruane
i
d
be
around
the
investment
world
for
a
long
time
at
that
point
and
i
d
gotten
to
know
them
over
the
year
so
i
not
only
knew
their
result
but
i
knew
how
they
d

accomplish
their
result
which
be
terribly
important
so
the
richer
partner
would
go
to
gottesman
at
first
manhattan
but
sandy
didn
t
want
the
small
fry
so
buffett
sent
the
rest
to
ruane
who
be
now
leavingkidder
peabody
to
set
up
his
own
investment
advisory
firm
ruane
cunniff
stires
with
two
partner
rick
cunniff
and
sidney
stires
and
creatingthe
sequoia
fund
specifically
to
take
on
the
small
account
they
hire
john
harding
who
would
be
out
of
a
job
when
the
partnership
dissolve
to
run
an
omaha
office
for
the
new
company
john
loomis

salesman
who
be
carol

and
buffett

henry

also
go
to

in

these

also
kept
harding
loomis
and
brandt
in
buffett

buffett
brought
ruane
to
omaha
and
promote
the
sequoia
fund
to
the
partner
he
endorse
ruane
in
typically
mathematicalterms
unremarkably
even
though
he
have
know
ruane
for
year
he
still
felt
it
necessary
to
leave
a
small
escape
hatch
fearingblame
in

thing
didn
t
work

and
write
there
be
no
way
to
eliminate
the
possibility
of
error
when
judging

i
consider

to
be
an
exceptionally
high

a
high

yet
while
buffett
make
arrangement
to

have
no

than
buffett
ask
around
and
then
make
the
unfortunate
choice
of
the
colony
club
a
palmbeach
florida
resort
where
they
be
treat
like

snooted
at
even
by
the

at

that
the

have

with
a

say
you
need
it
more
than
i
do

have
give

he
always
carry
in

to
make

the

threw

all
over

the
men
sat
classroom
style
with
buffett
most
often
in
his
usual
place
at
the
front
they
bat
thought
back
and
forth
in
an
encode

frommany
year
of

and
a
closely

of
concept
and
value
charlie
told
some
horror
story
buffett
write
later
and
i
drew
the
same
gloomy
conclusion
while
walter
schloss
say
that
two
mislocated
steel
company
with
obsolete
plant
be
still
below

so
all
be
not

if
you
be

on
a
desert
island
for
ten
year
he
ask
in
what
stock
would
you
invest
the
trick
be
to
find
a
company
with
the
strong
franchise
one
least
subject
to
the
corrodingforces
of

and
time
munger
s
idea
of
the
great
business
as
henry
brandt
take
copious
note
on
the

answer
buffett
deliver
his

choice
dow
jones
owner
of
the

journal
his
interest
in

would
only
become
more
intense
yet
curiously
he
do
not
actually
own
this
stock
the
gatheringended
much
as
it
have
begin
with
more
display
of
rudeness
from
the
hotelstaff
who
have
no
idea
they
be

than
a
third

group
of
stockbroker
at
a
time
when
the

be
fall
the
staff
have
officiously
shooed
the
grahamites
away
from
the
jewelry
case
on
the
hotel
mezzanine
on
the
last
day
as

anderson
approach
the
front
desk
and
ask
how
best
to
get
to
the
airport
most
of
our
guest
go
by
limousine
he
be
told
but
for
you
folk
we
ll
call
a
cab
buffett
would
go
on
to
describe
the
colony
club
as
a
friendly
family
hotel
that
be
friendly
if
you
be
the
kennedy
family
it
be
a
low
class
performance
by
a
high
class
place
say
anderson
later
when
a
fort
lauderdale
businessman
who
held
the
mortgage
on
the
colony
club
ask
buffett
to
advise
him
on
a
financingdeal
buffett
told
the
man
he
would
be
happy
to
do
it
without
takinga
fee
but
if
you
ever
have
a
chance
to
foreclose
on
them
do
it
one
of
those

deep
wariness

buffett
have
take
special
care
with
this
his
first
public
financing
and
insist
to
his
underwriter
that
the
bond
have
several
unusual
feature
the
banker
have
object
that
a
novel
structure
would
make
the
bond
harder
to
sell
i
say
well
but
bond
should
have
this
in
there
that
be
the
first
bond
issue
i
ever
sell
and
i
put
a
few
thing
in
there
that
the
underwriter
have
no
interest
in
whatsoever
but
i
have
thought
a
lot
about
bond
issue
over
the
year
and
i
have
thought
about
how
bondholder
get
take
bondholder
historically
earn
less
than
stockholder
because
they
give
up
the
potentially
unlimited
opportunity
of
a
shareholder
in
favor
of
low
risk
but
buffett
knew
that
in
the
real
world
this
be
not
necessarily
true
one
of
the
thing
i
put
in
be
that
if
we
didn
t
pay
the
interest
on
the
bond
for
any
reason
the
bondholder
take
over
voting
control
of
the
company
so
they
didn
t
have
to
get
mickey
mouse
by
bankruptcy
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
ben
graham
have
write
about
this
in
security
analysis
with
as
much
passion
as
he
muster
on
any
subject
describinghow
court
rarely
allow
bondholder
to
seize
the
asset
that
back
those
bond
unless
the
asset
be
nearly
worthless
unsecured
bondholder
interest
be
work
over
in
receivership
through
a
stranglingprocess
that
delayed
payment
almost
to
the
point
of
irrelevance
thus
drc
s
debenture
also
provide
that
the
company
could
not
pay
dividend
while
the
debenture
be
outstanding
meaningthat
equity
investor
could
not
siphon
off
profit
while
interest
on
the
bond
be
in
arrears
the
second
unusual
provision
be
that
the
debenture
paid
eight
percent
but
dependingon
the
earnings
of
the
company
could
pay
up
to
an
additional
one
percent
and
buffett
add
a
third
provision
because
he
felt
that
the
bond
would
be
sell
mainly
to
people
who
knew
him
or
his
reputation
he
want
the
bond
to
be
redeemable
if
he
sell
enough
stock
in
drc
that
he
be
no
longer
the
large
shareholder
and
nobody
have
ever
stuck
anything
like
this
in
a
covenant
i
say
you
know
they
re
entitle
to
have
this
in
there
they
may
not
want
to
redeem
them
but
they
re
entitle
if
they
want
to
they
lent
money
to
me
basically
when
his
own
banker
nelson
wilder
protest
that
such
clause
be
unprecedented
and
unnecessary
buffett
overrule
him
now
that
interest
rate
have
risen
and
bank
be
newly
reluctant
to
lend
the
debenture
suddenly
become
a
valuable
formof
cheap
financing
a
powerful
consolation
prize
nevertheless
since
buffett
thought
of
a
dollar
today
as
the
fifty
or
hundred
dollar
that
it
could
become
someday
it
be
as
if
he
have
lose
many
million
on
hochschild
kohn
because
of
the
forgone
opportunity
to
use
the
money
more
effectively
he
drew
a
conclusion
that
he
would
later
state
as
time
be
the
friend
of
the
wonderful
business
the
enemy
of
the
mediocre
you
might
think
this
principle
be
obvious
but
i
have
to
learn
it
the
hard
way
after
endingour
corporate
marriage
to
hochschild
kohn
i
have
memory
like
those
of
the
husband
in
the
country
song
my
wife
ran
away
with
my
best
friend
and
i
still
miss
him
a
lot
it
s

well
to

this
early
i
be
a

learner

as
not

significant
the

be
floor
to
find
that
through
their

of

they
own
a
trading

company
a

an
insignificant

now
they
have
to
decide
whether
to
hold
these

or
trade
them
because
they
could
have
all

instead
he
would
cut
the
pie
and
you
would
be
able
to
get
the
first
choice
on
the
piece
say
john
harding
this
be
a
brilliant
move
on
buffett
s
part
he
of
course
want
them
to
choose
the
cash
leavingthe
berkshire
hathaway
and
diversified
retailingstocks
for
himself
nevertheless
he
be
honest
with
them
in
a
letter
of
october
he
make
a
market
forecast
which
he
have
previously
decline
to
do
with
the
market
at
such
height
f
or
the
first
time
in
my
professional
life
he
write
i
now
believe
there
be
little
choice
for
the
average
investor
between
professionally
manage
money
in
stock
and
passive
investment
in
bond
although
he
do
allow
as
how
the
very
best
money
manager
might
be
able
to
squeeze
out
a
few
percentage
point
over
the
earnings
of
bond
nonetheless
the
departingpartners
shouldn
t
have
high
hope
for
what
they
could
do
with
the
cash
two
month
later
on
december
he
give
a
prediction
about
how
these
two
stock
would
do
alongwith
tellingthe
partner
what
he
be
goingto
do
himself
my
personal
opinion
be
that
the
intrinsic
value
of
drc
and
b
h
will
grow
substantially
over
the
year
i
would
be
disappointed
if
such
growth
wasn
t
at
a
rate
of
approximately
ten
percent
per
annum
that
be
an
important
statement
he
be
tellingthem
that
berkshire
and
diversified
would
not
only
do
well
than
bond
but
well
than
he
have
say
in
october
the
partner
could
expect
fromeven
the
very
best
money
manager
i
think
both
security
should
be
very
decent
long
term
holding
and
i
be
happy
to
have
a
substantial
portion
of
my
net
worth
invest
in
them
i
think
there
be
a
very
high
probability
that
i
will
maintain
my

investment
in
drc
and
b
h
for
a
very
long
period
separately
buffett
write
the
partner
a
dissertation
on
how
to
invest
in
bond
again
extendinghimself
considerably
more
than
a
typical
money
manager
would
ever
do
even
so
i
have
four
people
panic
when
i
close
down
all
four
be
divorce
woman
they
trust
me
and
they
didn
t
trust
anybody
else
they
have
have
bad
experience
with
men
and
they
didn
t
feel
they
could
make
it
again
if
they
lose
what
money
they
d
gotten
they
would
call
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
say
you
ve
get
to
keep
earn
me
money
and

all
this
sort
of
thing
but
he
refuse
to
act
as
what
he
consider
to
be
a
fiduciary
if
he
could
not
performto
his
high
standard
basically
if
i
m
the
guarantor
i
just
can
t
do
it
know
how
hard
it
be
on
me
once
he
say
harken
back
to
what
he
have
felt
at
age
eleven
when
city
service
prefer
have
disappointed
his
sister
he
continued
workingon
the

dissolution
over
christmas
in

he
have
bought
his
christmas
gift
with
his
usualefficiency
as
with
most
thing
he
have
a
system
he
go
to
topps
the
best
dress
shop
in
omaha
and
give
thema
list
of
the
different
size
for
all
the
woman
in
his
life
i
would
go
over
and
they
d
wheel
out
the
dress
i
d
make
a
variety
of
decision
and
buy
present
for
my
sister
susie
gladys
and
so
forth
i
kind
of
enjoy
it
bertie
s
more
conservative
so
i
d
move
her
up
a
notch
in
style
and
she
d
accept
it
from
me
but
nobody
else
you
know
clothing
hold
its
value
well
than
jewelry
on
december
after
the
exchange
of
christmas
gift
he
sent
the
partner
another
longletter
goingout
of
his
way
to
answer
at
length
a
number
of
their
question
a
few
of
the
partner
have
be
challenginghim
they
be
decidingwhether
to
hold
the
berkshire
stock
if
it
be
such
a
lousy
business
why
not
get
rid
of
the
berkshire
hathaway
textile
mill
i
have
no
desire
to
trade
severe
human
dislocation
for
a
few
percentage
point
additional
return
per
annum
he
write
echoingwhat
he
have
say
to
themin
his
letter
of
january
but
since
the
whole
point
of
his
business
be
to
eke
out
a
few
additionalpercentage
point
per
annum
this
kind
of
rationalization
would
have
be
unthinkable
earlier
in
his
career
what
be
sun
newspaper
they
ask
it
s
worth
a
buck
a
share
he
reply
kind
of
skippingthe
rest
of
the
economics
then
he
add
some
famous
last
word
we
have
no
particular
plan
to
expand
in
the

communication
field
he
write
why
didn
t
you
register
the
berkshire
hathaway
and
diversified
stock
so
that
it
could
be
freely
trade
berkshire
be
so
closely
held
that
it
trade
by
appointment
which
make
it
hard
for
anyone
to
know
what
the
stock
be
actually
worth
diversified
do
not
trade
at
all
a
long
complicate
explanation
follow
in
which
buffett
argue
that
a
freely
trade
and
liquid
public
market
for
these
stock
would
be
less
efficient
and
less
fair
and
the
more
sophisticated
partner
might
have
an
important
edge
over
the
less
sophisticated
partner
and
it
be
certainly
true
that
the
more
naive
of
his
departingpartners
would
be
kept
from
the
clutch
of
the
manic
depressive
mr
market
who
might
at
time
have
value
the
stock
at
a
severely
discount
price
it
lower
the
odds
that
a
pack
of
broker
would
talk
them
into
sellingjust
to
buy
ibm
or
at
t
but
it
also
meant
that
buffett
be
limitinghis
partner
option
makingit
harder
for
themto
buy
and
harder
for
them
to
sell
and
if
they
do
sell
makingit
more
likely
that
they
would
sell
to
him
as
general
partner
of
the
partnership
he
be
use
to
havingtotal
control
of
these
two
company
lettinggo
and
givingup
control
to
the
anonymous
mr
market
he
just
couldn
t
do
it
moreover
as
soon
as
he
hand
these
stock
to
his
departingpartners
for
the
first
time
his
own
self
interest
and
theirs
might
be
at
odds
this
complicate
rationale
to
justify
keepingthe
stock
unregistered
dance
a
little
do
si
do
around
the
fact
that
buffett
be
the
most
sophisticated
partner
of
all
it
be
he
who
would
have
the
most
important
edge
over
his
former
partner
no
matter
how
honest
his
intention
the
decision
widen
the
potential
conflict
between
his
interest
and
theirs
the
painfully
earnest
tone
of
buffett
s
letter
sound
like
someone
who
have
have
to
talk
himself
into
thinkingthat
he
be
doingthe
right
thing
but
the
conflict
be
guaranteed
to
cause
hard
feeling
anyone
who
sell
to
him
and
be
later
sorry
could
look
back
with
hindsight
and
think
he
have
an
edge
on
me
still
the
howard
in
warren
demand
that
he
present
their
option
with
scrupulous
honesty
the
way
he
answer
the
next
question
told
the
departingpartners
exactly
what
to
expect
should
i
hold
my
stock
they
ask
buffett
give
as
clear
and
direct
advice
as
he
would
ever
give
in
public
about
a
stock
all
i
can
say
be
that
i
mgoingto
do
so
he
say
and
i
plan
to
buy
more
the
departingpartners
be
also
goingto
have
a
third
stock
to
deal
with
in
this
same
letter
of
december
buffett
told
themthat
the
blue
chip
stock
sale
have
fall
through
the
stock
have
plunge
in
a
short
time
from
a
high
of
to
a
share
because
safeway

have
drop
blue

its
customer
base
be
erode
and
no
buyer
be
in
sight
for
the
one
third
of
the
business
that
the
justice
department
have
mandate
it
sell

against

in
the
u

in
los

one
by

and
the
other
by
a

of
fillingstations
who
say
blue

have
broken
the
antitrust
law
that
it
be
a
monopoly
and
ask
for
treble
damage
and
attorney
fee
yet
even
as
blue
chip
s
problem
multiply
and
the
price
fell
buffett
have
be
buying
the
stock
instead
of
sell
he
have
bought
it
for
diversified
retailingand
for
nationalindemnity
he
have
bought
it
for
cornhusker
casualty
and
national
fire
marine
two
little
insurance
company
that
berkshire
have
acquire
he
have
also
bought
it
for
himself
and
for
susie
now
the
partner
knew
that
buffett
wouldn
t
sell
and
indeed
plan
to
hoover
up
more
of
all
these
stock
they
would
get
whichever
they
want
stock
or
cash
if
they
take
the
money
he
would
get
the
stock
if
they
kept
their
stock
they
would
still
be
his
partner
in
a
sense
in
his
anxiety
over
whether
people
accepted
and
like
him
buffett
value
loyalty
more
than
almost
anything
he
look
for
loyalty
in
allof
his
relationship
the
dissolution
of
the
partnership
have
element
of
a
loyalty
test
as
his
behavior
afterward
would
make
clear
when
the
partnership
unwound
buffett
have
more
money
to
buy
even
more
stock
for
even
while
holdingon
to
his
share
he
personally
own
eighteen
percent
of

hathaway
twenty
percent
of

two
percent
of

he
and
susie
have
haul
home
roughly
million
in
cash
by
the
end
of
duringthe
ensuingyear
the
share
of
berkshire
and
diversified
quickly
begin
to
change
hand
as
though
a
giant
be
shufflinga
deck
of
card
as
he
have
promise
but
on
a
scale
that
might
have
stagger
his
partner
have
they
know
buffett
use
the
cash
he
get
from
the
partnership
to
buy
still
more
berkshire
and
diversified
for
his
own
account
he
use
berkshire
s
cash
to
buy
its
own
stock
and
for
drc
offer
to
buy
the
company
s
stock
fromsome
people
in
exchange
for
a
drc
note
that
paid
interest
at
nine
percent
he
bought
from
people
rangingfromhis
former
brother
in
law
truman
wood
to
his
first
investor
homer
dodge
and
his
son
norton
those
who
reject
these
offer
have
to
be
willingto
ride
alongand
let
buffett
reinvest
the
earnings
without
ever
payingout
a
dime
a
show
of
trust
that
be
important
to
him
forever
after
he
would
feel
a
loyalty
to
those
who
kept
the
stock
a
loyalty
of
such
depth
and
strength
that
the
standard
model
modern
ceo
would
find
it
completely
incomprehensible
berkshire
he
would
later
reflect
be
still
like
a
partnership
you
basically
have
the
closest
thing
to
a
private
business
with
shareholder
who
identify
with
you
and
who
like
to
come
to
omaha
he
thought
of
partner
as
people
who
have
come
together
out
of
a
complex
set
of
share
value
and
interest
not
out
of
short
termeconomic
convenience
he
often
say
that
he
try
to
treat
his
partner
the
way
he
would
his
family
his
partner
be
people
who
trust
him
people
to
whomhe
owe
a

in

he
expect

fromthem
yet
people
make
their
decision
for
all
sort
of
reason
some
need
money
others
simply
invest
in

buffett
more

munger
would
later
call

an

like

by

of

while

his

have
shot

their

it
be

buffett
that
warren

gyration
to

berkshire
hathaway
meant
that
her

retirement
would
be
similar

one
reason
be
that

it

ed
anderson
thought
it

but
munger
be
overflowingwith
enthusiasm
he
and
buffett
go
through
the

and
munger
say
what
a
fantastic
business
and
the
manager
chuck
huggins
boy
be
he
smart
and
we
can
keep
himon
see
s
have
a
tentative
deal
on
the
table
already
and
want
million
for
asset
worth
million
the
difference
be
see

brand
reputation
and
trademark
and
most
of
all
its
customer
goodwill
susie
buffett
for
example
be
crazy
about
see
s
which
she
have
discover
in
california
they
decide
that
see
s
be
like
a
bond
worth
pay
million
for
if
the
company
have
paid
out
its
earnings
as
interest
the
interest
would
average
about
nine
percent
that
be
not
enough
owninga
business
be
riskier
than
owninga
bond
and
the
interest
rate
be
not
guaranteed
but
the
earnings
be
grow
on
average
twelve
percent
a
year
so
see
s
be
like
a
bond
whose
interest
payment
grow
furthermore
we
thought
it
have
uncapped
pricing
power
see
s
be
sell
candy
for
about
the
price
of
russell
stover
at
the
time
and
the
big
question
in
my
mind
be
if
you
get
another
fifteen
cent
a
pound
that
be
two
and
a
half
million
dollar
on
top
of
four
million
dollar
of
earnings
so
you
really
be
buying
something
that
perhaps
could
earn
six
and
a
half
or
seven
million
dollar
at
the
time
if
just
price
a
little
more

the

her
friend
rodney
wead
and
other
leader
in
the
black

have
gotten
the
idea
of
startinga
minority
own
bank
to
enhance
community
pride
and
economic
development
on
the
north
side
promote
black
capitalism
they
come
to
buffett
and
his
friend
nick
newman
the
man
who
have
sponsor
warren
in
local
civil
right
activity
wead
be
a
respect
figure
in
omaha
and
buffett
like
bank
he
have
just
join
the
board
of
omaha
national

the
big

a
long
held
ambition
he
have
an
automatic
and
rational
predisposition
toward
any
business
where
people
give
money
to
the
business
faster
than
the
company
disburse
it
so
he
be
willingto
listen
to
wead
but
want
to
know
if
a
minority
bank
be
viable
since
the
hope
be
that
community
bank
would
attract
a
diverse
group
of
customer
he
hire
peter
and
one
of
his
friend
to
sit
outside
another
minority
bank
to
count
how
many
people
go
inside
and
to
classify
them
by
race
peter
s
tally
make
warren
optimistic
so
he
join
an
advisory
board

and
also
get
john

that
if

drive

buffett
go
into

he

as

buffett

no
wead
felt
buffett
didn
t
understand
the
cycle
of
poverty
and
never
understood
his
role
as
a
wealthy
man
in
our
beleaguer
community
but
buffett
understood
the
number
he
knew
the
bank
wouldn
t
help
anyone
by
relaxingits
lendingstandards
and
makinguncollectible

the

limp
alongfor

without

he
get
a
chance
to

in
another
way
when
hallie

incredible
that
someone

allow
her

her
no
good
she
take
himseriously
and
it
also
carry
weight
when
another
of
graham
s
acquaintance
bob
abboud
a
fellow
trustee
at
the
university
of
chicago
warn
her
away
andr
meyer
really
want
to
think
he
control
everything
and
it
be
easy
when
he
get
a
woman
like
kay
he
would
make
her
feel
like
she
d
well
not
go
to
the
bathroom
without
check
with
him
he
have
that
style
andr
kept
refer
to
me
as
her
new
bos
because
i
bought
this
stock
you
have
all
these
guy
who
could
see
their
power
be
dilute
if
i
get
in
the
inner
circle
she
be
very
sensitive
to
the
idea
that
anyone
would
manipulate
her
for
political
purpose
or
for
the
paper
which
be
understandable
she
be
use
to
everybody
in
the
world
try
to
use
her
but
what
you
could
do
with
kay
be
you
could
play
on
her
fear
if
you
want
to
work
her
over
you
could
make
her
feel
so
insecure
and
she
knew
you
be
do
it
to
her
but
she
couldn
t
resist
it
she
would
second
guess
herself
say
fellow
post
board
member
arjay
miller
she
would
fall
in
and
out
of
love
with
people
she
could
be
bully
she
would
get
overwhelmed
by
certain
people
in
business
she
would
meet
somebody
and
be
sort
of
dazzle
with
them
for
a
little
while
and
think
they
knew
allthe
answer
she
thought
men
knew
all
about
business
and
woman
didn
t
know
anything
at
the
bottom
that
be
the
real
problem
her
mother
told
her
that
and
her
husband
told
her
that
over
and
over
and
over
and
over
again
graham
try
to
find
out
what
she
could
about
buffett
she
barely
remember
himfromtheir
brief
encounter
two
year
earlier
she
and
her
colleague
bought
copy
of
supermoney
and
devour
the
chapter
on
him
wonderingwhat
the
man
fromnebraska
have
in
store
for
them
those
unfriendly
to
buffett
make
sure
she
also
saw
an
unsigned
article
in
the
september
issue
of
forbes
about
buffett
s
purchase
of
stock
in
san
jose
water
work
which
cast
a
shadow
on
the
sunny
portrait
that
supermoney
have
paint
of
the
mystery
man
this
forbes
piece
struck
a
very
different
tone
than
the
glowingarticle
the
magazine
have
publish
two
year
before
it
described
a
san
jose
water
work
shareholder
who
want
to
unload
his
stock
he
go
to
a
company
director
who
sent
himto
buffett
the
article
insinuate
that
buffett
must
have
know
that
a
deal
be
brewingfor
the
city
to
take
over
the
water
work
at
a
high
price
than
he
be
payingfor
the
stock
simply
because
a
director
have
refer
a
seller
to
him
he
have
connection
so
he
must
have
know
something
right
the
article
end
the
american
stock
exchange
and
the
san
francisco
office
of
the
security
exchange
commission
be
makinginquiries
and
askingquestions
but
there
be
nothingillegalabout
a
director
referringa

of
stock
to
a
buyer
indeed
no
dealever

to
anyone
checkinghimout
this
would
be
the
most
prominent
public
recent
mention
of
his
name
apart
from
supermoney
buffett
felt
like
a
cat
s
scratchingpost
if
this
cascade
into
a
series
of
expandingstories
it
could
wreck
his
newly
gild
reputation
even
though
the
story
have
no
substance
to
it
he
be
not
the
type
to
storm
and
shout
however
but
to
brood
and
plan
thus
while
angry
he
be
too
clever
to
confront
the
magazine
and
denounce
its
nameless
reporter
he
want
retribution
and
vindication
so
he
use

enough

that

be
rarely
read
and
have
no
impact
as
compare
to
the

initially
buffett
now
have
a
new
cause
outrage
at
bias
in
news
reporting
which
wound
itself
around
his
sense
of
justice
and
his
interest
in
journalismin
general
that
a
reporter
could
lie
by
inference
or
omission
without
any
accountability
drove
himwild
he
knew
that
even
well
intentioned
news
publication
flew
into
a
state
of
high
dudgeon
and
defend
their
reporter
dubious
behavior
on
the
premise
of
newsroommorale
and
press
independence
this
stance
he
would
later
learn
be
refer
to
at
the
washington
post
as
the
defensive
crouch
eventually
he
would
end
up
helpingto
fund
the
nationalnews
council
a
nonprofit
organization
that
arbitrate
complaint
of
journalistic
malpractice
the

s
position
be
that

have
become

by
monopoly
and
concentrate
in
a

this
lack
of

meant
that
the

give

unfortunately
those

the

the

have
no

in

perhaps
ahead
of
its

like

of

how
she
should
come
down

it

true
that
the
formal

that
surround
the
powerful
mr

have
unnerved

and
make
him
ill
at

he
have
never
be
one
to

his
enthusiasm

so
it
must

company
call
century
investor
which
have
to

where
he
would

at

which
would
be
buying

in

the
big
company
at
the
end
of
the
thing
be
mergenthaler
linotype
which
be
two
third
own
by
american

in
those
day
you
didn
t
have
to
file
with
the
sec
to
publicly
reveal
that
you
be
buying
so
nobody
knew
and
he
just
would
keep
buying
until
he
get
control
he
bought
control
of
electric
auto
lite
partly
through
mergenthaler
and
he
be
do
the
same
thing
with
crane
co
not
the
stationery
but
the
plumbing
supply
somewhere
in
the
chain
be
webster
tobacco
they
be
all
cheap
statistically
everything
sell
at
a
discount
and
you
could
just
keep
buying
all
of
them
and
make
more
money
every
time
you
make
a
purchase
usually
i
would
buy
some
of
all
of
them
i
own
mergenthaler
i

own
electric
auto
lite
i
own
american
manufacturing
what
would
cause
the
value
to
come
out
that
be
always
the
question
but
you
just
have
a
feel
you
be
with
a
smart
guy
and
eventually
it
would
early
on
he
go
to
see
wattle
at
his
office
at
white
weld
co
in
boston
i
be
a
little
apprehensive
and
say
something
like
mr
wattle
i
hope
i
can
ask
you
some
question
and
he
say
shoot
right
away
i
have
to
start
think
of
question
he
be
very
good
with
me
for
ten
or
fifteen
year
i
follow
him
he
be
very
graham
like
very
graham
like
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
him
except
me
he
be
sort
of
my
model
as
to
what
i
hop
to
do
for
a
while
it
be
so
understandable
and
so
obvious
and
such
a
sure
way
of
make
money
although
it
didn
t
make
you
huge
money
necessarily
you
knew
you
be
go
to
make
money
what
interested
warren
about
the
wattle
model
the
way
one
company
could
legitimately
buy
cheap
stock
in
another
you
don
t
have
to
think
of
everything
you
know
it
be
isaac
newton
who
say
i
ve
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
than
others
because
i
stand
on
the
shoulder

of
giant
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
stand
on
other
people
s
shoulder
eventually
wattle
have
merge
his
empire
into
one
company
eltra
corporation
create
through
the
merger
of
mergenthaler
linotype
and
electric
auto

this
stock
be
now
a
favorite
of

because
the

then
wesco
announce
that

an

approach
that

thought

yet
buffett
and

saw
the
opposite
they
thought
santa

overprice
and
wesco
be
handingover

buffett

he
read

even
so
wesco
have
never

its

it

the
only
member
of

both
interested
and
able
to

on

felt
that
wesco

condescend
to
her
and
dismiss
her
suggestion
that
they
could
grow

instead
they
use

and
forth
to

on

to
attend
board
meeting
runninga
saving

she
found
be
hardly
a
black
art
she
subscribed
to
everythingrelevant
she
could
get
her
hand
on
and
sat
down
and
read
and
figure
it
out
as
peter
s
frustration
grow
she
push
for
a
merger
she
knew
the
santa
barbara
offer
wasn
t
great
but
all
of
the
company
s
executive
be
in
their
mid
forty
and
they
be
bright
and
aggressive
although
they
hungaround
the
country
club
too
much
for
her
taste
they
be
vigorous
acquiringbranches
and
doingthings
that
she
thought
should
be
do
blue
chip
already
own
eight
percent
of
wesco
when
the
merger
be
announce
munger
thought
that
if
it
kept
buyingwesco
it
could
accumulate
enough
stock
to
defeat
the
santa
barbara
deal
but
then
he
discover
that
it
would
take
fifty
percent
of
the
stock
a
much
high
obstacle
munger
have
a
great
incentive
than
buffett
to
keep
go
since
blue
chip
be
his
partnership
s
most
important
investment
he
urge
goingahead
buffett
thought
fifty
percent
be
too
high
a
threshold
and
held
back
soon
thereafter
munger
go
to
see
wesco
s
ceo
louis
vincenti
and
try
to
persuade
himto
abandon
the
santa
barbara
deal
and
vincentibrushed
munger
off
like
a
flake
of
dandruff
not
an
easy
thingto
do
munger
and
buffett
have
no
intention
of
launchinga
competinghostile
bid
however
far
munger
could
not
imagine
that
such
a
thingmight
be
necessary
he
write
vincenti
appealingto
his
high
value
surely
his
superior
reasoningcould
bringvincenti
around
it
be
wrong
that
wesco
should
sell
itself
too
cheap
vincenti
should
simply
see
that
so
munger
told
vincentithat
he
like
wesco
s
management
and
that
vincenti
be
buffett
and
munger
s
sort
of
fellow
he
told
vincenti
somethinglike
you
re
engage
to
this
other
girl
so
we
can
t
talk
to
you
but
if
you
be
free
you
re
the
kind
of
man
we
would
like
munger
s
old
fashion
ben
franklinesque
sense
of
ethic
and
his
noblesse
oblige
notion
that
gentleman
in
business
should
agree
upon
the
right
conduct
amongthemselves
must
have
sound
like
sanskrit
to
vincenti
but
at
least
vincentidid
let
slip
that
betty
peter
be
the
shareholder
pushingfor
the
merger
munger
sent
don
koeppel
ceo
of
blue
chip
down
to
see
peter
she
view
himas
a
minion
and
sent
him
back
empty
hand
so
it
be
time
for
the
biggun
within
ten
minute
of
koeppel
s
departure
buffett
call

just
finish
readingthe

warren
buffett
that
s
in

she
ask
buffett
admit
that
he
be
the
man
who
accordingto
jerry
goodman
represent
the
triumph
of
straight
thinkingand
high
standard
over
flapdoodle
folly
and
flimflam
peter
willingly
agree
to
meet
buffett
with
her
three
child
at
the
twa
ambassador
lounge
at
the
san

airport
twenty
four
hour
later
at
the
meeting
buffett
with
pepsi
in
hand
underplayed
his
talent
and
record
while
askingquestions
in
a
warm
unthreateningmanner
they
talk
for
three
hour
mostly
about
omaha
where
peter
s
mother
have
grown
up
they
talk
about
politics
peter
a
lifelongdemocrat
be
pleased
by
buffett
s
view
finally
he
say
with
considerable
understatement
betty
i
think
i
can
do
well
with
wesco
than
this
merger
inasmuch
as
you
re
givingup
the
company
why
don
t
we
give
it
a
try
peter
be
take
with
buffett
and
thought
he
might
be
right
about
doingbetter
than
the
fast
youngmen
from
santa
barbara
in
fact
her
concern
now
become
that
somethingmight
happen
to
buffett
if
she
swungher
vote
to
him
he
told
her
he
have
a
partner
however
someone
who
would
be
in
charge
of
berkshire
and
the
buffett
family
s
stockholding
if
the
proverbial
truck
mow
himdown
on
her
next
trip
to
pasadena
peter
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
buffett
and
munger
at
the
grand
old
huntington
hotel
so
that
she
could
get
to
know
this
mysterious
partner
the
two
of
themasked
for
a
meeting
with
the
wesco
board
peter
then
do
somethingbrave
allowingherself
to
look
capricious
in
front
of
the
board
rather
than
let
the
company
make
a
serious
mistake
she
go
to
the
next
board
meetingand
ask
the
board
to
reverse
course
and
meet
with
buffett
and
munger
the
board
wave
her
off
however
and
vote
at
a
special
meetingto
use
every
effort
to
complete
the

with

own
the

be
their
mistake
peter
now
take
munger
and
buffett
to
meet
her
brother
to
secure
their
vote
by
the
time

met
again
a
week
later
and
reaffirm
their
position
peter
have
make
a
decision
and
behind
the
scene
brought
her
whole
family
around
to
votingagainst
the
santa
barbara
deal
and
then
my
task
say
peter
be
to
go
back
into
that
little
hermetically
seal
pasadena
boardroom
and
tellall

that
what
be
goingon
in
everyone

this
what
happens
when

they
have
also
decide
they
want

wesco
themselves
and
felt
it
would
be
possible
to
engage

win
his

however
by

it

be
apparent
that

not

he

munger

no
he

like
the

on
one
occasion
munger
say
he
have
found
a

that
he

want
to

buffett
want
to
take
the

away
from

buy
it
for
berkshire
hathaway
after
a
discussion
clearly
about
who
need
it
more
the
combine
strength
of
munger

gottesman
have
somehow
overpower
buffett
and
diversified
get
the

at

that
way
they
kept
a
little
share
still
buffett
do
own
forty
three
percent
of

so
its
purchase
of
berkshire
have
add
almost
five
percent
to
his
personalownership
buyingthrough
diversified
be
particularly
attractive
in
that
it
tend
not
to
ratchet
up
berkshire
s
stock
price
hardly
anybody
be
payingattention
but
why
do
he
want
it
at
all
berkshire
be
not
worth
more
than
forty
buck
as
a

you
couldn
t
have
sell
the
textile
mill
and
insurance
business
for
more

half
the

be

i

twenty

a

the
forty

and
i
didn

in

what

two
thing

so
that

that
buffett

best
while
he
have
not
yet
decide
exactly
what
to
do
with
the
collective
enterprise
he
have
built
by
the
end
of

thing

something
that
be
very
hard
for

always
the
funny
thing
be
she
have
a
great
sense
of
humor
she
be
smart
but
she
tend
to
freeze
in

of
a
crowd
particularly
if
she
thought
they
be
go
to
question
her
about

robert

have
say
in

a
tight
jawed
blue

quality
that
demand
that
her

why
therefore
redford
ask

do
she
keep

she

it

make
any
difference
you
re
pay
what
other
people
be

so

that
be
a
big
thing
she
be
just
convince
i
kept
try
to
get
her
away
from

just
have
a
theme
graham
want
to
say
that
good
journalismmakes
good
profit
buffett
snort
to
himself
over
this
notion
and
refocus
her
you
know
good
journalism
be
not
inconsistent
with
good
profit
or
something
like
that
the
hell
with
all
the
other
stuff
i
just
try
to
convince
her
that
she
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
smarter
than
all
those
dumb
male
that
be
out
there
that
s
what
really
sort
of
bond
us
initially
in
an
ironic
turnabout
buffett
become
kay
graham
s
personal
dale
carnegie
instructor
he
of
allpeople
could
sympathize
with
someone
who
tend
to
freeze
in
front
of
a
crowd
moreover
thanks
to
susie
s
gentle
tutelage
over
the
year
he
have
learn
a
subtler
way
of
dealingwith
people
he
knew
how
to
anticipate
their
reaction
and
to
phrase
thing
in
a
nonthreateningway
his
letter
which
have
always
be
self
conscious
be
now
more
deftly
word
and
empathetic
he
have
learn
to
listen
and
show
interest
in
other
people
and
to
converse
on
topic
other
than
stock
it
help
that
he
be
genuinely
fascinate
by
graham
after
they
finish
preparingand
rehearse
graham
say
she
be
goingto
a
party
at
the
agnellis
that
night
you
might
find
the
sightseeingentertaining
she
say
why
don
t
you
come
with
me
buffett
always
stress
how
uncomfortable
and
out
of
place
he
felt
at
glamorous
event
and
how
uninterested
he
be
in
attendingthem
so
he
told
grahamthat
yes
he
would
go
that
eveninghe
left
his
room
at
the
plaza
to
pick
up
graham
and
ride
to
the
upper
east
side
we
be
this
very
improbable
couple
her
mid
fifty
me
early
forty
and
we
get
to
this
apartment
which
be
more
than
an
apartment
it
be
like
a
triplex
it
be
huge
and
everybody
be
bow
and
scrap
to
kay
there
be
every

gianni
agnelli
the
head
of
fiat
and
his
wife
marella
weren
t
there
it
be
almost
like
a
costume
party
except
it
wasn
t
buffett
return
to
omaha
afterward
havingseen
a
new
side
of
graham
as
he
continued
gettingto
know
her
on
a
personal
level
he
saw
her
as
a
bundle
of
paradox
fearful
but
willful
patrician
but
democratic
wound
by
the
people
she
care
most
about
he
be
surprised
how
much
she
still
talk
about
her
former
husband
a
decade
after
his
suicide
when
you
first
met
her
she
would
often
get
off
on
the
subject
of
phil
very
quickly
almost
like
charlie
get
off
on
a
subject
and
she
described
him
in
term
that
be
sort
of
hard
to
believe
consider
how
badly
he
treat
her
but
after
i
get
to
know
her
well
she
told
me
everything
about
him
and
the
relationship
she
have
found
it
impossible
to
conceive
of
herself
as
be
in
the
same
league
as
him
she
felt
she
be
a
fraud
almost
even
pretend
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
him
they
use
to
hang
out
a
lot
with
the
kennedy
and
she
just
felt
that
she
shouldn
t
be
there
anything
he
say
be
funny
anything
he
do
be
right
when
he
use
to
chop
up
the
child
right
in
front
of
her
she
wouldn
t
stop
him
i
mean
the
whole
thing
that
he
and
graham
who
show
the
aftereffect
of
an
upbringingby
a
cruel
neglectful
mother
and
year
of
abuse
by
a
sadistic
husband
with
untreated
bipolar
disorder
would
be
mutually
attract
seem
almost
a
foregone
conclusion
give
buffett
s
own
childhood
experience
he
knew
how
to
behave
around
her
in
a
way
that

seidman
seem
a
little
baffle
by
this
argument
and
even
munger
admit
that
the
detail
of
what
have
be
do
do
not
look
good
he
beg
seidman
to
look
at
the
bigpicture
as
you
look
at
the
overall
record
we
go
way
beyond
any
legal
requirement
in
tryingto
be
fair
with
people
to
observe
the
nicety
of

i
simply
hope
that
you
willreach
the
conclusion
that
this
average
out
as
not
an
appropriate
case
for
any
sort
of
prosecution
if
there
s
any
defect
at
all
it
s
not
intentional
when
buffett
appear
they
ask
himwhy
he
and
munger
hadn
t
let
wesco
go
into
the
tank
so
they
could
buy
it
cheap
i
think
the
general
business
reputation
of
blue
chip
would
not
have
be
as
good
buffett
say
i
think
someone
might
have
be
sore
about
it
but
why
should
he
care
because
say
buffett
it
be
important
how
wesco
management
feel
about
us
you
can
say
well
we
own
the
control
interest
so
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
but
lou
vincenti
doesn
t
really
need

work
for

if

we

it

he

thus

we

we
try

personally
he
be
unswayed

rickershauser
write
sporkin
directly
he
plead
with
him
not

munger
individual
who
value
their
good

probably
most
people
assume

of
anyone
civilly
prosecute
by

merely

cause
terrible
irreversible
damage
because
the
good
reputation
of
the
commission
automatically
and
inexorably
destroys
the
good
reputation
of
the
defendant
a
giant
s
strength
should
be
use
with
great
discretion
he
urge
the
risk
frominadvertent
oversight
in

should
not
become
so
onerous
that
people

any

the
panic
inside
buffett
s
mind
can
only
be
imagine
within
the
office
he
do
his
best
to
maintain
an
imperturbable
facade
so
as
not
to
alarmhis
office
staff
any
of
whom
might
be
interviewed
by
the

rickershauser
work
like
a

to
portray
his

as
upstandingcitizens
fromthe

family
he
sent
in
biography
of
munger

to
the

work
the
many
board
on
which
they
serve
howard
buffett

as

the

buffett
have
paid
to
the

since

return
at
age
fourteen
buffett
obviously
have
be
grindingaway
at
this
document
as
if
his
life
depend
on
it
munger
be
resign
if
a
policeman
follow
you
down
the
road
for
five
hundred
mile
he
say
to
buffett
you
re
goingto
get
a
ticket
then
rickershauser
make
a
far
proffer
to
sporkin
put
delicately
the
complex
financialinterests
of
mr
buffett
and
mr
munger
have
apparently
raise
the
impression
that
compliance
with
various
legal
requirement
be
becomingdifficult
he
write
notingthe
pair
have
try
to
comply
with
both
the
spirit
and
the
letter
of
the
law
they
now
wish
to
simplify
their
holding
as
rapidly
as
they
can
in
their
interview
the
sec
lawyer
have
already
explore
what
simplifyingwould
mean
sometime
in
the
future
it
be
certainly
possible
that
we
would
merge
blue
chip
with
berkshire
buffett
have
respond
to
their
question
but
blue
chip
have
a
lot
of
legal
problem
and
until
some
of
those
be
resolve
it
might
be
hard
to
arrive
at
what
we
would
feel
reasonably
sure
would
be
a
fair
exchange
ratio
if
i
have
my
preference
it
would
be
that
someday
they
would
be
merge
so
hopefully
we
would
have
more
or
less
the
same
business
we
have
now
but
less
complication
i
don
t
really
like
these
complication
it
may
look
like
i
like
these
complication
i
don
t
have
a
great
staff
to
handle
it
all
it
seem
fairly
simple
while
we
be
do
it
he
say
but
not
simple
now
ask
by
an
sec
investigator
if
buffett
have
contingency
plan
to
simplify
thing
oh
do
he
ever
say
munger
he
have
about
twice
as
biga
contingency
plan
as
before
this
investigation
start
in
consideringthe
proffer
say
sporkin
today
much
depend
on
rickershauser
he
be
one
of
those
few
lawyer
that
i
ve
met
in
life
that
whatever
he
told
you
you
could
go
to
the
bank
on
sporkin
view
rickershauser
as
not
only
a
brilliant
lawyer
but
truthful
straightforward
and
upright
incapable
of
be
disingenuous
rickershauser
told
sporkin
that
buffett
be
goingto
be
the
great
person
that
wallstreet
have
ever
see
and
that
he
be
the
most
decent
honorable
person
you
would
ever
meet
comingfrom
almost
anyone
else
sporkin
would
have
dismiss
this
as
rhetoric
but
comingfrom
rickershauser
he
take
these
statement
to
be
both
sincere
and
probably
well
judged
sporkin
felt
he
have
as
great
a
duty
to
absolve
as
to
convict
he
thought
that
a
prosecutor
have
to
differentiate
between
a
fundamentally
honest
person
who
have
make
a
misstep
and
a
crook
when
it
come
to
crook
his
job
be
to
put
em
away
his
view
of
buffett
and
munger
be
that
they
have
certainly
misstepped
but
that
they
be
not
crook
and
so
the
giant
tapped
blue
chip
gently
on
the
wrist
the
company
consent
to
an
sec

it
neither

the

the

of

when

get
obsess
with
something
especially
someone
new
he
could
not
stop
thinkingabout
it
or
them
this
come
across
to
a
new
person
as
a
wholehearted
flatter
and
even
overwhelmingattentiveness
when
business
arose
however
he
snap
back
to
it
in
a
split
second
with
all
the
fierce
intensity
his
steely
mind
could
muster
as
munger
put
it
buffett
never
let
his
minor
obsession
interfere
with
his
major
obsession
katharine
graham
however
be
no
minor
obsession
some
time
earlier
he
have
decide
to
see
what
spark
would
fly
when
she
brush
up
against
munger
the
great
smart
as
he
knew
kay
be
the
kind
if
i
give
topic
of
thing
for
her
to
do
she
be
very
dutiful
if
i
told
her
to
read
some
terribly
complicate
financial
statement
she
be
go
to
follow
my
instruction
no

it
on
thick
finally
she
be
out
in
los
angeles
and
go
to
meet
charlie
so
she
sat
down
in
that
scrubby
office
of
charlie
s
and
immediately
she
pull
out
a
yellow
pad
so
she
can
take
note
on
what
he
s
say
charlie
just
love
it
the
idea
that
everything
he
be

so
important
that
the
most
powerful
woman
in
the
world
have
to
be
take
it
down
as
fast
as
he
could
talk

could
not
resist
this
encouragement
to
show
off
he
have
be
correspondingwith

and
write

however
giddily

he

smart
with
as
close
to
a
photographic
memory
as
anyone

for
monthly
board

she
didn
t

but
i
told
her
i
ll
dress
as
well
as
don
dress
buffett
say
he
and
i
have
a
sort
of
united
front
buffett
felt
that
kay
be
very
very
smart
and
in
many
way
wise
as
long
as
you
didn
t
go
into
those
area
where
the
wound
be
but
she
understood
people
well
as
they
grow
more
intimate
he
felt
he
could
say
somethingto
her
about
the
way
she
present
herself
to
her
board
he
knew
she
be
less
needy
than
she
herself
realize
one
day
he
take
her
aside
and
say
you
can
t
plead
for
help
anymore
fromthe
board
it
s
just
not
the
position
you
want
to
be
in
and
so
he
say
she
quit
the
business
and
personal
tie
between
the
graham
and
buffett
have
become
close
enough
that
warren
invite
katharine
and
don
to
join
the
grahamgroup
at
their
meeting
at
hilton
head
don
make
an
immediate
impression
with
his
unpretentious
manner
while
raisingits
already
high
average
iq
many
people
quickly
saw
beneath
kay
s
brittle
patrician
veneer
to
the
vulnerability
and
humility
that
have
endear
her
to
warren
thus
she
fit
easily
with
most
of
the
group
despite
her
queenly
presence
worldliness
and
connection
she
make
a
sincere
effort
to
get
alongwith
everyone
although
her
deep
belief
that
men
be
far
superior
to
woman
wasn
t
lose
on
the
woman
at
the

the
beautifully

the

somebody

utter
a

ninety

what
my

want
to

it

terrific

that

the

kay
it
be
the
insecure
kay
if
she
get
feel
insecure
she
could
get
pretty
shrill
occasionally
some
incident
would
set
her
off
and
then
she
would
react
like
an
animal
it
be
as
if
she
felt
nobody
be
on
her
side
she
felt
corner
and
nobody
would
quite
know
what
to

the
executive
at
the

hadn
t
always
be
on
her

and
so
she
always
have
this
sense
in
the
back
of
her
mind
that
she
be
in
an
unfriendly
environment
and
it
could
be

by
some
incident
but
she
always
knew
that
i
be
on
her
side
that
didn
t
mean
i
agree
with
her
on
everything
or
ate
everything
she
want
me
to
eat
but
i
be
on

i
always

she

that

that
it

insecure
i
don
t

he
ever

although
if

he
say
the
desperate
board
have
no
trouble
decidingthat
this
ruddy
round
face
cannonball
be
the
right
guy
byrne
s
first
task
when
he
take
over
as
ceo
be
to
run
straight
to
the
dusty
chinatown
office
of
the
district
of
columbia
s
insurance
superintendent
max
wallach
an
old
school
german
who
spoke
with
a
thick
accent
wallach
be
stubborn
as
hell
and
he
have
this
enormous
interest
in
servingthe
public
byrne
recall
he
be
disgust
with
geico
s
former
management
and
have
refuse
to
dealwith
them
byrne
perceive
that
wallach
be
not
wild
about
himeither
nevertheless
the
two
men
begin
talkingdaily
sometimes
hourly
wallach
insist
that
the
company
put
a
dealin
place
by
late
june
to
raise
money
while
simultaneously
gettingother
insurance
company
to
take
over
some
of
its
policy
that
be
to
reinsure
geico
the
idea
be
to
increase
the
resource
geico
have
available
to
pay
claim
and
to
cut
the
risk
it
be
carryingso
that
they
be
more
in
balance
thus
byrne
have
to
sell
other
insurer
on
the
idea
of
put
up
money
to
save
a
competitor
byrne
s
prior
experience
be
that
he
could
sell
anything
at
first
he
be
confident
my
pitch
be
that
insurance
company
take
care
of
themselves
say
byrne
we
don
t
want
the
regulator
involve
if
geico
fail
the
regulator
would
just
send
the
billfor
geico
s
unpaid
claim
to
its
competitor
so
they
would
end
up
bailingit
out
anyway
but
ed
rust
senior
who
ran
state
farm
say
byrne
he
be
a
cooney
old
bastard
he
conclude
and
he
be
probably
pretty
smart
i
llpay
a
hundred
million
to
cover
any
of
their
unpaid
claim
if
it
put
geico
out
of
business
they
have
a
well
mousetrap
and
killinggeico
willsave
us
money
in
the
longrun
so
state
farm
back
out
of
the
reinsurance
deal
in
the
end
say
byrne
a
couple
of
really
good
friend
renege
the
traveler
just
say
we
re
not
go
to
help
they
didn
t
have
any
principled
idea
behind
this
traveler
be
just
wussy
about
it
three
week
after
he
join
geico
i
be
racingaround

make
the
big

the

be
suggestinggeico
might
not
survive
its
stock
so
recently
tradingfor
a

have
crashed
to
a

somebody
who
own
say
twenty
five
thousand

have
just
see
their
fortune
dwindle
by
almost
ninety
seven
percent
from
more
than
million
to
from
enough
to
live
on
for
the
rest
of
your
life
to
enough
to
buy
a
very
good

the
reaction
of
the

investor
and
shareholder
to
the
calamity
would
in
not
a

many

with

a

he
have
sniffed
out
another

however
the

geico

buffett
felt
that
only
a
brilliant
energetic
manager
have
any
chance
of
turningthe
situation
around
he
want
to

himup
before

after
overcomingbyrne

initial
resistance
she
set
up

buffett
wait
at
graham
s
georgetown
house
after
a
post
board
dinner
for
byrne
to
arrive
this
be
risky
he
told
don
graham
it
could
go
completely
out
of
business
but
in
insurance
it
s
very
hard
to
get
an
edge
and
they
have
an
edge
if
they
get
the
right
person
in
to
run
it
i
think
he
could
turn
it
around
in
come
byrne
red

effervescent
forty
three
year
old

the

in

buffett
question
byrne
for
a
couple
of
hour
of
all
the
irish
american
who
would
ever
swingthrough
buffett
s
orbit
byrne
have
the
great
gift
of
blarney
and
by
a
wide
margin
buffett
say
i
be
excite
and
babblingon
and
on
and
on
say
byrne
warren
ask
a
lot
of
question
about
how
i
thought
we
be
goingto
stay
out
of
insolvency
and
what
my
plan
would
be
after
that
for
buffett
the
question
be
whether
byrne
really
be
cool
unflappable
and
professional
or
whether
he
just
didn
t
know
what
be
go
on
he
decide
that
byrne
understood
insurance
very
well
and
have
the
analytical
ability
and
he
be
a
leader
and
a
promoter
geico
need
an
analytical
leader
to
figure
out
how
to
solve
its
problem
and
it
need
a
promoter
to
make
that
sale
to
all
the
constituency
that
be

involve
the
next
morning
buffett
met
up
with
george
gillespie
the
lawyer
who
have
sell
himthe

because
the
two
men
be

the
detective
company
and
there
be
a
board
meetingthat
day
george
he
say
it
s
pretty
uncharacteristic
of
me
but
today
i
bought
some
stock
that
really
might
be
worthless
tomorrow
he
have
just
call
bill
scott

in
the

place
an

scott
put
together
a
huge
block
trade
buying

worth
of

for
him
buffett
have
wait
year
for
the
chance
to
buy
geico
at
the
right
price
the
tow
truck
have
arrive
but
geico
stilldid
not
have
reinsurance
it
need
capital
and
both
depend
on
the
goodwill
of
max
wallach
the
regulator
but
now
a
new
phenomenon
take
hold
buffett
s
margin
of
safety
be
his
mere
presence
as
an

as
a

a
now
legendary

whose

give
byrne
a
powerful
card
to

in

general
mcdermott
the

be
very
formal
we
go
outside
in

by

and
walter
sat
down
he
be
beautifully
dress
and
look
as
though
everything
he
be
wear
have
be
bought
that
morning
he
be
about
seventy
at
the
time
and
i
be
about
forty
seven
and
he
say
in
a
nice
kind
manner
as
if
he
be
talk
to
a
young
man
he
be
try
to
help
mr
buffett
the
first
thing
you
should
understand
be
nobody
like
to
be
criticize
that
be
set
the
ground
rule
for
get
along
nothingcould
be
easy
for
buffett
i
say
yes
mr
ambassador
i
ve
get
it
don
t
worry
about
that
one
and
then
he
start
in
on
essentiality
there
be
three
property
in
the
world
he
say
that
have
the
quality
of
essentiality
they
be
the
daily
race
form
the
tv
guide
and
the
wall
street
journal
and
i
own
two
out
of
three
what
he
meant
by
essentiality
be
that
even
during
the
depression
he
saw
the
race
form
be
sell
for
two
and
a
half
buck
down
in
cuba
the
race
form
have
that
quality
because
there
be
no
source
of
well
or
more
complete
information
about
handicappinghorses
it
sell
a
hundred
fifty
thousand
copy
a
day
and
it
have
for
about
fifty
year
it
cost
more
than
two
buck
and
it
be
essential
if
you
be
head
to
the
racetrack
and
be
a
serious
race
handicapper
you
want
the
race
form
he
could
charge
whatever
he
want
and
people
be
go
to
pay
it
it
s
like
sell
needle
to
addict
basically
so
every
year
walter
would
go
in
and
say
mirror
mirror
on
the
wall
how
much
should
i
raise
the
price
of
the
race
form
this
fall
and
the
mirror
would
always
say
walter
charge
another
quarter
this
be
when
you
could
buy
the
entire
new
york
time
or
washington
post
for
a
quarter
and
yet
thought
buffett
the
new
york
time
and
the
washington
post
be
great
business
that
meant
the
daily
race
form
be
an
incredible
business
annenbergenjoyed
owningtwo
of
the
essentiality
but
he
want
to
own
all
three
the
visit
to
sunnylands
be
the
beginningof
a
reelthat
he
and
buffett
would
dance
fromtime
to
time
talkingabout
whether
and
how
they
could
buy
the
wall
street
journal
together
but
the
real
reason
that
he
have
me
out
there
be
to
send
a
message
to
kay

she

with
the

that
even
after
a
stressful
day
of

in
which
walter
have
have
to
defend
himself
one
by
one
against
the
point
make
in
the
pearson
column
the
annenbergs
reluctantly
go
to
graham
s
georgetown
mansion
to
attend
a
dinner
party
for
fifty

to
which
they
have

many
week
before
upon

drawingroom
annenberg
who
care
deeply
about
protocol
and
who
be
well
prim
to
take
offense
that
night
do
indeed
take
offense
when
graham
seat

prickliness
about

a
slight
resemble
in
many
way
his
friend
nixon
s
lack
of
perspective
he
and
nixon
also
share
an
unfortunate
inability
to

thus
a
feud
that
have
be

out
of
the

early
and
stop

kay
graham
kay
be
distraught
about
it
she
want
enormously
to
get
along
with
walter
kay
be
not
look
to
have
fight
with
anybody
that
be
not
her
style
she
like
be
in
charge
but
she
do
not
like
to
show
off
she
like
big
shot
and
she
like
big
shot
guy
particularly
so
it
be
not
comfortable
for
her
to
be
in
a
fight
with
him
but
she
also
want
walter
to
understand
that
she
wasn
t
go
to
tell
ben
bradlee
what
to
write
about
in
the
paper
so
by
the
time
i
go
out
to
see
him
he
be
think
about
have
a
book
commission
about
phil
graham
and
how
phil
s
teeth
be
in
a
funny
way
phil
graham
s
teeth
walter
have
a
theory
that
if
you
be
gap
toothed
that
be
a
sign
of
mental
instability
and
if
walter
have
a
theory
you
didn
t
argue
with
it
walter
like
me
but
one
reason
that
he
like
me
be
that
i
never
disagreed
if
walter
say
to
me
black
be
white
i
just
wouldn
t
say
anything
so
i
become
the
go
between
with
kay
annenbergexpected
buffett
to
deliver
the
message
that
if
he
publish
the
book
about
phil
graham
s
teeth
well
that
s
show
business
meanwhile
he
couldn
t
have
be
nicer
to
me
he
put
me
in
this
super
fancy
guest
room
and
he
take
me
into
his
office
where
he
have
a
little
display
in
a
glass
case
of
a
prussian
coin
a
pocketknife
and
one
other
thing
it
be
all
that
his
grandfather
have
in
his
pocket
when
he
land
in
this
country
from
prussia
and
he
say
everything
you
see
here
be
a
product
of
that
in
a
period
of
not
that
many
year
walter
have
rehabilitate
his
family
he
do
his
father
proud
and
that
be
his
number
one
goal
in
life
to
do
his
father
proud
buffett
understood
annenbergpsychologically
yet
never
seem
to
notice
certain
resemblance
between
the
ambassador
and
himself
probably
this
be
because
they
be
so
different
in
other
way
annenberg
s
humorlessness
his
fondness
for
opulence
and
formality
and
his
enmity
toward
the
graham
set
him
strikingly
apart
frombuffett
and
they
be
at
opposite
pole
politically
nonetheless
beneath
their
similarly
paper
thin
skin
these
two
shrewd
businessmen
share
a
deep
drive
to
prove
themselves
both
in
business
and
in
the
socialworld
and
a
reverence
for
father
whom
they
felt
the
world
have
treat
unjustly
they
struck
up
a
correspondence
annenbergwould
come
to
think
of
himself
in
an
avuncular
sort
of
way
as
trainingbuffett
in
philanthropy

should

it

plain
to

such
an
outpouringwas
nothinglike
his

there
be
five

people
who
have
come
from
as
much
as
a
thousand
mile
away
and
they
start
do
all
these
crazy
thing
first
we
have
to
get
a

and
one
of
them
be
to

with
this
nice
woman
from

and
she
start
talk
then
she
pause
and
i
say
and
then
what
in
ten
minute
she
s
sob
uncontrollably
i
ve
destroyed
her
just
by

and
then
what
it
be
like
i
be
boring
into
her
i
felt
like
i
be
run

after
havingmisinterpreted
this
exercise
in
every
possible

drench
companion

both
travel
so
much
anyway
he
would
barely
notice
the
difference
with
the
child
grown
it
be
time
for
her
to
tend
to
her
need
she
told
him
over
and
over
we
both
we
both
have
need
that
part
be
for
sure
true
susie
wasn
t
totally
leave
either
that
be
the
thing
she
just
want
a
change
in
allof
susie
s
travel
in
her
talk
of
buyingthis
place
or
that
place
it
have
never
occur
to
him
that
she
would
leave
because
it
would
never
occur
to
himto
leave
her
wantinga
change
and
not
totally
leave
be
the
kind
of
ambiguous
buffettesque
statement
they
both
tend
to
make
to
avoid
feelingas
though
they
be
disappointinganyone
and
then
she
left
susie
go
off
to
europe
for
a
few
week
with
her
friend
bella
eisenberg
she
return
to
emerald
bay
for
christmas
with
the
family
but
left
to
go
back
to
europe
again
where
she
connect
in
paris
with
tom
newman
son
of
her
friend
rackie
susie
and
tom
who
would
soon
be
joininghis
mother
in
her
new
home
in
san
francisco
become
instant
friend
increasingly
it
be
clear
that
for
susie
havinga
place
of
her
own
in
san
francisco
do
not
mean
rentinga
pied
terre
that
she
would
escape
to
for
a
week
every
now
and
then
warren
be
hopeless
at
takingcare
of
himself
and
susie
jr
come
back
to
omaha
for
a
couple
of
week
to
lend
a
hand
since
the
quicksilver
wedding
she
have
spent
much
of
her
marriage
callingher
mother
in
tear
bigsusie
be
gently
assistingher
out
of
the
marriage
at
the
same
time
that
she
be
extricatingherself
from
many
of
the
convention
that
tie
her
to
her
own
marriage
susie
jr
try
to
explain
to
her
father
that
give
how
much
time
he
and
her
mother
have
be
spendingapart
his
life
be
not
goingto
be
that
different
from
before
but
warren
have
not
previously
thought
of
himself
and
susie
as
livingvirtually
separate
life
in
his
mind
susie
live
for
him
she
certainly
act
as
if
she
do
when
they
be
together
so
it
be
a
hard
concept
to
grasp
that
susie
want
her
own
life
and
would
not
be
there
for
himallthe
time
susie
and
warren
talk
for
hour
and
hour
on
the
phone
now
that
he
understood
warren
would
have
do
anythingshe
ask
to
get
her
back
submit
to
any
condition
met
any
demand
move
to
california
learn
to
dance
but
apparently
it
be
too
late
he
could
not
give
her
what
she
want
whatever
that
be
she
explain
it
in
term
of
her
freedom
her
need
to
be
separate
and
to
fulfill
her
need
and
find
her
own
identity
she
could
not
do
that
while
spendingallher
time
takingcare
of
him
so
he
wander
aimlessly
around
the
house
barely
able
to
feed
and
clothe
himself
he
come
to
the
office
most
day
with
a
rag
headache
in
front
of
the
staff
he
maintain
his
self
control

he
do
look
as

he
be
not

at

exactly
sure
where

head
so
she
be
terrify
but
finally
she
make
the
call
arrivingat
the
door
to
cook
a
homemade
meal
she
found
a
cave
fill
with
book
newspaper
and
annual
report
warren
who
be
incapable
of
functioningwithout
female
companionship
be
desperate
for
affection
he
have
be
tryingto
fillthe
void
by
takingdottie
to
the
movie
and
spendingtime
with
ruthie
muchemore
a
divorc
e
and
family
friend
yet
he
be
obviously
still
a
lonely
miserable
man
who
have
be
reduce
emotionally
to
an
eleven
year
old
boy
he
need
feed
his
clothes
be
a
wreck
astrid
be
the
least
pushy
woman
imaginable
but
as
susie
have
know
would
happen
when
face
with
a
problem
she
knew
what
to
do
warren
would
eventually
come
to
explain
why
susie
left
this
way
it
be
preventable
it
shouldn
t
have
happen
it
be
my
big
mistake
essentially
whatever
i
do
in
connection
with
susie
leave
would
be
the
big
mistake
i
ever
make
part
of
it
be
sort
of
not
understandable
it
be
definitely
ninety
five
percent
my
fault
no
question
about
that
it
may
even
have
be
ninety
nine
percent
i
just
wasn
t
attune
enough
to
her
and
she
d
always
be
perfectly
attune
to
me
it
have
always
be
all
in
my
direction
almost
you
know
my
job
be
get
more
interest
and
more
interest
and
more
interest
as
i
go
along
when
susie
left
she
felt
less
need
than
i
should
have
make
her
feel
your
spouse
start
come
second
she
kept
me
together
for
a
lot
of
year
and
she
contribute
ninety
percent
to
raise
the
kid
although
strangely
enough
i
think
i
have
about
as
much
influence
it
just
wasn
t
proportional
to
the
time
spent
and
then
she
lose
her
job
in
effect
when
the
kid
be
raise
in
a
sense
it
be
time
for
her
to
do
what
she
like
to
do
she
do
a
lot
of
volunteer
thing
along
the
way
but
in
the
end
that
never
really
work
that
well
she
didn
t
want
to
be
mr
big
the
way
a
lot
of
wife
of
prominent
guy
in
town
do
she
didn
t
like
be
a
prominent
woman
because
she
s
the
wife
of
a
prominent
guy
she
love
connect
with
people
and
everybody
connects
with
her
she
love
me
and
she
still
love
me
and
we
have
an
incredible
relationship
but
still
it
shouldn
t
have
happen
and
it
s
totally
my
fault
no
matter
how
huge
the
wound
or
its
reason
as

the

an
upheaval
in
buffett

the

with

bewilder
to

it
meant
the
classic
stepmother
problem
a
barrier
between
her

and
the
problemof
accept
that
anyone

this
wasn
t
what
she

that
they
both
have
need
in
her

warren
s
dependence
on
her
be
absolute
how
could
he
need
a
relationship
with
anyone
else
but
it
might
have
be
predict
warren
have
search
his
whole
life
for
the
perfect
daisy

and
whatever
he
want
astrid

to

flee

she
come
to

no

how
she
divide
her
own
attention
she
do
not
really
want
warren
to

his
and
thus
it
be
susie
s
expectation
not
warren
s
that
would
come
to
define
allof
their

of

into
some

he

of

insistence
that
sittingin

be
no
way
to
spend
a
life
he
begin
to
see
what
he
have
miss
while
he
be
friendly
enough
with
his
kid
he
hadn

really
gotten
to
know

the
reality
behind
the
joke
who
be
that
that
s
your
son
meant
that
he
would
spend
the
next
few
decade
tryingto
repair
these
relationship
much
of
the
damage
could
not
be
undone
at
age
forty
seven
he
be
just
beginningto
take
stock
of
his
loss
warren
who

on
honesty

perfectly
open
about
livingwith
astrid
everybody
knew
except
doc
thompson
both
susie
and
astrid
however
remain
closemouthed
about
the
situation
say
merely
that
they
like
each
other
warren
make
only
one
public
statement
if
you
knew
the
people
involve
you
d
see
that
it
suit
all
of
us
quite
well
that
be
true
at
least
if
compare
to
the
alternative
in
this
sense
and
others
the
situation
bore
a
resemblance
to
the
life
of

idol
ben

in
the
mid

for
him
it
be
a
real
strain
to
explain
the
relationship
much
later
he
would
describe
it
this
way
susie
put
me
together
and
astrid
keep
me
together
they
both
need
to
give
and
i
m
a
great
receiver
so
it
work
for
them
but
the
question
never
end
because
explanation
like
these
and

that
the

glide

they
can
t

the
inequality
of

in

it
involve
two

but
only
one
of

that
in
a
state
of
ignorance
warren
thought
of
susie
as
the
one
who
have
be
wrong
he
try
to
square
thing
by
placatingher
in
private
and
showeringher
with
lavish
attentiveness
in
public
which
left
astrid
expose
and
vulnerable
in
a
similar
state
of
ignorance
astrid
who
admire
and
practically
worship
susie
accepted
that
warren
would
never
marry
her
cede
susie
the
turf
of
all
social
and
business
event
outside
omaha
and
unhappily
tolerate
beingcalled
buffett
s
housekeeper
and
mistress
so
that
his
marriage
to
susie
would
appear
as
intact
as
possible
buffett
would
come
to
rationalize
this
astrid
know
where
she
fit
with
me
she
know
she
s
need
that
s
not
a
bad
place
to
be
and
indeed
her
role
however
narrowly
define
do
give
astrid
a
security
that
she
have
always
lack
it
have
take
a
literalchange
in
geography
for
susie
to
maintain
her
aura
of
the
selfless
mr
warren
buffett
while
simultaneously
seekingfulfillment
in
a
life
completely
outside
that
role
yet
it
be
warren
who
look
as
though
he
be
gettingthe
best
of
both
world
even
though
the
new
relationship
didn
t
compensate
for
his
loss
he
couldn
t
defend
himself
against
the
impression
that
he
have
driven
his
wife
to
move
out
through
his
relationship
with
katharine
grahamor
because
some
people
get
the
time
line
wrong
his
relationship
with
astrid
he
want
desperately
to
hold
the
remainingpieces
together
and
would
try
for
the
rest
of
susie
s
life
to
make
up
for
what
he
have
do
to
disappoint
her
but
of
course
that
didn
t
change
who
he
be
and
obviously
didn
t
mean
he
would
stop
seeingkay
buffett
invite
graham
to

to

you

the
idea
of
negotiate
with

we

thirty

that
wasn

any
money
he
buffetted
the

i
told
all

we
have

length

at
the

you
ve
get

you

you
will
never
have
another

again
he

childhood
omaha
have
be
torn
for
more
than
a
decade
over
how
to
liberate
the
only
route
to
iowa
fromthe
toll
taker
s
grasp
he
and

later
try
to
buy
the
detroit
internationalbridge
company
which
own
the
bridge
that
connect
detroit
and
windsor
ontario
but
wound
up
with
only
twenty
four
percent
of
the
company
it
be
one
hell
of
a
bridge
a
thousand
square
foot
and
it
make
more
money
i
be
terribly
disappointed
when
we
didn
t
get
it
charlie
kept
tell
me
how
well
off
we
be
that
we
didn
t
get
it
because
he
say
what
could
be
bad
for
your
image
than
a
guy
who
raise
the
price
on
a
toll
bridge
indeed
the
judge
didn
t
like
me
for
one
reason
or
another
he
just
didn
t
like
me
he
didn
t
like
our
lawyer
either
most
people
like
ron

the

not

characteristically
buffett
do
not
want
to
lengthen
the
fight
with
the
judge
munger
have
always
kid
buffett
that
his
management
technique
be
to
take
out
all
the
cash
froma
company
and
raise
price
if
that
fail
buffett
didn
t
have
any
more
arrow
in
his
quiver
this
technique
wouldn
t
solve
the
problem
of
the
even

buffett
be
so
beaten
down
and
want
so
badly
not
to
get
into
a
confrontation
with
the
judge
that
he
be
willingto
let
million
go
down
the
drain
a
remnant
of
his
last
biglegalbattle

the

finally
at
longlast

and
diversified
buffett
want
desperately
to
be
do
with
lawyer
deposition
subpoena
and
fight
i
didn
t
want
to
appeal
i
just
felt
it
would
take
so
damn
long
it
would
irritate
the
judge
and
that
we
have
more
to
lose
by
irritate
him
as
he
enforce
this
injunction
and
as
the
courier
come
up
with
all
these
furious
attack
and
he
could
just
keep
extend
it
i
declare
we
re
not
go
to
appeal
because
in
a
year
or
year
and
a
half
we
ll
be
dead
anyway
and
ron
and
charlie
told
me
i
be
wrong
and
i
be
wrong
in
the
end
he
decide
to
go
alongwith
them
we
have
to
appeal
i
wasn
t
go
to
give
in
to
a
set
of
condition
which
be
go
to
make
us
noncompetitive
so
basically
i
have
no
choice
we
don
t
bluff
it
s
not
my
style
anyway
over
a
lifetime
you
ll
get
a
reputation
for
either
bluffing
or
not
bluffing
and
therefore
i
want
it
to
be
understood
that
i
don
t
do
it
the
buffalo
even
news
be
buffett
s
single
large
investment
and
by
a
wide
margin
it
be
tyingup

losingmoney
under

and
vulnerable
to
any
strike
that
would
weaken
it
far
at
a
time
when
the
stock

be

buffett
need
it
to
produce

to

at

he
always

the

eventually
figure
out
that

they
thought
so
much
alike
that
the
main
difference
between
their
behavior
in
business
be
that
munger
on

would
veto

that
the

buffett
might
have
struck
their
attitude
toward
their
shareholder
be
identical
with
the
merger
do
in
the
annual
report
the
two
men
spell
out
to
berkshire
s
shareholder
a
set
of
principle
fromwhich
they
would
operate
they
call
them
the
owner
orient
principle
no
other
management
told
its
company
s
owner
these
thing
although
our
form
be
corporate
our
attitude
be
partnership
they
write
we
do
not
view
the
company
as
the
ultimate
owner
of
our
business
asset
but
instead
view
the
company
as
a
conduit
through
which
our
shareholder
own
the
asset
this
statement
deceptively
simple
amount
to
a
throwback
to
a
former
generation
of
corporate
governance
the
modern
day
corporate
chief
view
the
shareholder
as
a
nuisance
a
noisy
or
quiet
group
to
be
appease
or
ignore
they
be
certainly
not
his

or
his
bos
we
don
t

buffett
and

say
we

of

we
run
the
business
to
achieve
the
best
long
termresults
all
of
these
sound
like
simple
truism
except
that
so
few
management
could
honestly
make
allof
these
statement
incidentally
buffett
also
write
that
year
r
egardless
of
price
we
have
no
interest
at
allin
sellingany
good
business
that
berkshire
own
and
be
very
reluctant
to
sell
sub
par
business
even
if
that
hurt
performance
as
longas
we
expect
them
to
generate
at

some
cash
and
as
longas
we
feelgood
about
their

that

the

who
take
over
from

chace
at

in
after
the

then
buffett
have
shut
down
the
manchester
milland
cut
back
on
production
in
new
bedford
by
one
third
the
textile
business
would
make
money
for
about
ten
minute
each
year
we
make
half
the
men
s
suit
lining
in
the
country
but
nobody
ever
go
to
a
tailor
and
say
i
d
like
a
pin
strip
gray
suit
with
a
hathaway
line
a
square
yard
of
cloth
that
come
out
of
our
mill
cost
more
than
a
square
yard
from
somewhere
else
and
capitalism
s
frugal
that
way
we
d
get
award
from
sears
roebuck
as
supplier
of
the
year
and
we
take
them
fishing
and
supply
them
during
world
war
ii
and
i
be
personal
friend
with
the
chairman
of
sears
and
they
d
say
your
product
be
wonderful
and
we
d
say
how
about
another
half
a
cent
a
yard
and
they
d
say
you
re
out
of
your
mind
so
it
be
a
terrible
business
instead
of
generatingcash
morrison
beg
buffett
to
give
him
cash
so
that
he
could
upgrade
the
mill
buffett
say
no
and
yet
he
clungto
the
beleaguer
mill
thus
it
have
be
even
harder
like
havinga
root

for
him
to
sell
one

the

for
several
year
we
didn

see
him
that
often
say
buffett
and
he
would
sort
of
get
himself
psyched
up
to
try
and
get
past
that
plus
we
didn

want
to

it
charlie

him
so

we
didn

face

lou
vincenti
be
decisive
he
be
intelligent
and
he
be
honest

shrewd
say
munger
and
he
ran
the

saving

in
california
to
go
to
a
computer

with

you
can
see
how
that
would
turn
warren

me
on
he

cranky

independent
and
a
very
good
human

we
love

much
that
even
after
we
found
out
we
kept

the

comingin
and
he
wasn

doingus
any
harm
buffett
and
munger
turn
this
story
into
a
jokey
parable
sayingthat
they
want
more
business
that
could
be
run
successfully
by
a
manager
with
alzheimer
s

buffett
be
sensitive
to
the
subject
of
alzheimer
s
he
take
great
pride
in
his
powerful
memory
now
his
mother
grow
forgetful
her
state
of
mind
could
be
obscure
by
the
way
that
leila
have
always
tend
to
live
in
the
past
and
to
create
her
own
ideal
reality
her
version
of
buffett
s
bathtub
memory
in
which
whoosh
the
plugpopped
up
and
bad
memory
drain
away
now
in
her
late
seventy
her
son
s
glory
be
her
major
joy
but
warren
still
tremble
if
he
have
to
spend
time
with
her
it
be
no
wonder
since
the
old
rage
stillflared
up
occasionally
by
now
virtually
every

ran

you
have
to

that

just
happens
sometimes
to
other
people

not
just
you
warren

doris
go
through
it
for

so
just
don

focus
on
what
she

it

peter

she
sometimes
comment
that

possibly
that

since

have
no

buffett
agree
to
buy
a
farm
which
he
would
rent
to
his
son
an
arrangement
rather
like
the
one
he
have
have
with
his
sharecropper
back
when
he
be
stillin
high
school
howie
trudge

a

butt
and
would
not
pay
a
nickel
more
than
necessary
finally
somebody
bit
in
tekamah
and
buffett
plunked
down
the
necessary
although
he
take
howie
s
rent
check
he
didn
t
set
foot
on
the
farm
as
with
susie

art
gallery
he
have
no
interest
in
the
experience
only
the
money
he
compare
the

as
a
commodity
business
to
men

suit
lining
no
one
go
to
the

he

that
buffett
try
to
control
his
child
with
money
yet
never
spent
any
time
teachingthemabout
money
might
seemodd
but
it
be
the
same
story
as
with
his
employee
he
felt
any
smart
person
could
figure
it
out
he
hand
the
kid
their
berkshire
stock
without
stressinghow
important
it
might
be
to

letter
polished
to
a
fine
sheen
by
carol
loomis
have
tackle
most
financialsubjects
and
he
undoubtedly
thought
that
these
alongwith
the
example
of
his
life
serve
as
adequate
lesson
it
probably
didn
t
occur
to
himthat
his
kid
might
need
more
personal
tutoringthan
his
partner
buffett
do
care
very
much
about
what
they
do
with
their
stock
however
because
he
and
berkshire
be
as
one
to
sellthe
stock
be
to
sell
himtoo
even
so
he
do
not
want
his
childen
to
live
on
easy
street
because
of
berkshire
hathaway
rather
he
thought
the
future
of
his
child
and
the
future
of
berkshire
hathaway
would
ultimately
be
join
not
through
ownership
of
the
company
but
by
an
act
of
philanthropy
their
stewardship
of
the
stock
in
the
buffett
foundation
buffett
express
his
feeling
on
the
subject
of
inheritance
and
philanthropy
through
a
tribute
he
write
in
the
omaha
world
herald
upon
the
death
of
peter
kiewit
a
near
mythical
figure
in
omaha
kiewit
s
company
peter
kiewit
son
inc
be
reportedly
the
most
profitable
construction
company
in
the
world
once
call
the
colossus
of
road
buffett
and
kiewit
never
have
business
dealing
but
kiewit
own
the
omaha
world
herald
and
buffett
sat
on
its
board
the
childless
workaholic
kiewit
have
live
in
a
penthouse
apartment
in
kiewit
plaza
where
berkshire
be
headquarter
and
he
commute
to
work
by
elevator
buffett
envy
himthis
arrangement
kiewit
be
another
buffett
prototype
a
hard
taskmaster
and
penny
pincher
in
the
office
who
instill
his
value
through
pithy
little
saying
the
company
be
his
labor
of
love
and
he
be
often
pleased
but
never
satisfied
a
reputation
be
like
fine
china
he
say
expensive
to
acquire
and
easily
broken
in
makingethicaldecisions
therefore
if
you
re
not
sure
if
somethingis
right
or
wrong
consider
whether
you
d
want
it
report
in
the
morningpaper
also
like
buffett
kiewit
be
obsess
with
managingother
people
s
weight
the
main
difference
between
themwere
three
kiewit
be
a
hand
on
manager
he
shun
publicity
and
he
only
seem
to
be
a
cheapskate
while
in
omaha
he
drove
a
four
year
old
ford
and
live
like
a
spartan
as
an
example
to
his
employee
but
at
his
palmsprings
vacation
home
he
drove
a
cadillac
and
live
a
more
than
comfortable
lifestyle
nevertheless
in
many
way
peter
kiewit
exemplify
warren
buffett
s
idea
about
how
a
life
should
be
live
when
kiewit
die
buffett
s
tribute
not
only
honor
the
man
it
express
as
much
as
anythingthat
buffett
ever
write
how
he
would
like
to
be
remember
himself
startingfrom
scratch
he
write
kiewit
built
one
of
the
great
construction
company
of
the
world
although
not
the
large
it
may
well
be
the
most
profitable
business
of
its
type
in
the
country
an
achievement
possible
only
because
kiewit
be
able
to
transmit
throughout
an
organization
of
thousand
of
employee
an
unremittinginsistence
on
excellence
and
efficiency
kiewit
be
overwhelmingly
a
producer
not
a
consumer
he
go
on
profit
go
to
build
the
capacity
of
the
organization
not
to
provide
opulence
to
the
owner
in
essence

spends
less

use
at

he

reverse
the

by

or
he
may
pas
themon
to

either
duringhis

by

or
upon
his
death
by

william

hearst
buffett

use
up
many
of
his

by

simeon
he
arrange
to
have
ice
haul
daily
to
the

in
his
private
zoo
much
the
way
pharaoh
use
their
claimchecks
to
build
the
pyramid
buffett
have
meditate
on
the
economics
of
the
pyramid
if
he
hire
a
thousand
people
to
build
a
pyramid
dedicate
to
himself
he
say
it
would
all
go
into
the
economy
every
dime
and
a
lot
of
form
of
give
and
spending
be
just
a
form
of
that
it
s
crazy
and
it
s
probably
somewhat
morally
wrong
too
but
there
be
people
who
would
think
it
s
great
that
you
re
give
employment
to
the
people
who
be
tug
the
slab
for
the
pyramid
and
they
re
make
a
mistake
it
isn
t
productive
they
re
think
in
term
of
input
not
output
if
you
want
to
build
pyramid
to
yourself
and
take
a
lot
of
resource
out
of
society
you
ought
to
pay
like
hell
for
it
you
ought
to
pay
a
perfectly
appropriate
tax
i
would
force
you
to
give
back
a
huge
chunk
to
society
so
that
hospital
get
built
and
kid
get
educate
too
instead
he
note
in
this
article
some
who
earn
the
claimchecks
pass
themalongto
their
heir
enable
hundred
of
descendant
to
consume
far
more
than
they
personally
have
produce
in
effect
their
whole
lifetime
have
be
spent
at
the
withdrawal
window
of
the
bank
of
societal
resource
buffett
found
the
result
ironic
i
love
it
he
say
when
i
m
around
the
country
club
and
i
hear
people
talk
about
the
debilitate
aspect
of
a
welfare
cycle
where
some
woman
have
a
child
at
seventeen
and
she
get
food
stamp
and
we
re
perpetuate
a
cycle
of
dependency
and
these
same
people
be
leave
their
kid
a
lifetime
supply
of
food
stamp
and
beyond
but
instead
of
have
a
welfare
officer
they
have
a
trust
fund
officer
and
instead
of
have
food

they
have

they

this
buffett

nevertheless
buffett
have
make
a
decision
that
demonstrate
newfound
if
slight
flexibility
in
he
set
up
an
innovative
programin

berkshire

this
programallowed
the
shareholder
to
direct
how
the
company
spent
its
charitable
dollar
rather
than
lettingtop
management
donate
to
its
pet
cause
and
receive
the
credit
the
programdid
not
allocate
much
money
but
for
buffett
to
do
it
at
all
be
a

and
the

buffett
however
be
insatiably
curious
and
have
a
deep
interest
in
knowingabout
his

as
individual
as
if
they
be
part
of
an
extend

which
be
how
he

them

perhaps
it

you

someday
buffett
invite
ron
and
irv
to
come
to
his
office
for
a
visit
and
struck
up
a
relationship
with
them
he
sent
louie
a
letter
explaininghis
thought
on
the
pro
and
con
of
their
sellingto
berkshire
the
blumkins
should
be
in
no
hurry
to
sell
he
write
dealingwith
themas
honestly
as
anyone
possibly
could
if
you
decide
not
to
sell
now
you
be
very
likely
to
realize
more
money
later
on
with
that
knowledge
you
can
deal
from
strength
and
take
the
time
require
to
select
the
buyer
you
want
then
he
laid
out
what
he
really
have
to
offer
they
could
sell
to
another
furniture
company
he
write
or
to
somebody
in
a
similar
business
but
such
a
buyer
no
matter
what
promise
be
make
usually
will
have
manager
who
feel
they
know
how
to
run
your
business
operation
and
sooner
or
later
will
want
to
get
into
hand
on
activity
they
will
have
their
own
way
of
do
thing
and
even
though
your
business
record
undoubtedly
will
be
far
well
than
theirs
human
nature
at
some
point
will
cause
them
to
believe
that
their
method
be
superior
then
there
be
the
financial
maneuverer
usually
operating
on
large
amount
of
borrow
money
who
plan
to
resell
either
to
the
public
or
to
another
corporation
as
soon
as
the
time
be
favorable
he
write
if
the
sole
motive
of
the
owner
be
to
cash
their
chip
and
put
the
business
behind
them
either
of
these
type
of
buyer
be
satisfactory
but
if
the
seller
business
represent
the
creative
work
of
a
lifetime
and
remains
an
integral
part
of
their
personality
and
sense
of
be
both
of
these
type
of
buyer
have
serious
flaw
any
buyer
will
tell
you
that
he
need
you
and
if
he
have
any
brain
he
most
certainly
do
need
you
but
a
great
many
for
the
reason
mention
above
don
t
subsequently
behave
in
that
manner
we
will
behave
exactly
as
promise
both
because
we
have
so
promise
and
because
we
need
to
buffett
explain
that
if
he
bought
he
want
the
blumkins
to
stay
on
as
partner
if
they
look
back
with
regret
the
deal
would
be
a
disappointment
for
everyone
includinghim
he
told
louie
that
he
would
get

why

someone
who

not

moreover
the

not
the

thus
a

that

at

the

they

the

buffett
of

would
not
have
sneer
at
an
extra
million

and
the
chance
to

which
be
what
his
decision
not
to
liquidate
berkshire
hathaway
in
cost
him
personally
but
ordinary
greed
no
longer
drove
his
decision
for
this
cost
himfar
more
than
any
other
shareholder
his
long
standingattachment
to
berkshire
held
himso
firmly
in
its
grip
that
he
give
up
the
option
of
keepingberkshire
as
a
virtual
partnership
otherwise
he
would
have
liquidate
without
a
second
s
hesitation
instead
he
have
cross
the
rubicon
and
chosen
the
role
of
beingthe

with
its
disparate
part
be
hard
to
value
munger
like
to
joke
that
berkshire
be
the
frozen
corporation
since
it
would
grow
endlessly
but
never
pay
a
penny
in

to
its

by

they

he

that

would
be

another
example
suppose
that
warren
make
a

astrid
to
give
up

for
a

if
he
ate
a

chip
he
have
to
pay
her
a
thousand

this
would
not
be
a
derivative
contract
warren
and
astrid
be
simply
makinga
deal
whether
warren
ate
a
potato
chip
be
not
derive
from
anything
it
be
under
his
own
control
however
if
astrid
and
warren
make
that
agreement
and
then
astrid
paid
warren
s
sister
bertie
a
hundred
buck
as

in
exchange
for
a
thousand
dollar
if
astrid
lose
the
bet
the
deal
with
bertie
would
be
a
derivative
contract
it
would
be
derive
from
whether
warren
ate
the
potato
chip
which
be
not
under
either
bertie
s
or
astrid
s
control
astrid
stood
to
lose
the

and

would

if

therefore
be
either
a

rather
than

her
she
fought
back
this

she
didn

know
what
to
do
you
don

ever
need

susie
have
told

about

of
you
after

her
early
on
a
saturday
morning
he
say
that
if
he
give
her
the

her
creditor
it
would
only
help
the
business
to
whom
she
owe
money
the
counterparties
whomshe
have
insured
his
logic
be
that
they
be
speculator
therefore
he
would
not
bailthemout
as
she
realize
that
this
meant
he

this
meant
that
her

despise
her
he
felt
however
that
his
decision
be
simply
rational
i

such
as

a

of

so
abruptly
that
the

almost
beyond

these
and
the

be
goingto
gouge
a

hole
in
the

that

with
that

the

the

committee
which
buffett
have
join
at
the

of
its

bob

begin
to
discus
loweringthe

at
which
the

these
option
be
right
to
buy

at
a
specify
price
in
the
future
if
salomon
have
be
see
s

it
would
be
as
if
buffett
paid
the
line
worker
partly
in
piece
of
paper
that
give
them
the
right
to
buy
candy
at
a
set

if
the

of

kept
goingup
every
year
those
piece
of

kept
increasingin
value
as
time
go
along
however
right
now
the
candy
factory
be
havinga
bad
year
see
s
be
goingto
lose
money
and
its
employee
would
suffer
a
cut
in
wage
the
compensation
committee
be
talkingabout
loweringthe
price
the
worker
would
have
to
pay
for
candy
to
make
up
the
difference
buffett
argue
against
this
the
candy
factory
belong
to
the
owner
the
shareholder
not
the
employee
he
want
the
employee
share
of
candy
trim
by
exactly
the
amount
that
earnings
have
decline
the
other
member
of
the
committee
however
felt
the
worker
have
be
promise
candy
worth
a
certain
amount
when
gutfreund
announce
their
package
a
couple
of
month
before
and
when
the
candy
go
on
sale
they
be
obligate
to
make
up
the
difference
perhaps
they
be
tryingto
forestall
the
traditional
wallstreet
bonus
day
stampede
that
occurs
whenever
people
be
unhappy
take
the
money
and
run
buffett
felt
this
be
morally
wrong
since
the
shareholder
weren
t
gettingtheir
earnings
why
should
the
employee
get
their
candy
the
others
outvote
himtwo
to
one
he
be
outrage
but
his
role
on
the
salomon
board
be
mostly
titular
his
advice
be
rarely
sought
and
less
often
take
even
though
salomon
stock
by
then
be
startingto
recover
the
repricingof
the
stock
option
he
say
almost
immediately
make
his
investment
in
salomon
way
less
attractive
financially
than
it
have
be
i
could
have
fought
harder
and
be
more
vocal
i
might
have
felt
well
about
myself
if
i
do
but
it
wouldn
t
have
change
the
course
of
history
unless
you
sort
of
enjoy
combat
it
doesn
t
make
sense
buffett
s
willingness
to
do
combat
even
in
a
roundabout
way
have
diminish
markedly
since
the
day
of
sanborn
map
dempster
and
the
buffettingof
seabury
stanton
i
don
t
enjoy
battle
i
won
t
run
from
them
if
i
need
to
do
it
but
i
don
t
enjoy
them
at
all
when
it
come
to
the
board
charlie
and
i
didn
t
even
vote
against
it
we
vote
yes
we
didn
t
even
abstain
because
abstain
be
the
same
thing
as
throw
down
the
gauntlet
and
there
be
other
thing
at
salomon
one
thing
after
another
would
come
up
that
i
thought
be
nutty
but
they
didn
t
want
me
to
say
anything
and
then
the
question
be
do
you
say
anything
i
don
t
get
in
fight
just
to
get
in

buffett

you

ready
to
bite
the

off
a
bear
every
morning
indeed
it
appear
to
employee
who
make
presentation
in
board
meeting
that
buffett
be
a
relatively
passive
board
member
he
seem
to
understand
little
of
the
detail
of
how
the
business
be
run
and
adjustingto
a
business
that
wasn
t
literally

of
brick

or
run
like
an
assembly
line
be
not
easy
for
him
since
he
have
make
the
investment
in

purely
because
of
gutfreund
and
now
didn
t
like
the
way
it
be
workingout
he
always
have
another
choice
which
be
to
sellhis

and
resign
from
the

boil
with
rumor
that

that

either
goingto
sell
or
to

and
bringin
someone

it

to
that
someone
as
prominent
as
buffett
sellingand
resigningfromthe
board
as
a
major

would
be
a
shockinggesture
that
would

cost
his

as
well
as

unreliable
by
now
his

moreover
he
hadn

up
on

his
whole

for

gutfreund
and
when
buffett
threw
his

around
someone
it
take
an
ax
to
split
them
apart
thus
as
the
holiday
approach
he

however
ko

however
buffett
apply
a
margin
of

to
his

he
do
this
simply
by
takinga

at
the

rather
than

the

go

to

he

a

that

be

and
he
have
a

in

so
he
could
trade
all
the
time
he
have
it
rig
so
that
if
the
japanese
yen
move
more
than
a
certain
amount
it
rang
a
bell
or
something
and
woke
him
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
say
to
mark
now
let
me
get
this
straight
you
ve
get
this
computer
here
and
at
three
in
the
morning
after
you
ve
be
do
who
know
what
we
won
t
even
ask
until
one
or
two
in
the
morning
you
re
asleep
and
this
bell
ring
and
you
get
up
and
stagger
over
to
the
computer
and
you
see
that
the
yen
dollar
relationship
be
such
and
such
tell
me
be
there
any
limit
to
what
you
can
punch
in
to
the
computer
in
term
of
the
size
of
the
trade
that
you
d
do
do
the
computer
rebel
if
you
make
a
mistake
and
he
say
no
i
can
type
whatever
i
want
so
i
say
well
if
you
ve
have
a
little
too
much
to
drink
and
you
punch
three
extra
zero
in
there
by
mistake
be
the
firm
commit
do
it
have
to
follow
through
with
the
trade
and
he
say
yeah
so
i
have
these
nightmare
of
this
guy
at
three
in
the
morning
maybe
with
a
girl
still
in
the
bed
or
something
go
over
there
in
a
daze
and
sort
of
punch
something
into
the
computer
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
then
stagger
back
to
bed
and
find
out
the
next
morning
that
instead
of
a
trillion
yen
he
d
put
in
a
quadrillion
yen
to
buffett
it
be
obvious
that
the
combination
of
fallible
human
being
and
judgment
free
computer
in
a
completely
unmonitored
unsupervised
environment
meant
an
almost
unlimited
potentialfor
thing
to
go
wildly
out
of
control
but
as
a
board
member
he
lack
authority
to
make
change
and
could
only
try
persuasion
by
now
he
and
munger
have
wrangle
repeatedly
and
unsuccessfully
with
salomon
s
management
munger
have
take
over
the
audit
committee
which
have
not
formerly
be
a
bastion
of
zealous
oversight
and
put
it
through
six
and
seven
hour
dissection
of
the
firmand
its
accountant
munger
discover
that
salomon
s
derivative
business
have
grown
immensely
usingtrades
for
which
no
ready
market
exist
the
trade
would
not
settle
for
longperiods
sometimes
year
with
minimal
cash
change
hand
the
derivative
be
value
on
salomon
s
book
usinga
model
since
the
modelwas
create
by
those
whose
bonus
it
would
determine
not
surprisingly
the
model
usually
show
the
trade
be
quite
profitable
as
much
as
million
of
profit
have
be
overstate
through
such
accountingmismarks
the
audit
committee
however
address
only
trade
and
deal
already
approve
and
usually
complete
the
real
oversight
take
place
before
the
fact
there
in
the
one
area
in
which
buffett
and
munger
unequivocally
have
more
skillthan
anyone
else
make
investment
they
weigh
in
loud
of
all
and
be
ignore
their
protestation
only
alienate
themfrom
the
employee

one
example
salomon

say
when
the

this
be
an
idiotic
idea
there
be
no
anglos
and
no
swiss
involve
in
this
company
the
name
alone
be
reason
not
to
get
involve
but
salomon
put
million
into
the
joint
venture
anyway
thinkingthat
oilwas
goingto
be
integral
to
russia
s

and
that
western
capitalwas

while
the

and
the
oil
isn

the

go

no
margin

could
cover
that
sure
enough
as
soon

the

he

peekingsideways
from

see
what
he
would
do
course
after
course
arrive
and
each
of
his

go
back
untouched
he
imagine
that
he
heard
a
slight
buzz
from
the

how
many
more

could
there
possibly

mr

seem
slightly
embarrass
for
him

disgracinghimself
even
in
the
middle
of
his
bonfire
of
embarrassment
he
could
not
help
but
think
longingly
of
hamburger
he
be
sure
that
the
beehive
in
the
kitchen
be
humminglouder
with
every

sent
back
by
the

still
not
eat
a
bite
the
moritas
could
not
have
be
more
polite
which
add
to
his
humiliation
he
be
desperate
to
escape
back
to
kay

where
popcorn

more
of
the

than

just
heard
mozer
have
not
just
overbid
to
get
around
the

limit
at

stash
the

in
fact
he
have
place
more
than
one
false

in
that
auction
as
to
why
these
have
not
be
report
earlier
they
explain
the
delay
as
an
oversight
yet
the
sec
and
the
treasury
be
in
the
midst
of
investigatingmozer
for
he
have
pull
a
huge

his
action
be
under
intense
scrutiny
by
regulator
that
should
have
be
true
at
salomon
as
well
how
could
the
delay
have
be
an
oversight
now
the
regulator
have
to
consider
whether
this
confession
indicate
some
major
systemic
problem
at
salomon
no
matter
what
these
admission
be
goingto
be
highly
embarrassingto
the
treasury
and
the
federal

corrigan
be
shock
that
the

not
come
to
himsayingthat
it
have
already
fire
mozer
and
create
a
remedialprogram
that
involve
institutingallsorts
of

but
he
expect
somethinglike
that
to
be
announce
within
twenty
four
or
forty
eight
hour
after
which
he
could
keep
themon
probation
for
a
while
and
hope
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
he
told
gutfreund
and
strauss
patiently
and
dispassionately
as
he
recall
that
they
have
an
immediate
obligation
to
release
this
information
to
the
public
base
on
what
he
knew
he
surmise
that
the
incident
could
blow
up
into
a
very
very
very
significant
problem
it
seem
to
him
however
that
strauss
and
gutfreund
do
not
fully
grasp
this
indeed
with
hindsight
the
fact
that
gutfreund
have
go
off
to
london

munger
picked
up
instantly
on
bullshit

by

he
have
go
to
his
bos
john

make
a
confession
of
sort
in
february
to
get
around
the

he

to

that
this
be
the
only

and
he
would
never
do
it
again
meriwether
have
recognize
immediately
that
this
be
career
threaten
have
say
so
to
mozer
and
have
report
the
situation
to
feuerstein
and
strauss
on

the
three
of
themwent
to

told
him
what
mozer
have
confess
gutfreund
they
say
later
have
be
red
face
and
piss
off
when
he
heard
the

therefore
in

knew
feuerstein
the
generalcounsel
knew
they
all
knew
feuerstein
have
inform
gutfreund
at
the
time
that
mozer
s
action
appear
criminal
he
didn
t
believe
that
the

technically
have
a

still
feuerstein
be
sure
that
salomon
would
run
seriously
afoul
of
the
regulator
if
it
didn
t
do
something
and
therefore
the
federalreserve
must
be
told
gutfreund
say
it
would
be
take

curiously
however
no

the

ornate
italianate

give
jerry
corrigan
the

moreover
have
conclude
that
the
phony

be
a
one
time
aberrant
act
they
have
decide
to
leave

feuerstein
say
that
yes
it
should

but
the
decision
have
be
make
not

nobody

that
he
have

the
right
thingby
reportingmozer
s

the
debate
be
whether
he
should
have
do
more
some
people
felt
as
mcintosh
articulate
that
he
be
simply
too
close
to
the
flame
meriwether
have
a
reputation
as
a
tight
manager
in
his
area
as
one
say
no
sparrow
fell
that
meriwether
didn
t
see
it
meriwether
have
not
be
involve
in
the
false
bid
but
how
could
salomon
expect
clemency
while
keep
him
on
it
seem
obvious
to
themthat
the
government
would
treat
the
firmmore
harshly
if
he
stayed
although
strauss
and
gutfreund
be
not
present
they
too
have
told
buffett
that
they
thought
meriwether
should
resign
alongwith
them
with
uncanny
timing
meriwether
himself
arrive
and
lean
silently
against
a
wall
watchingas
most
of
his
peer
demand
his
head
buffett
have
told
marty
lipton
earlier
that
day
that
unlike
strauss
and
gutfreund
meriwether
must
not
be
force
to
resign
unless
he
chose
to
do
so
voluntarily
buffett
want
time
to
deliberate
he
do
not
agree
with
those
who
thought
meriwether
have
to
go
meriwether
have
not
suck
his
thumb
he
have
report
mozer
to
gutfreund
and
strauss
it
be
not
so
much
that
they
thought
meriwether
have
do
anythingwrong
buffett
decide
rather
they
be
panicked
their
life
be
simply
goingto
be
so
much
easy
the
next
morningif
meriwether
be

the
consequence
of
puttinghis
name
in
the
press
release
now
loom
large
to
buffett
after
the
meeting
he
climbed
into
a
waitingblack
town
car
with
gutfreund
and
strauss
and
they
wove
their
way
through
downtown
rush
hour
traffic
to
corrigan
s
office
corrigan
have
felt
it
necessary
to
maintain
his
previous
schedule
in
the
interest
of
secrecy
he
arrive
directly
from

but
the
chillin
the
air
be
such
that
he
could
have
be
wearingblack
tie
and
i
wouldn
t
have
notice
give
my
state
of
mind
tomstrauss
later
say
buffett
open
disarmingly
look
the
only
thingi
owe
personally
be
on
a
second
home
i
have
in
california
because
the
interest
rate
be
cheap
he
promise
complete
cooperation
with
the
regulator
corrigan
refuse
to
be
charm
interimchairmanships
usually
didn
t
work
very
well
he
say
buffett
have
well
not
seek
help
for
salomon
from
his
washington
friend
corrigan
demand
a
thorough
houseclean
buffett
agree
to
all
sort
of
fundamental
change
to
strengthen
salomon
s
policy
control
and
documentation
his
verbalcommitment
to
me
be
absolute
say
corrigan
and
i
trust
him
nevertheless
corrigan
make
no
promise
givingbuffett
a
steely
look
he
say
prepare
for
all
eventuality
it
be
a
dutch
uncle
type
of
talk
it
be
cordial
enough
but
the
dutch
uncle
aspect
be
there
we
owe
more
money
than
virtually
anybody
in
the
country
and
we
owe
it
on
very
short
term
i
try
once
or
twice
to
suggest
how
worried
i
be
about
the
funding
problem
hop
he
might
figuratively
put
his
arm
around
me
a
little
bit
but
he
didn
t
do
it
prepare
for
all
eventuality
that
be
something
i
didn
t
know
quite
how
to
do
i
certainly
thought
of
strychnine
or
something
of
the
sort
then
corrigan
sent
buffett
out
of
the
roomso
he
could
talk
to
gutfreund
and
strauss
you
have
a
problem
with
an
employee
in
your
firm
he
say
that
s
his
problem
you
ve
get
a
problemwith
an
employee
in
your
firm
and
you
fail
to
do
somethingabout
it
that
s
your
problem
then
with
tear
in
his
eye
he
told
them
how
much
he
regret
endingtheir
career
on
the
way
out
while
tomwas
in
much
more
of
a
state
of
shock
gutfreund
again
seem
quite
compose
he
seem
to
be
blamingcorrigan
for
forcinghimto
resign
i
ll
be
damn
if
i
mgoingto
grant
himabsolution
gutfreund
say
they
rode
back
across
downtown
to
salomon
then
go
off
to
have
a
steak
in
a
back
roomat
joe
rise
s
steak
house
on
th
street
strauss
and
gutfreund
insist
again
that
meriwether
have
to
go
they
talk
about
the
candidate
for
chief
operatingofficer
close
to
midnight
buffett
stumble
back
to
katharine
graham
s
apartment
at
the
un
plaza
and
try
to
sleep
later
many
people
write
many
thing
about
why
buffett
take
the
job
some
say
it
be
his
million
and
some
say
it
be
his
duty
to
the
other
shareholder
somebody
have
to
take
the
job
he
say
i
be
the
logical
person
other
than
the
people
who
be
resign
no
one
have
more
at
stake
but
it
be
not
just
the
money
it
be
what
he
care
about
just
as
much
his
reputation
when
he
invest
in
salomon
and
give
john
gutfreund
his
imprimatur
it
be
like
nailingthat
reputation
to
salomon
s
door
like
a
shield
buffett
have
told
his
child
it
take
a
lifetime
to
build
a
reputation
and
five
minute
to
ruin
it
he
thought
of
that
risk
primarily
in
term
of
his
own
action
yet
the
people
he
have
endorse
have
put
his
reputation
at
risk
if
he
have
make
a
mistake
it
be
to
invest
in
wall
street
yet
distance
himself
fromit
by
relyingon
someone
else
his
judgment
about
gutfreund
s
ability
to
oversee
the
runaway
culture
of
salomon
be
flaw
by
this
time
buffett

man
in

of
the
most
respect
businessmen
in
the
world
at
some
point
duringthat
long
horrible
friday
he
recognize
with
a
sickeningjolt
that
investingin
salomon
a
business
with
problem
over
which
he
have
essentially
no
control
have
fromthe
beginningput
all
that
at
risk
he
do
not
want
to
become
interimchairman
of
salomon
that
way
lay
great
peril
if
salomon
go
down
afterward
he
would
be
even
more
closely
associate
with
shame
and
disaster
but
if
there
be
anybody
who
could
get
himself
and
the
other
shareholder
out
of
this
mess
he
be
that
person
to
do
so
he
would
have
to
extend
the
umbrella
of
his
reputation
already
at
risk
even
far
to
protect
the
firm
there
be
no
way
to
avoid
this
challenge
deryck
maughan
and
john
meriwether
could
not
do
it
he
could
not
send
somebody
frommunger
tolles
or
charlie
munger
or
tom
murphy
or
bill
ruane
he
could
not
solve
it
by
passingan
idea
alongto
carol
loomis
for
an
incisive
article
in
fortune
even
bigsusie
could
not
solve
this
for
once
nobody
could
be
his
proxy
only
he
could
save
salomon
and
if
he
walk
away
the
odds
be
high
that
salomon
would
implode
there
be
an
old
sayingin
the
military
to

go
into
a
foxhole
with
this

he
have
to
be
the
right
choice
the

the
quality
that
would
provide

to
the

about
whether

that
be
go
to
subsequently
embarrass
the

or
even
put
us
out
of
business
as
i
talk
to
these
people
what
be
really
go
through
my
mind
be
essentially
the
same
question
that
would
go
through
your
mind
if
you
be
decide
who
you
want
to
be
a
trustee
under
your
will
or
who
you
want
to
have
marry
your
daughter
or
anything
of
this
sort
i
want
the
kind
of
person
who
be
go
to
be
able
to
make
decision
as
to
what
should
get
to
me
and
what
could
get
solve
below
the
line
who
would
tell
me
all
the
bad
news
because
good
news
always
take
care
of
itself
in
business
i
want
to
hear
every
bit
of
bad
news
as
soon
as
it
happen
so
we
could
do
something
about
it
i
want
someone
who
be
ethical
who
wouldn
t
stick
a
gun
to
my
head
later
on
know
that
i
couldn
t
fire
him
buffett
found
that
all
but
one
of
the
other
candidate
thought
it
should
be
deryck
maughan
who
have
return
three
week
earlier
fromrunningsalomon
s
asian
operation
maughan
forty
three
year
old
now
head
the
investment
bankinggroup
he
be
not
a
trader
and
he
be
english
not
american
he
have
the
least
resemblance
to
mozer
or
any
of
salomon
s
frat
house
tradingboys
of
anyone
that
could
be
found
he
be
view
as
both
ethical
and
possess
of
common
sense
thanks
to
liar
s
poker
the
public
thought
of
salomon
as
a
place
full
of
people
who
stuffed
their
face
with
onion
cheeseburger
for
breakfast
and
dangle
stripper
panty
fromtheir
tradingscreens
salomon
after
all
be
the
firmwhere
as
lewis
have
write
a
vice
chairman
be
more
like
a
chairman
of
vice
maughan
however
be
the
very
portrait
of
a
dignify
impeccably
tailor
englishman
since
he
have
spent
the
past
several
year
in
tokyo
the
chance
that
he
be
taint
by
the
treasury
auction
scandal
be
remote
of
allmaughan
s
qualification
possibly
the
most
valuable
be
his
distance
from
the
crime
within
salomon
land
of
the
longknives
allof
the
other
candidate
have
enemy
maughan
be
a
question
mark
like
the
token
black
guy
in
the
movie
putney
swope
who
get
elect
to
the
job

but
no
one
knew
himallthat
well
as
one
of
the
other
warlord
put
it
they
allvoted
for
maughan
because
it
s
well
to
choose
someone
you
don
t
know
than
someone
you
think
be
bad
in
the
movie
putney
swope
have
have
the
sense
to
vote
for
himself
when
buffett
ask
maughan
who
should
run
salomon
maughan
reply
adroitly
i
mafraid
you
re
goingto
find
out
that
it
s
me
then
add
that
he
would
serve
whomever
buffett
chose
two
other
thing
get
buffett
s
attention
maughan
do
not
ask
him
for
protection
against
beingsued
and
buffett
who
as
much
as
he
hat
admittingit
do
not
enjoy
payingpeople
be
mightily
impressed
that
maughan
do
not
ask
how
much
the
job
would
pay
maughan
and
two
others
be
told
to
come
to
the
office
for
the
board
meetingthe
next
day
that
afternoon
buffett
taxi
back
uptown
to
graham
s
un
plaza
apartment
where
the
arb
boy
met
himto
plead
with
passion
and
logic
for
meriwether
s
job
if
j
m
left
buffett
knew
there
have
to
be
a
risk
that
the
arb
boy
would
eventually
join
him
without
meriwether
the
main
source
of
salomon
s
profit
would
drain
away
buffett
s
investment
in
salomon
could
become
worth
far
less
then
meriwether
himself
arrive
shaken
he
do
not
want
to
resign
and
he
talk
to
buffett
at
length
buffett
begin
to
waver
he
focus
on
meriwether
s
straightforwardness
in
reportingthe
problem
after
listen
to
all
of
this
my
reaction
be
not
to
ask
for
his
resignation
as
best
i
knew
at
the
time
and
this
be
still
my
belief
when
he
have
heard
of
his
subordinate
s
misdeed
he
have
go
straight
upstairs
to
his
superior
and
the
general
counsel
and
have
report
it
it
seem
to
me
that
it
be
the
job
of
his
superior
and
the
general
counsel
of
the
firm
to
then
take
action
no
one
at
this
point
be
suggest
that
the
general
counsel
should
resign
then
gutfreund
call
his
flight
to
nantucket
have
be
thwart
by
hurricane
bob
and
he
be
head
back
to
new
york
i
have
no
future
he
say
agitate
they
make
plan
to
go
to
dinner
gutfreund
insist
that
first
they
talk
to
his
newly
hire
lawyer
philip
howard
about
severance
pay
buffett
and
munger
call
howard
with
munger
doingmost
of
the
talk
gutfreund
felt
the
firm
owe
him
million
as
he
be
lay
all
this
out
i
be
listen
like
the
japanese
say
yes
i
understand
your
position
not
yes
i
agree
with
you
we
have
no
interest
whatsoever
in
try
to
arrange
a
compensation
agreement
with
anyone
who
be
in
the
middle
of
a
scandal
of
this
proportion
without
know
the
full
fact
buffett
then
say
that
they
could
not
agree
upon
an
overall
number
because
no
matter
what
the
figure
be
salomon
give
xx
severance
package
to
gutfreund
would
be
the
headline
rather
than
the
break
with
former
management
they
laid
on
praise
of
gutfreund
s
character
however
they
told
howard
that
gutfreund
would
be
treat
fairly
that
they
have
the
power
to
make
it
happen
and
have
never
broken
a
promise
before
buffett
say
the
only
way
this
won
t
happen
be
if
both
charlie
and
i
die
he
later
explain
that
this
be
a
way
of
avoidingconfrontation
that
be
deflectingmr
howard
and
gettinghim
off
this
kick
because
it
would
be
a
little
abrupt
to
say
they
didn
t
want
to
reach
a
settlement
because
we
don
t
know
the
full
fact
yet
buffett
and
munger
then
go
out
for
a
steak
with
gutfreund
at
christ
cella
gutfreund
offer
to
stay
on
as
a
consultant
at
no
charge
in
the
day
ahead
i
m
goingto
need
all
the
help
i
can
get
buffett
say
fervently
they
talk
about
the
problem
of
the
firm
and
gutfreund
say
he
thought
deryck
maughan
be
the
right
guy
to
run
salomon
at
one
point
however
gutfreund
who
still
knew
a
number
of
fact
of
which
buffett
be
not
yet
aware
say
somethingthat
contradict
the
warmand
cozy
scene
of
a
few
minute
before
you
guy
be
smarter
than
i
be
he
told
them
you
guy
be
goingto
fuck
me
it
be
with
relief
that

munger
start
gettingirritable
they
discuss
the
matter
for
perhaps
an
hour
or
more
munger
have
already
make
up
his
mind
that
he
be
goingto
say
no
to
this
deal
as
he
recall
later
i
be
deliberately
not

i
be
beingpolite
but
i
wasn
t
payingmuch
attention
i
sort
of
turn
off
my
mind
i
be
just
sittingthere
politely
with
my
head
turn
off
when
howard
reach
the
end
of
his
lengthy
list
of
demand
munger
refuse
to
sign
the
paper
but
stress
that
gutfreund
would
eventually
be
treat
fairly
on
the
way
out
the
door
howard
hesitate
it
bother
him
that
he
still
have
nothingin
write
you
can
t
get
paid
after
the
divorce
he
say
munger
reassure
him
phil
you
have
to
practice
law
the
way
my
father
do
by
trustingin
a
man

while
howard
and
munger
be

meriwether
and

and
forth
and
he
be

he
say
that
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do

later
express
feeling
of
guilt
over
agreeingto
put
meriwether
s
name
in
the
press

which
he
view
as
a

they

they

that
they

simply
by
standingover

he
could

they

could
survive
a
meltdown
of

of
its

the

refer
to
in
the
press
release
as
the

practicaljoke
it
be
not
a
joke
i
suppose
if
you
have
to
characterize
it
in
some
way
begin
buffett
those
be
your
word
in
the

retort
the

sharply
those
be
not
my
word
it
be
in
the

my
name
be
not
on
the
bottomof
the
release
you
can
characterize
it
as
a
bizarre
incident
my
definition
of
a
practicaljoke
be
one
you
can
laugh
at
after
hearingit
i
don
t
see
it
as
the
least
bit
funny
the
reporter
most
of
whomhad
read
liar
s
poker
wait
for
an
explanation
salomon
they
knew
be
famous
for
its
goof
trader
be
constantly
stealingthe
clothes
out
of
each
other
s
suitcase
and
replacingthemwith
wet
paper
towel
or
lacy
pink
panty
the
most
famous
goof
at
salomon
concerned
the
game
of
liar
s
poker
itself
which
gutfreund
once
allegedly
offer
to
play
meriwether
for
a
million
dollar
on
a
single
bet
no
tear
meriwether
supposedly
counter
with
ten
million
causinggutfreund
to
stand
down
while
even
this
story
be
thought
to
be
a
sort
of
goof
containingapocryphal
element
until
now
ten
million
dollar
be
the
outside
limit
that
anyone
have
ever
imagine
for
a
salomon
goof
but
for
a
billion
dollar
you
could
fillnew
york
harbor
with
rubber
chicken
as
high
as
the
statue
of
liberty
s
thigh
what
then
could
have
be
the
billion
dollar
practical
joke
apparently
a
woman
be
leavingthe
department
after
many
many
year
retire
i
guess
buffett
say
an
order
be
work
out
with
somebody
to
give
her
a
very
large
order
a
billion
dollar
a
billion
dollar
order
on
a
new
offeringof
thirty
year
treasury
bond
then
and
this
get
vague
i
guess
the
plan
be
to
maybe
convince
her
somehow
that
the
order
be
not
submit
and
have
the
client
question
the
fact
that
it
be
not
submit
it
be
to
try
to
scare
the
hell
out
of
her
or
something
i
don
t
know
the
bid
actually
do
get
submit
a
hundred
fifty
reporter
sat
in
silence
salomon
have
bought
a
billion
dollar
worth
of
bond
in
a
practical
joke
go
wrong
buffett
be
not
kiddingthat
the
culture
of
salomon
be
goingto
have
to
change
it
should
have
be
cross
out
my
guess
be
that
whoever
do
it
do
intend
to
cross
it
out
it
have
to
be
the
dumbest
joke
ever
attempt
to
be
perpetrate
no
one
say
a
word
maughan
any
more
question
the
hot
air
have
be
let
out

after
this
bit
of
truth
tell
what
could
anyone
ask

a
few
more
mild
question
follow

you

as
fast
as

to
his
new
secretary
who
have
work
for
gutfreund
and
knew
everybody
well
paula
he
suggest
why
don
t
you
start
talkingto
the
board
member
and
ask
themquestions
about
what
they
knew
and
when
bob
denham
the
cautious
thorough
munger
tolles
lawyer
who
have
be
airlift
in
from
los
angeles
to
head
the
investigation
get
wind
of
this
plan
and
put
a
stop
to
it
the
investigatingwould
be
do
by
lawyer
the
first
thingdenham
do
be
interview
don
feuerstein
afterward
feuerstein
be
fire
summarily
he
ask
to
talk
to
buffett
who
told
himonly
you
could
have
do
more
since
buffett
have
know
that
from
the
begin
feuerstein
couldn
t
understand
the
about
face
buffett
however
have
gradually
settle
on
the
conclusion
that
in
his
loyalty
to
gutfreund
feuerstein
have
put
his
bos
s
interest
ahead
of
salomon
s
now
denham
get
the
job
of
general
counsel
as
buffett
begin
to
assume
control
he
discover
how
much
the
board
have
be
subject
to
what
he
call
adroit
information
ration
by
salomon
s
management
he
and
munger
now
learn
that
when
mozer
have
first
admit
in
april
to
submittingan
unauthorized
bid
the
firm
have
also
discover
that
he
have
try
to
cover
it
up
and
have
mislead
the
customer
whose
name
he
have
use
by
claimingtheir
falsely
submit
order
for
treasury
bond
be
a
clerical
error
it
be
as
if
mozer
have
lit
a
match
and
mr
gutfreund
could
on
april
twenty
ninth
have
blown
out
that
match
that
mozer
lit
and
instead
he
do
nothing
about
it
and
it
turn
out
that
mozer
have
certain
characteristic
of
a
pyromaniac
and
tend
to
light
match
more
often
than
we
thought
mr
gutfreund
s
responsibility
be
to
do
something
about
that
when
he
saw
it
he
at
first
do
nothing
and
then
later
start
perhaps
in
panic
pour
gasoline
on
it
the
end
result
be
that
the
shareholder
of
salomon
would
be
cost
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
and
eight
thousand
employee
and
their
family
would
fear
for
their
job
i
think
it
be
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
do
here
you
have
a
fellow
paul
mozer
who
admits
submit
false
bid
to
the
most
important
client
and
regulator
in
the
world
the
u
s
government
and
then
you
know
he
s
try
to
cover
it
up
by
drag
in
a
customer
and
try
to
get
that
customer
to
cooperate
with
a
cover
up
so
that
the
government
won
t
find
out
none
of
that
be
mr
gutfreund
s
fault
at
all
but
when
you
hear
about
an
action
like
that
it
be
very
obvious
in
ten
second
that
you
pick
up
the
phone
and
say
mozer
you
re
fire
then
you
go
right
over
to
jerry
corrigan
and
say
jerry
you
know
this
be
the
problem
of
run
a
place
with
eight
thousand
employee
this
guy
go
off
the
reservation
and
i
fire

him
as
soon
as
i
heard
about
it
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
next
of
course
it
wouldn
t
be
obvious
in
ten
second
to
many
people
they
would
be
thinkingabout
allsorts
of
other
thing
mozer
be
so
valuable
to
the
firm
he
have
turn
around
the
foreign
exchange
department
firinghimwould
be
unpleasant
might
it
be
possible
to
rehabilitate
him
it
be
goingto
be
painful
to
confess
to
the
regulator
their
reaction
might
be
scorch
and
no
less
than
a
major
law
firmhad
say
that
reporting
it
wasn
t
technically
require
buffett
skip
all
that
he
thought
in
probability
he
extrapolate
right
away
to
whether
a
catastrophic
outcome
be
possible
then
work
out
very
fast
what
it
would
take
to
get
to
the
low
probability
of
catastrophe
here
it
be
firingmozer
and
confessingright
away
buffett
also
thought
in
black
and
white
term
about
honesty
he
have
no
tolerance
for
liar
and
cheater
so
that
be
that
now
he
found
that
the
situation
unfortunately
involve
more
lyingand
cheatingthan
he
have
previously
be
told
the
investigator
report
to
him
that
feuerstein
have
say
at
the
time
that
mozer
s
action
be
criminalin
nature
a
startlingcontrast
to
the
firm
s
agreeable
response
to
later
legal
advice
that
no
disclosure
be
require
and
nobody
have
ever
told
the
firm
s
compliance
department
which
be
charge
with
overseeingregulatory
conduct
of
mozer
s
behavior
true
salomon
have
an
attitude
toward
compliance
that
be
best
described
as
loose
there
would
later
even
be
an
argument
over
who
should
be
consider
a
member
of
the
compliance
committee
nevertheless
the
head
of
compliance
have
be
disturbed
when
he
found
out
that
he
be
out
of
the
loop
and
be
angry
that
such
procedure
as
do
exist
have
be
ignore
buffett
and
munger
also
learn
about
the
time
in
early
june
when
gutfreund
have
met
with
treasury
undersecretary
bob
glauber
to
defend
the
firmagainst
accusation
that
it
have
engineer
the
may
squeeze
they
found
out
that
salomon
s
management
have
consider
whether
to
disclose
the
february
false
bid
to
glauber
immediately
after
that
meeting
and
have
decide
that
the
time
be
not
right
glauber
later
say
he
felt
that
he
be
played
for
a
sucker
because
gutfreund
have
not
told
him
nothinghad
inflame
relation
with
the
government
and
compromise
salomon
s
credibility
more
than
this
meetingwith
glauber
it
smack
of
an
outright
cover
up
the
second
press
release
that
the
board
have
approve
sayingthat
the
delay
occur
thanks
to
a
lack
of
sufficient
attention
to
the
matter
have
make
the
board
look
like
part
of
the
cover
up
give
that
gutfreund
met
with
glauber
and
clearly
have
the
opportunity
to
tell
him
but
of
course
the
board
itself
have
be
ignorant
of
the
glauber
meeting
buffett
be
angry
that
he
have
know
nothingof
these
matter
duringthe

in

that
he
want
to
pursue
a
novel
strategy
already
staggeringunder
the
near
mortal
blow
to
its
reputation
salomon
could
not
in
his
view
survive
a
criminalindictment
it
be
like
a
late
stage
cancer
patient
to
save
it
buffett
felt
radical
technique
must
be
apply
even
if
it
left
the
patient
in
a
weaken
state
the
therapy
he
thought
be
salomon
s
best
hope
of
avoidinga
criminal
indictment
be
to
show
extreme
contrition
he
would
surgically
digout
every
last
cellof
the
cancer
and
with
scorch
radiation
cleanse
the

burn

on

otto
obermaier
the

attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
who
would
make
the
decision
whether
to
criminally
indict
salomon
the
argument
we
make
to
otto
obermaier
be
that
we
would
set
an
example
this
be
go
to
be
an
example
of
the
most
extraordinary
cooperation
that
a
target
have
ever
give
and
the
outcome
would
have
an
effect
on
the
behavior
of
future
defendant
and
how
the
justice
system
work
olson
have
to
make
an
extraordinary
pledge
on
the
spot
he
waive
salomon
s
attorney
client
privilege
which
shield
communication
between
the
firmand
its
lawyer
from
prosecutor
he
say
that
whatever
mto
found
in
its
investigation
obermaier
would
know
it
as
soon
as
mto
knew
it
in
plain
english
this
meant
that
mto
on
behalf
of
salomon
have
volunteer
to
act
as
an
armof
the
government
obermaier
be
incredulous
olson
say
he
thought
we
be
some
midwest
aw

in

so
freely
some
thought
salomon
have
give
up
its
negotiate
leverage
but
what
the
large

really
reflect
be
that
the

bungle
its
reportingresponsibilities
so
badly

three

that
on

deliberately
not

turn

i
be
just
sit
there
politely
with
my
head
turn
off
gutfreund

lawyer
ask
himwhether
he
have
make

not

not

when
the

come
to

i
talk
one
of
my
fault
i
amfairly
outspoken
i
may
well
have
discuss
some
individual
thing
that
get
through
my

this
be
one
of
my
most
irritatingconversational
habit
it
follow
me
through
the
course
of
my
life
so
every
time
somethingwould
get
through
and
i
would
see
a
counterargument
he
say
he
would
give
it
howard
have
ask
for
an
indemnification
for
gutfreund
against
lawsuit
beinga

matter
this
have
gotten
through
munger
s
band

i
think
i
say
to
him
you
don
t
even
know
what
you

if
you

it
make
sense
to
get
into
any
of
those
issue
at
this

be
that
also
a

in
which
you

no
i
tend
to
tune
in
when
i
amspeakingmyself
say
munger
under
oath
i
tend
to
remember
what
i
say
be
this
also
a
conversation
in
which
you
be
deliberately
not
listeningat
various
time
what
do
you
say
say
munger
i
just
tune
out
again
and
i
wasn

doingit
on

be
this
also
a
conversation
in
which
at
various
time
you
be
deliberately
not
listen
i
be
ashamed
to
say
i
have
do
it
again
will
you
please
do
it
one
more
time
this
time
i
willuse
an
effort
gutfreund
s
lawyer
repeat
the
question
for
the
third
time
you
bet
say
munger
i
be
goingthrough
the
motion
in
what
mental
state
the
arbitrator
the
lawyer
and
gutfreund
heard
these
word
can
only
be
imagine
regrettably
much
of
the
misunderstandingseems
to
have
lain
in
philip
howard
s
unfamiliarity
with
the
outward
sign
of
the
working
of
charlie
munger
s
mind
he
have
labor
that
night
under
the
illusion
that
he
and
munger
be
havinga
conversation
he
do
not
recognize
munger
s
occasional
reply
as
intermittent
thought
burst
ignite
by
some
randommite
that
have
pierce
munger
s
band
of
indifference
whenever
munger
object
howard
assume
they
be
negotiate
not
that
he
be
simply
beinglectured
when
munger
say
nothingor
emit
a
grunt
to
move
the
conversation
along
howard
infer
that
munger
agree
or
at
least
that
he
have
no
objection
to
whatever
have
just
be
say
nobody
have
explain
to
him
that
munger
s
head
be
turn
off
gutfreund
s
lawyer
remind
munger
of
buffett
s
testimony
in
which
he
have
acknowledge
sayingto
gutfreund
that
he
have
the
power
to
make
allthis
happen
do
mr
munger
recall
mr
buffett
sayingthat
i
don
t
remember
mr
buffett
s
word
as
well
as
i
remember
my
own
say
munger
but
certainly
the
gist
of
the
thingwas
that
you
can
count
on
us
to
be
fair
the
issue
be
what
be
meant
by
fair
salomon
never
dispute
that
the
money
be
gutfreund
s
and
that
he
have
already
earn
it
the
argument
boil
down
to
whether
gutfreund
would
have
be
terminate
have
all
the
fact
be
know
thus
the
case
become
an
exercise
in
provingthat
gutfreund
should
have
be
terminate
even
donald
feuerstein
agree
that
in
concealingwhat
he
knew
fromglauber
gutfreund
have
be
dishonest
with
the
government
although
everyone
thought
this
bizarre
and
out
of
character
behavior
nonetheless
it
have
happen
in
fairness
to
salomon
gutfreund
understood
why
the
firm
be
expendingso
much
effort
to
prove
he
should
have
be
fire
he
knew
it
be
in
everybody

interest

vilify
him

the
lack

him
at
some
point

what
factor
do
people
feel
be
the
most
important
in
get
to
where
they
d
gotten
in
life
and
i
say
focus
and
bill
say
the
same
thing
it
be
unclear
how
many
people
at
the
table
understood
focus
as
buffett
live
that
word
this
kind
of
innate
focus
couldn
t
be
emulate
it
meant
the
intensity
that
be
the
price
of
excellence
it
meant
the
discipline
and
passionate
perfectionismthat
make
thomas
edison
the
quintessential
american
inventor
walt
disney
the
kingof
family
entertainment
and
james
brown
the
godfather
of
soul
it
meant
the
depth
of
commitment
and
mental
independence
that
lead
jeannette
rankin
to
stand
alone
as
the
only
representative
in
congress
to
vote
against
u
s
entry
into
both
world
war
in
the
face
of
widespread
ridicule
it
meant
single
mind
obsession
with
an
ideal
focus
meant
the
kind
of
person
who
could
earn
billion
by
allocatingcapital
yet
be
baffle
by
a
sign
that
say
no
tp
sometime
duringthe
weekend
a
guest
who
be
less
focus
have
figure
out
that
no
tp
stood
for
touchy
plumbingthat
couldn
t
handle
toilet
paper
at
last
the
mystery
of
the
indoor
facility
have
be
reveal
and
buffett
be
liberate
fromthe
gas
station
however
some
traitorous
member
of
the
party
graham
greenfield
or
one
of
the
evans
have
found
the
story
so
hilarious
that
even
buffett
s
introduction
to
the
gate
family
have
include
a
recountingof
the
story
of
no
tp
a
day
later
buffett
escape
the
island
and
return
to
the
normalplumbingof
omaha
he
could
see
that
gate
be
brilliant
and
that
he
understood
business
very
well
but
since
the
day
when
he
told
katie
buffett
not
to
invest
in
control
data
and
pass
on
the
chance
to
invest
in
the
start
up
of
intel
buffett
have
never
trust
technology
company
as
investment
technology
company
come
and
go
their
product
often
make
obsolete
now
his
interest
pique
he
bought
a
hundred
share
of
microsoft
which
to
him
be
like
eatinga
single
cheerio
he
couldn
t
bringhimself
to
buy
any
intel
even
though
he
sometimes
bought
a
hundred
share
just
to
keep
track
of
a
company
grinnellcollege
have
make
a
lot
of
money
fromits
intel
stock
but
have
already
sell
it
buffett
himself
would
never
buy
stock
like
intel
that
depend
so
much
on
future
growth
and
that
he
didn
t
fully
understand
but
he
do
invite
gate
to
the
next
buffett
group
meeting
soon
thereafter
he
have
gotten
the
phone
callfromdon
feuerstein
and
tomstrauss
and
for
the
next
two
month
have
thought
of
nothingbut
the
misery
of
salomon
in
october
release
fromthe
conference
room
of
world
trade
center
and
the

everybody
turn

the

continued
if

fromremainingthe

most
of
the
propose
answer
regardless
of
the
company
revolve
around
arrogance
complacency
and
what
buffett
call
the
institutional
imperative
the
tendency
for
company
to
engage
in
activity
for
its
own
sake
and
to
copy
their
peer
instead
of
tryingto
stay
ahead
of
them
some
company
didn
t
bringin
youngpeople
with
fresh
idea
sometimes
management
weren
t
attune
to
tectonic
shift
in
their
industry
nobody
suggest
these
problem
be
easy
to
cure
after
a
while
buffett
ask
everyone
to
pick
their

stock
what
about
kodak
ask
bill

look

nobody
else
in
the
buffett

knew
that
the

even
kodak
didn

all
the

no
it

not
that
simple
say

the

be
different
than
camera
film
and
nothingis
goingto
come
in
and
fundamentally
change
that
you
ll
see
some
falloff
as
people
move
toward
variety
but
the
network
own
the
content
and
they
can
repurpose
it
the
network
face
an
interest
challenge
as
we
move
the
transport
of
tvonto
the

but
it
s
not
like
photography
where
you
get
rid
of
film
so
knowinghow
to
make
filmbecomes
absolutely
irrelevant
now
everybody
want
to
talk
to
gate
who
could
explain
the
new
digital
world

what
it
meant
to

that
i
didn

this

his

in

he
write
his

brimmingwith

compress
into
a
short
time
in
buffett
have
invite
howie
to
join
the
board
of
berkshire

sayingthat
his

would
become

after
he

still
light
he
have
never
finish
college
and
he
be
more
interested
in
agriculture
than
invest
he
now
have
the
beginning
of
a
credible
r
sum
however
since
buffett
be
the
large
shareholder
of
what
amount
to
a
family
corporation
he
be
within
his
right
to
do
this
his
reasoningwas
that
howie
would
steward
the
culture
after
he
be
go
he
knew
that
his
son
be
beginningto
mature
and
be
a
principled
individual
buffett
now
have
to
do
some
mentalbackflips
however
to
reconcile
all
the
statement
he
have
make
over
the
year
denunciation
of
the
evil
of
the
divine
right
of
the
womb
dynastic
wealth
and
advantage
base
on
parentage
rather
than
merit
with
his
decision
to
make
his
relatively
untested
son
the
chairman
of
berkshire
hathaway
after
he
be
go
and
it
be
not
clear
how
howie
s
role
would
complement
that
of
the
next
ceo
of
berkshire
that
may
have
be
the
point
every
sign
now
indicate
that
buffett
would
see
to
it
that
power
would
not
be
concentrate
in
any
one
individualafter
his
death
this
might
inhibit
berkshire
s
potential
or
it
might
not
but
it
would
fend
off
the
grisly
menace
of
the
institutionalimperative
which
he
view
as
the
great
danger
that
berkshire
face
buffett
want
a
degree
of
control
frombeyond
the
grave
and
this
be
his
first
step
in
gettingit
in
a
second
step
he
have
put
susie
jr
then
peter
on
the
board
of
the
buffett
foundation
with
the
understandingthat
susie

would
run
the

after
her

the

his
skill
have
improve
so
much
under
osberg
s
tutelage
that
he
want
to
play

why
not

for
an
unranked
amateur
to
show
up
at
the
world
championship
as
his
first
tournament
be
an
unusual
thing
for

buffett
to
do
it
be
shock
osbergexpected
that
they
would
lose
in
short
order
so
the
point
be
to
have
fun
and
get
some
experience
instead
buffett
sat
down
at
the
table
and
seem
to
shut
out
everything
it
be
as
if
there
be
nobody
else
in
the
room
his
bridge
skill
be
not
close
to
the
levelof
most
other

he
be
able
to
focus
as
calmly
as
if
he
be
playingin
his
livingroom
my
defense
be
well
with

almost
like
i
can
feel
what
she
s
do
and
you
can
trust
that
everything
she
s
do
have
meaning
somehow
his
intensity
overcame
the
weakness
of
his
game
osbergwas
amaze
when
they
qualify
for
the
final
we
be
just
good
enough
she

but
after
a
day
and
a
half
of
playingto
get
to
this
point
buffett
be
exhaust
and
wrungout

have
be
an
hour
here
and
there
to
slip
out
for

he
look

he
have
run
a
marathon
in
the
break
before
the

he
told
osberg
i

the
job
of

nobody
who

have
ever
decide
not
to

the
representative
of
the

outrage
that

endorse
it
by
his
famous
and
important

that
they

main
philanthropic
issue
overpopulation

nuclear
proliferation
problem
that
be
almost
unimaginably
hard
to

nuclear
proliferation
didn
t
lend
itself
well
to

although
buffett
would
have
give
as
much
money
as
he
could
to
his
high
priority
any
plausible
way

there

a
percent

but
if
you
can
get
that
probability
down
to
three
percent
that
reduces
the
probability
to
only
seventy
eight
percent
in

and
if
you

there

make
all
the

the

there

a

it

far
far
far
far

great
than
thomas

ever
dream
on
the
other
hand
there
be
some
carry
capacity
and
the
one
thing
about
carry
capacity
be
that
you
want
to
err
on
the
low
side
if
you

provision

rocket

for

this

until

by

accordingly
by

buffett
have
always
felt
that
any
mean
of
solvingthe
population
problemthat
involve
coercion
be
out
of
the
question
now
he
go
a
step
far
i
wouldn
t
in
any
way
limit
a
woman
s
right
to
bear
child
even
if
the
world
be
extremely
overpopulate
and
i
wouldn
t
ban
the
right
to
choose
even
if
there
be
only
two
people
on
the
planet
and
fertility
be
critical
i
think
the
world
should
be
limited
to
want
people
first
i
don
t
think
that
the
number
should
determine
how
many
people
be
want
even
if
everybody
have
seven
child
i
wouldn
t
do
as
garrett
hardin
say
and
link
the
right
to
the
number
so
the
buffett
foundation
support

increasingly
the

perhaps
without

of
it
buffett

who
do
not

have
thought
ever
since
he

that
geico
should
be
privately
own
he
would
much
rather
work

than
a
bunch
of
analyst

money
manager
butler
lead
the
negotiation
he
want
stock
and
a
price
in
the

buffett
regard
that
as
outrageous
he
want
to
pay
cash
and
a

in
the
high
s
for
a
year
they
bargain
buffett
pull
out
the
circular
saw
this
be
his
technique
to
cut
the
floor
out
from
under
geico
by
tryingto
make
butler
feel
the
company
be
weak
and
vulnerable
the
market
be
gettingout
of
hand
buffett
say
this
high
tech
internet
stuff
be
goingcrazy
and
it
s
goingto
hurt
the
whole
industry
includinggeico
you
guy
have
a
significant
advantage
sellingover
the
telephone
but
the
internet
be
goingto
narrow
that
quite
a
bit
it
be
apparent
that
by
before
the
average
person
even
have
an
e
mailaddress
buffett
who
supposedly
knew
nothingabout

have
already
grasped
how
the
internet
be
goingto
affect
the
auto
insurance
industry
in
the
comingdecades
well
than
the
auto
insurance
industry
itself
have
but
butler
be
a
tough
and
experienced
lawyer
and
couldn
t
be
buffetted
berkshire

have
double

that
april
with

magazine
cite
the
overprice

which
say
the
price
of
brk
make
sense
only
if
the
company
be
run
by
god
butler
refuse
to
low
his
number
he
want
as
many
berkshire
share
as
he
could
get
the
two
reach
an
impasse
finally
buffett
resort
to
the
ultimate
weapon
and
brought
in
charlie
munger
as
the
appoint
bad
guy
at
salomon
this
have
be
predictably
successful
but
sam
butler
prove
so
tough
that
he
couldn
t
even
be
mungered
after
a
year
it
become
clear
that
if
buffett
want
geico
he
be
goingto
have
to
meet
butler
s
price
buffett
want
geico
so
badly
that
he
capitulate
in
august
he
paid
billion
dollar
for
fifty
two
percent
of
geico
after
havingspent
million
for
the
first
forty
eight
percent
and
he
paid
with
berkshire
stock
not
cash
despite
havingfought
so
hard
buffett
actually
regard
the
price
as
reasonable
look
at
as

the

take

over

so
that
his
number
two
steve
ballmer
and
half
a
dozen
engineer
could
interview
them
almost
as
anthropologist
so
strange
do
it
seemto
them
that
these
two
incredibly
brilliant
men
be
such
latecomer
to
the
world
of

they
be
like
a

discover
in
the

who
have

an

but
wouldn

his
sense
of
the

s
importance
for
example
it
have
not
yet
occur
to
buffett
to
tellgeico
to
hurry
up
and
exploit
the
internet
to
sellinsurance
to
buffett
computer
be
just
tunnel
that
enable
him
to
reach
other
people
who
could
play
bridge
that
be
quite
interest
to
bill
because
he
saw
how
some
guy
who
have
no
interest
in
the
computer
per
se
could
be
drawn
in
by
an
application
the
computer
itself
be
interest
to
all
the
people
around
him
but
to
me
only
the
application
be
interest
you
sell
the
computer
first
to
people
who
be
interested
in
computer
and
then
you
sell
it
to
people
like
me
who
don
t
give
a
damn
about
computer
buffett
who
deem
computer
outside
his
circle
of

might
stillhave
be
the
richest
man
in
america
instead
of

have
he
bought

he
do
not

he
do

he
care
a
lot
he
would
rather

much

he

far
more
about

he
didn

know
which
company
would
turn
into
the
next
microsoft

which
would
crash
and
burn
he
would
never
give
up
his
margin
of
safety
he
knew
that
the

of
many

be
as
short
as
a
naked
mole

s
even

that
a

similar

will
eventually
tighten
for

the

whether

a
closer

with
so
much
new

the
easy

have
become

the

take

with
more

when
they

they
double
down
and
increase
the
size
of
their

in
both
case
they
do
so
because

doingbigger

often
usingdebt
help
offset
that
the
rule
of
the
racetrack
say
not
to
do
so
because
you
don
t
have
to
make

back
the
way
you
lose
it
the
reason
be
the
math
of
losingmoney
which
work
like
this
if
someone
have
a
dollar
and
she
loses
fifty
cent
she
have
to
double
her
money
to
make
back
what
she
s
lose
that
s
difficult
to
do
it
be
temptingto
borrow
another
fifty
cent
for
the
next
bet
that
way
you
only
have
to
make
fifty
percent
plus
the
interest
you
owe
on
the
loan
to
get
back
whole
much
easy
to
do
but
borrowingthe
money
double
your
risk
if
you
lose
fifty
percent
again
you
re
history
the
loss
have
wipe
out
all
your
capital

buffett

the

therefore
when
the

if
you
be
goingto

by

more
in

of

you
need
a

even
a

one
with
so
much
capitalthat
it
essentially
undid
the

somebody

maybe
they
would
have
be
well
off
beingowned
by
somebody
like

but
that
would
have
meant
givingup
their
ownership
you
couldn
t
have
it
both
way
if
you
want
berkshire
to
take
the
risk
and
put
up
the
money
to
it
go
the

somehow

if

that
coca
cola
have
by
now
become
a
self
sustainingenterprise
and
he
admire
goizueta
for
havinggotten
it
to
this
stage
in
gate
join
buffett
and
goizueta
on
a
panel
discussion
at
sun
valley
that
be
moderate
by
keough
i
use
to
talk
to
bill
all
the
time
and
i
d
always
use
this
expression
that
a
ham
sandwich
could
run
coca
cola
and
bill
wasn
t
quite
housebroken
then
so
we
be
sit
on
this
panel
up
in
front
of
the
audience
and
bill
say
something
to
the
effect
that
it
s
pretty
easy
to
run
coke
i
be
tryingto
make
a
point
about
how
coke
be
such
a
wonderful
business
say
gate
and
i
say
somethingabout
how
i
mgoingto
step
down
frommicrosoft
before
i
m
sixty
because
it
s
a
tough
business
and
a
youngperson
may
need
to
be
in
there
to
handle
turn
in
the
road
but
it
come
across
that
i
thought
of
microsoft
as
excitingand
i
must
have
say
somethinglike
unlike
coca
cola
goizueta
thought
i
be
an
uppity
arrogant
kid
who
be
paintingsome
kind
of
picture
that
i
be
engage
in
some
masterful
act
on
a
daily
basis
whereas
anybody
could
leave
at
noon
and
go
golfingif
they
ran
coca
cola
and
roberto
hat
bill
from
that
point
forward
buffett
avoid
technology
stock
partly
because
these
fast
movingbusinesses
could
never
be
run
by
a
ham
sandwich
he
thought
it
no
shame
to
have
a
business
that
could
be
run
by
a
hamsandwich
he
want
to
get
berkshire
hathaway
to
the
point
that
it
could
be
run
by
a
ham
sandwich
too
though
not
until
after
he
be
go
but
by
coca
cola
have
start
to
set
goal
for
itself
that
be
so
ambitious
that
it
take
not
a
ham
sandwich
not
even
goizueta
but
a
lot
of
financial
engineeringto
achieve
them
coke
own
forty
percent
of
cce
and
tend
to
act
as
though
it
own
a
hundred
percent
the
creation
of
cce
by
rollingup
a
group
of
bottler
have
be
part
of
a
large
strategy
of
buyingand
sellingbottlers
in
order
to
time
the
profit
and
boost
coca
cola
s
earnings
this
be
neither
illegalnor
technically
deceitful
but
it
be
nonetheless
an
illusion
and
warren
who
be
on
the
board
of
coke
be
always
aware
of
the
potential
for
misrepresentation
roberto
do
a
lot
of
thing
operationally
that
be
terrific
and
i
love
the
guy
but
roberto
get
tangle
up
in
promising
number
that
eventually
couldn
t
be
deliver
he
talk
about
high
teen
growth
eighteen
percent
big
company
be
not
go
to
increase
their
earnings
in
the
high
teen
over
long
period
of
time
for
a
while
you
can
do
it
but
it
just
isn
t
in
the
card
to
keep
it
up
forever
i
remember
when
he
come
in
and
talk
to
us
about
how
he
be
go
to
add
a
third
leg
to
earnings
which
be
profit
make
on
buying
and
sell
bottler
he
try
to
sell
the
finance
committee
that
this
be
the
way
of
the
future
the
price
they
paid
for
bottle
company
be
just
nut
i
ask
the
chief
financial
officer
all
these
question
but
roberto
start
the
board
meeting
at
ten
o
clock
and
finish
at
noon
the
atmosphere
be
such
that
it
didn
t
lend
itself
to
question
you
just
have
a
feel
when
it
get
to
be
noon
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
polite
to
keep
raise
subject
or
talk
about
thing
that
would
cause
the
meeting
to
last
until
one
o
clock
he
be
just
not
a
guy
you
question
some
people
have
that
bearing
about
them
and
when
the
bearing
be
back
up
by
a
very
good
record
the
combination
of
the
two
be
pretty
overpower
buffett
be
more
than
simply
nonconfrontational
he
be
of
an
age
and
froman
era
that
view
servingon
board
as
a
quasisocial
activity
in
which
deference
and
politeness
held
sway
in
that
be
the
boardroomculture
throughout
america
this
culture
reflect
the
reality
that
the
structure
of
corporate
board
give
director
very
little
leeway
with
management
as
a
director
you
can
t
remotely
tell
management
what
to
do
all
this
stuff
you
read
in
the
press
about
the
board
set
strategy
be
baloney
as
a
board
member
you
can
do
practically
nothing
if
a
ceo
think
a
director
be
smart
and
on
his
side
he
ll
listen
to
some
degree
but
ninety
eight
percent
of
the
time
he
ll
do
what
he
want
to
anyway
listen
that
s
the
way
i
run
berkshire
i
think
roberto
like
me
but
he
be
not
look
for
a
lot
of
idea
from
me
buffett
never
knew
of
anythingseriously
enough
awry
at
coca
cola
to
make
him
consider
the
drastic
step
of
resigningfrom
the
board
howie
have
a
different
problem
standingup
to
pressure
fromcoca
cola
i
be
more
independent
than
just
about
anybody
else
on
that
board
because
i
be
on
the
berkshire
board
and
no
one
at
coca
cola
could
intimidate
me
say
howie
so
i
have
no
problemchallengingcoca
cola
on
behalf
of
cce
but
howie
eventually
get
off
the
cce
board
there
be
just
too
much
potential
for
conflict
between
the
two
board
in
the
sense
that
people
learn
more
fromheavy

the

historically

more
ladylike

give
the
pattern
of
buffett
s
purchase
of

in
almost
every
case
they
plunge
straight
into
the
ditch
shortly
after
he
bought
them
and
give
the
size
of
this
deal
the
distant
rumble
of
the
tow
truck
s
engine
warmingup
could
be
heard
barely
audible
over
the
next
hill
but
it
be
the
high
price
paid
for
general
re
that
attract
most
of
the
attention
and
the
fact
that
buffett
have
paid
in
stock
not

in
effect
swappingtwenty
percent
of

for
general

announce
on
the
day
that
berkshire
hit
its
then
all
time
high
of
per

people
wonder
if
buffett
s
willingness
to
give
away
his
stock
when
it
be
tradingat
such
an
unheard
of
price
meant
that
he
too
thought
brk
be
overvalue
buffett
have
spent
his
career
tighteninghis
stranglehold
on
berkshire
givingstock
to
general
re
s
shareholder
dilute
his
own
personal
votinginterest
in
berkshire
from
forty
three
percent
to
less
than
thirty
eight
percent
the
last
time
he
have
paid
stock
for
a
major
purchase
it
be
geico
and
investor
have
believe
then
that
berkshire
be
overprice
so
they
speculate
about
the
message
buffett
s
new
deal
might
be
send
the
price
of
brk
swungup
and
down
base
partly
on
the
price
of
the
stock
that
berkshire
own
it
be
especially
high
at
that
moment
because
berkshire
own
million
share
of
coca
cola
which
now
trade
at
an
astronomicalprice
so
if
buffett
be
subtly
signalingthrough
his
purchase
of
generalre
that
brk
be
overvalue
do
that
mean
that
its
underlyingstocks
like
coca
cola
be
overprice
if
so
this
could
have
implication
for
the
entire
market
it
might
mean
the
whole
market
be
overprice

be

the

result
besides
with
its
effervescent
mix
of

show
business
and
likable
people
coca
cola
be
buffett
s
favorite
stock
the
realthing
wasn
t
a
slogan
to
him
it
be
an
incredible
cash
machine
that
could
grind
out
money
forever
like
the
mill
in
the
old

of

s
worth
of

buffett
carefully
sidestep
these
question
about
the
market
and
coca
cola
when
he
use
berkshire
stock
to
buy
general
re

it
be
not
a

call
whatsoever
brk
he
say
be
fairly

before
the
merger
and
the
combine
company
would
create
synergy
when
charlie
munger
be
ask
he
state
that
buffett
have
consult
himabout
this
dealvery
late
in
the
game
in
effect
he
disown
the
deal
not
unexpectedly
investor
begin
to
reprice
brk
as
if
either
berkshire
and
its
holding
in
stock
like
coca
cola
be
overprice
or
the
deal
s
synergy
would
prove
illusory
or
both
buffett
s
explanation
later
that
summer
at
sun
valley
be
that
we
want
to
buy
gen
re
but
come
with
gen
re
be
billion
dollar
of
investment
many
be
stock
buffett
promptly
sell
them
add
billion
of
bond
change
the
bond
stock
ratio
at
berkshire
which
i
be
not
unhappy
with
it
do
have
the
effect
of
a
portfolio
allocation
change
so
buffett
who
sat
on
the
coca
cola
board
with
herbert
allen
be
not
unhappy
with
swampingbrk
s
stock
includingcoca
cola
in
an
ocean
of
general
re
s
bond
this
statement
in
context
make
all
kind
of
sense
in
his
previous
shareholder
letter
buffett
have
write
that
stock
be
not
overvalue
if
interest
rate
stayed
below
average
and
if
business
kept
deliver
extraordinary
return
on
capital
in
other
word
if
the
unlikely
continued
to
occur
this
statement
be
oblique
enough
to
avoid
lookinglike
a
forecast
buffett
thought
those
who
be
always
out
prophesyingsome
turn
in
the
market
s
direction
usually
wound
up
beingwrongten
time
out
of
two
so
he
rarely
make
statement
about
the
market
and
often
played
coy
when
he
do
still
it
be
unusually
clever
of
himto
work
the
word
not
overvalue
into
a
sentence
that
say
that
the
market
be
overvalue
people
could
read
this
message
any
way
they
want
but
if
they
be
smart
they
get
it
likewise
buffett
be
not
unhappy
with
dilutinghis
stock
portfolio
in
the
same
sun
valley
speech
where
he
face
an
audience
fill
with
internet
ceo
at
a
time
when
internet
stock
be
parthenogizingfaster
than
naked
mole
rat
he
accompany
his
not
unhappy
with
remark
with
the
same
warning
as
in
his
letter
that
interest
rate
must
stay
well
below
average
and
the
economy
stay
unusually
hot
for
the
market
to
meet
investor
expectation
this
be
also
the
same
sun
valley
speech
where
buffett
have
use
his
place
at
the
pulpit
to
explain
that
investingis
layingout
money
today
to
get
money
back
tomorrow
like
aesop
s
bird
in
the
hand
versus
the
bird
in
the
bush
that
interest
rate
be
the
price
of
waitingfor
the
bird
in
the
bush
that
for
period
sometimes
as
longas
seventeen
year
the
market
have
go
exactly
nowhere
and
that
at
other
time
such
as
the
present
the
value
of
stock
grows
much
faster
than
the
economy
and
of
course
he
have
close
this
speech
by
comparinginvestors
to
a
bunch
of
oilprospectors
who
be
goingto
hell
thus
if
buffett
be
reshufflinghis
portfolio
and
focusingon
bond
perhaps
it
meant
that
he
thought
that
it
be
now
easy
to
make
a
livingin
bond
than
stock
and
it
be
goingto
get
easy
still
the
followingoctober
he
make
another
move
that
be
just
the
opposite
of
what
most
people
be
do
strikingly
conservative

the
standard
of
the

that

buffett

we
probably
aren

go
to
sell
any
more

of

we

the

one
of
the

problem
in

it

at

when

very

heard
that

dictatingterms
to
the

in
an
unheard
of
way
this
troubled
him

so
much
of
the

have
come
fromreengineeringthe

between
the

now
ivester
be
pushingthat

hard
that
the

reiterate
the
question
of
whether

about

the

problem
trowelingmore
makeup
on
coke
when
the
ceo
s
main
job
as
keough
and
allen
and
buffett
perceive
it
be
to
make
the
coke
brand
more
popular
around
the
world
since
goizueta
have
be

before
he
die
and
ivester
be
the
engineer

reaped
the
reward
for
doingso
why
should
he
behave
any
differently
now
that
he
be

as
one
board

put
it
the

be
odd
for
a

company

in
the
end
the
mistake
be
not
ivester

still
buffett
be
pretty
sure
that
the

not
so
obvious
to
the

after

herbert

put
in
a
call
to
buffett
i
think
we
have
a
problemwith
ivester
he
say
we
picked
the
wrongguy
buffett
agree
that
s
about
it
say
allen
they
begin
to
lay
their
plan
they
both
estimate
that
it
would
take
more
than
a
year
for
the
board
to
come
around
to
their
point
of
view
that
ivester
have
to
go
and
that
say
allen
would
have
be
devastatingto
the
company
so
i
think
we
decide
just
as
two
individual
to
tell
him
the
truth
about
how
we
felt
allen
call
ivester
and
say
he
and
buffett
want
a
meeting
they
agree
to
get
together
in
chicago

kindle
buffett
s
dread
of
confrontation
he
lash
down
his
anxiety

into
his
shell
later
it
be
report
that
he
appear
cold
the
three
men
get
down
to
business
without
preamble
impersonally
buffett
and
allen
told
ivester
that
they
appreciate
his
effort
on
behalf
of
coca
cola
but
he
no
longer
have
their
confidence
still
ivester
be
not
actually
fire
buffett
and
allen
lack
the
authority
to
fire
ivester
he
might
have
won
a
board
vote
and
he
knew
that
buffett
say
ivester
take
the
news
stoically
he
rush
back
to
atlanta
to

sunday
ivester
told
the

that
he
have
conclude
that
he
be
not
the
right
person
to
run
the
company
he
would
step
down
immediately
this
be
exactly
as
buffett
and
allen
have
hop
but
he
also
say
there
would
be
no
transition
he
be
leavingas
of
that
day
as
the
board
listen
in
stun
silence
he
described
it
as
a
voluntary
decision
and
that
be
true
in
the
sense
that
it
be
voluntary
to
avoid
the

squad
by

why
didn
t
they
have
any
warn
must
the
transition
be
so
sudden
ivester
never
waver
fromhis
script
a
while
back
the
board
have
insist
against
some
resistance
that
ivester
put
a
name
in
an
envelope
that
say
who
should
succeed
himif
he
be
hit
by
a
truck
the
envelope
be
now
open
to
reveal
the
name
of
doug
daft
head
of
coca
cola
s
middle
and
far
eastern
division
daft
be
halfway
out
the
door
to
retirement
but
the
board
amongthem
buffett
and
allen
instantly
make
himivester
s
successor
with
apparently
no
serious
discussion
of
any
alternative
the
recrimination
begin
as
the
market
take
a
hatchet
to
the
stock
investor
have
figure
out
that
ivester
be
walkingthe
plank
in
private
conversation
with
a
few
board
member
he
let
on
what
have
happen
the
board
now
realize
with
varyingdegrees
of
outrage
how
much
their
role
have
be
usurped
with
the
medium
howl
it
become
clear
that
the
company
have
well
become
more
forthcoming
fortune
write
an
exclusive
piece
revealingdetails
of
the
secret
chicago
meeting
ivester
have
negotiate
a
stagger
million
consolation
package
which
angered
both
his
detractor
and
his
supporter
it
give
the
impression
that
he
be
either
paid
off
or
wrong
and
observer
now
realize
that
an
inner
circle
rule
the
coke
board
it
be
carry
out
badly
except
that
there
wasn
t
anything
well
that
we
could
have
carry
out
it
be
almost
a
disaster
the
way
we
do
it
but
if
we
hadn
t
it
would
have
be
a
disaster
for
sure
i
don
t
think
we
could
have
gotten
the
board
to
vote
to
make
a
change
like
that
bingo
i
think
the
only
way
to
have
make
a
change
fast
be
the
way
we
do
it
and
it
take
both
of
us
to
get
it
do
if
either
of
us
have
do
it
individually
it
wouldn
t
have
happen
but
by
year
end
buffett
s
reputation
be
sufferingin
an
even
more
overt
way
because
the
big
most
profitable
feat
of
stock
selection
that
he
have
ever
make
coca
cola
be
down
by
one
third
after
ivester
s
departure
that
buffett
have
felt
force
to
intervene
in
a
particularly
graceless
way
which
have
backfire
in
public
on
both
the
company
and
himself
left
the
impression
not
that
he
have
ridden
to
the
rescue
as
with
salomon
but
that
what
he
and
herbert

have
do
be
the
meddlingof
a

of

buffett
say
he

the

that

have
to

nearly
half
before
he
would
get
really
excite

he
told

despite
two
year
of
keelhauling
even
with
the

down
by
more

he

no

about
seven

the

that

explain
his
twenty
punch
approach
to

you
d
get
very
rich
he
say
if
you
thought
of
yourself
as

a

with
only
twenty
punch
in

buffett

that
the
most
important
opportunity
give
him
in
the

of

he
now

both
the

the

that
have
go

in
the
late
s
buffett
thought
the
time
be
right
for
himto
speak
up
about
the
rapacity
of
the
rich
and
the
way
it
be
beingvalidated
by
fiscalpolicy
his
sense
of

be
particularly
inflame
by
a
proposalthat
be
a
centerpiece
of
president
bush
s
new
budget
a
plan
to
gradually
repeal
the
decade
old
federal
estate
tax
which
take
for

a

of
the
large

supporter
of
the
plan
refer
to
the
estate
tax
as
the
death
tax
which
have
an
ominous
sound
the
mantra
be
that
death
shouldn
t
be
a
taxable
event
they
call
the
estate
tax
a
barrier
to
the
ambition
of
hardworkingentrepreneurial
people
they
cite
a
proverbial
family
that
would
have
to
sellthe

farmto
pay
the
tax
when
its
patriarch
die
undoubtedly
there
be
some
such
family
buffett
argue
that
the
sufferingof
those
few
be
far
outweigh
by
the
effect
on
everybody
else
the
estate
tax
be
technically
not
a
death
tax
it
be
a
gift
tax
anytime
someone
give
a
large
gift
of
money
he
paid
a
gift
tax
all
gift
tax
be
a
blockade
against
the
return
of
the
robber
baron
who
control
so
much
of
the
nation
s
rich
through
gift
and
inheritance
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
they
become
like
a

unto
themselves
a
plutocracy
a
rulingclass
base
on

the

tax
however
be
paid
at

allowingrelatively

to
go
untaxed
buffett
use
his
preacher
s
pulpit
to
point
out
that
of
the
roughly
million
american
who
die
each
year
few
than
fifty
thousand
two
percent
paid
any

at
all
half
of
all
the
estate
tax
paid
come
fromfewer
than
four
thousand
people
two
tenth
of
one

of
those
who
have
die
these
be
the
monumentally
colossally
rich

on
the
scale
of

own
a

in
france
and
wear
jewel
that
look
like
rock
candy
and
lemon
and
lime
sourball
as
to
the
question
it
be
their
money
why
shouldn
t
they
be
able
to
do
what
they
want
with
it
why
should
they
subsidize
others
buffett
s
answer
be
that
they
owe
some
minimumamount
to
the
society
that
enable
themto
become
so
rich
if
they
thought
they
do
it
all
themselves
reincarnate
themas
one
of

see
how
rich
and

they
would

on
a

plantation
in
c
te
d
ivoire
if
the
estate
tax
be
eliminate
he
say
somebody
else
would
have
to
make
up
the
difference
since
the
same
amount
of
money
would
still
be
require
to
pay
for
runningthe
government
for
year
a
supply
side
theory
have
postulate
that

would
force
the

to

this
theory
have
an
intuitive
logic
after
all
if
people
be
suppose
to
live
within
their

why
not
the

by
the

to
avoid

debate
over

side
policy
still
boil
after
twenty
year
the
tax
the
government
be
collectingusually
didn
t
cover
its
cost
and
it
be
borrowingto
make
up
the
difference
the
theory
by
now
look
more
dubious
killingthe
estate
tax
would
mean
that
the
government
would
have
to
raise
tax
or
borrow
even
more
money
and
the
interest
on
that
debt
alongwith
its
ultimate
repayment
would
eventually
be
pass
on
to
everybody
else
in
the
form
of
high
tax
buffett
felt
that
proposingan
estate
tax
cut
while
runningthe
federal
budget
at
a
deficit
be
in
fact
the
height
of
hypocrisy
the
average
person
who
would
pay
these
high
tax
if
the
estate
tax
be
repeal
would
never
face
an

tax
the
push
to
repealthe
estate
tax
be
not
comingfrompeople
who
own
small
ranch
in
oklahoma
no
the
real
push
buffett
say
be
comingfrom
a
tiny
percentage
of
the
country

population

he
actually
knew
people
who

buffett
felt
that
politics
have
slither
into
the

of
people

could

of

where
they
would

the
most

he
didn
t
blame

actingin
their

he
even

for
the

buffett
say
that
the

corrupt
the
current
way
of

out

whose
job
be

that

the

not
go
far
enough
he
thought
that

you

in
any
way
you
want
to
you
can
cash
it
in
or
give
it
away

the
idea
of
passing

from

to
generation
so
that
hundred
of
your
descendant
can
command
the

they

i
d
have

i
wouldn

mind
have
no

up
to

then
a
hundred
percent
tax
for
an
estate
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
million
dollar
the
most
important
thing
be
to
ask
and
then
what
if
you
eliminate
the
twenty
billion
dollar
or
so
raise
by
the

tax
you
ve
get
to
make
the

up
by

everybody
else
somehow
it
s
amaze
how
hard
the
american
population
will
fight
for
the
family
of
those
few
thousand
people
who
pay
large
estate
tax
and
for
the
whole
rest
of
the

to

for
it
out
of

i
don

i
don

i

like
anything
where
the

twenty

get
a

poorer

but
the
debate
over

tax
turn
shrill
and
bitter
buffett
be
portrayed
as
a
silver
spoon
populist
a
rich
old
crocodile
who
be
tryingto
keep
the

turn
a
meritocracy
upside
down
he
write
to
senator
ken
salazar
in
effect
it
say
that
the
people
who
should
allocate
the
resource
of
this
country
should
be
the
descendant
of
those
who
excel
in
amassingresources
longago
subtly
or
not
the
estate
tax
feud
be
inform
by
the
issue
of
buffett
s
own
money
some
people
call
rich
guy
like
buffett
tax
dodger
because
they
have
amass
their
money
through
lightly
taxed
investment
but
to
say
that
buffett
invest
to
dodge
tax
be
like
sayingthat
a
baby
drank
its
bottle
to
fillits
diaper
indeed
buffett
be
the
first
to
say
that
the
tax
on
investment
be
unfairly
low
in
fact
this
be
another
of
his
cause
he
like
to
compare
his
tax
rate
to
his
secretary
s
pointingout
how
unjust
it
be
that
she
paid
a
high
tax
rate
on
her
income
than
he
do
just
because

in

buffett
vowed
to
carry
on
the
fight
against

and
would
spin
on
this

for

he

just

before
the

buffett
s
betrayalof

their

say
one
that
of

be
his
point
he
felt
that
the
united

of

be
never
meant
to
be
a
country
where
people
with

who
constantly
gather
more

themselves
the

however

a

of

of

bother
buffett
because
of
the
way
it
have

with

gouge
out
one
of
buffett
s
least
favorite
way
for
the
rich
to
get
richer
be
through
stock
option
since
his
famous
no

on

at

no
other

only
if

increase

to

the

approve
it
with
buffett
staringat
his

think
okay
this
willnever
happen
a
month
later
the

belatedly
realize
that
the

be
impossible
and

would
never

it

and
bonus
pimped
for
him
loweringthe

to

that
be
like
movingthe
finish

in
a

to
the
nineteen

buffett
couldn

it
the

six

and
would
be

something
and
you

they

i
really
wasn

i
be
just
overcome
at
that

afterward
buffett
be
able

carry

the

which

allow

not

nobody

do
that
they
use

the

who
tell
his

it
didn

happen
but
if
it
do
i
wasn

there
and
if

be
there
i
didn
t
do

and
if
i
do
my
friend
make
me
business
say
that
stock

weren
t
an

but
if
they
be
an

nobody
knew
how
to
calculate
it
and
if
they
could
the

shouldn
t
be
deduct
fromearnings
it
should
only
be
disclose

it
might
confuse

how

the

it

that

earlier
it
would

journal
and
a

time
flown
in
daily
on
the

it
would
be
three
day
late
howie
say
but
they
would
get
the
paper
to
him
it
be
goingto
cost
five
hundred
buck
a
day
but
they
would
hook
it
up
so
he
could
be
online
in
his
room
and
check
the
news
they
already
have
the
hamburger
and
french
fry
thingdown
because
they
do
that
for
me
the
buffetts
would
be
leavingfor
africa
a
few
week
after
their
annual

which
always
follow
the

on

the

near
berkshire
announce
the

in
the

the
clayton
deal
have
come
about
because
year
of
low
interest
rate
have
give
lender
piggy

full
of
cheap
money
and
that

be
quick
to
train
consumer
that
low
interest
rate
meant
they
could
buy
more
stuff
for
less
cash
outlay
now
those
with

in

learn
it
could
be

whether
it

the

in

of

increasingly
turn

in
the

the
manufacturer
who
use
it
to
lend

to
the

historically
this
process
have
work
because
if
the
mobile

maker
make
bad
loan
it
face
the
discipline
of
not
gettingpaid

but
then
the
mobile

begin
to
sell
their

handingoff
the

that

buffett
propose
a
systemin
which
united

company
that
export
would
be
issue
import
certificate
in
totalabout
billion
a

they
could
trade
these
like
the
old
warehouse
certificate
issue
by
rockwood
chocolate
could
be
trade
anybody
wantingto
import
into
the
united
state
would
need
an
import
certificate
and
would
have
to
buy
froman
exporter
presto
company
would
get
paid
a
high
price
to
export
than
to
sell
domestically
automatically
increasingexports
that
of
course
would
increase
the
importer
foreign
company
cost
while
this
systemcould
be
view
as
unfriendly
a
tariff
or
tax
on
import
which
in
the
past
have
lead
to
trade
war
that
depressed
economy
buffett
felt
that
importer
be
goingto
suffer
anyway
as
their
good
become
more
expensive
with
the
fallingdollar
the
import
certificate
idea
at
least
use
the
market
to
allocate
who
be
willingto
suffer
over
time
demand
for
import
certificate
would
gradually
increase
export
to
rebalance
trade
and
restore
parity
between
thriftville
and
squanderville
the
plan
have
many
nuance
but
its
bottomline
be
hallmark
buffett
in
many
way
the
article
showcased
buffett
s
think
it
be
a
lesson
on
economics
it
be
a
warningof
potential
catastrophe
it
have
a
margin
of
safety
while
it
might
not
improve
the
trade
balance
as
much
as
he
hop
the
market
mechanismmeant
it
be
unlikely
to
make
thing
bad
it
be
a
blend
of
a
market
and
government
solution
it
be
a
complex
ingenious
comprehensive
system
and
of
course
a
no
risk
deal
in
which
most
party
would
be
at
least
somewhat
well
off
than
the
alternative
of
doingnothing
executingit
would
also
require
a
wholesale
change
in
think
a
coalition
of
politician
would
have
to
grasp
the
economics
and
care
deeply
enough
about
themto
take
the
considerable
political
risk
of
pushingthrough
buffett
s
idea
moreover
the
plan
would
attack
a
problem
before
it
have
turn
into
a
crisis
always
unlikely
in
washington
the
odds
of
anythingremotely
resemblinga
tariff
beingenacted
into
law
with
president
bush
and
free
marketeers
controllingthe
white
house
be
zero
thus
the
import
certificate
be
an
elegant
solution
that
be
goingabsolutely
nowhere
buffett
s
father
however
would
have
be
extremely
proud
of
him
and
at
least
buffett
would
have
the
honor
of
beingthe
first
prominent
figure
to
go
on
record
warn
loudly
about
the
risk
of
a
fallingdollar
to
hedge
that
risk
for
berkshire
he
have
be
lookingat
chinese
stock
because
of
china
s
burgeoningeconomic
power
he
have
found
petrochina
study
it
and
gotten
comfortable
enough
to
buy
it
although
he
be
able
to
purchase
only
million
he
say
he
wish
he
could
have
bought
more
his
endorsement
of
petrochina
sent
investor
over
the
moon
warren
buffett
have
bought
a
foreign
stock
petrochina
soar
and
so
do
attendance
at
the
brk
shareholder
meeting
that
year
people
come
to
omaha
s
woodstock
for
capitalist
buffett
s
billion
fortune
be
once
again
exceed
only
by
bill
gate
s
he
have
bounce
back
almost
to
the
top
of
the
heap
what
be
the
idealbusiness
a
shareholder
ask
when
the
question
begin
the
ideal
business
be
one
that
earns
very
high
return
on
capital
and
that
keep
use
lot
of
capital
at
those
high
return
that
becomes
a
compound
machine
buffett
say
so
if
you
have
your
choice
if
you
could
put
a
hundred
million
dollar
into
a
business
that
earns
twenty
percent
on
that
capital
twenty
million
ideally
it
would
be
able
to
earn
twenty
percent
on
a
hundred
twenty
million
the
follow
year
and
on
a
hundred
forty
four
million
the
follow
year
and
so
on
you
could
keep
redeploy
capital
at
those
same
return
over
time
but
there
be
very
very
very
few
business
like
that
we
can
move
that
money
around
from
those
business
to
buy
more
business
this
be
about
as
clear
a
lesson
on
business
and
investingas
he
would
ever
give
it
explain
why
berkshire
be

it
be
although
what
it
say
about
the
stock
market
s
longhistory
of
disappointed

be
sober
it
explain
why
he
be
always
lookingfor
new
business
to
buy
and
what
he
be
planningto
do
with
clayton
home
he
expect
to
invest
part
of
berkshire
s
extra
capital
in
clayton
so
that
it
could
survive
to
take
market
share
away
from
its
bankrupt
competitor
and
to
buy
and
service
their

the

the

who
have
flown
in
to

be
more
interested
in

and
whether
that
investment
signal
a
new

in

they
get
their
chance
to
ask
him
and
munger
about
it
at
the
press
conference
on
sunday
many
of
them
want
to
ask
a
version
of
a
question
that
they
knew
would
resonate
with
their
home
audience
what
stock
would
you

the

about

but
the
idea
of
a

overseeingwarren
buffett
be
ludicrous
a

make
up

would
do
just
as
well
when
the

buffett
teach
just
as
every
occasion
from
a
party
to
a
luncheon
to
a
sing
alongwith
jim
clayton
turn
into
an
opportunity
for
buffett
to
figuratively
stand
at
the
blackboard
finger
dusty
with
chalk
the
reason
shareholder
care
about
berkshire
corporate
governance
be
not
oversight
however
but
the
question
of
who
would
succeed
buffett
who
be
now
almost
seventy
three
he
have
always
say
there
be
a
name
in
an
envelope
crowninghis
successor
but
he
would
not
acquiesce
to
the
pressure
to
revealthe
name
because
that
would
tie
his
hand
to
one
person
and
event
could
change
it
would
also
effectively
begin
the
transition
and
he
certainly
wasn
t
ready
for
that
there
be
of
course
a
guessinggame
about
who
this
person
could
possibly
be
most
of
the
manager
of
the
various

shun
the

who
work
as

but
these
people
do
not
manage

where
be
the

susie
continued
to
seemoblivious
to
the
potentialseriousness
of
the
situation
when
they
arrive
at
dr
schmidt
s
office
susie
say
to
kathleen
you
re
so
nervous
why
be
you
so
nervous
kathleen
thought
oh
my
gosh
doesn
t
she
get
that
this
could
be
bad
news
when
they
met
with
the
doctor
he
told
susie
that
she
have
stage
three
oral
cancer
she
be
stun
by
the
diagnosis
it
be
like
somebody
shot
a
thunderbolt
through
her
say
cole
she
have
apparently
not
even
consider
this
as
a
possibility
susie
have
her
moment
of
tear
then
characteristically
by
the
time
they
get
into
the
car
she
have
pull
herself
together
and
start
chicken
soupingeverybody
but
herself
she
call
warren
he
do
not
say
much
she
call
susie
jr
and
told
her
call
your
dad
he
s
goingto
be
a
mess
then
she
go
home
and
talk
to
warren
again
and
to
susie
jr
howie
and
peter
by
then
susie
jr
have
already
go
to
the
internet
to
research
she
call
her
father
and
say
don
t
read
the
oralcancer
web
site
oral
cancer
strike
only
people
a
year
but
kill
more
than
an
often
painless
but
fast
grow
cancer
it
be
more
deadly
than
melanoma
brain
cancer
liver
cancer
cervicalcancer
or
hodgkin
s
disease
it
be
particularly
dangerous
because
it
s
usually
discover
only
after
it
have
spread
to
the
lymph
node
of
the
neck
at
which
point
the
primary
tumor
may
have
invade
surroundingtissue
and
potentially
migrate
to
other
organ

oral
cancer

an
especially
high
risk
of
developinga
second
primary
tumor
survivinga
first
bout
with
the
disease
carry
a
twentyfold
great

ninety

of

with

the
risk
even
more
susie
buffett
never
smoke
or
drank
she
have
no
significant
risk
factor
the
fact
that
her
cancer
be
stage
three
meant
that
it
have
already
spread
to
at
least
one
lymph
node
but
probably
not
to

return
to
her

with
a
souvenir
of
a

froma
friend
or
a
piece
of
art
that
meant
somethingto
her
the
woman
who
never
let
go
of
anythingor
anybody
start
tellingpeople
i

my

i

live
to

i
love
my

but
i
ve
do
my
job
and
i
m
not
really
need
anymore
if
it
be
up
to
me
she
told
kathleen
i
would
go
off
to
a
villa
in
italy
in
privacy
and
just
die
she
be
far
more
fearfulof
a
protract
painfuldeath
than
of
dyingitself
but
if
she
simply
give
up
she
would
be
abandoningpeople
who
be
important
to
her
people
who

part
of
her
life
for
decade
it
be
really
warren
for
whom
she
be
goingto
have
the
surgery
however
she
told
kathleen
and
her
friend
ron
park
amongothers
that
she
hadn
t
decide
whether
to
do
the
follow
up
radiation
that
be
a
standard
part
of
the
treatment
to
reduce
the
risk
of
a
recurrence
which
be
high
for
some
reason
perhaps
because
she
be
in
a
state
of
shock
she
didn
t
seemto
grasp
how
important
it
be
the
followingmorning
as
she
and
kathleen
be
makingplans
for
what
be
to
come

unaccountably
refuse
to
authorize
kathleen

in
some
kind
of
shock
or
denialand
finally
call
susie
jr
who
simply
say
to
ignore
her
mother
and
make
the
necessary
arrangement
meanwhile

through
his

or
all
of
her

be

for
more
than
a
month
after
the

she
would
be
fed
through
a
tube
in
her
nose
that
lead
directly
into
her
stomach
she
would
not

to
talk
duringthat
period
and
the
surgery
be
potentially
disfigure
susie
told
warren
little
more
she
do
say
she
be
worried
that
she
would

about

but
his
mind
never
really
left

of

the

uneventful
nobody
get

nor
do
buffett

for
the
rest
of
the
week
he
start
every
morningin
a
thunderhead
mood
a
sure
sign
that
he
be
not

well
then
brighten
through
the
course
of
the

other
than
debbie
bosanek
and
a
few
other
people
nobody
at
berkshire
hathaway
headquarters
knew
the
reason
duringthat
week
he
rarely
left
his
corner
of
the
floor
next
to
the
xerox
room
and
the
two
file
room
spendingmuch
of
his
time
on
the
phone
with
susie
although
they
talk
for
hour
she
be
vague
about
the
ordeal
that
she
face
initially
she
herself
have
not
grasped
the
extensiveness
of
the
surgery
which
might
also
involve
a
bone
graft
take
fromher
leg
the
surgeon
be
not
sure
how
much
of
her
face
would
be
involve
although
they
thought
they
could
spare
her
tongue
most
devastatingto
her
be
that
she
would
probably
not
be
able
to
singagain
she
have
discuss
the
surgery
with
her
former
son
in
law
allen
greenberg
who
have
a
longtime
familiarity
with
her

havingtaken
his

bos
and
former
mother

at

greenbergdid
not
even
mention
susie
when
he
go
to
buffett
s
office
to
update
himon
the
foundation
s
project
yet
while
warren
didn
t
want
to
know
much
he
talk
and
talk
about
what
he
do
know
they
ve
get
a
team
of
five
guy
and
it
s
at
least
a
ten
hour
deal
she
s
get
the
best
care
in
the
world
she
get
a
letter
from
howie
that
no
mother
could
get
a
well
letter
she
s
get
a
lot
go
for
her
but
it
ll
be
a
tough
ordeal
they
ve
give
her
a
lot
of
information
and
she
know
i
don
t
want
the
detail
she
s
told
me
what
she
think
i
can
handle
i
m
sure
the
doctor
think
it
s
crazy
that
i
m
not
talk
to
them
directly
but
i
can
t
take
that
so
she
s
sort
of
told
me
the
key
element
a
few
day
later
susie
flew
into

to
pick
up

this
meetingwithout
susie

of
her

the
art
of
compartmentalizingto
such
a
degree
that
these
skill
be
second
nature
to
him
but
under
the
circumstance
it
be
stillgoingto
be
a
hell
of
a
performance
once
he
be
back
in
his
hotelroom
at
the
end
of
the
even
he
would
be
alone
in
the
dark
with
his

and
his

then

till
all
hour
now
he
sat
talk
at
first
strugglingthrough
a
brittle
discussion
about
business
and
politics
eventually
the
conversation
wound
its
way
to
what
have
be
bubblingbeneath
the
surface
for
day
the
surgery
that
would
take
place
shortly
after
the
meetingended
for
the
briefest
fraction
of
a
second
a
look
of
surprise
flicker
across
his
face
then
his
face
begin
to
crumple
and
collapse
into
his
hand
his
shoulder
heave
and
rock
and
he
slid
forward
in
his
chair
like
a
tower
crumblingin
an
earthquake
dry
desolate
heavingsobs
like
silent
scream

gaspingout
of
him
there
wasn
t
any
consolation
for
this
gradually
the
wrackingsobs

themselves
then
he
begin
to
talk
about
susie

quietly
off
and
on
for
about
two
hour
he
be
afraid
of
what
she
be
goingto
have
to
suffer
through
she
be
strong
than
he
his
main
concern
be
the
pain
she
would
face
he
be
even
more
worried
that
she
might
accept
death
as
a
natural
thingand
not
fight
it
as
he
would
he
be

that

part
of
the
very
core
of
his
beinghad
be
upended
he
have
always
assume
that
he
would
never
be
alone
because
she
would
outlive
him
he
have
always
assume
that
he
could
count
on
her
wisdomand
judgment
to
handle
any
life
and
death
decision
that
might
have
to
be
make
he
have
always
assume
that
she
would
run
the
foundation
after
he
be
go
she
would
keep
peace
within
the
family
if
he
be

there
she
would
see
to
it
that
astrid

care
of
she
would
resolve
any
conflict
soothe
any
bad
feeling

would
handle
his
funeraland
shape
the
way
in
which
everyone
would
remember
him
above
all
he
have

ease
his
sufferingwhen

as
she

the
first
time

to
contemplate
that
it
might
not
work
out
this
way
but
these
thought
be
so
unbearable
that
he
could
only
glance
at
thembefore
shuttingthemdown
he
be
sure
that
her
doctor
would
take
care
of
her
and
that

the

system
the
doctor
begin
to
prepare
susie
for
the
six
week
course
of
radiation
which
be
intend
to
kill
any
remainingcancer
cell
it
would
begin
in
december
and
continue
through
the
holiday
the
radiation
which
she
have
never
quite
agree
to
in
the
first
place
be
goingto
burn
her
throat
the
doctor
have
told
her
to
bulk
up
before
the
surgery
because
she
could
expect
to
lose
around
fifty
pound
over
the
entire
course
of
the
surgery
and
radiation
that
be
a
lot
of
weight
but
one
of
the
thought
that
have
comfort
her
before
the
surgery
be
that
she
could
afford
to
lose
a
good
bit
of
it
now
as
the
feedingtube
come
out
the
nurse
begin
to
feed
susie
six
unit
of
liquid
meal
replacement
a
day
it
take
her
much
of
the
day
to
get
it
down
because
of
the
pain
under
stress
warren
have
gain
a
little
weight
he
felt
that
he
need
to
lose
twenty
pound
and
have
decide
to
diet
alongside
susie
s
liquid
mealregimen
that
can
t
be
a
lot
of
fun
he
say
so
i
won
t
have
any
fun
either
buffett
s
manner
of
dietingwas
as
eccentric
and
unhealthy
as
the
rest
of
his
eatinghabits
he
decide
to
stick
with
his
usualapproach
which
be
to
consume
only
a
thousand
calorie
a
day
and
budget
it
however
he
like
that
meant
he
could
spend
the
thousand
calorie
on
licorice
peanut
brittle
hamburger
or
whatever
else
he
want
to
eat
so
longas
he
didn
t
exceed
the
self
impose
limit
the
easy
step
be
to
cut
back
on
all
the
cherry
coke
replacingit
with
nothingand
thereby
dehydratinghimself
the
idea
behind
the
thousand
calorie
starvation
regimen
be
to
get
the
pain
of
dietingover
with
fast
he
be
impatient
and
cut
off
debate
over
the
health
merit
of
such
a
diet
at
my
height
and
age
he
say
i
reckon
that
i
can
eat
about
a
million
calorie
a
year
and
maintain
my
weight
the
nice
round
even
number
of
a
million
calorie
pleased
him
i
can
spend
those
calorie
however
i
want
if
i
want
to
eat
a
bunch
of
hot
fudge
sundae
in
january
and
starve
the
rest
of
the
year
i
can
do
that
it
be
completely
rational
on
the
surface
yet
totally
ludicrous
but
since
he
have
never
be
either
seriously
overweight
or
seriously
ill
it
be
pointless
to
argue
with
him
he
go
on
this
crash
diet
every
year
right
before
the
shareholder
meeting
it
be
possible
however
that
all
that
dehydration
may
have
have
nothingto
do
with
his
earlier
kidney
stone
regardless
buffett
have
a
way
of
winningarguments
before
they
ever
occur
the
one
extremely
rare
exception
be
when
he
argue
with
the
press
over
how
it
present
him
he
never
spar
with
the
financial
time
or
the
new

time
both
of
which
he
read
religiously
his
problem
always
be
the
wall
street
journal
through
the
year
his
penchant
for
lettingthe
rube
in
on
the
fact
that

be
an
opportunity
for

explain
the

slept
down
in
the

that

mainly
for
storage
while

much
of
the

to

cry
on

sometimes
they
go
to
midnight

when
warren
be
in

susie
saw
no
visitor
only
her
daughter
her

and
a

of
people
like
kathleen

bertie
who
have
bought
apartment
in
the
same
building
be
kept
away
allthe
time
not
just
duringthe
weekend
the
feelingbeingthat
even
a
soup
on
of
attention
would
be
too
drainingfor
susie
every
day
jeannie
write
susie
a
card
and
left
it
downstairs
for
her
like
many
of

bertie
be
sad
about
not

she
have
always
look
up
to
susie
for
her
wisdom
about
people
and
now
in
the
wake
of
her
husband
s
recent
death
she
felt
that
she
have
gain
a
similar
wisdom
herself
hilt
be
a
psychologist
she
say
and
even
without

he
could
see
what
people
s
meta
message
be
when
hilt
die
what
he
will
to
me
be
that
i
can
see
thing
about
people
that
i
never

before
all
of
a
sudden
my
eye
open
about
thing
i
have
never
understood
bertie
felt
that
now
her
relationship
with
susie
would
be
different
more
equal
so
that
she
would
no
longer
have
to
lean
on
susie
she
also
felt
she
be
startingto
understand
susie
for
the
first
time
as
her
brother
travel
back
and
forth
to

every

he

never

and
the
in

facingsusie
s
fear
as
well
as
his
own
when
talkingabout
this

in
a

election
to
unseat
gray
davis
the
governor
of
california
my
wife
have
an
operation
in
san
francisco
about
six
week
ago
and
i
ll
be
out
there
a
couple
of
day
every
week
pause
well
you
know
arnold
sometimes
people
can
t
tell
which
one
be
which
when
we
re
next
to
each
other
when
we
re
strip
down
nobody
have
a
chance
when
someone
he
knew
well
call
he
struggle
to
talk
about
a
subject
that
formerly
he
would
have
avoid
at
allcosts
oh
hi
chuck
yeah
well
she
s
do
well
in
every
respect
than
people
have
told
us
would
be
the
case
go
in
she
doesn
t
have
any
energy
and
it
s
it
s
be
an
experience
like
she
hasn
t
have
before
but
in
term
of
her
mouth
heal
in
term
of
swallow
everything
it
s
all
go
fine
and
the
people
be
terrific
not
a
lot
of
pain
right
now
i
think
it
s
psychological
more
than
i
mean
she
s
not
find
life
any
fun
at
all
at
the
moment
but
the
annual
meeting
well
i
would
say
this
now
with
susie
s
condition
the
way
it
be
i
think
we
re
go
to
skip
the
music
and
just
there
s
no
way
she
ll
be
sing
in
this
may
s
meeting
so
let
s
see
what
happens
next
year
from
time
to
time
he
still
talk
about
susie
beingable
to
singagain
even
though
that
wasn
t
goingto
happen
and
only
with
people
with
whomhe
be
very
close
such
as
his
daughter
would
he
drop
the
occasional
hint
that
he
need
help
hello
hi
i
feel
fine
i
m
get
two
hour
of
sleep
every
night
oh
great
why
don
t
you
come
down
and
swap
car
with
me
oh
yeah
there
s
a
ham
to
pick
up
incidentally
too
it
s
here
we
will
maybe
tomorrow
or
something
okay
okay
okay
two
hour
sleep
a
night
if
i
m
think
about
something
i
m
not
go
to
sleep
i
slept
two
hour
last
night
actually
and
i
feel
fine
it
doesn
t
kill
me
not
to
sleep
susie
s
go
through
this
thing
again
about
whether
she
want
the
radiation
we
ll
get
over
it
her
inclination
over
this
be
go
in
a
bad
direction
when
i
left
san
francisco
but
it
s
still
well
than
it
be
when
i
get
there
so
the
only
good
thing
about
susie
have
the
operation
be
that
this
be
the
first
year
in
thirty
odd
year
that
i
won
t
go
to
emerald
bay
for
christmas
i
m
not
even
sure
my
house
be
there
anymore

winter
omaha
and
san
francisco
december
january
susie
be
still
resistingthe
idea
of
radiation
so
anxious
about
it
that
she
be
takinga
lot
of
ativan
and
dr
isley
start
givingme
little
ativan
speech
say
susie
jr
about
how
i
need
to
stop
askingfor
so
much
ativan
for
her
but
she
be
very
agitate
about
the
radiation
warren
s
view
be
that
it
be
a
formof
handicap
if
radiation
improve
your
odds
why
not
do
it
the
surgery
he
told
her
be
the
hard
part
the
radiation
wouldn
t
be
nearly
as
hard
but
the
radiation
oncologist
have
told
susie
if
anyone
tell
you
about
their
radiation
and
say
it
s
not
that
bad
don
t
believe
them
radiation
in
your
mouth
be
not
like
any
other
radiation
everythingwill
taste
like
metal
your
whole
mouth
will
be
burn
your
salivary
gland
will
be
damage
or
destroyed
you
may
lose
all
your
taste
bud
there
will
be
a
lot
of
pain
susie
have
already
have
a
lot
of
pain
she
felt
she
have
the
right
to
refuse
more
pain
she
s
see
a
lot
of
people
die
see
people
go
through
more
than
they
need
to
go
through
we
both
want
control
over
the
end
of
life
she
have
no
fear
of
death
but
somehow
she
get
the
idea
that
by
have
radiation
she
would
lose
control
and
that
radiation
would
increase
the
chance
of
a
terrible
end
we
go
on
for
hour
and
hour
around
and
around
it
s
up
to
her
to
decide
what
to
do
but
on
the
other
hand
nothing
make
sense
right
now
she
keep
say
i
know
my
brain
isn
t
work
right
and
she
s
have
these
two
doctor
prepare
her
for
sort
of
a
bad
case
scenario
in
the
nice
way
but
just
because
they
d
rather
do

split
the

absolutely
equally
buffett

with

and
it
occur
to
him
that
one
way
susie
could
choose
to

it
be
to

in

than
anybody

they
ve
work
enormously
hard
on

he

well
he

work
they
ve
thought
it
through
their

their
logic

right
warren
be
stillassumingthat
susie
ultimately
would
be
the
one
to
make
these
decision
however
susie
get
all
the
money
and
she
be
in
total
charge
of
everything
my
will
just
give
it
to
her
and
her
will
just
give
it
to
me
it
s
crazy
to
try
and
write
complicate
instrument
you
don
t
need
to
do
it
now
she
could
give
it
all
to
my
kid
foundation
if
she
want
she
be
not
restrict
but
susie
doesn
t
care
whether
she
have
one
share
of

berkshire
or
a
hundred
thousand
share
of
berkshire
she
will
probably
just
put
it
all
in
the
foundation
not
a
share
need
to
be
sell
in
the
first
year
or
two
while
they
be
ramp
up
on
other
thing
if
they
just
match
what
the
gates
do
and
give
them
two
billion
instead
of
one
billion
a
year
that
d
be
perfectly
appropriate
don
t
get
proprietary
about
it
i
m
perfectly
willing
to
let
other
people
do
all
the
work
at
berkshire
but
they
would
hate
that
at
the
buffett
foundation
it
seem
so
lack
in
imagination
and
innovativeness
even
though
it
s
terribly
logical
now
that
isn
t
what
people
want
to
do
i
mean
the
normal
human
institution
reacts
enormously
against
that
but
that
be
not
a
crazy
system
it
s
like
double
your
position
on
a
stock
he
s
get
people
in
place
and
if
we
give
some
money
to
him
the
last
half
of
the
money
would
be
use
as
intelligently
as
the
first
half
there
would
be
very
little
falloff
in
utility
of
the
last
dollar
versus
the
first
dollar
give
money
to
other
foundation
it
s
just
not
what
foundation
like
to
do
but
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
copying
good
people
coattailingby
givingsome
of
the
money
to
the
gate
foundation
while
the
buffett
foundation
be
ramp
up
to
give
away
its
ten
of
billion
might
be
completely
logical
what
wasn
t
completely
logical
give
the
current
circumstance
be
for
warren
to
assume
that
susie
would
be
the
one
makingthese
decision
rather
than
himself
or
his
daughter
and
to
operate
under
this
scenario
without
a
backup
plan
although
maybe
he
be
startingto
have
the
embryo
of
a
backup
plan
over
the
holiday
susie
grow
despondent
again
about
her
radiation
she
threaten
to
discontinue
it
buffett
go
through
another
stretch
of
spendinghours
and
hour
convincingher
that
she
have
go
this
far
and
it
didn
t
make
sense
to
stop
no
matter
what
susie
decide
however
the
radiation
schedule
would
have
two
interruption
at
christmas
and
new
year
s
warren
steam
it
bother
me
that
they
take
off
for
the
holiday
as
well
as
weekend
she
s
have
eight
radiation
treatment
it
just
doesn
t
seem
right
and
the
radiologist
acknowledge
to
me
that
drop
the
schedule
to
four
day
a
week
be
somewhat
marginal
susie
be
stillnot
wellenough
to
receive
any
new
visitor
neither
of
her
son
have
even
see
their
mother
since
the
surgery
but
howie
his

devon
and
their
son
howie
b
finally
join
warren
in
san

howie
still
a

man
chorus
line
of
rockettes
when
it
come
to
energy
saw
susie
just
a
touch
but
the
family
be
stillnot
allowingother
people
to
visit
she
d
just
as
soon
conserve
her
strength
as
see
anybody
frankly
there
s
a
number
of
people
that
be
just
die
to
get
at
her
some
of
them
she
s
a
huge
crutch
for
and
all
they
ll
do
be
drain
her
if
they
get
close
because
she
can
t
stop
be
their
resident
psychiatrist
or
professor
or
whatever
she
feel
a
little
safer
when
i
m
there
but
she
know
that
if
she
start
see
other
people
they
ll
basically
try
to
draw
energy
from
her
with
me
or
with
little
sooz
she
doesn
t
feel
that
way
but
even
with
my
sister
or
her
best
friend
bella
she
can
t
help
but
go
back
into
the
mode
where
she
s
give
and
they
re
receive
susie
jr
have
instruct
everyone
around

that

he
invoked
his
independence
and
buffett

as
reason
for
their

by
actingout
his

he
seem
in
his

into

some
day
she
could
not

drink
the

put
her
back
on

choked
with
a
thick
dry

she
spent

she
scribble
wht
her

on
a
piece
of

a
wry
reference
to

likely
to

to
drain
her
of
energy
on
the
weekend
when
warren
come
he
sat
with
susie
in
the
tvroom
watchingold

he
make
her
feel
secure
but
decade
of
her
give
and
his

t
disappear
overnight
sometimes
susie
be
so
sick
from
the
radiation
that
even
warren
have
to
leave
but
he
be
doinghis
best
to
immerse
himself
in
the
day
to
day
need
of
his
family
in
a
way
that
he
have
never
do
before
to
give
his
daughter
a
break
fromendless
day
in
susie
s
apartment
warren
would
take
her
to
johnny

even
gotten
involve
in

however
her
taste
bud
aren
t
go
yet
i
talk
to
the
radiation
oncologist
and
it
s
conceivable
that
some
of
the
tongue
won
t
get
hit
by
what
they
re
do
which
could
presumably
mean
a
fair
number
of
taste
bud
would
stick
around
warren
buffett
the
man
who
ducked
the
subject

a
common
cold
and
use
term
like
not
feelingup
to
par
as
euphemism
for
illness
the
man
who
change
the
subject
uneasily
whenever
anyone
spoke
of
physical
complaint
and
who
profess
ignorance
of
the
most
basic
point
of
anatomy
be
usingterms
like
radiation
oncologist
and
doingmedical
homework
for
his

but
as
he
grow
more
optimistic
about
susie
s
recovery
he
start
to
become
more
irritable

the

be
a
very
different

people
turn
to
himbecause
they
trust
his
direct

gettingto
the

his
sense

although
rich
beyond
even
his

wild
dream
he
have

the

the

that

because
so
many
investor
have
simply
delegate
their

to
it
isswas
more
like
a
single
behemoth
shareholder
that
control
as
much
as
twenty
percent
of
all
the
board
vote
for
major
corporation
in
the
united
state
the
security
law
have
not
anticipate
that
a
situation
could
arise
in
which
one
unregulated
magisterial
shareholder
held
so
much
power
over
american
business
but
there
it
be
buffett
have
a
passionate
view
of
corporate
board
responsibility
found
in
his
partnership
and
base
on
alignment
of
interest
i
think
owner
should
behave
like
owner
and
i
think
they
should
care
about
independence
and
so
those
guy
be
right
on
two
out
of
three
it
s
just
that
they
don
t
have
the
faintest
notion
of
what
independence
be
about
or
how
board
actually
work
this
checklist
approach
be
totally
crazy
if
we
d
go
out
and
found
somebody
in
the
unemployment
line
and
paid
them
to
be
a
coke
director
they
d
be
consider
independent
and
calpers
and
i
would
have
no
problem
voting
for
him
even
though
he
depend
completely
for
his
income
on
that
paycheck
from
coke
study
however
have
show
either
no
correlation
or
negative
correlation
between
board
independence
and
a
firm
s
performance
but
for
the
coke
board
to
railagainst
issalso
lack
a
certain
credibility
and
seemliness
now
that
coke
s
stock
be
barbecue
its
board
member
could
convincingly
summon
no
more
than
low
to
middlingdudgeon
the
accusation
of
a
crony
board
near
the
mark
although
it
have
faction
one

rule
or
rather
misruled
buffett
admit
that
he
should
have
do
more
to
try
to
steer
thing
right
at

indeed
if

have
be

assist
only
by
a
six

of
cherry

perhaps
many
of
its
woe
could
have
be
avoid
instead
a

of
important
people
several
of

all

themselves
to

they

me

at
the

that
while
many
disagreed
with
the
first
person
makinga
comment
his
violent
removal
be
beneath
the

of

it
be
an
overreaction
it
be
an
excessive
use
of

i
would
like
to
know
jackson
ask
rhetorically
if
there
be
a

in
the

under

accusation
that
the

now
seem
anticlimactic
daft
struggle

immediately
in

sat
down
next
buffett

enter

so
everybody
get
a
close

look
buffett
be
staringout
at
a
dark
arena
fill
with
flashinglights
and
as
many
people
as
would
show
up
in
nebraska
to
see
the
rollingstones
before
takingquestions
buffett
kick
off
the
meetingwith
rapid
efficiency
to
cover
a
normally
perfunctory
five
minute
business
agenda
of
electingdirectors
ratifyingauditors
and
the
like
this
year
almost
immediately
one
of
the
shareholder
stood
up
at
a
microphone
and
say
in
a
timid
voice
that
he
be
withholdinghis
vote
he
offer
a
motion
fromthe
floor
he
ask
that
buffett
consider
usingsome
of
the
ceo
of
his
company
as
director
because
they
be
well
qualify
than
susie
and
howie
buffett
an
audible
ripple
shudder
across
the
auditorium
the
motion
even
though
present
in
a
respectful
tone
felllike
a
bigwet
blot
to
mar
the
smooth
engrave
surface
of
the
shareholder
meetingagenda
most
of
the
audience
be
shock
berkshire
be
now
the
fourteenth
large
business
in
the
united
state
with
over
employee
billion
in
revenue
and
profit
of
billion
a
year
but
it
remain
at
heart
a
family
corporation
as
the
large
shareholder
buffett
have
the
vote
to
elect
a
couple
of
board
seat
for
family
member
if
he
want
he
saw
his
family
s
role
in
berkshire
as
similar
to
the
walton
family
s
at
wal
mart
a
nexus
between
the
buffett
foundation
and
the
company
unquestionably
the
way
he
chose
his
board
be
purely
personal
although
some
board
member
happen
to
be
successfulbusinessmen
thank
you
say
buffett
charlie
do
you
have
any
thought
on
that
this
puntingto
munger
no
quick
comeback
or
pithy
comment
be
a
measure
of
buffett
s
complete
discomfiture
however
it
also
put
munger
on
the
spot
since
anythinghe
say
might
imply
that
he
have
some
influence
on
how
buffett
chose
his
board
he
have
none
whatsoever
so
munger
simply
say
i
think
we
should
go
on
to
the
next
item
another
motion
come
to
the
floor
tomstrobhar
on

international
one
of
the
organization
that
have
boycott
berkshire
hathaway
and
successfully
force
the
company
to
end
its
charitable
contribution
program
give
a
speech
about
abortion
that
be
as
he
later
write
ostensively
sic

as
a

berkshire
publish
a
list
of
its

buffett
merely
say
in

that
berkshire
hadn

make
any

the
motion
be

down
the

section
of
the

now
consume
half
an

instead
of
its

and
for
the
first

have
borne

vaguely

patiently

up
at
the

now
buffett
open
the

askingto
hear
from

number
one
as
the
question
begin
his
wheel
churn
on
the
issue
that
be
botheringhim
he
use
a
question
on
another
topic
as
an
opportunity
to
address
the
issue
of
his
family
as
board
member
his
wife
and
son
he
say
be
on
the
board
as
guardian
of
the

they
re
not
there
to
profit
themselves
it
be
a
remarkable
moment
for
the
first
time
he
have
to
defend
in
public
the
way
he
ran
his
company
afterward
however
nobody
else
ask
anythingrelated
to
this
topic
the
shareholder
of
berkshire
hathaway
be
content
with
thing
as
they
be
buffett
have
earn
the
license
to
run
his
company
any
way
he
damn
well
pleased
as
far
as
they

concerned
they
be
a
happy

they
ask
our

not

somebody
ask
buffett
about

the
issue
still
linger
i
think
it
be
bertrand

he
say
who
say
that
most

would
rather
die
than

many
do

hurt
not
help
munger
add
in
a
tart
voice
when
an
activist
make
an
idiotic
suggestion
like
the
one
that
havingwarren
on
the
board
of
the
coca
cola
company
be
counter
to
the

of
the

company
nutty
activity
do
not
help
the
cause
for
which
the
person
speaks
as
happen
every
year
someone
ask
what
buffett
be
doingwith
all
those
warehouse
of
silver
he
have
bought
a
few
year
ago
he
pause
for
a
minute
then
say
he
couldn
t
comment
munger
make
some
unintelligible
noise
in
the
background
and
the
shareholder
sat
down
unenlightened
in
fact
the
silver
have
be
sell
buffett
and
munger
start

and
people
go
downstairs
to
the
basement
exhibition

where
thirty
seven
berkshire

subsidiary
be

and
bought
out
all
the

in

the

sell

many
people
bought

take
themback
to
the

where
they
sat
listeningto
buffett
and
bingeingon
sweet
in
the
course
of
answeringthe
many
repetitious
question
he
be
ask
in
between
the
new
and
insightful
one
buffett
manage
to
work
many
of
the
item
he
want
to
discus
into
his
response
this
year
he
use
the
meetingto
expound
on
his
why
i
mdown
on
the
dollar
theme
the
u
s
he
say
be
like
a
family
that
spent
more
than
it
earn
american
be
buyinghuge
amount
of
product
fromother
country
and
didn
t
have
the
income
to
pay
for
them
because
we
weren
t
sellingas
much
to
other
country
as
they
be
sellingto
us
to
make
up
the
difference
we
be
borrowingmoney
those
who
be
lendingit
to
us
might
be
less
willingto
do
so
in
the
future
now
buffett
say
we
be
spendingmore
than
two
percent
of
allour
income
just
to
pay
the
interest
on
our
national
debt
and
that
meant
the
situation
would
be
hard
to
turn
around
most
likely
he
thought
at
some
point
foreign
investor
would
decide
they
like
our
realestate
and
business
and
other
real
asset
well
than
our
paper
bond
we
would
start
sellingoff
piece
of
america
like
office
building
and
company
we
think
that
over
time
the
u
s
dollar
be
likely
to
decline
in
value
against
some
of
the
major
currency
he
say
therefore
the
economy
which
have
be
pretty
wonderful
over
the
past
twenty
year
with
both
low
interest
rate
and
low
inflation
could
at
some
point
reverse
interest
rate
probably
would
be
high
as
would
inflation
which
would
be
an
unhappy
situation
as
always
when
he
make
prediction
he
couldn
t
say
when
in
the
meantime
however
he
have
bought
billion
of
foreign
currency
to
hedge
berkshire
s
dollar
risk

buffett

munger

buffett
have
see
the
earlier

and
knew
the

involve
peter
on

with
a

a
special
theater
shape
like
a

laser

and
native
american
singer
and
dancer
warren
always
give
student
advice
to
pursue
their
passion
but
the
example
of
passion
he
use
like
become
backgammon
champion
of
the
world
be
competitive
at
their
core
someone
driven
by
an
inner
fire
of
artistry
irrespective
of
the
world
s
reward
be
simply
off
the
map
of
his
reality
that
be
susie
s
territory
the
realmof
spirit
and
souland
heart
of
the
poet
in
her
lonely
room
of
the
painter
strivingfor
self
expression
on
canvas
for
year
with
no
public
recognition
of
his
work
nonetheless
his
own
passion
and
patience
and
creativity
as
he
work
with
capitalresembled
peter
s
passion
and
patience
and
artistic
vision
with
music
thus
buffett
s
genuine
wish
for
peter
s
success
found
its
expression
in
the
best
and
only
way
he
knew
in
the
marriage
between
art
and
commerce
the
show
s
potential
for
commercial
success
preoccupy
him
i
ve
see
it
several
time
and
i
ve
see
different
iteration
of
it
almost
every
time
it
get
enthusiastic
response
but
what
i
don
t
know
be
just
how
big
the
market
be
it
s
not
like
a
broadway
musical
in
term
of
the
depth
of
the
market
so
we
will
find
out
the
buffett
name
have
work
heavily
against
peter
when
it
come
to
raisingmoney
because
people
assume
that
he
have
easy
access
to
unlimited
fund
people
do
not
take
himseriously
about
not
havingmoney
untilhe
actually
mortgage
his
house
to
fund
the
show
warren
typically
offer
to
pay
the
last
ten
percent
of
the
cost
if
peter
could
raise
the
rest
when
he
have
raise
two
million
of
the
total
his
father
go
ahead
and
give
him
of
the
he
have
promise
peter
then
raise
the
rest
of
the
money
himself
much
of
it
through
a
grant
fromthe
rudolph
steiner
foundation
from
start
to
finish
he
struggle
against
heavy
odds
to
raise
fund
while
tryingto
stage
and
produce
the
show
at
the
same
time
his
parent
duringthe
same
month
waive
their
no
donation
rule
and
write
a
million
check
to
tommurphy
s
save
the
child
as
a
gesture
of
friendship
and
support
it
seem
a
little
chilly
even
in
the
name
of
cultivatingself
reliance
to
support
their
son
s
cause
with
only
two
percent
of
what
they
give
a
family
friend
with
hindsight
however
peter
be
grateful
that
his
show
do
not
become
a
vanity
project
fund

they

a
topic
he
now
cover
every

buffett
write
long
ago
mark
twain
say
a
man
who
try
to
carry
a
cat
home
by
its
tail
will
learn
a
lesson
that
can
be
learn
in
no
other
way
i
dwell
on
our
experience
in
derivative
each
year
for
two
reason
one
be
personal
and
unpleasant
both
charlie
and
i
knew
at
the
time
of
the
gen
re
purchase
that
it
be
a
problem
and
told
its
management
that
we
want
to
exit
the
business
it
be
my
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
happen
rather
than
address
the
situation
head
on
however
i
waste
several
year
while
we
attempt
to
sell
the
operation
that
be
a
doom
endeavor
because
no
realistic
solution
could
have
extract
us
from
the
maze
of
liability
that
be
go
to
exist
for
decade
our
obligation
be
particularly
worrisome
because
their
potential
to
explode
could
not
be
measure
moreover
if
severe
trouble
occur
we
knew
it
be
likely
to
correlate
with
problem
elsewhere
in
financial
market
so
i
fail
in
my
attempt
to
exit
painlessly
and
in
the
meantime
more
trade
be
put
on
the

buffett

referringto
a
period
duringwhich
he
have
hire
a
new
manager
and
briefly
allow
himto
expand

some
of

whether

in

operation
the
time
to
act
be
now
the
second
reason
i
regularly
describe
our
problem
in
this
area
lie
in
the
hope
that
our
experience
may
prove
instructive
for
manager
auditor
and
regulator
in
a
sense
we
be
a
canary
in

up
with
nothing

a

the
main
risk
and
part
of
why
the

be
north

and
north

be
a

korea
the
whole

all

the
consequence
be
almost
unimaginable
north
korea
be
very
close
to
have
nuclear
weapon
i
regard
it
as
one
of
the
world
s
most
dangerous
country
but
i
would
make
the
bet
that
the
rest
of
the

include
china
and
japan
be
simply
not
go

let
the

that
north

make

you
have

a

do
very
well
for
several

some
of
them
may
not

as
a
group
they
should
do
very
well
i
could
end
up
own
them
for
several
year
he

a

that

the
most
rationaland
best
execute
of
any
foundation
policy
he
have
ever
see
and
he
like
that
they
didn
t
want
publicity
for
their

do
not

their

an

about

he
make
this
startlingannouncement
and
some
people
have
qualm
about
the

initially
because
it
be
such
an
abrupt
change
fromwhat
they
have

to
give

even
a

intelligently
thought
it
be
a
brilliant
decision
on
june
buffett
announce
that
he
would
give
away
eighty
five
percent
of

he
be
requiringthat
the

be

as
it
be

so
that
the

could
not

bar
a
touchstone
for
others
that
warren
buffett
have
do
this
be
both
surprisingand
predictable
an
unconventional
thinker
and
problem
solver
he
be
makinga
gesture
against
philanthropic
waste
and
grandiosity
the
gate
foundation
get
its
money
but
have
to
spend
each
installment
and
fast
the
decision
be
unusual
highly
personal
a
form
of
teachingby
example
and
naturally
enormously
attention
get
meanwhile
in
another
sense
this
be
a
classic
buffett
no
lose
deal
he
have
stun
the
world
by
givingaway
almost
all
of
his
money
by
earmarkingit
yet
get
to
keep
most
of
it
until
he
actually
transfer
the
share
nonetheless
in
one
stroke
he
have
transform
a
lifetime
of
graspingat
money
by
committingto
lettinggo
and
have
start
to
disburse
it
by
the
billion
the
boy
who
would
not
let
his
family
touch
the
chifforobe
where
he
kept
his
hoard
coin
have
finally
become
a
man
who
could
entrust
his
ten
of
billion
to
someone
else
s
hand
in
the
announcement
speech
buffett
say
just
over
fifty
year
ago
last
month
i
sat
down
with
seven
people
who
give
me
one
hundred
and
five
thousand
dollar
to
manage
in
a
little
partnership
and
those
people
make
the
judgment
that
i
could
do
a
well
job
in
amass
wealth
for
them
than
they
could
do
themselves
fifty
year
after
that
i
sat
down
and
thought
about
who
could
do
a
well
job
dispense
the
wealth
than
myself
it
s
really
quite
logical
people
don
t
often
have
that
second
sit
down
they
be
always
say
who
should
handle
my
money
and
they
quite
willingly
turn
their
money
over
to
people
with
a
certain
expertise
but
they
don
t
seem
to
think
about
do
that
very
often
in
the
philanthropic
world
they
pick
their
old
business
crony
or
whomever
to
administer
wealth
after
they
re
go
at
a
time
when
they
won
t
even
be
able
to
observe
what
s
happen
so
i
get
very
lucky
because
philanthropy
be
harder
than
business
you
be
tackle
important
problem
that
people
with
intellect
and
money
have
tackle
in
the
past
and
have
a
tough
time
solve
so
the
search
for
talent
in
philanthropy
should
be
even
more
important
than
the
search
for
talent
in
investment
where
the
game
be
not
as
tough
buffett
then
spoke
of
the
ovarian
lottery
i
have
be
very
lucky
i
be
born
in
the
united
state
in
and
won
the
lottery
the
day
i
be
born
i
have
terrific
parent
a
good
education
and
i
be
wire
in
a
way
that
paid
off
disproportionately
in
this
particular
society
if
i
have
be
born
long
ago
or
in
some
other
country
my
particular
wiring
would
not
have
paid
off
the
way
it
have
but
in
a
market
system
where
capital
allocation
wiring
be
important
it
pay
off
like
no
other
place
all
along
i
ve
felt
the
money
be
just
claim
check
that
should
go
back
to
society
i
be
not
an
enthusiast

it
be
a
simple

the

follow
a
basic
creed
that

by
the
belief
that

this
be
in
no

to
all
that
capital
the
question
of
either
a

or
a
huge

would
arise
instantly
when
he
be
go
his
successor

to

of

candidate

that
wasn

the

what
for

there

the

he
could

pretty
close

they
don

to
spread
to
what
they
would
regard
as
otherwise
sound
institution
if
bear
fails
and
two
minute
later
people
worry
that
lehman
fails
and
two
minute
after
that
they
worry
that
merrill
will
fail
and
it
spread
from
there
the
rationalbuffett
try
to
unlock
the
puzzle
embed
in
the
risky
choice
facingthe
federal

it
have
no
really
good
option
either
it
allow
a
financial
meltdown
or
it
take
action
that
would
promote
inflation
by
addingto
downward
pressure
on
the
dollar
it
could
all
end
on
a
dime
if
they
flood
the
system
with
enough
liquidity
but
there
be
consequence
to
do
that
if
dramatic
enough
the
consequence
would
be
the
immediate
expectation
of
huge
inflation
a
lot
of
thing
would
happen
that
you
might
not
like
the

definitely
tank
it
s
not
my
game

if
i
have
to
bet
one
way
or
another
everybody
else
say
a
recession
will
be
short
and
shallow
but
i
would
say
long
and
deep
you
absolutely
never
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
tomorrow
morning
you
have
to
depend
on
the
kindness
of
stranger
in
the
financial
world
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
think
about
that
i
never
want
to
have
to
come
up
with
a
billion
dollar
tomorrow
morning
well
a
billion
i
could
but
any
significant
amount
because
you
just
cannot
be
sure
of
anything
you
have
to
think
about
thing
that
have
never
happen
before

always

plenty

the

toil
much
as
they
have
year
earlier
on

this
time
however
it
be
with
the
almost
certain
knowledge
that
the

failure
would
have
catastrophic
consequence
to
the

system
whether

just
before

not

in

nearly
sixty

there

people
who
say
that
the
rule
have

it
only
look
that
way
he

if

there

in

everyone

the

be
perfectly
good
there
be
no
reason
why
it

we
bid
and
we
may
get
one
while
concurrently
someone
else
buy
exactly
the

issue
at
if
you
d
told
me
ten
week
ago
i
d
be
do
this
i
d
have
say
that
s
about
as
likely
as
me
become
a
male
stripper
we
ve
put
billion
into
this
stuff
it
s
the
most
dramatic
thing
i
ve
see
in
my
life
if
this
be
an
efficient
market
dictionary
will
have
to
redefine
efficient
who
would
think
that
tax
exempt
money
market
fund
could
become
cigar
butt
but
the
most
immediate
and
doable
opportunity
be
weird
thing
in
the
credit
market
and
the
big
opportunity
be
in
mortgage
but
i
don
t
understand
them
well
enough
although
i
m
learn
them
so
that
i
can
understand
them
and
if
i
think
i
ve
get
enough
margin
of
safety
i
ll
do
it
but
the
average
person
should
not
do
it
no
stock
be
the
thing
to
own
over
time
productivity
will
increase
and
stock
will
increase
with
it
there
be
only
a
few
thing
you
can
do
wrong
one
be
to
buy
or
sell
at
the
wrong
time
pay
high
fee
be
the
other
way
to
get
kill
the
best
way
to
avoid
both
of
these
be
to
buy
a
low
cost
index
fund
and
buy
it
over
time
be
greedy
when
others
be
fearful
and
fearful
when
others
be
greedy
but
don
t
think
you
can
outsmart
the
market
if
a
cross
section
of
american
industry
be
go
to
do
well
over
time
then
why
try
to
pick
the
little
beauty
and
think
you
can
do
well
very
few
people
should
be
active
investor
if
there
be
any
lesson
the
life
of
warren
buffett
have
show
it
be
the
truth
of
that

tree
don
t
grow
to
the
sky
but
buffett
felt
he
could
help
new
sapling
take
root
he
never
lose
his
focus
on
business
but
as
he
contemplate
the
idealway
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
once
again
he
be
rouse
by
the
urge
to
preach
for
some
time
he
have
be
givingtalks
to
college
student
around
the
united
state
travel
to
their
school
welcomingthemto
omaha
he
like
talkingto
student
because
they
be
not
harden
in
their
habit
stillyoungenough
to
take
fulladvantage
of
what
he
say
i
packed
my
little
snowball
very
early
and
if
i
have
packed
it
ten
year
later
it
would
have
be
way
different
than
where
it
stand
on
the
hill
right
now
so
i
recommend
to
student
that
if
you
start
out
a
little
ahead
of
the
game
it
doesn
t
have
to
be
a
lot
but
it
s
so
much
well
than
start
out
behind
the
game
and
credit
card
really
get
you
behind
the
game
as
early
as
feelinga
sense
of
urgency
he
have
begin
to
pick
up

that

that
he

possess
by

deliberately

he

harsh
he

word
to

that
he
didn
t
consider
her
his
granddaughter
and
if

would

so
nicole
told
oprah
it
s
a
weird
thingto
be
workingfor
a
very
wealthy
family
consideringi
do
come
fromone
of
the
wealthy
family
in
america
she
say
she
be
at
peace
with
not

apparently
a
reference
to
the
smallamounts
that
susie
have
left
her
grandchild
but
add
i
do
feelthat
it
would
be
nice
to
be
involve
with
create
thing
for
others
with
that
money
and
to

involve
in
it
i
feelcompletely
exclude
from
it
the
poor
little
me
aspect
of
her
interview
be
her
second
mistake
afterward
she
sent
buffett
a
letter
askingwhy
he
have
disavowed
her
in
august
he
write
back
offeringher
good
wish
told
her
that
she
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
accomplishment
and
give
her
some
worthwhile
advice
positioningherself
with
people
as
a
member
of
the
buffett
family
be
a
mistake
he
write
if
you
do
so
it
will
become
your
primary
identity
with
them
people
will
react
to
you
base
on
that
fact
rather
than
to
who
you
be
or
what
you
have
accomplish
he
also
write
i
have
not
legally
or
emotionally
adopt
you
as
a
grandchild
nor
have
the
rest
of
my
family
adopt
you
as
a
niece
or
cousin
it
be
simply
a
fact
that
just
as
your
mother
be
in
no
respect
my
daughter
in
law
her
child
be
not
my
grandchild
despite
the
control
tone
of
the
letter
nicole
have
wound
him
in
his
most
tender
spot
his
identity
and
that
of
his
family
otherwise
he
might
have
thought
twice
about
sendingthe
letter
which
backfire
badly
on
him
nicole
may
have
be
wrong
but
she
seem
sincere
instead
of
reiningher
in
the
rejection
letter
set
her
off
on
another
round
