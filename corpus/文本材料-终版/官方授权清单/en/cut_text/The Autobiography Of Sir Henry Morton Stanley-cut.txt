introduction
to
the
autobiography
there
be
no
reason
now
for
withholding
the
history
of
my
early
year
nothing
to
prevent
my
state
every
fact
about
myself
i
be
now
decline
in
vitality
my
hard
life
in
africa
many
fever
many
privation
much
physical
and
mental
suffer
bring
me
close
to
the
period
of
infirmity
my
prospect
now
cannot
be
blast
by
gibe
nor
advancement
thwart
by
prejudice
i
stand
in
no
man
way
therefore
without
fear
of
consequence
or
danger
to
my
pride
and
reserve
i
can
lay
bare
all
circumstance
which
have
attend
me
from
the
dawn
of
consciousness
to
this
present
period
of
indifference
i
may
tell
how
i
come
into
existence
and
how
that
existence
be
mould
by
contact
with
others
how
my
nature
developed
under
vary
influence
and
what
after
life
severe
test
be
the
final
outcome
of
it
i
may
tell
how
from
the
soft
tender
atom
in
the
cradle
i
become
a
football
to
chance
till
i
grow
in
hardihood
and
learn
how
to
repel
kick
how
i
be
taught
to
observe
the
mood
and
humour
of
that
large
mass
of
human
being
who
flit
by
me
as
i
have
be
in
the
habit
of
confine
myself
to
myself
my
reserve
have
be
repugnant
to
gossip
in
every
shape
or
form
and
i
have
ever
be
the
least
likely
person
to
hear
anything
evil
of
others
because
when
the
weakness
or
eccentricity
of
a
casual
acquaintance
happen
to
be
a
topic
i
have
make
it
a
principle
to
modify
if
i
could
not
change
it
in
this
book
i
be
not
translate
from
a
diary
nor
be
it
the
harvest
of
a
journal
but
it
consists
of
backward
glance
at
my
own
life
as
memory
unrolls
the
past
to
me
my
inclination
as
a
young
man
be
always
to
find
congenial
soul
to
whom
i
could
attach
myself
in
friendship
not
cling
to
for
support
friend
on
whom
i
could
thoroughly
rely
and
to
whom
i
could
trustfully
turn
for
sympathy
and
the
exchange
of
thought
but
unfortunately
those
to
whom
in
my
trust
f
ul
age
i
venture
to
consign
the
secret
hope
and
interest
of
my
heart
invariably
betrayed
me
in
some
bitter
mood
i
have
thought
that
the
sweetest
part
of
the
bible
be
wholly
inapplicable
to
actual
humanity
for
no
power
it
appear
to
me
could
ever
transform
grown
up
human
bdngs
so
as
to
be
worthy
of
heavenly
blessing
little
child
love
one
another
say
divine
st
john
ah
yes
while
we
be
child
we
be
capable
of
love
our
love
be
as
that
of
angel
and
we
be
not
far
below
them
in
purity
despite
our
trivial
error
and
fantasy
for
however
we
err
we
still
can
love
but
when
i
emerge
from
childhood
and
learn
by
experience
that
there
be
no
love
for
me
bom
so
to
say
fatiherless
spume
and
disown
by
my
mother
beaten
almost
to
death
by
my
teacher
and
guardian
fed
on
the
bread
of
bitterness
how
be
i
to
believe
in
love
i
be
met
by
hate
in
all
its
degree
and
not
i
alone
look
into
the
hall
of
legislation
of
religious
community
of
justice
look
into
the
press
any
market
place
meeting
house
or
walk
of
life
and
answer
the
question
as
to
your
own
soul
where
shall
i
find
love
see
what
a
change
forty
year
have
wrought
in
me
when
a
child
i
love
him
who
so
much
as
smile
at
me
the
partner
of
my
little
bed
my
play
fellow
the
stranger
boy
who
visit
me
nay
as
a
flower
attracts
the
bee
it
only
need
the
glance
of
a
human
face
to
begin
regard
it
with
love
mere
increase
of
year
have
change
all
that
never
can
i
recall
that
state
of
innocence
any
more
than
i
can
rekindle
the
celestial
spark
for
it
be
extinguish
with
the
expansion
of
intellect
and
by
my
experience
of
mankind
while
my
heart
it
may
be
be
as
tender
as
ever
to
the
right
person
it
be
subject
to
my
intellect
which
have
become
so
fastidious
and
nice
in
its
choice
that
only
one
in
a
million
be
pronounce
worthy
of
it
no
doubt
there
will
be
much
self
betrayal
in
these
page
and
he
who
can
read
between
the
line
as
a
physiognomist
would
read
character
will
not
find
it
difficult
to
read
me
but
then
this
be
the
purpose
of
an
autobiography
and
all
will
agree
that
it
must
be
much
more
authentic
than
any
record
make
of
me
by
another
man
indeed
i
wish
to
appear
without
disguise
as
regard
manner
and
opinion
habit
and
characteristic
if
a
nation
can
be
say
to
be
happy
which
have
no
history
that
man
be
also
happy
whose
uneventful
life
have
not
brought
him
into
prominence
and
who
have
nothing
to
record
but
the
passing
of
year
between
the
cradle
and
the
grave
but
i
be
not
sent
into
the
world
to
be
happy
nor
to
search
for
happiness
i
be
sent
for
a
special
work
now
from
innocent
boyhood
and
trustful
youth
i
have
advanced
to
some
height
whence
i
can
look
down
pityingly
as
a
father
i
can
look
down
upon
that
young
man
myself
with
a
chasten
pride
he
have
do
well
he
might
have
do
well
but
his
life
have
be
a
fulfilment
since
he
have
finish
the
work
he
be
sent
to
do
amen
part
i
autobiography
through
the
world
the
autobiography
of
sir
henry
morton
stanley
chapter
i
the
workhouse
it
be
say
that
one
of
the
patrician
mostjois
of
north
wale
posse
a
write
pedigree
forty
foot
long
to
prove
the
claim
of
his
family
to
a
direct
descent
from
adam
though
no
doubt
much
of
this
extraordinary
genealogy
be
fabulous
it
allows
all
of
us
plebeian
a
reasonable
hope
to
believe
that
we
be
also
descend
from
that
venerate
ancestor
of
our
common
humanity
the
time
have
be
when
patrician
family
fondly
believe
their
first
progenitor
have
come
direct
from
heaven
and
we
baser
creature
have
to
be
content
with
an
earthly
sire
i
can
prove
as
ancient
a
descent
for
myself
though
the
name
of
my
intermediate
progenitor
between
adam
and
my
grandfather
moses
and
john
have
not
be
preserve
my
family
belong
to
a
class
always
strangely
indifferent
to
write
pedigree
which
rely
more
on
oral
tradition
the
preserve
of
which
have
be
mostly
the
duty
of
female
on
account
of
their
superior
fluency
of
speech
and
their
disposition
to
cling
to
their
family
hearth
my
early
pain
be
cause
by
the
endless
rehearsal
of
family
history
to
which
my
nurse
be
addict
for
soon
after
sunset
each
even
she
would
insist
on
take
me
before
some
neighbour
fire
where
i
would
meet
about
a
dozen
dame
from
the
castle
row
prepared
to
indulge
in
their
usual
entertainment
of
recitation
from
their
stock
of
unwritten
folklore
after
a
ceremonious
greet
and
kindly
interchange
of
civil
enquiry
about
each
other
health
and
affair
they
would
soon
drift
into
more
serious
matter
i
have
a
vague
idea
that
much
of
it
border
on
the
uncanny
and
awful
but
i
retain
a
strong
impression
that
most
of
their
conversation
related
to
the
past
and
present
of
their
respective
family
courtship
marriage
and
death
be
prime
event
i
also
remember
that
there
be
many
long
pause
during
which
i
could
hear
a
chorus
of
sympathetic
sigh
the
episode
which
drew
these
from
their
affectionate
breast
be
quite
forgotten
but
those
sigh
haunt
me
still
such
family
as
be
cluster
in
front
of
the
green
of
denbigh
castle
be
an
exceedingly
primitive
folk
with
far
less
regard
for
ancient
ancestry
than
the
bedouin
of
the
desert
indeed
i
doubt
whether
any
tradesman
or
farmer
in
our
part
could
say
who
be
his
great
great
grandfather
or
whether
one
yeoman
out
of
a
hundred
could
tell
who
be
his
ancestor
of
two
hundred
year
back
as
king
cazembe
say
to
livingstone
the
seeker
of
river
we
let
the
stream
run
on
and
do
not
enquire
whence
they
rise
or
whither
they
flow
so
these
simple
welsh
people
would
answer
if
question
about
their
ancestor
we
be
bom
and
die
and
beyond
that
none
of
us
care
who
be
before
us
or
who
shall
come
after
us
my
personal
recollection
do
not
extend
beyond
the
time
i
lay
in
the
cradle
so
that
all
that
precedes
this
period
i
have
be
oblige
to
take
upon
trust
mind
and
body
have
grown
together
and
both
will
decay
accord
to
the
task
or
burden
impose
on
them
but
strange
half
form
idea
glide
vaguely
into
the
mind
sometimes
and
then
i
seem
not
far
from
a
tangible
and
intelligent
view
into
a
distant
age
sometimes
the
turn
of
a
phrase
a
sentence
in
a
book
the
first
faint
outline
of
a
scene
a
face
like
yet
unlike
one
whom
i
knew
an
incident
will
send
my
mind
search
swiftly
down
the
long
reach
aisle
extend
far
into
remote
pre
personal
period
try
to
discover
the
connection
to
forge
again
the
long
broken
link
or
to
re
knit
the
sever
strand
my
father
i
never
knew
i
be
in
my
teen
before
i
learn
that
he
have
die
within
a
few
week
after
my
birth
up
to
a
certain
date
in
the
early
forty
all
be
profound
darkness
to
me
then
as
i
woke
from
sleep
one
day
a
brief
period
of
consciousness
suddenly
dawn
upon
my
faculty
there
be
an
indefinable
murmur
about
me
some
unintelligible
view
float
before
my
sens
light
flash
upon
the
spirit
and
i
enter
into
be
at
what
age
i
first
receive
these
dim
but
indelible
impression
i
cannot
guess
it
must
have
be
in
helpless


infancy
for
i
seem
to
have
pass
subsequently
through
a
long
age
of
dream
wherein
countless
vague
experience
emotion
and
act
occur
which
though
indefinable
left
shadowy
trace
on
my
memory
during
such
a
mechanical
stage
of
existence
it
be
not
possible
for
me
to
distinguish
between
dream
and
reality
i
fancy
i
see
a
white
ceiling
and
square
joist
with
meat
hook
attach
to
them
a
round
pink
human
face
the
frill
of
a
cap
a
bit
of
bright
ribbon
but
before
i
be
able
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
what
i
see
i
have
lapse
into
unconsciousness
again
after
an
immeasurable
time
the
faculty
seem
to
be
re
awaken
and
i
can
distinguish
tone
and
be
aware
that
i
can
see
hear
and
feel
and
that
i
be
in
my
cradle
it
be
close
by
a
wooden
staircase
and
my
eye
follow
its
length
up
and
then
down
i
catch
sight
of
a
house
fly
and
then
another
and
their
buzz
and
movement
become
absorb
presently
a
woman
advance
bend
over
me
a
moment
then
lift
me
up
in
her
arm
and
from
a
great
height
i
survey
my
world
there
be
a
settle
of
dark
wood
a
bit
of
carve
at
the
end
of
it
there
be
a
black
shiny
chimney
a
red
coal
fire
with
one
splutter
jet
of
flame
and
wave
soot
flake
there
be
a
hiss
black
kettle
and
a
thread
of
vapour
from
the
nozzle
a
bright
copper
bed
warmer
suspend
to
the
wall
a
display
of
colour
plate
mainly
blue
with
chinese
picture
on
them
arrange
over
a
polished
dresser
there
be
an
uneven
flagstone
floor
a
window
with
diamond
pane
set
in
lead
a
burnish
white
table
with
two
deep
drawer
in
it
a
curious
old
clock
with
intensely
red
flower
above
and
chain
and
weight
below
it
and
lastly
i
see
a
door
cut
into
two
half
the
upper
one
be
wide
open
through
which
i
gain
my
first
view
of
sky
and
space
this
last
be
a
sight
worth
see
and
i
open
my
eye
roundly
to
take
stock
of
this
pearly
space
and
its
drift
fleece
as
see
through
the
door
and
my
attention
be
divide
between
the
sky
and
the
tick
tack
of
the
clock
while
force
to
speculate
what
the
white
day
and
the
pearly
void
mean
there
follow
a
transition
into
another
state
of
conscious
be
wherein
i
appear
to
have
wing
and
to
be
soar
up
to
the
roof
of
a
great
hall
and
sail
from
comer
to
comer
like
a
hum
bee
on
a
tour
of
exploration
and
the
roof
pre
sently
be
remove
i
launch
out
with
wing
outspread
joyous
and
free
until
i
lose
myself
in
the
unknowable
to
emerge
sometime
after
in
my
own
cradle
nest
at
the
foot
of
the
wooden
stair
and
thus
for
an
unknown
stretch
of
time
i
endure
my
day
without
apparent
object
but
quietly
observant
and
an
inarticulate
witness
of
a
multitude
of
small
event
and
thus
i
wait
and
watch
and
dream
surrender
myself
to
my
state
undisturbed
unaffected
unresisting
borne
along
by
time
until
i
could
stand
and
take
a
large
and
more
deliberate
survey
of
the
strange
thing
do
around
me
in
process
of
time
however
my
tongue
learns
to
form
word
and
to
enter
upon
its
duty
and
it
be
not
long
before
intelligence
begin
to
peep
out
and
to
retain
durably
the
sense
of
existence
one
of
the
first
thing
i
remember
be
to
have
be
gravely
told
that
i
have
come
from
london
in
a
band
box
and
to
have
be
assure
that
all
baby
come
from
the
same
place
it
satisfied
my
curiosity
for
several
year
as
to
the
cause
of
my
come
but
later
i
be
inform
that
my
mother
have
hasten
to
her
parent
from
london
to
be
deliver
of
me
and
that
after
recovery
she
have
go
back
to
the
metropolis
leave
me
in
the
charge
of
my
grandfather
moses
parry
who
live
within
the
precinct
of
denbigh
castle
forty
year
of
my
life
have
pass
and
this
delve
into
my
early
year
appear
to
me
like
an
exhumation
of
pompeii
bury
for
century
under
the
scoria
lava
and
volcanic
dust
of
vesuvius
to
the
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
pace
the
recover
street
and
byeways
of
pompeii
how
strange
seem
the
relic
of
the
far
distant
life
just
so
appear
to
me
the
little
fatherless
babe
and
the
orphan
child
up
to
a
certain
time
i
could
remember
well
every
incident
connect
with
those
day
but
now
i
look
at
the
child
with
wonder
and
can
scarcely
credit
that
out
of
that
child
i
grow
how
quaint
that
bib
and
tucker
that
short
frock
the
fat
leg
the
dimple
cheek
the
clear
bright
grey
eye
the
gap
wonderment
at
the
sight
of
a
stranger
and
i
have
to
brush
by
the
stupefy
memory
of
a
lifetime
when
i
attempt
to
arrest
one
of
the
fleeting
view
of
these
early
stage
of
my
life
the
foremost
image
which
present
itself
be
that
of
my
grandfather
house
a
white
wash
cottage
situate
at
the
extreme
left
of
the
castle
with
a
long
garden
at
the
back
at
the
far
end
of
which
be
the
slaughterhouse
where
my
uncle
moses
pole
axed
calf
and
prepared
their
carcass
for
tnb
market
and
the
next
be
of
myself
in
bib
and
tucker
between
grandfather
knee
have
my
finger
guide
as
i
trace
the
alphabet
letter
on
a
slate
i
seem
to
hear
even
yet
the
encourage
word
of
the
old
man
thou
wilt
be
a
man
yet
before
thy
mother
my
man
of
men
it
be
then
i
believe
that
i
first
felt
what
it
be
to
be
vain
i
be
proud
to
believe
that
though
woman
might
be
taller
strong
and
old
than
i
there
lay
a
future
before
me
that
the
most
powerful
woman
could
never
hope
to
win
it
be
then
also
i
gather
that
a
child
first
duty
be
to
make
haste
to
be
a
man
in
order
that
i
might
attain
that
high
human
dignity
my
grandfather
appear
to
me
as
a
stout
old
gentleman
clad
in
corduroy
breech
dark
stocking
and
long
melton
coat
with
a
clean
shaven
face
rather
round
and
lit
up
by
humorous
grey
eye
he
and
i
occupy
the
top
floor
which
have
an
independent
entrance
from
the
garden
the
low
room
be
inhabit
by
my
uncle
moses
and
thomas
by
and
bye
there
come
a
change
my
strong
one
arm
uncle
moses
married
a
woman
name
kitty
a
flaxen
haired
fair
girl
of
a
decide
temper
and
after
that
event
we
seldom
descend
to
the
low
apartment
i
have
a
vivid
remembrance
of
sunday
evening
at
a
wes
leyan
chapel
on
account
of
the
torture
which
i
endure
the
large
galleried
building
crowd
with
fervid
worshipper
and
the
deep
murmur
of
amen
the
pious
ejaculation
be
well
remember
as
well
as
the
warm
atmosphere
and
curious
scent
of
lavender
which
soon
cause
an
unconquerable
drowsiness
in
me
within
a
short
time
my
head
begin
to
nod
heavily
to
the
great
danger
of
my
neck
and
the
resolute
effort
i
make
to
overcome
this
sleepiness
to
avoid
the
reproach
of
my
grandfather
who
affected
to
be
shock
at
my
extraordinary
behaviour
cause
the
conflict
with
nature
to
be
so
painful
that
it
have
be
impossible
for
me
to
forget
the
chapel
and
its
scene
after
passing
my
fourth
year
there
come
an
afternoon
when
to
my
dismay
and
fright
a
pitcher
with
which
i
be
sent
for
water
fell
from
my
hand
and
be
broken
my
grandfather
come
to
the
garden
door
on
hearing
the
crash
and
view
what
have
happen
ufted
his
forefinger
menacingly
and
say
very
well
shonin
my
lad
when
i
return

shalt
have
a
sound
whip

naughty
boy

a
tragedy
however
intervene
to
prevent
this
punishment

appear
that
he
be
in
a
hurry
to
attend
to
some
work
in
a
field
that
day
and
while
there
fell
down
dead
the
neighbour
announce
that
he
have
die
through
the
visitation
of
god
which
be
their
usual
way
of
explain
any
sudden
fatality

this
kind

after

his
wife
jenny
a
stout
and
buxom
old
lady
be
remember
by
me
mostly
for
her
association
with
pea
pudding
for
which
i
have
a
special
aversion
and
for
her
resolute
insistence
that
whether
i
like
it
or
not
i
should
eat
it
other
memory
of
this
period
be
also
unforgettable
for
the
pain
connect
with
them
such
as
the
soap
lather
in
my
saturday
even
tub
and
the
nightly
visit
of
sarah
price
the
daughter
of
the
house
to
her
friend
at
castle
row
where
she
would
gossip
to
such
a
late
hour
that
i
always
suffer
from
intolerable
fidget
mother
of
the
present
day
will
understand
how
hard
it
be
for
a
child
of
four
or
five
year
old
to
remain
awake
long
after
sunset
and
that
it
be
cruel
ignorance
on
the
part
of
sarah
to
keep
me
up
until
ten
o
clock
every
night
to
listen
to
her
prosy
story
of
ghost
and
graf
sarah
description
of
a
devil
a
curious
creature
with
horn
on
his
head
with
hoofed
foot
and
a
long
tail
be
wont
to
make
me
shiver
with
fright
she
be
equally
graphic
and
minute
in
her
description
of
witch
ghost
fairy
giant
and
dwarf
kidnapper
and
hobgoblin
bugaboo
and
other
terrific
monster
against
whose
extraordinary
power
it
behove
me
to
be
always
on
guard
the
dark
night
be
especially
haunt
by
them
and
the
ingle
nook
by
a
bright
fire
be
then
the
safest
place
for
child
if
the
grown
folk
have
not
all
share
sarah
belief
in
these
gruesome
creature
i
might
perhaps
have
doubt
they
exist
but
i
remember
to
have
see
them
huddle
closer
to
the
fire
look
warily
over
their
shoulder
at
the
shadow
as
though
they
lay
in
wait
for
a
casual
bit
of
darkness
to
pounce
upon
them
and
carry
them
off
to
the
ghostly
limbo
have
sarah
but
know
how
pain
impress
the
memory
of
a
child
it
be
probable
that
she
would
have
put
me
to
bed
rather
than
have
take
me
with
her
as
a
witness
of
her
folly
and
ignorant
credulity
she
believe
herself
to
be
very
level
head
and
indeed
by
her
acquaintance
she
be
esteem
as
a
sensible
and
clever
woman
but
as
she
infect
me
with
many
silly
fear
i
be
now
inclined
to
believe
that
both
she
and
her
neighbour
be
sadly
deficient
in
common
sense
one
effect
of
these
interminable
ghost
story
be
visible
one
even
when
i
go
to
fetch
some
water
from
the
castle
well
it
appear
to
me
that
i
saw
on
this
occasion
a
tall
black
spectre
stand
astride
of
the
castle
well
i
take
it
at
first
to
be
the
shadow
of
a
tree
but
trace
it
upward
i
saw
a
man
head
which
seem
to
reach
the
sky
i
gaze
at
it
a
short
time
unable
to
move
or
cry
out
then
the
phantom
seem
to
be
advance
upon
me
fear
put
wing
to
my
foot
and
i
turn
and
ran
scream
and
never
once
halt
until
i
have
found
a
safe
hiding
place
under
my
bed
the
dreadful
vision
of
that
ghost
haunt
me
for
year
and
for
a
long
time
i
make
it
a
rule
not
to
retire
until
i
have
look
under
the
bed
l
when
asleep
ghost
and
kidnapper
might
come
and
carry
me
off
the
belief
that
the
darkness
be
infest
by
evil
agency
and
ferocious
visitant
hostile
to
little
boy
i
owe
to
sarah
silly
garrulity
at
castle
row
i
be
under
tihie
impression
that
during
the
day
for
a
portion
of
this
period
i
be
sent
to
an
infant
school
where
there
be
a
terrible
old
lady
who
be
associate
in
my
mind
with
spectacle
and
a
birch
rod
but
i
have
no
particular
incident
connect
with
it
to
make
it
definite
richard
price
and
his
wife
jenny
seem
to
have
at
last
become
dismayed
at
my
increase
appetite
and
to
have
demand
a
high
rate
for
my
maintenance
as
both
my
uncle
have
in
the
mean
time
married
and
through
the
influ
ence
of
their
wife
decline
to
be
at
far
charge
for
me
the
old
couple
resolve
to
send
me
to
the
workhouse
consequently
dick
price
the
son
take
me
by
the
hand
one
day
saturday
february
th
and
imder
the
pretence
that
we
be
go
to
aunt
mary
at
fynnon
beuno
induced
me
to
accompany
him
on
a
long
journey
the
way
seem
interminable
and
tedious
but
he
do
his
best
to
relieve
my
fatigue
with
false
cajolings
and
treacherous
endearment
at
last
dick
set
me
down
from
his
shouldeib
before
an
immense
stone
building
and
passing
through
tall
iron
gate
he
pull
at
a
bell
which
i
could
hear
clang
noisily
in
the
distant
interior
a
sombre
face
stranger
appear
at
the
door
who
despite
my
remonstrance
seize
me
by
the
hand
and
drew
me
within
while
dick
try
to
sooth
my
fear
with
glib
promise
that
he
be
only
go
to
bring
aunt
mary
to
me
the
door
close
on
him
and
with
the
echo
sound
i
experienced
for
the
first
time
the
awful
feel
of
utter
desolateness
the
great
building
with
the
iron
gate
and
innumerable
window
into
which
i
have
be
so
treacherously
take
be
the
st
asaph
union
workhouse
it
be
an
institution
to
which
the
age
poor
and
superfluous
child
of
that
parish
be
take
to
relieve
the
respectability
of
the
obnoxious
sight
of
extreme
poverty
and
because
civilisation
know
no
well
method
of
dispose
of
the
infirm
and
helpless
than
by
imprison
them
within
its
wall
once
within
the
age
be
subject
to
stem
rule
and
useless
task
while
the
child

it
be
a
house
of

the

the
doom
of
such
be
that
they
shall
be
take
to
eke
out
the
rest
of
their
miserable
existence
within
the

preserve
that
austere
morality

which
these

that
the
piteous

in
which
uniform
garb
they
become
undistinguishable
and
excite
no

their
only
fault
be
that
they
have
become
old
or
so
enfeeble
by
toil
and
sickness
that
they
could
no

this
be
so
heinous

grave
in

another
time
they
incur
the
suspicion
of

either

burnt
but
in
the
reign
of
queen
victoria
the
dull
witted
nation
have
conceive
it
to
be
more
humane
to

brought
me

from

they

not

well
meant
no

i
then
learn
for
the
first
time
that
one
profess
friend
can
smile
while
prepare
to
deal
a
mortal
blow
and
that
a
man
can
mask
evil
with
a
show
of
goodness
it
would
have
be
far
well
for
me
if

than
i
have
employ
compulsion
instead

no
greek

as
the

of

of
james

though
a
tremendously
rough
and
reckless
striker
with
his
fist

such
blow

preferable
to

these

upon
how

us
with
if

more
at

a

until

where
he
remain
during
many
year

become
more
and
more
savage
and
at
last
it
be
discover
he
have
lose
lu
reasod
and
he
die
in
a
mad
house
i
s
wrath
and
wherein
lay
the
difference
between
the
two
name
he
grow
tire
at
last
and
lay
hold
of
a
new
birch
rod
he
order
me
to
unbreech
upon
which
i
turn
marble
white
and
for
a
moment
be
as
one
that
be
palsy
for
my
mind
be
struggle
between
astonishment
terror
and
doubt
as
to
whether
my
ear
have
heard
aright
and
why
i
be
chosen
to
be
the
victim
of
his
anger
this
hesitation
increase
his
wrath
and
while
i
be
still
inwardly
in
a
turmoil
he
advanced
upon
me
and
rudely
tore
down
my
nether
garment
and
administer
a
forceful
shower
of
blow
with
such
thrill
effect
that
i
be
bruise
and
bloody
all
over
and
could
not
stand
for
a
time
during
the
hour
that
follow
i
remain
as
much
perplexed
at
the
difference
between
jophes
and
joseph
as
at
the
peculiar
character
of
the
agonise
pain
i
suffer
for
some
week
i
be
under
the
impression
that
the
scourge
be
less
due
to
my
error
than
to
some
mysterious
connection
it
might
have
with
genesis
with
such
a
passionate
teacher
it
may
be
imagine
that
we
child
increase
his
displeasure
time
without
number
the
restlessness
of
childhood
and
nature
infirmity
contribute
endless
cause
for
correction
the
unquiet
foot
the
lively
tongue
defect
of
memory
listlessness
the
effect
of
the
climate
all
suffice
to
provoke
his
irritation
and
to
cause
us
to
be
summarily
castigate
with
birch
or
stick
or
pummel
without
mercy
day
after
day
little
wretch
would
be
flung
down
on
the
stone
floor
in
writhe
heap
or
stood
with
blinking
eye
and
humped
back
to
receive
the
shock
of
the
ebony
ruler
or
be
sent
pirouette
across
the
school
from
a
ruffianly
kick
while
the
rest
suffer
from
a
sympathetic
terror
during
such
exhibition
for
none
knew
what
moment
he
might
be
call
to
endure
the
like
every
hour
of
our
life
we
live
and
breathe
in
mortal
fear
of
the
cruel
hand
and
blighting
glare
of
one
so
easily
frenzied
the
second
memorable
whip
i
receive

of
the
year
of

be
report
to
be
in
the
country
and
i
believe
we
be
forbidden
to
eat
fruit
of
any
kind
some
week
however
after
the
edict

and
the
most
scholarly
boy
in
the
school
be
sent
on
an
errand
to
the
cathedral
town
when
return
we
caught
sight
of
a
bunch
of
blackberry
on
the
other
side
of
a
hedge
and
wholly
oblivious
of
the
consequence
we
climbed
over
a
gate
into
the
field
and
feast
on
the
delicious
fruit
and
of
course
stain
our
finger
and
lip
on
reporting
ourselves
to
francis
it
be
evident
by
the
way
he
gaze
at
us
both
that
he
guess
what
we
have
be
do
but
he
say
nothing
and
we
retire
from
him
with
a
sense
of
relief
about
half
an
hour
after
we
all
have
be
dismiss
to
our
dormitory
and
we
be
all
quiet
abed
the
master
tramp
be
heard
on
the
stair
and
when
he
appear
at
the
door
he
have
a
birch
as
large
as
a
broom
in
his
hand
he
stood
long
enough
to
remind
us
all
that
he
have
expressly
forbidden
us
to
eat
any
fruit
from
stall
or
hedge
because
of
the
sickness
that
be
in
the
country
then
give
a
swish
blow
in
the
air
with
his
birch
he
advanced
to
my
bed
and
with
one
hand
plucked
me
out
of
bed
and
forthwith
administer
a
punishment
so
dreadful
that
blackberry
suggest
birching
ever
afterwards
he
next
go
to
the
bed
of
the
scholar
george

hitherto
have

be
now
to
undergo
because
of
his
remarkable
ability

be
new
to
the
exquisite
pain
of
flagellation
writhe
and
struggle
to
such
an
extent
that
he
exasperate
the
master
and
receive
double
punishment
and
his
back
breast
and
leg
be
cover
with
wound

hard
task
impose
upon
us
such
as
sweep
the

the

we
all
appear
to

that
some

knew

more
geography
than

knew
himself

that
to
prevent

the
difference
between
our
school
and
the

in
the
fact

somehow
the

the
privilege
of
dispense
to
all

barrel
of
currant

youth

necktie

might
wear
any
gorgeous
robe

chose
for

him
from

we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
great
world
outside
contain
low
depth
of
misery
than
anything
experienced
by
us
for
now
and
then
we
caught
glimpse
of
horrid
unkempt
vagrant
as
they
come
to
the
porter
lodge
for
a
lodge
and
during
our
visit
to
st
asaph
we
could
not
enter
the
town
without
be
impressed
with
the
squalor
of
the
irish
square
which
make
us
glad
that
we
be
not
so
disreputable
as
the
rag
urchin
of
that
sordid
locality
little
as
we

aware

it
our

become

by
prejudice
just
as
our
boot
be
stain
with
the
greasy
mud
of
that
neighbourhood
the
repulsiveness
of
the
square
and
the
insolence
of
the
smutty
face
bare
foot
amin
make
us
believe
that
irishman
and
roman
catholic
be
barbarian
and
idolater
and
when
lose
patience
with
their
yelp
clamour
we
turn
to
resent
their
attack
and
saw
them
skurry
to
their
kennel
we
believe
ourselves
justified
in
the
opinion
that
the
young
brat
knew
nothing
of
fair
fight
once
this
opinion
become
fix
no
amoimt
of
argument
would
avail
to
prove
its
injustice
probably
the
very
morning
that
i
have
have
to
bide
the
brunt
of
their
savage
rudeness
and
have
be
disgust
with
their
ugliness
have
see
me
superintend
the
cleaning
of
our
dormitory
with
a
zeal
inspire
by
my
firm
belief
that
before
we
could
be
call
good
we
must
be
clean
within
and
without
and
that
our
heart
our
person
and
our
dwelling
should
be
without
stain
how
i
come
to
manifest
the
passion
of
a
fanatic
for
order
and
cleanliness
i
know
not
yet
when
it
be
my
turn
to
clean
up
and
make
the
bed
i
be
seize
with
a
consume
desire
to
exhibit
everything
at
its
best
to
arrange
the
bed
without
a
single
crease
or
pucker
to
make
the
fold
with
mathematical
exactness
to
dust
and
polish
cupboard
and
window
sill
until
they
be
speckle
and
to
make
the
flagstone
shine
like
mirror
there
i
would
say
to
my
companion
detailed
for
these
duty
my
eye
sparkle
with
pride
that
be
the
way
to
wash
a
floor
let
us
make
the
bed
fit
for
prince
to
sleep
in
and
hard
after
this
triumph
of
order
and
neatness
i
would
perhaps
be
despatch
to
the
town
to
have
every
sense
offend
by
the
miracle
of
dirt
and
disorder
in
and
around
the
irish
square
no
wonder
that
we
felt
unmitigated
scorn
for
irish
habit
and
way
there
be
two
or
three
boy
even
among
us
whom
we
should
have
exile
among
the
irish
have
we
the
power
we
felt
it
to
be
degradation
to
be
near
them
at
school
one
be
remarkable
for
a
pasty
complexion
small
piggish
eye
white
eyelash
and
carroty
hair
another
have
project
gooseberry
eye
which
suggest
that
they
might
fall
from
him
some
day
as
from
a
bush
his
stubborn
soul
could
endure
thump
without
bellowing
though
a
tear
or
two
would
trickle
his
mouth
be
like
that
of
a
beast
and
garnish
with
great
jagged
teeth
and
altogether
he
be
so
unlovely
as
to
shock
every
sense
in
us
between
francis
and
ourselves
they
have
a
hard
time
of
it
and
i
often
wonder
how
fate
have
dispose
of
them
during
this
long
interval
when
i
reach
my
eleventh
year
the
king
of
the
school
for
beauty
and
amiability
be
a
boy
of
about
my
own
age
name
willie
robert
some
of
us
believe
that
he
belong
to
a
very
superior
class
to
our
own
his
coal
black
hair
curl
in
profusion
over
a
delicately
mould
face
of
milky
whiteness
his
eye
be
soft
and
limpid
and
he
walk
with
a
carriage
which
tempt
imitation
beyond
these
indication
of
him
i
remember
but
little
for
just
then
i
fell
ill
with
some
childish
malady
which
necessitate
my
removal
to
the
infirmary
where
i
lay
for
week
but
as
i
be
become
convalescent
i
be
startle
by
a
rumour
that
he
have
suddenly
die
when
i
heard
that
his
body
be
in
the
dead
house
i
felt
stricken
with
a
sense
of
irreparable
loss
as
the
infirmary
open
upon
the
court
yard
which
contain
our
morgue
some
of
the
boy
suggest
that
it
might
be
possible
to
view
him
and
prompt
by
a
fearful
curiosity
to
know
what
death
be
like
we
avail
ourselves
of
a
favourable
opportunity
and
enter
the
house
with
quake
heart
the
body
lay
on
a
black
bier
and
cover
with
a
sheet
appear
uncommonly
long
for
a
boy
one
of
the
boldest
drew
the
cloth
aside
and
at
the
sight
of
the
waxen
face
with
its
awful
fixity
we
all
start
back
gaze
at
it
as
if
spell
bound
there
be
something
grand
in
its
superb
disregard
of
the
chill
and
gloom
of
the
building
and
in
the
holy
calm
of
the
feature
it
be
the
face
of
our
dear
willie
with
whom
we
have
played
and
yet
not
the
same
for
an
inexplicable
aloofness
have
come
over
it
we
yearn
to
cry
out
to
him
to
wake
but
dare
not
for
the
solemnity
of
his
face
be
appal
presently
the
sheet
be
drawn
far
away
and
we
then
saw
what
one
of
us
have
insinuate
might
be
see
the
body
be
livid
and
show
score
of
dark
weal
one
glance
be
enough
and
hastily
cover
it
we
withdrew
with
mind
confirm
in
the
opinion
that
sign
of
violence
would
appear
after
death
as
testimony
against
him
who
be
guilty
of
it
after
what
we
have
see
it
would
have
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
have
remove
from
our
mind
the
impression
that
francis
be
accountable
for
willie
death
for
week
after
this
my
first
thought
in
the
morning
be
of
willie
dead
face
and
in
consequence
i
could
not
help
look
into
every
face
with
something
of
pity
that
mankind
should
be
born
for
death
and
burial
in
the
cold
remorseless
earth
when
i
re
enter
the
school
i
found
myself
curiously
regard
francis
and
wonder
that
he
be
so
insensible
to
the
miserable
fate
in
store
for
him
and
that
he
could
be
so
pitiless
in
his
cruelty
to
his
fellow
sufferer
what
would
he
say
i
thought
when
the
judge
who
would
come
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
would
ask
him
what
hast
thou
do
to
thy
brother
willie
some
time
after
willie
death
george
the
scholar
and
i
become
as
chummy
as
twin
brother
he
be
not
so
amiable
as
willie
but
we
believe
him
to
be
severely
good
and
far
more
learn
by
which
he
obtain
our
respect
he
be
not
a
zealous
friend
and
after
some
intimacy
with
him
i
be
often
chill
with
what
appear
to
be
selfishness
in
him
it
may
have
be
that
i
be
too
exact
but
i
certainly
thought
that
it
be
not
in
his
nature
to
be
scrupulous
in
the
keep
of
the
pact
of
chumship
if
a
cake
or
an
apple
be
to
be
divide
into
two
an
uneasy
feel
come
over
me
that
he
take
pain
to
pick
out
the
large
half
and
in
any
dispute
with
other
boy
george
be
not
so
resolutely
insistent
on
my
behalf
as
the
vow
of
brotherhood
demand
after
a
few
week
of
effort
to
make
inward
apology
for
his
laxity
and
backwardness
it
be
force
upon
me
that
he
be
by
nature
indifferent
to
his
obligation
and
it
be
agree
that
each
should
be
a
friend
unto
himself
for
the
future
there
be
no
quarrel
however
but
we
part
with
mutual
respect
about
this
period
i
come
across
a
pious
romance
the
title
of
which
be
forgotten
relate
to
three
young
brother
or
friend
one
of
whom
i
remember
be
name
enoch
who
for
their
perfect
piety
be
attend
by
a
guardian
angel
they
have
set
out
on
travel
through
a
land
which
must
have
be
subtropical
from
its
luxurious
vegetation
and
its
beflowered
scene
but
whatever
might
be
the
peril
they
encounter
or
the
temptation
that
beset
them
the
unseen
guardian
be
always
near
them
and
make
them
strong
confident
and
victorious
the
story
of
joseph
david
and
daniel
and
the
three
brave
youth
at
babylon
have
powerfully
affected
me
but
unfortunately
their
association
with
task
and
rod
have
mar
their
attraction
my
delight
in
saintly
enoch
and
his
friend
be
unalloyed
by
any
such
bitter
memory
the
story
be
also
write
in
an
easy
every
day
language
and
the
scene
be
laid
in
a
country
wherein
god
presence
be
still
felt
god
have
depart
from
canaan
and
he
have
cast
off
israel
and
now
his
protection
be
vouchsafed
to
all
the
child
of
men
without
distinction
and
only
piety
and
prayer
be
need
to
secure
his
aid
in
time
of
distress
above
the
fireplace
in
the
schoolroom
the
two
dormitory
and
din
hall
be
tacked
paint
iron
sheet
which
be
inscribed
with
appropriate
scriptural
text
we
have
bible
lesson
morning
and
even
collect
and
gospel
to
commit
to
memory
our
shelf
held
a
fair
collection
of
religious
literature
memoir
of
wesley
fletcher
life
of
bunyan
fox
milton
and
others
of
less
note
sermon
and
commentary
twice
on
sunday
we
have
full
service
and
after
supper
the
porter
of
the
establishment
who
be
a
methodist
of
super
fervid
zeal
would
treat
us
to
a
lengthy
and
noisy
prayer
which
as
i
think
of
it
now
be
rather
a
tedious
string
of
adjuration
to
and
incrimination
of
the
almighty
than
a
supplication
for
grace
to
the
creator
but
all
these
religious
exercise
and
literature
have
not
such
direct
immediate
effect
as
this
romantic
novelette
i
now
conceive
god
to
be
a
very
real
personage
as
active
to
day
as
in
biblical
period
in
his
supervision
of
mundane
concern
i
fancy
god
presence
visible
in
many
small
event
but
to
obtain
the
divine
interposition
in
one
favour
it
be
necessary
to
earnestly
solicit
it
and
to
be
worthy
of
it
by
perfect
sin
lessness
here
be
a
great
difficulty
it
be
not
possible
to
be
wholly
free
from
sin
in
our
circumstance
i
observe
that
our
senior
though
they
punctiliously
go
through
the
form
of
prayer
be
none
of
them
blameless
they
be
cruelly
unkind
they
be
unjust
in
their
punishment
they
be
censorious
without
cause
and
most
ungentle
they
ask
for
god
forgiveness
for
their
trespass
but
be
relentless
in
their
condemnation
of
the
small
fault
we
commit
when
i
come
to
think
of
that
beast
will
thomas
and
that
imp
davy
and
that
tale
bearer
and
mischief
maker
williams
my
gorge
rise
against
them
and
i
felt
that
the
circumstance
of
enoch
life
be
not
like
mine
however
i
make
a
grand
effort
to
free
myself
from
my
vanity
and
pride
i
compel
myself
for
a
season
to
make
the
sacrifice
demand
of
me
i
champion
ugly
will
against
his
oppressor
and
suppress
my
scorn
of
davy
i
strove
to
like
williams
though
i
fear
he
be
incorrigible
i
sought
to
surprise
each
of
them
with
good
office
and
in
the
process
endure
much
contumely
because
human
being
be
so
prone
to
misconstrue
one
action
i
rise
at
midnight
to
wrestle
in
secret
with
my
wicked
self
and
while
my
schoolfellow
sweetly
repose
i
be
on
my
knee
lay
my
heart
bare
before
him
who
know
all
thing
vow
that
the
next
day
should
be
a
witness
of
my
sincerity
and
that
i
would
have
no
fear
of
derision
for
attempt
at
well
do
i
would
promise
to
abstain
from
wish
for
more
food
and
to
show
how
i
despise
the
stomach
and
its
pain
i
would
divide
one
meal
out
of
the
three
among
my
neighbour
half
my
suet
pudding
should
be
give
to
ffoulkes
who
be
afflict
with
greed
and
if
ever
i
possess
anything
that
excite
the
envy
of
another
i
would
at
once
surrender
it
great
proof
than
these
of
my
resolve
to
be
perfect
i
thought
i
could
not
show
and
when
i
have
do
my
part
i
hop
to
see
the
sign
of
god
favour
in
milder
treatment
by
francis
i
cannot
recollect
that
the
season
which
i
devote
to
the
subjection
of
self
witness
the
lenity
which
i
anticipate
or
that
it
have
any
effect
beyond
a
feel
of
physical
weakness
but
indirectly
i
be
not
sure
that
it
be
wholly
without
gain
without
the
faith
which
support
me
i
might
never
have
thought
of
experiment
on
will
and
practise
it
on
myself
my
dislike
and
passion
and
place
them
at
the
service
of
those
i
have
despise
and
i
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
feel
of
friendlessness
be
soothe
it
be
a
comfort
to
know
that
though
without
a
parent
relation
or
friend
on
earth
to
turn
to
i
have
a
father
in
heaven
before
whom
i
be
the
equal
of
the
mighty
i
believe
in
the
immediate
presence
of
angel
who
be
depute
to
attend
us
for
our
protection
that
the
emissary
of
the
evil
one
range
about
during
the
darkness
of
the
night
seek
to
wreak
their
spite
against
those
averse
to
them
and
i
believe
that
the
frightful
dream
from
which
we
sometimes
suffer
be
due
to
their
machination
sometimes
i
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
after
a
tremendous
struggle
with
a
nightmare
and
gaspingly
look
out
fancy
i
saw
the
evil
spirit
crowd
the
darkness
and
sail
about
like
huge
fantastic
microbe
or
stand
shadowy
grey
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
would
rub
my
eye
hard
for
a
clearer
vision
and
i
would
observe
them
retreat
against
the
cold
bare
wall
within
all
be
terror
and
confusion
entreaty
to
heaven
for
protection
admonition
respect
some
neglect
of
prayer
or
coldness
in
devotion
and
i
would
rise
from
bed
on
be
thus
inform
of
the
remedy
and
indulge
in
the
sacred
theft
of
prayer
with
the
humbleness
due
from
a
little
child
pray
to
the
universal
father
and
creator
if
by
accident
i
be
discover
the
day
follow
be
certain
to
be
one
of
torture
an
opprobrious
nickname
or
bitter
gibe
taunt
immodest
expression
or
gesture
every
kind
of
conspiracy
would
be
make
to
excite
the
demon
that
lurks
within
every
human
breast
so
that
by
night
what
with
hate
of
my
fellow
burning
anger
at
their
atrocious
conduct
remorse
for
have
succumbed
to
rage
at
their
wicked
practice
i
have
collapse
from
my
virtuous
state
to
be
again
brought
to
my
sense
of
inborn
sinfulness
by
some
nightly
visitation
or
a
curious
gush
of
tearful
repentance
and
an
agony
of
longing
for
the
love
of
some
human
be
the
religious
conviction
of
my
childhood
be
too
intense
and
real
to
omit
recall
them
often
it
appear
as
though
it
be
wholly
useless
to
struggle
against
evil
yet
there
be
an
infinitesimal
improvement
in
each
stage
the
character
be
become
more
and
more
developed
the
temper
be
become
firmer
experience
be
teach
me
something
of
that
great
lesson
of
life
which
enables
one
to
view
more
calmly
lapse
of
condition
thus
there
be
two
thing
for
which
i
feel
grateful
to
this
strange
institution
of
st
asaph
my
fellow
man
have
deny
to
me
the
charm
of
affection
and
the
bliss
of
a
home
but
through
his
charity
i
have
learn
to
know
god
by
faith
as
the
father
of
the
fatherless
and
i
have
be
taught
to
read
it
be
impossible
that
in
a
christian
land
like
wale
i
could
have
avoid
contract
some
knowledge
of
the
creator
but
the
knowledge
which
be
gain
by
hearing
be
very
different
from
that
which
come
from
feel
nor
be
it
likely
that
i
would
have
remain
altogether
ignorant
of
letter
be
as
i
be
however
the
circumstance
of
my
environment
necessarily
focus
my
attention
on
religion
and
my
utterly
friendless
state
drove
me
to
seek
the
comfort
guaranteed
by
it
it
would
be
impossible
to
reveal
myself
accord
to
the
general
promise
involve
in
the
title
of
this
book
if
i
be
to
be
silent
regard
my
religious
conviction
be
i
to
remain
silent
the
true
key
to
the
action
of
my
life
would
be
miss
or
rather
let
me
try
to
put
the
matter
more
clearly
the
secret
influence
which
inspire
what
good
i
may
have
do
in
life
for
the
same
reason
prevent
me
from
do
evil
curbed
passion
guide
me
when
the
fire
of
youth
licentious
company
irreverent
mate
and
a
multitude
of
strange
circumstance
must
have
driven
me
into
a
confirm
state
of
wickedness
i
be
therefore
grateful
after
all
for
the
implant
of
religious
principle
in
me
by
the
biblical
education
give
me
in
the
union
the
fear
of
do
wrong
intentionally
the
feel
of
reverence
the
impulse
of
charity
the
possession
of
a
conscience
be
all
due
to
this
without
this
teach
i
should
have
be
little
superior
to
the
african
savage
it
have
be
the
drive
power
for
good
the
arrestor
of
evil
it
have
give
me
an
acute
and
perceptive
monitor
able
by
its
own
delicacy
to
perceive
evil
no
matter
how
deceptive
its
guise
it
have
form
a
magnet
by
which
to
steer
more
straightly
than
i
could
otherwise
have
do
my
belief
that
there
be
a
god
oversee
every
action
observe
and
remember
have
come
often
between
me
and
evil
often
when
sorely
tempt
come
the
sudden
strength
to
say
no
i
ivill
not
it
will
be
wicked
not
criminal
but
sinful
god
see
me
it
be
precisely
for
this
strength
that
i
be
grateful
reason
would
not
have
be
sufficient
to
restrain
me
from
yield
to
temptation
it
require
a
conscience
and
a
religious
conviction
create
it
that
same
inward
monitor
have
restrain
me
from
utter
idle
word
from
deceive
my
fellow
creature
with
false
promise
and
from
hastily
condemn
them
without
sufficient
evidence
from
listen
to
slander
and
from
join
with
them
from
yield
to
vindictiveness
it
have
soften
a
nature
that
without
its
silent
and
gentle
admonition
would
i
be
sure
be
much
bad
than
it
be
i
do
not
claim
that
it
have
always
be
successful
far
from
it
but
i
be
grateful
for
what
it
have
do
and
this
feel
so
long
as
i
posse
it
will
induce
me
to
hope
that
it
will
ever
remain
with
me
a
restrain
power
a
monitor
to
do
my
duty
to
my
creator
and
to
my
fellow
men
whether
these
religious
conviction
would
have
continued
with
me
have
i
live
the
life
of
the
city
be
another
question
i
think
not
at
least
not
in
sufficient
force
a
journalist
life
in
new
york
do
not
give
time
for
reflection
or
introspection
religion
grow
deep
root
in
me
in
the
solitude
of
africa
so
that
it
become
my
mentor
in
civilization
my
director
my
spiritual
guide
with
religious
conviction
we
can
make
real
and
substantial
progress
it
give
body
pith
and
marrow
without
it
so
call
progress
be
empty
and
impermanent
for
without
the
thought
of
god
we
be
toss
about
on
a
sea
of
uncertainty
for
what
be
our
earth
compare
with
the
vast
universe
of
world
in
unmeasurable
space
but
above
all
the
vastness
of
infinity
of
which
the
thought
of
the
wise
men
can
extend
to
but
an
infinitesimal
fraction
be
the
divine
and
almighty
intellect
which
order
all
this
and
to
him
i
turn
the
source
of
the
high
energy
the
generator
of
the
principle
of
duty
in
the
adult
ward
at
st
asaph
be
a
harmless
imbecile
name
john
holywell
who
have
be
a
resident
of
the
house
for
about
a
score
of
year
he
be
now
over
fifty
and
be
likely
to
remain
until
his
body
be
conveyed
to
a
pauper
grave
as
his
fate
so
mine
promise
except
that
i
oould
pray
and
read
tyranny
of
the
grossest
kind
lash
and
scowl
at
us
every
wake
hour
but
even
will
thomas
possess
something
that
i
have
not
he
have
relation
who
occasionally
visit
him
with
gift
but
i
be
alone
none
ever
come
to
see
me
i
must
have
be
twelve
ere
i
knew
that
a
mother
be
indispensable
to
every
child
to
most
boy
of
twelve
such
a
simple
fact
must
have
be
obvious
but
as
my
grandsire
and
nurse
have
suffice
for
my
early
want
the
necessity
for
a
mother
have
not
be
manifest
to
me
now
that
i
be
told
my
mother
have
enter
the
house
with
two
child
my
first
feel
be
one
of
exultation
that
i
also
have
a
mother
and
a
half
brother
and
a
half
sister
and
the
next
be
one
of
curiosity
to
know
what
they
be
like
and
whether
their
appearance
portend
a
change
in
my
condition
francis

up
to
me
during
the
dinner
hour
when
all
the
inmate
be
assemble
and
point
out
a
tall
woman
with
an
oval
face
and
a
great
coil
of
dark
hair
behind
her
head
ask
me
if
i
recognise
her
no
sir
i
reply
what
do
you
not
know
your
own
mother
i
start
with
a
burning
face
and
direct
a
shy
glance
at
her
and
perceive
she
be
regard
me
with
a
look
of
cool
critical
scrutiny
i
have
expect
to
feel
a
gush
of
tenderness
towards
her
but
her
expression
be
so
chill
that
the
valve
of
my
heart
dose
as
with
a
snap
honour
thy
father
and
mother
have
be
repeat
by
me
a
thousand
time
but

no
honour

me
after
a
few
week
residence

her
little
boy
with
her
but
the
girl

he
appoint
me
his
deputy
over
the
school
on
the
very
first
day
of
his
absence
a
boy
name
david
my
especial
bete
noire
on
the
play
ground
and
whose
malice
be
a
source
of
trouble
to
me
thought
fit
to
question
my
fitness
for
the
post
and
persist
in
noisy
demonstration
against
my
authority
for
a
while
the
serious
nature
of
a
conflict
with
one
who
have
often
prove
himself
my
superior
in
strength
restrain
me
from
notice
his
breach
of
order
the
sharp
witted
boy
of
the
first
class
observe
this
reluctance
and
rightly
account
for
it
they
also
soon
become
insolently
boisterous
and
i
have
to
cry
silence
as
imperiously
as
possible
there
be
an
instant
hush
from
habit
at
the
word
but
overcome
their
first
fear
and
prompt
by
mischievous
david
the
buzz
be
resume
and
soon
become
intolerable
i
strode
up
in
front
of
david
and
order
him
to
take
his
stand
at
the
dunce
comer
which
he
scornfully
decline
at
once
he
dare
me
to
compel
him
and
add
biting
word
about
my
puny
strength
and
impudence
instinctively
the
school
felt
that
an
excite
struggle
be
impend
and
sus
i
end
their
restlessness
i
be
force
to
accept
david
challenge
but
when
his
sinewy
arm
embrace
me
i
would
gladly
have
compromise
with
him
have
my
pride
permit
for
the
unbend
rigidity
of
his
stiff
back
be
terrify
to
think
of
we
contend
breathlessly
for
some
time
but
finally
i
succeed
in
kick
his
stubborn
pin
from
under
him
and
he
fell
heavily
undermost
in
a
few
second
i
rode
in
triumph
over
his
prostrate
form
and
demand
his
submission
which
he
sullenly
refuse
dicky
more
friendly
than
the
others
come
forward
at
the
call
with
a
woollen
mufiler
and
with
his
assistance
i
make
david
captive
and
after
binding
the
tense
arm
conduct
him
to
the
opprobrious
comer
where
he
be
left
to
meditate
with
two
others
similarly
guilty
from
the
hour
when
the
heroic
whelp
david
be
subdue
my
authority
be
undisputed
often
since
have
i
learn
how
necessary
be
the
application
of
force
for
the
estab
lishment
of
order
there
come
a
time
when
plead
be
of
no
avail
not
many
week
after
francis
have
return
from
mold
an
event
occur
which
have
a
last
influence
on
my
life
but
for
the
stupid
and
brutal
scene
which
brought
it
about
i
might
eventually
have
be
apprentice
to
some
trade
or
another
and
would
have
mildew
in
wale
because
with
some
knowledge
of
my
disposition
i
require
great
cause
to
break
away
from
association
unknown
to
myself
and
un
perceive
by
anyone
else
i
have
arrive
at
the
part
of
the
way
unconsciously
i
have
contract
idea
about
dignity
and
the
promise
of
manhood
be
manifest
in
the
first
bud
of
pride
courage
and
resolution
but
our
school
master
expose
to
mood
of
savage
temper
and
arbitrary
from
habit
have
fail
to
notice
the
change
in
may
a
new
deal
table
have
be
order
for
the
school
and
some
heedless
urchin
have
dent
its
surface
by
stand
on
it
which
so
provoke
francis
that
he
fell
into
a
furious
rage
and
uttered
terrific
threat
with
the
air
of
one
resolve
on
massacre
he
seize
a
birch
which
as
yet
have
not
be
bloody
and
stride
furiously
up
to
the
first
class
he
demand
to
know
the
culprit
it
be
a
question
that
most
of
us
would
have
prefer
to
answer
straight
off
but
we
be
all
absolutely
ignorant
that
any
damage
have
be
make
and
probably
the
author
of
it
be
equally
unaware
of
it
no
one
could
remember
to
have
see
anyone
stand
on
the
table
and
in
what
other
manner
mere
dent
have
be
impressed
in
the
soft
deal
wood
be
inexplicable
we
all
answer
accordingly
very
well
then
say
he
the
entire
class
will
be
flog
and
if
confession
be
not
make
i
will
proceed
with
the
second
and
afterwards
with
the
third
unbutton
he
commenced
at
the
foot
of
the
class
and
there
be
the
usual
yell
and
writhe
and
shed
of
shower
of
tear
one
or
two
of
david
oaken
fibre
submit
to
the
lacerate
stroke
with
a
silent
squirm
or
two
and
now
it
be
fast
approach
my
turn
but
instead
of
the
old
timidity
and
other
symptom
of
terror
i
felt
myself
harden
for
resistance
he
stood
before
me
vindictively
glare
his
spectacle
intensify
the
gleam
of
his
eye
how
be
this
he
cry
savagely
not
ready
yet
strip
sir
this
minute
i
mean
to
stop
this
abominable
and
bare
face
lie
i
do
not
lie
sir
i
know
nothing
of
it
silence
sir
down
with
your
clothes
never
again
i
shout
marvel
at
my
own
audacity
the
word
have
scarcely
escape
me
ere
i
found
myself
swung
upward
into
the
air
by
the
collar
of
my
jacket
and
flung
into
a
nerveless
heap
on
the
bench
then
the
passionate
brute
pummel
me
in
the
stomach
until
i
fell
backward
gasp
for
breath
again
i
be
lift
and
dash
on
the
bench
with
a
shock
that
almost
broke
my
spine
what
little
sense
be
left
in
me
after
these
repeat
shock
make
me
aware
that
i
be
smitten
on
the
cheek
right
and
left
and
that
soon
nothing
would
be
left
of
me
but
a
mass
of
shatter
nerve
and
bruise
muscle
recover
my
breath
finally
from
the
pound
in
the
stomach
i
aim
a
vigorous
kick
at
the
cruel
master
as
he
stoop
to
me
and
by
chance
the
boot
foot
smash
his
glass
and
almost
blind
him
with
their
splinter
start
backward
with
the
excruciate
pain
he
contrive
to
stumblte
over
a
bench
and
the
back
of
his
head
struck
the
stone
floor
but
as
he
be
in
the
act
of
fall
i
have
bound
to
my
foot
and
possess
myself
of
his
blackthorn
arm
with
this
i
rush
at
the
prostrate
form
and
struck
him
at
random
over
his
body
until
i
be
call
to
a
sense
of
what
i
be
do
by
the
stirless
way
he
receive
the
thrash
i
be
exceedingly
puzzle
what
to
do
now
my
rage
have
vanished
and
instead
of
triumph
there
come
a
feel
that
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
endure
instead
of
resist
some
one
suggest
that
he
have
well
be
carry
to
his
study
and
we
accordingly
drag
him
along
the
floor
to
the
master
private
room
and
i
remember
well
how
some
of
the
infant
in
the
fourth
room
commenced
to
howl
with
unreasoning
terror
after
the
door
have
be
close
on
him
a
dead
silence
comparatively
follow
my
wit
be
engage
in
unravel
a
way
out
of
the
curious
dilemma
in
which
i
found
myself
the
overthrow
of
the
master
before
the
school
appear
to
indicate
a
new
state
of
thing
have
successfully
resist
once
it
involve
a
continued
resistance
for
one
would
die
before
submit
again
my
friend
mose
ask
me
in
a
whisper
if
i
knew
what
be
to
happen
be
the
master
dead
the
hideous
suggestion

the
whole
aispect
of
my
thought
my
heart
begin
to
beat
as
my
imagination
conjure
up
unknown
consequence
of
the
outrage
to
authority
and
i
be
in
a
mood
to
listen
to
the
prompting
of
mose
that
we
should
abscond
i
assent
to
his
proposal
but
first
i
sent
a
boy
to
find
out
the
condition
of
the
master
and
be
relieve
to
find
that
he
be
bathing
his
face
mose
and
i
instantly
left
the
school
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
wash
the
blood
from
my
face
but
as
a
fact
we
climbed
over
the
garden
wall
and
drop
into
conway
field
and
thence
hasten
through
the
high
com
in
the
bod

as
though
pursue
by

and
tyranny

that
it

may

with

justice
but
undeserved
cruelty
be
almost
sure
to
ruin
them
we
ran
away
with
a
boundless
belief
that
beyond
the
wall

the

of
a

that
be

for
happiness
many
a
long
summer
even
i
have
spent
look
out
of
our
window
upon
the
radiant
vale
of
clwyd
and
the
distant
line
of
hill
which
rise
beyond

my
imagination
by
the
recital
to
myself
of
fanciful
delight

i
believe
to
exist
beyond
the
far
horizon
the
tide
of
humanity
as
they
swept
gaily
over
the
highroad
in
view
of
our
gate
have
seem
very
beautiful
and
happy
but
at
the
first
contact
with
the
highly
privileged
people
whom
we
met
on
the
turnpike
they
do
not
appear
so
gracious
to
me
whether
they
roued
by
in
carriage
or
sat
on
the
coach
enjoy
the
air
at
the
cottage
door
or
smash
stone
by
the
road

drove
swift
gig
or
tramped
afoot
like
ourselves
all
alike
be
harsh
and
forbid
even
lad
of
our
own
age
and
frock
child
assail
us
with
scorn
and
abuse
it
impressed
itself
on
me
that
we
be
outcast
we
wore
the
workhouse
livery
and
this
reveal
the
sphere
we
belong
to
to
all
who
met
us
being
in
that
garb
have
no
business
on
the
public
road
we
be
clearly
trespasser
what
with
the
guilty
feel
of
have
abscond
and
outrage
the
public
sense
by
our
appearance
in
scene
where
we
be
undoubted
alien
we
begin
to
feel
exceedingly
uncomfortable
and
shrank
from
the
view
of
every
one
as
night
approach
other
anxiety
troubled
us
sorely
where
should
we
sleep
how
should
we
subsist
we
could
not
remain
always
in
hiding
the
sun
be
about
set
when
we
come
across
a
disused
lime
kiln
we
crept
through
the
arch
into
the
open
bowl
like
interior
by
cuddle
together
we
could
just
find
room
in
the
bottom
to
sleep
but
as
it
be
still
daylight
our
foot
could
be
see
through
the
opening
of
the
arch
by
the
passer
by
and
we
should
be
take
prisoner
we
therefore
have
to
lean
on
the
side
of
the
kiln
until
the
darkness
come
before
we
could
forget
our
misery
in
sleep
in
this
awkward
position
we
wait
silently
for
the
darkness
our
limb
ache
with
fatigue
our
spirit
be
deject
in
about
an
hour
probably
it
would
be
dark
but
in
such
a
mood
what
a
time
to
wait
many
illusion
disappear
nothing
of
what
i
have
see
through
the
wofkhouse
window
be
real
i
have
be
all
the
time
dreanung
have
take
too
seriously
fact
which
have
be
sugar
with
pleasantness
for
our
childish
mind
the
world
be
ugly
cruel
and
hard
and
all
grown
up
people
be
liar
from
my
nurse
and
old
woman
my
head
have
be
crammed
with
ghost
story
and
i
have
become
a
believer
in
sign
omen
augury
and
fetishism
transmit
to
me
by
foolish
peasant
from
our
tattooed
ancestor

the
clear
glass
of
my
mind
have
be

as
the
darkness
settle
over
me
memory
of
its
spectral
inhabitant
come
troop
to
the
surface
i
fancy
i
saw
image
of
those
being
who
haunt
the
dark
when
unguarded
by
lock
and
bolt
through
the
top
and
arch
of
the
kiln
we
be
open
to
their
assault
i
become
nervously
watchful
and
the
more
i
strain
my
eye
the
more
i
fancy
i
could
see
flame
imp
act
a
ceaseless
pantomime
of
malice
once
or
twice
i
thought
i
felt
the
whiff
of
ghostly
wing
and
my
terror
cause
a
feel
of
suffocation
the
only
safe
thing
to
do
be
to
talk
tell
story
to
each
other
that
the
accurse
spirit
might
know
we
be
awake
and
fearless
i
continued
awake
by
this
method
until
the
sky
begin
to
pale
before
the
advance
dawn
when
i
softly
drop
into
sleep
and
so
pass
the
most
uneasy
night
i
remember
with
the
sunrise
we
rise
stiff
and
hungry
to
resume
our
flight
by
preference
we
clung
to
the
lane
as
be
the
safest
for
fugitive
who
wore
the
parish
uniform
but
near
corwen
our
ache
vitals
compel
us
to
brave
the
publicity
of
the
pike
road
we
halt
at
last
before
a
stone
cottage
at
the
door
of
which
a
stout
and
motherly
old
woman
stoop
over
a
wash
tub
rest
on
a
three
legged
stool
her
frilled
cap
look
very
white
and
clean
a
flaxen
haired
baby
sat
astride
of
the
door
sill
beating
a
tom
tom
with
a
piece
of
china
ware
our
desperately
famish
state
overcame
our
shyness
and
we
ask
for
a
piece
of
bread
the
woman
brace
herself
up
and
give
us
a
compassionate
look
say
you
seem
poorly
child
surely
you
do
not
belong
to
these
part
no
ma
be
we
belong
to
st
asaph
oh
yes
you
be
from
the
workhouse

she
invite
us
cordially
to
enter
and
opening
a
cupboard
that
be
under
the
stair
drew
out
a
loaf
she
cut
off
thick
slice
smear
them
with
butter
and
treacle
and
fill
two
lai
e
mug
with
buttermilk
set
them
before
us
and
bade
us
eat
and
welcome
after
such
kindness
it
be
not
difficult
to
win
our
confidence
i
well
remember
how
the
homely
clock
with
its
face
crown
at
the
top
with
star
red
flower
ticked
loudly
during
the
pause
of
our
narrative
and
how
the
minute
hand
flung
itself
recklessly
round
the
dial
how
near
the
door
the
wash
tub
become
cover
with
a
scum
as
the
soap
bubble
explode
one
by
one
how
the
good
woman
suckle
her
babe
to
sleep
as
we
talk
the
colour
picture
of
that
cottage
stand
out
unfading
in
my
memory
despite
the
varied
accumulation
of
so
many
year
have
be
strengthen
by
food
and
comfort
with
friendly
advice
we
decide
it
would
be
best
to
push
on
towards
denbigh
night
overtook
us
and
we
sought
the
lee
of
a
haystack
in
a
field
too
tire
to
fear
ghost
and
early
next
day
drew
near
the
castle
town
we
both
love
so
well
we
reach
the
foot
of
high
street
and
look
with
envy
at
the
shop
boy
we
could
not
help
peep
at
the
bright
shop
window
which
expose
such
varied
wealth
and
admire
those
singularly
favour
people
who
be
able
to
dispense
such
assortment
of
luxury
among
their
friend

the
market

lead
the
way
up
a
narrow
lane

towards

and
shortly
turn
in
into
a
dingy
stone
house
near
a
bakery
after
mount
some
step
we
be
confront
by
a
woman
who
as
soon
as
she
rest
her
eye
upon
my
companion
lift
her
hand
up
and
cry
out
in
affectionate
welsh
why

their
little
heart

exhibition
of
fond
love

not
without
its
effect
on
me

eldest
son
of

strange
now
how
we
lose
count
of
people

time
in
our
young
day
we
knew
well
and
old

a
fine
funeral
it
be
too
poor
old
man
it
be
a
great
come
down
in
the
world
from
the
great
house
at
plas
bigot
to
that
little
cottage
at
the
castle
do
you
think
of
go
to
see
old
john
rowlands

of
my
cousin
moses
owen
who

a
school
at
bryn
ford
near
holywell
well
i
do
not
wish
to
discourage
you
but
those
who
know
john
rowlands
would
tell
you
there
be
little
hope
of
help
from
him
however
the
llys
be
not
above
a
good
hour
walk
and
you
could
see
him
first
it
might
turn
out
well
than
we
expect
why
be
he
so
poor
then
poor
oh
no
john
rowlands
be
rich
enough
he
have
two
big
farm
and
be
a
very
prosperous
man
but
he
be
severe
cross
and
bitter
his
eldest
son
john
who
i
suppose
be
your
father
die
many
year
ago
thirteen
or
fourteen
year
i
should
think
there
be
two
daughter
living
with
him
and
they
might
be
kind
to
you
no
it
will
be
no
harm
to
try
the
old
man
he
will
not
eat
you
anyway
and
something
must
be
do
for
you
from
this
good
woman
i
receive
more
information
relate
to
my
family
than
i
have
ever
heard
previously
it
have
remain
fresher
in
my
memory
than
event
of
last
week
at
a
later
period
i
question
aunt
maria
of
liverpool
upon
these
matter
and
she
confirm
their
accuracy
the
next
morning
after
a
refresh
rest
i
set
out
for
the
llys
llanrhaidr
i
have
but
a
faint
recollection
of
its
appearance
though
i
remember
a
big
farm
j
rd
and
fat
stock
horse
pig
cackle
geese
and
fowl
my
mind
be
too
much
preoccupy
with
the
image
of
a
severe
and
sour
old
man
say
to
be
my
father
father
to
take
note
of
building
and
scenery
nothing
be
clear
to
me
but
the
interview
and
the
appearance
of
two
figure
my
grandfather
and
myself
it
be
quite
unforgettable
i
see
myself
stand
in

in
hand

a
stem

several
inch
high
than
his
head
and
he
be
smoking
a
long
clay
pipe
i
remember
that
he
ask
who
i
be
and
what
i
want
in
a
lazy
indifferent
way
and
that
he
never
cease
smoking
while
he
heard
me
and
that
when
i
conclude
he
take
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
reverse
it
and
with
the
mouth
piece
point
to
the
door

go
back

same
way

do
nothing
for
you

nothing
to
give
you
the
word
be
few
the
action
be
simple
i
have
forgotten
a
million
of
thing
probably
but
there
be
some
few
picture
and
some
few
phrase
that
one
can
never
forget
the
insolent
cold
blood
manner
impressed
them
on
my
memory
and
if
i
have
recall
the
scene
once

a
thousand
time

to
be
troubled
with
the
visit
of
poor
relation
and
the
meaning
conveyed
by
their
manner

not
difficult
to
interpret

as
gracious
to
me
as
i
believe
the
owner
of
the

ought
to
be

stood
in
the

her

annoyed
her
though
there
be
no
scorn
in
her
reception
of
me
i
yet
felt
instinctively
that
she
would
rather
not
have
receive
the
news
the
announcement
be
too
sudden
and
precipitate
to
please
a
mother
who
until
now
have
be
a
law
to
her
favourite
son
she
take
her
own
time
to
express
herself
she
ask
me
how
i
have
found
her
house
whether
i
be
hungry
and
tire
quietly
observe
me
the
while
she
set
before
me
an
abundance
of
choice
food
her
patten
signal
her
movement
in
the
pantry
dairy
shop
and

cellar
but
i
knew
she
be
think
of
me
and
the
letter
from
her

each
time
she
come
in
to
add
some
dish
to
the
fare
she
be
spread
for
me
i
felt
her
search
eye
on
me

be
an
ominous
begin
and
make
me
feel
subdue
as
i
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
ingle
nook
some
neighbour
come
in
to
quench
their
thirst
with
my
aunt
brewing
and
from
my
place
i
could
not
fail
to
hear
snatch
of
the
conversation
most
of
which
related
to
me
my
aunt
be
relieve
herself
of
her
grievance
by
which
i
discover
that
her
sense
of
prudence
have
be
offend
by
my
cousin
moses
rash
act
at
his
age
she
say
to
take
upon
himself
the
keep
and
education
of
a
grow
boy
he
will
be
marry
himself
shortly
and
will
have
child
enough
of
his
own
to
bring
up
why
should
he
bother
himself
about
other
people
child
i
say
do
what
you
can
for
your
own
and
let
other
people
do
for
their
family
the
same
i
do
not
like
this
whim
of
moses
at
all
in
the
first
place
it
be
disrespect
to
me
his
mother
who
have
striven
hard
to
establish
him
in
life
and
in
the
second
place
it
be
extravagant
and
every
penny
that
that
boy
will
cost
him
must
be
a
loss
to
the
family
that
he
will
have
to
look
after
in
the
course
of

poor

it
all
now
she
have
inherit
the
instinct

the
calamity

these
circumstance

that
only
thrift
calculation

prevent
the
most
respectable
family
from
decline
to
that
poverty
which
lead
to
the
workhouse
she
knew
that
money
meant
much
to
poor
folk
and
that
the
only
way
to
make
money
in
her
condition
of
life
be
to
make
the
most
of
her
resource
keep
whatever
she
could
scrape
from
the
proceeds
of
industry
and
act
on
those
principle
she
be
an
enemy
to
all
imprudence
and
improvidence
waste
and
extravagance
as
she
could
not
invoke
the
law
to
hinder
young
couple
from
the
folly
of
early
marriage
she
could
disown
them
even
though
they
be
her
near
relative
and
suffer
them
unassisted
to
bear
the
punishment
due
to
the
unwise
for

in
her
position

knew
of
no
other
course

complaint

interpret
her
thought

action
towards
me
henceforth

you
do
not

my

a
young
boy
cannot

expect
to
penetrate
into

motif
of
his

though
his
understand
may
be
dull
the
constant
iteration
of
hint
will
not
fail
in
the
end
to
sharpen
his
intelligence
thus
it
be
that
i

not

better
much
by

slavery
i
be
now
about
to
suffer
moral
slavery
i
say
it
in
no
resentful
sense
but
as
a
fact
i
saw
that
i
be
to
be
subject
to
an
anxious
woman
temper
whose
petulance
would
not
be

by
any
tenderness
for
me
she

the
undisputed
mistress
of
her
household
and
those
who
be
of
it
could
only
remain
with
her
by
uncomplaining
submissiveness
this
feel
of
dependence
on
other
people
favour
and
the
sense
that
my
condition
be
never
to
be
other
than
the
singer
of
their
virtue

troubled
me
at

some
by

but
this
to
love

about

heard
of

the

at

such
be
the
opinion
of
those
qualify
to

he
be
however
of
delicate
constitution
like
many
slender
overgrown
youth

careful
watch

all
the

to

by
such
method
and
stimulate
to

i
become
infect
with
a
passion
for
book
and
for
eighteen
hour
out
of
the
twenty
four
i
be
wholly
engross
with
them
when
a
couple
of
month
later
i
stood
up
for
examination
among
the
head
pupil
my
progress
be
conspicuous
in
time
all
friendship
with
any
schoolfellow
at
brynford
be
impossible
most
of
the
boy
be
uncongenial
through
their
incurable
loutishness
few
of
them
be
cleanly
or
orderly
and
their
idea
of
what
be
right
differ
from
mine
they
be
vilely
irreligious
and
to
my
astonishment
act
as
though
they
believe
manliness
to
consist
of
bare
face
profanity
most
of
them
snuffle
abominably
while
as
to
be
tidy

neat
no
savage
could
have
show
great
indifference
it
would
be
easy
to
transform
ape
into
men
than
to
make
such
nature
gentle
they
all
appear
to
have
become
acquaint
with
my
antecedent
and
their
general
behaviour
towards
me

not
dissimilar
to
that
which
the
imconvicted
show
towards
the
ticket
of
leave
the
gentlest
retort
be
follow
by
expression
which
remind
me
of
my
ignoble
origin
often
they
do
not
wait
to
be
provoke
but
indulge
their
natural
malice
as
from
divine
privilege
the
effect
of
it
be
to
drive
me
within
my
own
shell
and
to
impress
the
lesson
on
me
that
i
be
forever
ban
by
have
be
an
inmate
of
the
workhouse
i
be
neither
grieve
nor
resaitful
for
this
because
i
have
no
dignity
or
vanity
which
could
be
wound
and
be
confine
to
my
own
thought
i
obtain
more
leisure
for
observation
and
there
be
less
occasion
for
speech
my
cousin
also
be
too
imperious
and
exact
to
leave
me
much
time
for
brooding
and
to
one
of
my
temperament

dis
reeable
when
however
a
few
of
our
neighbour

condescend
for
want
of
other
company
to
solicit
mine
for
hunt
nest
among
the
furze
or
for
a
battle
in
the
pool
or
to
explore
an
abandon

shaft
the
restlessness
latent
in
all
boy
be
provoke
in
me
and
i
remember
several
enjoyable
saturday
afternoon
accomplish
as
my
cousin
moses
appear
to
have
be
in
literature
he
be
too
young
to
know
much
about
human
nature
after
month
of
indefatigable
tuition
he
relaxed
in
his
effort
he
b
an
to
aif
ect
a
disbelief
in
my
advancement
and
to
indulge
in
scorn
of
my
progress
my
short
coming
be
now
the
theme
of
his
discourse
each
time
we
met
my
task
become
heavier
and
longer
his
sarcasm
sharper
and
his
manner
more
provoke
as
i
owe
a
home
to
him
i
be
debar
from
retort
he
do
not
stoop
to
the
vulgar
punishment
of
birching
or
can
but
inflict
moral
torture
by
a
peculiar
gift
of
language
his
cut
word
be
more
painful
to
bear
than
any
amount
of
physical
castigation
their
effect
bewilder
me
and
make
me
more
despair
and
i
think
his
unkindness
increase
as
my
helpless
dependency
on
him
be
make
more
manifest
it
frequently
happens
that
as
the
dependent
becomes
humbler
the
tyrant
becomes
harsher
for
the
spirit
take
from
one
seem
to
be
convert
into
force
in
the
other
aunt
mary
during
all
this
period
have
be
regularly
visit
her
son
once
a
week
with
fresh
home
supply
and
by
observe
the
change
in
my
cousin
after
one
of
these
visit
i
suspect
that
her
wish
be
gradually
pervert
his
original
intention
towards
me
moses
be
absolute
over
his
brother
david
and
myself
but
when
aunt
appear
it
be
obvious
even
to
me
that
however
great
her
respect
for
his
talent
be
his
personality
sank
in
the
presence
of
her
masterful
spirit
the
strong
nature
of
his
mother
rule
him
as
completely
at
brynford
as
when
he
be
a
tiny
boy
at
home
in
the
same
way
that
his
mother
show
her
pride
in
her
son
moses
her
son
be
proud
of
his
mother
fine
quality
her
wise
management
of
her
property
and
business
and
the
esteem
she
won
from
all
who
come
near
her
as
an
honourable
far
see
and
right
judging
woman
a
pity
it
be
that
moses
do
not
pursue
the
shorter
and
nobler
course
with
me
it
be
but
due
to
his
mother
that
her
wish
should
prevail
but
by
hesitate
and
gradually
work
himself
into
a
dislike
of
me
he
deprive
me
of
the
sweet
memory
of
his
goodness
have
he
but
call
me
and
say
i
be
too
poor
to
play
the
benevolent
cousin
longer
and
we
must
part
and
sent
me
off
there
and
then
i
should
have
live
to
honour
him
for
his
straightforwardness
and
to
remember
with
gratitude
that
as
long
as
he
be
able
to
he
be
graciously
beneficent
but
with
every
spoonful
of
food
i
ate
i
have
to
endure
a
word
sting
that
left
a
remkling
sore
i
be
a
dolt
a
bom
imbecile
and
incorrigible
dunce
when
the
tear
commenced
to
fall
the
invective
pour
on
my
bent
head
i
be
a
disgrace
to
him
a
blockhead
an
idiot
if
weary
of
this
i
arm
myself
with
a
stony
im
passiveness
he
would
vary
his
charge
and
say
i
have
hop
to
make
a
man
of
you
but
you
be
bound
to
remain
a
clodhopper
your
stupidity
be
monstrous
perfectly
monstrous
v
he
would
push
back
his
chair
from
the
table
and
with
fierce
brow
beating
glance
exclaim
your
head
must
be
full
of
mud
instead
of
brain
seven
hour
for
one
proposition
i
never
knew
the
equal
of
this
numskull
i
can
endure
no
more
of
this
you
must
go
back
whence
you
come
you
be
good
for
nothing
but
to
cobble
pauper
boot
etc
etc
it
would
be
difficult
to
decide
whether
i
become
more
and
more
confuse
by
this
wholly
unlooked
for
violence
and
confound
by
a
grow
belief
in
my
worthlessness
or
moses
tire
with
his
self
impose
task
of
teach
his
imfortunate
cousin
deserve
the
more
pity
have
i
be
in
his
place
and
believe
my
protege
to
be
the
matchless
dunce
he
described
me
to
be
i
could
never
have
have
the
heart
to
bait
him
to
despair
but
would
have
sought
an
occupation
for
him
more
suit
for
his
capacity
moses
appear
to
have
require
time
to
heat
himself
thoroughly
for
such
a
resolve
and
in
his
desire
for
a
proper
pretence
he
be
become
cruel
so
from
this
time
he
be
mute
about
my
merit
i
be
the
object
of
incessant
disparagement
and
reproach
and
the
feel
of
this
act
as
a
weighty
clog
on
my
effort
the
excellence
which
the
owens
pritchards
and
jones
of
the
school
might
aspire
to
be
to
be
deny
me
my
spiritual
intellectual
and
bodily
function
be
to
be
stimulate
with
birch
boot
and
bluster
for
in
no
other
way
could
one
so
dense
as
i
be
affected
the
pain
at
last
become
intolerable
and
i
be
again
draw
perilously
near
revolt
but
moses
saw
nothing
and
continued
to
shower
his
wordy
arrow
which
perpetually
stung
and
cause
inward
bleeding
i
use
to
think
that
moses
be
a
grand
scholar
but
i
get
to
believe
that
he
have
never
be
a
boy
that
tower
intellect
of
his
be
not
due
to
education
it
come
to
him
with
his
mother
milk
yet
i
be
unable
to
understand
when
i
reflect
on
the
severity
of
his
manner
how
the
lord
bishop
of
st
asaph
who
be
a
prince
of
the
church
and
be
three
time
old

unbend
so
far
as
to
challenge
us
workhouse
boy
to
a
race
over
his
lawn
and
would
laugh
and
be
as
frisky
as
any
of
us
the
stone
of
the
highway
would
sooner
rise
and
smile
than
moses
owen
would
relax
the
kill
joy
mask
he
wore
at
this
period
at
last
after
a
course
of
nine
month
tuition
i
receive
permission
to
visit
ffynnon
beuno
and
i
be
never
recall
to
brynford
though
my
aunt
never
forgot
that
she
ought
to
be
rid
of
me
as
soon
as
possible
there
be
no
hardship
in
do
chore
for
her
at
the
farm
when
she
be
gracious
as
she
often
be
she
amply
compensate
me
for
any
inward
suffering
inflict
during
her
severe
week
day
mood
she
be
an
exact
mistress
and
an
unsympathetic
relative
though
in
every
other
sense
she
be
a
most
estimable
woman
but
what
i
lack
most
to
make
my
youth
complete
in
its
joy
be
affection
tremeirchion

only
a

overlook
the
vale
of
clwyd
inhabit
by
tradesman
farm
employee
and
navvy
and
their
family
but
my
impression
be
that
though
the
vale
contains
a
large
number
of
land
proprietor
few
of
them
be
prouder
than
the
occupant
of
the
hamlet
sarah
elli
who
rent
a
cottage
from
my
aunt
at
the
grand
rate
of
shilling
a
year
carry
herself
more
majestically
than
any
royal
person
i
have
since
see

i
fail
to

what
cause
they
have
of

so
inordinately

i

they

be
remind
how
they
despise
all
foreigner
hat
the

how

thought

perhaps

held

of

and
david

rosy

jane

have
to

briskly
in

supply
these
mighty

with
foam
ale
the

quart
make

sociable
the

make

noisily

tom
davy
the
long
limbed
tailor
would
then
be
call
for
a
song
and
after
a
deal
of
persuasion
he
would
condescend
in
spite
of
his
hoarseness
to
give
us
rule
britannia
or
the
march
of
the
men
of
harlech
the
chorus
of
which
would
be
of
such
stupendous
volume
that
the
bacon
flitch
above
swung
to
the
measure
if
while
under
the
influence
of
the
ale
and
the
patriotic
song
the
french
have
happen
to
invade
the
vale
of
clwyd
i
do
believe
that
if
the
toper
could
have
get
within
arm
length
of
them
the
french
would
have
have
a
bad
time
of
it
then
another
singer
would
treat
us
to
the
maid
of
llangollen
which
soothe
the
ardent
temper
heat
by
the
late
valorous
thought
or
john
jones
the
butcher
envious
of
the
applause
won
by
tom
davy
would
rise
and
ring
out
the
strain
to
the
west
where
the
mighty
mizzourah
which
give
us
the
vision
of
a
wide
and
free
land
await
the
emigrant
and
an
enormous
river
flow
between
silent
shore
to
the
sea
more
beer
would
be
call
for
by
the
exult
men
while
eye
spoke
to
eye
of
enchant
feeling
and
of
happy
heart
courage
be
high
at
this
juncture
waistcoat
would
be
imbuttoned
for
easy
breathing
content
flush
each
honest
face
the
foam
ale
and
kitchen
fire
be
so
inspire
after
ten
the
spirit
of
our
customer
would
be
still
more
exalt
for
they
be
deep
in
the
third
quart
all
the
combat
iveness
of
the
welsh
nature
then
be
at
white
heat
this
would
be
the
time
for
dick
griffith
wooden
legged
dick
to
indulge
in
sarcasm
at
the
expense
of
the
fiery
butcher
and
for
sam
elli
the
black
browed
navvy
to
rise
and
challenge
them
both
to
a
bout
of
fisticuffs
and
then
would
follow
sad
scene
of
violence
for
john
who
be
gamey
as
a
bantam
cock
would
square
off
at
the
word
but
at
this
critical
moment
aunt
mary
would
leave
her
shop
counter
and
walk
solemnly
into
the
kitchen
and
with
a
few
command
calm
the
fiery
soul
dick
would
be
bustle
out
ignominiously
as
he
be
too
irascible
for
peace
after
half
past
ten
sam
would
be
warn
of
dreadful
consequence
if
he
lift
his
voice
again
while
as
for
john
jones
the
butcher
it
be
pitiful
to
see
how
craven
he
become
at
sight
of
a
woman
uplifted
forefinger
thus
do
the
men
waste
their
spare
time
in
gossip
and
smoking
and
drinking
which
involve
a
waste
of
their
spare
cash
or
the
surplus
left
in
their
pocket
after
the
purchase
of
absolute
necessity
the
gossip
injured
men
moral
as
the
smoking
deaden
their
intellect
and
the
beer
disturbed
their
life
the
cottage
and
farm
fireside
have
receive
great
praise
than
it
deserves
for
if
we
think
of
the
malice
ill
nature
and
filthy
or
idle
gossip
vacuous
mind
find
pleasure
in
it
will
be
see
tiiat
there
be
another
side
to
the
picture
and
that
not
a
flatter
one
this
chapter
might
be
expand
to
a
book
if
i
be
to
dwell
on
too
many
detail
of
this
period
it
be
crowd
with
small
felicity
notwithstanding
myriad
of
slight
during
the
prostrate
fever
of
africa
memory
love
to
amuse
itself
with
its
incident
it
have
be
my
signal
misfortune
to
have
be
consider
as
the
last
in
the
village
and
every
churl
be
but
too
willing
to
remind
me
of
it
my
aunt
be
nothing
loth
to
subdue
any
ebullience
of
spirit
with
the
mention
of
the
fact
that
i
be
only
a
temporary
visitor
and
my
cousin
david
be
quick
as
boy
generally
be
to
point
out
how
ill
it
become
me
to
forget
it
while
jane
use
it
as
an
eflfective
weapon
to
crush
any
symptom
of
manliness
but
with
a
boy
gaiety
and
healthful
spirit
i
flung
all
thought
of
these
misery
aside
so
that
there
be
time
when
i
enjoy
hearty
romp
with
david
hunt
for
rabbit
and
burrow
in
the
cave
or
make
dam
across
the
brook
with
the
memory
of
which
i
have
whiled
many
a
lonely
hour
in
african
solitude
aunt
mary
have
so
often
impressed
it
on
me
that
i
be
shortly
to
leave
and
worry
in
the
outer
world
for
myself
that
my
imagination
while
with
the
sheep
on
craig
fawr
or
at
church
be
engage
in
draw
fanciful
picture
of
the
destiny
await
me
my
favourite
spot
be
on
the
rocky
summit
of
the
craig
there
the
soul
of
childe
roland
gradually
expand
into
maturity
there
he
dream
dream
of
the
life
to
come
there
i
enjoy
a
breezy
freedom
and
have
a
wide
prospect
of
the
ridi
vale
of
clwyd
from
the
seashore
at
rhyl
to
the
castle
town
of
denbigh
and
between
me
and
the
sky
nothing
intervene
there
be
i
happiest
withdrawn
from
contact
with
the
cold
hearted
selfish
world
with
only
the
sheep
and
my
own
thought
for
company
there
i
could
be
myself
unrestrained
my
loud
shout
could
not
be
heard
by
man
my
wild
thought
be
free
the
roll
cloud
above
me
have
a
charm
indescribable
they
seem
to
carry
my
spirit
with
them
to
see
the
huge
round
world
in
some
far
off
comer
of
which
invisible
to
everyone
but
god
i
be
to
work
out
my
particular
task
at
such
a
time
enoch
glorious
and
sweet
life
would
be
recall
in
the
lovely
land
of
flower
and
sunshine
and
it
would
not
be
long
before
i
would
feel
inspire
to
imitate
his
holy
blamelessness
and
rise
to
my
foot
i
would
gather
stone
and
raise
a
column
to
witness
my
vow
like
jacob
in
the
patriarchal
day
those
hour
on
the
top
of
the
craig
be
not
wholly
without
their
influence
they
left
on
the
mind
remembrance
of
a
secret
compact
with
the
all
see
god
who
heard
through
rush
cloud
and
space
the
love
less
boy
prayer
and
promise
and
when
provoke
they
often
come
between
me
and
offence
finally
another
aunt
come
to
visit
us
from
liverpool
and
therewith
the
first
phase
of
my
future
be
shape
when
she
have
gather
the
intention
of
her
sister
towards
me
she
venture
upon
the
confident
statement
that
her
husband
uncle
tom
as
he
come
to
be
know
to
me
be
able
to
launch
me
upon
a
career
which
would
lead
to
afbuence
and
honour
he
have
such
great
influence
with
a
mr
winter
manager
of
a
liverpool
insurance
office
that
my
future
be
assure
after
several
debate
between
the
two
sister
aunt
mary
be
persuade
that
i
have
but
to
land
in
liverpool
to
be
permanently
establish
in
a
highly
prosperous
business
after
aunt
maria
departure
a
letter
from
her
husband
arrive
which
substantiate
all
she
have
say
and
urge
the
necessity
of
an
early
decision
as
such
a
vacancy
could
not
be
left
long
unfilled
it
only
need
this
to
hurry
aunt
mary
in
procure
for
me
the
proper
outfit
which
she
be
resolve
should
be
as
complete
as
if
it
be
for
one
of
her
own
child
when
the
day
of
departure
at
last
come
my
feeling
be
violently
wrench
certainly
some
fibre
of
my
affection
be
be
torn
else
why
that
feel
of
awful
desolation
it
may
appear
odd
that
i
wept
copiously
at
leave
ffynnon
beuno
where
there
be
none
who
could
have
wept
for
me
have
they
try
ever
so
hard
nevertheless
when
one
image
after
the
other
of
the
snug
farm
house
and
lovely
neighbourhood
the
craig
fawr
the
field
the
wood
the
cave
the
brook
crowd
into
my
mind
i
be
sorely
tempt
to
pray
for
a
little
delay
it
be
probably
well
that
i
do
not
and
it
be
well
for
my
health
that
my
affection
be
with
inanimate
nature
and
not
with
person
for
otherwise
it
would
have
be
a
calamity
wordsworth
finely
describes
the
feel
that
move
me
in
the
line
these
hill
which
be
his
living
be
even
more
than
his
own
blood
have
laid
strong
hold
upon
his
affection
be
to
him
a
pleasurable
feel
of
blind
love
as
the
little
packet
steamer
bore
us
towards
liverpool
and
the
shore
of
wale
recede
from
view
the
sight
of
the
melan
choly
sea
and
cold
sky
seem
in
fit
sympathy
with
the
heavy
burden
which
lay
on
my
heart
they
stir
up
such
oppressive
fancy
that
i
regard
myself
as
the
most
miserable
be
in
existence
deprive
of
even
a
right
to
love
the
land
that
i
be
bom
in
i
say
to
myself
i
have
do
no
harm
to
any
living
soul
yet
if
i
but
get
attach
to
a
field
all
conspire
to
tear
me
away
from
it
and
send
me
wander

a
vagabond
over
the
unknown
who
can
describe
that
sadness
anguish
rack
me
and
a
keen
sense
of
woe
and
utter
beggary
so
whelm
the
mind
that
my

oh
place
me
on
the
summit
of
the
craig
again
and
let
me
sit
in
peace
and
my
happy
thought
will
fly
out
one
by
one
and
bring
the
smile
to
my
face
and
make
me
proof
against
the
misery
of
orphanage
and
the
wintry
cold
of
the
world
there
my
treasure
which
to
me

covetousness
or
strike
the
spark
of
envy
and
be
close
hidden
within
the
soul
often
as
i
have
left
english
shore
since
the
terrible
dejection
of
spirit
of
that
day
have
ever
recur
to
my
mind
when
about
half
way
across
the
dee

i
be
astonish
at
see
many
great
and
grand

under
tower
of
bellying
canvas
over
the

towards
some
world

after
there
appear
on
the
horizon
cloud
of
smoke
out
of
which
presently
wound
a
large
city
there
i
saw
distinctly
mass
of
house
immensely

of

and
grove
of

by
the
attempt
to
comprehend
what
this
sight
could
mean
be
this
liverpool
this
monstrous
aggregation
of
building
and
gloomy
home
of

before
i
could
answer
the
question
satisfactorily
liverpool

all
around

grown
unperceived
by
me
into
a
land

by
numberless
structure
of
surpass
vastness
and
height
and
spread
on
either

there
be
an
immeasurable
length
of

with

and
when
i
look
astern
the

their
wonder
of

far
out

the

whence
we

of
impression

have
sat
through
all
unmoved
and
silent
touch
me
on
the
shoulder
and
bade
me
follow
her
ashore
mechanically
i
obeyed
and
step
out
on
a
float
stage
which
be
sufficiently
spacious
to
accommodate
a
whole
town
full
of
people
and
walk
over
an
iron
bridge
we
gain
the
top
of
the
colossal
wall
among
such
a
number
of
human
being
that
i
become
speechless
with
fear
and
amazement
enter
a
carriage
we
drove
along
past
high
wall
that
imprison
the
shipping
through
an
atmosphere
impregnate
with
fume
of
pitch
and
tar
and
street
whose
roar
of
traffic
be
deafen

ear
could
distinguish
clink
of
iron
grind
roll
of
wheel
tramp
of
iron
shod
hoof
but
there
be
a
hubbub
around
them
all
which
be
loud
and
strenuous
of
which
i
could
make
nothing
save
that
it
be
awful
and
absorb
fresh
from
the
slumber
existence
of
a
quiet
country
home
my
nerve
tingle
under
the
influence
of
the
ceaseless
crash
and
clamour
the
universal
restlessness
visible
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
the
medley
of
noise
be
so
overwhelm
that
from
pure
distraction
and
an
impressive
sense
of
littleness
in
the
midst
of
such
a
mighty
babel
every
intelligent
faculty

power
of
this
ag
egate
force
so
fiercely
astir
make
me
feel
so
limp
and
helpless
that
again
i

tempt
to
implore
my
aunt
to
return
with
me
to
the
peace
of

i
refuse
the
cowardly
impulse
and
before
my
total
collapse
the
carriage
stop
at
an
hotel
we
be
receive
by
such
smile
and

stranger
that
my
confidence

restore
the
comfort
visible
everywhere
and
the

demeanour
of
my

most
soothe
in
the
even
aunt
maria

and
her
warm
greeting
serve
to
dissipate
all
trace
of
my
late
panic
and
even
infuse
a
trifle
of
exaltation
that
my
insignificant
self
be
henceforth
to
be
consider
as
one
of
the
many
throated
army
which
have

so
terrible
to
a
youthful
rustic

but
when
she

by
no

reluctant
to
brave
the
terror
of
the
street
aunt
mary
slip
a
sovereign
into
my
hand
stood
over
a
minute
still
and
solemn
then
bade
me
be
a
good
boy
and
make
haste
to
get
rich
i
be
take
away
and
i
never
saw
her
again
the
street
no
longer
resound
with
the
startle
hurly
burly
of
the
day
at
a
quick
trot
we
drove
through
mile
of
light
way
and
by
endless
range
of
ill
lit
building
once
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
spacious
market
aglow
with
gas
light
where
the
view
of
innumerable
carcase
remind
me
of
the
wonderful
populousness
of
the
great
city
but
beyond
it
lay
the
peaceful
region
of
a
sleep
people
at
about
the
middle
of
this
quieter
part
the
cab
halt
and
we
descend

the
door
of
no
roscommon
street

precious
box

its
liverpool
outfit

breezy

bluff
of

and
so
confident
of
great
thing
for
me
in

that
i
forgot
i
be
in
the
city
of
noise
and
smoke
as
well
as
my
first
dread
of
it

be
the
first
of
his
type
i
ever
met

have
the
heartiness
and
rouick
ness
of
the
traditional
sea
dog
as
sound
in
fibre
as
he
be
impervious
to
care
no
presence
could
daunt
him
or
subdue
his
unabashed
frankness
he
be
like
that
fellow
who
have
be
praise
for
bluntness
doth
affect
a
saucy
roughness
he
cannot
flatter
he
an
honest
mind
and
plain
he
must
speak
truth
an
they
will
take
it

plain
uncle

of
fair
education

be
through
his
influence
that
edward
owen
have
found
a
position
in
it
and
i
presume
that
the
memory
of
that

influence
aunt

in
commit
me
to
his
care

of
life
while
his
prot
g

now
mount
rapidly
he
now
be
a
poor
cottoner
at
a
pound
a
week
with
which
he
have
to
support
himself
and
lai
e
family
his
fault
if
fault
it
may
be
call
may
be
guess
by
the
fact
that
while
his
family
be
increase
he
have
rashly
undertaken
to
burden
himself
with
the
care
of
a
boy
of
my
age
while
the
slightest
accident
or
indisposition
would
leave
him
wholly
without
mean
to
support
anybody
his
heart
be
altogether
too
easily
expansive
for
one
of
his
condition
have
his
mean
permit
he
would
have
kept
perpetual
holiday
with
his
friend
he
so
love
good
cheer
and
genial
fellowship
he
be
over
content
with
himself
and
others
and
too
willing
to
become
surety
for
anyone
who
appear
to
posse
good
humour
and
good
nature
and
through
that
disposition
which
be
fatal
to
a
man
of
family
he
continued
to
fall
low
and
low
until
his
precarious
wage
barely
suffice
for
the
week
want
during
the
first
few
day
i
do
little
more
than
tramp
through
the
street
of
liverpool
from
everton
to
the
dock
with
teddy
morris
age
as
a
guide
who
show
me
the
wonder
of
the
city
with
the
air
of
an
important
shareholder
glory
in
his
happy
investment
the
spirit
of
his
father
in
regard
to
its
splendour
and
wealth
have
take
possession
of
him
and
so
much
be
i
impressed
with
what
he
say
to
me
that
have
a
later
comer
question
me
about
liverpool
i
should
doubtless
have
express
the
conviction
that
its
grandeur
be
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
presence
of
uncle
tom
and
his
son
teddy
the
day
come
when
uncle
tom
take
me
to
interview
mr
winter
through
whose
influence
i
be
to
lay
the
foundation
of
that
promise
prosperity
that
be
to
be
mine
i
have
don
my
new
eton
suit
for
the
first
time
and
my
hair
shone
with
macassar
such
an
important
personage
as
mr
winter
could
only
live
among
the
plutocracy
of
everton
height
and
thither
we
wend
with
hope
and
gladness
in
our
eye
year
ago
when
uncle
tom
be
in
affluent
circumstance
he
have
befriend
mr
winter
in
some
way
that
have
make
that
gentleman
pledge
himself
to
repay
his
kindness
he
be
about
to
test
the
sincerity
of
his
profession
by
solicit
his
influence
on
behalf
of
his
wife
nephew
we
be
receive
with
a
profuse
show
of
friendship
and
such
civility
that
they
seem
obsequious
to
me
when
i
compare
the
sheen
of
mr
winter
black
clothes
with
the
fluffy
jacket
on
uncle
tom
shoulder
the
gentleman
take
out
his
spotless
kerchief
and
affected
to
dust
the
chair
before
place
it
before
his
visitor
and
anxiously
inquire
about
the
health
of
good
mr
morris
and
her
divine
child
when
he
come
finally
to
touch
upon
my
affair
i
be
render
quite
emotional
with
pride
by
the
compliment
he
shower
upon
me
mr
winter
an
extremely
genteel
person
in
long
curl
presently
appear
upon
the
scene
and
after
coo
with
her
spouse
and
exchange
affectionate
embrace
be
introduce
to
us
but
though
we
be
present
husband
and
wife
have
such
an
attraction
for
each
other
that
they
could
not
refrain
from
resume
their
endearment
my
cheek
burn
with
shame
as
i
heard
them
call
one
another
my
sweetie
darling
love
bless
dearie
and
the
like
but
uncle
tom
be
hugely
delighted
and
take
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
in
wale
however
married
people
do
not
conduct
themselves
so
grossly

at
my
prospect
inclined
me
to
echo
my
uncle
sentiment

my
belief
that
mr

like
a
saint
with
her
dove
like
eye
and
pretty
ringlet
though
in

something
of
a
disdain
for
those

the
oil
of
sweetness
the
visit

be
gradually

be
unvaryingly
sanguine
of
my
ultimate
success
in

would
say
aye

it

a
little
hard
at
first
i
know
but
well
time
be
come
take
my
word
for
it
and
he
would
cite
numerous
instance
of
men
in
liverpool
who
begin
at
the
low
step
have
risen
by
dint
of
perseverance
and
patience
to
fabulous
wealth
those
early
breakfast
while
aunt
maria
and
the
child
be
asleep
and
uncle
bustle
cheerfully
about
with
the
confidence
of
a
seer
in
the
future
have
be
treasure
in
my
memory
at
half
past
six
i
would
leave
the
house
with
a
tin
bucket
contain
bread
and
butter
and
a
little
cold
meat
to
support
me
until
nine
at
night
thousand
in
similar
condition
be
then
trudge
through
the
street
to
their
various
task
bright
happy
and
regular
as
clock
work
to
all
appearance
they
take
pride
in
their
daily
toil
and
i
felt
sometiiing
of
it
too
though
the
heavy
shutter
which
i
take
down
and
put
up
make
me
wince
when
i
remember
them
i
think
most
of
us
would
have
prefer
the
work
with
the
wage
to
the
wage
without
the
work
the
morning
be
generally
sunless
the
building
very
grimy
the
atmosphere
be
laden
with
soot
and
everything
be
dingy
but
few
of
us
thought
of
them
as
we
move
in
long
and
lively
procession
of
men
and
bojrs
woman
and
girl
with
complexion
blooming
like
peach
and
lip
and
ear
redden
with
rich
blood
as
it
drew
near
half
past
nine
at
night
i
would
return
home
with
diflferent
view
my
back
ache
i
be
hungry
and
tire
and
a
supper
of
cockle
and
shrimp
or
bloater
be
not
at
all
stimulate
at
half
past
ten
i
would
be
abed
weary
with
excessive
weariness
so
long
as
my
fresh
country
strength
endure
my
habit
be
regular
but
after
two
month
the
weight
of
the
shutter
conquer
me
and
sent
me
to
bed
for
a
week
to
recuperate
meantime
the
haberdasher
have
engage
a
strong
boy
of
eighteen
in
my
place
then
follow
a
month
of
tramp
about
the
street
again
seek
fresh
work
during
which
i
pass
through
the
usual
vicissitude
of
hope
and
disappointment
the
finance
of
the
family
fell
exceedingly
low
nearly
all
my
clothes
depart
to
the
house
of
the
gilt
ball
and
their
loss
entail
a
correspond
loss
of
the
smartness
expect
in
office
or
shop
boy
necessity
drove
me
far
afield
even
as
far
as
the
dock
it
be
then
while
in
search
of
any

it
ignoble
hitherto
this
elevation
of

seduce
me
to
enter
the

and
to
inspect
more
closely

in

ramble
up

with
the

malignity
of
a

when
in
after
year
i
first
look
into
the

orb
of
the

forbid
that
after
such
a
long
period
i
should
malign
him
but
i
cannot
resist
the
conviction
that
when
he
die
those
who
have
know
him
must
have
breathe
freer
wretched
as
be
my
fortnight
stay
at
the

inhumanly
malicious

fresh
provision
to
the
vessel
in
the
dock
and
time
and
fate
have
so
order
it
that
through
this
acquaintance
i
should
be
shunt
into
another
line
of
life
during
the
last
few
week
domestic
matter
at
roscommon
street
have
not
be
at
all
pleasant
the
finance
of
the
family
have
fall
very
low
and
it
have
be
evident
that
here
also
as
at
ffynnon
beuno
there
be
a
wide
distinction
between
child
who
have
parent
and
those
who
be
orphan
for
if
ever
a
discussion
rise
between
my
cousin
and
myself
my
uncle
and
aunt
be
invariably
partial
to
their
own
when
call
to
arbitrate
between
us
it
be
obvious
that
i
be
the
least
aggressive
and
troublesome
the
most
respectful
and
sympathetic
of
the
young
member
of
the
family
but
these
merit
be
as
naught
when
weigh
in
the
scale
of
affection
teddy
temper
make
arrogant
by
the
conceit
that
he
be
his
father
son
require
to
be
curbed
sometimes
but
if
i
assert
myself
and
promise
him
a
thrash
the
maternal
bosom
be
a
sure
refuge
and
as
each
mother
think
her
son
more
perfect
than
any
other
boy
a
certain
defeat
await
me
just
as
i
have
submit
to
the
humour
of
david
at
ffynnon
beuno
i
be
force
to
submit
to
those
of
teddy
if
aunt
censure
of
me
be
not
sufficient
to
ensure
immunity
to
the
nag
boy
there
be
the
old
man
rough
tongue
to
encounter
slowly
the
thought
be
form
that
if
i
be
not
to
be
permit
to
resent
teddy
infirmity
of
temper
nor
to
obtain
the
protection
of
his
over
indulgent
parent
my
condition
could
not
be
bad
if
i
exchange
the
grow
intolerance
of
the
evil
for
some
other
where
at
least
i
should
enjoy
the
liberty
of
kick
occasionally
on
strike
a
balance
between
the
gain
of
living
with
teddy
family
and
the
cross
receive
through
teddy
insolence
it
appear
to
my
imperfect
mind
that
my
humiliation
be
in
excess
i
have
not
obtain
the
clerkship
for
which
i
have
left
wale
my
gold
sovereign
be
go
all
my
clothes
be
in
the
pawnshop
i
have
fall
so
low
as
to
become
a
butcher
errand
boy
under
a
brute
at
home
there
be
as
little
peace
at
night
as
there
be
during
the
day
with
the
foreman
expose
to
the
unruly
spitefulness
of
teddy
the
frown
of
aunt
the
hasty
anger
of
uncle
and
the
unholy
fury
of
the
scotsman
i
be
in
a
fair
way
of
be
ground
very
fine
at
this
juncture
and
while
in
an
indifferent
mood
fate
cause
a
little
incident
to
occur
which
settle
my
course
for
me
i
be
sent
to
the
packet
ship
windermere
with
a
basket
of
provision
and
a
note
to
captain
david
hardinge
while
the
great
man
read
his
note
i
gaze
admiringly
at
the
rich
furniture
of
the
cabin
the
gild
mirror
and
glitter
cornice
and
speculate
as
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
this
gild
but
suddenly
i
become
conscious
that
i
be
be
scrutinise
i
see
say
the
captain
in
a
strong
and
rich
voice
that
you
admire
my
cabin
how
would
you
like
to
live
in
it
sir
i
answer
astonish
i
say
how
would
you
like
to
sail
in
this
ship
but
i
know
nothing
of
the
sea
sir
sho
you
will
soon
learn
all
that
you
have
to
do
and
in
time
you
may
become
a
captain
of
as
fine
a
ship
we
skipper
have
all
be
boy
you
know
come
what
do
you
say
to
go
with
me
as
cabin
boy
i
will
give
you
five
dollar
a
month
and
an
outfit
in
three
day
we
start
for
new
orleans
to
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
all
my
discontent
gather
into
a
head
in
a
moment
and
inspire
the
answer
i
will
go
with
you
sir
if
you
think
i
will
suit
that
be
all
right
steward
he
cry
and
when
the
man
come
the
captain
give
him
his
instruction
about
me
as
he
spoke
i
realise
somewhat
more
clearly
what
a
great
step
i
have
take
and
that
it
be
beyond
my
power
to
withdraw
from
it
even
if
i
should
wish
to
do
so
there
be
no
difficulty
in
obtain
goff
consent
to
quit
his
service
and
the
fiendish
foreman
only
give
a
sardonic
smile
which
might
mean
anything
as
i
strode
towards
home
my
feeling
varied
from
spasm
of
regret
to
gush
of
joy
as
i
mentally
analyse
the
come
change
lard
bread
and
a
sordid
life
with
its
pawnshop
and
family
bickering
be
to
be
exchange
for
full
ration
and
independence
constant
suppression
from
those
who
usurped
the
right
to
control
my
action
word
and
thought
be
to
be
exchange
for
the
liberty
enjoy
by
the
rest
of
the
world
toiler
these
be
the
thought
which
pleased
me
but
when
i
regard
the
other
side
a
haunt
sense
of
insecurity
and
forebode
sober
me
and
make
me
unhappy
then
there
be
a
certain
feel
of
affection
for
my
native
land
and
family
oh
if
my
discontent
have
not
be
so
great
if
uncle
tom
have
be
only
more
just
i
have
clung
to
them
like
a
limpet
to
a
rock
it
need
all
the
force
of
reason
and
the
memory
of
many
unhappiness
and
innumerable
spite
to
sever
all
connection
with
my
humble
love
and
accept
this
offer
of
freedom
and
release
from
slavery
the
magnitude
of
the
change
and
the
inevitable
sunder
of
all
earthly
tie
at
such
short
notice
troubled
me
greatly
but
they
have
no
effect
in
alter
my
decision
when
the
old
man
reach
home
and
heard
the
news
he
appear
quite
stagger
what
go
to

how
be
this
his
sincere
regret

it
harder
than
ever

in
my
nature
to
hate

aunt
join
her
argument
to
those
of
uncle

to
dissuade
me
but
there
rise
up
before
me
a
great
bulk
of
wretchedness
my
slavish
dependence
on
relative
who
could
scarcely
support
themselves

i
look
up
from
the
introspection
and
with
fix
resolve
say
it
be
no
use
uncle
i
must
go
there
be
no
chance
of

anything
in

at
last
in
strict
justice
however
to
his
character
i
must
admit
that
have

equal
to

there
be
no
place
in

the
world
like
england
on
the
third
day
the
windermere
be
warp
out
of
dock
and
then
a
steam
tug
towed
her
out
into
mid
river
shortly
after
a
tug
brought
the
crew
alongside
sail
be
loosen
and
our
ship
be
drawn
towards
the
ocean
and
as
she
head
for
the
sea
the
sailor
with
rouse
chorusesy
hoist
topsail
and
sheet
them
home
chapter
iii
at
sea
when
the
windermere
be
desert
by
the
tug
and
she
rise
and
fell
to
the
wave
i
become
troubled
with
a
strange
lightness
of
the
head
and
presently
i
seem
to
stand
in
the
centre
of
a
great
circle
around
which
sea
and
sky
and
ship
revolve
at
great
speed
then
for
three
day
i
lay
oblivious
helpless
and
grieve
but
at
the
deck
wash
on
the
fourth
morning
i
be
quicken
into
sudden
life
and
activity
by
hearing
a
hoarse
rasp
voice
whose
owner
seem
in
a
violent
passion
bawling
down
the
scuttle
now
then
come
out
of
that
you
young
britisher
step
up
here
in
a
brace
of
shake
or
i
come
down
and
skin
your
carcase
alive
the
furious
peremptoriness
of
the
voice
be
enough
to
rouse
the
dead
and
the
fear
of
the
ogre
threat
drove
all
feeling
of
sickly
wretchedness
away
and
drew
me
on
deck
inunediately
my
nerve
tingle
and
my
sens
seem
to
swim
as
i
cast
a
look
at
the
unsteady
sea
and
uneasy
ship
but
the
strong
penetrate
breeze
be
certainly
a
powerful
tonic
though
not
such
a
reviver
as
the
sight
of
the
ireful
fellow
who
come
on
at
a
tear
palce
towards
me
and
hiss
seize
that
scrub
broom
you
joskin
lay
hold
of
it
i
say
and
scrub
you
son
of
a
sea
cook
scrub
like
scrub
until
you
drop
sweat
you
swab
dig
into
the
deck
you
white
livered
lime
juicer
i
stole
the
briefest
x
ssible
glance
at
his
inflame
face
to
catch
some
idea
of
the
man
who
could
work
himself
into
such
an
intense
rage
for
he
be
a
kind
of
creature
never
dream
of
before
by
me
see
me
bend
to
my
task
without
argument
or
delay
he
dart
to
another
boy
on
the
lee
side
and
with
extreme
irony
and
retract
lip
stoop
with
hand
on
knee
and
say
to
him
now
harry
my
lad
i
be
sure
you
do
not
want
the
toe
of
my
boot
to
touch
ungently
those
crescent
of
yours
do
you
now
no
sir
say
the
boy
promptly
all
right
then
my
sweet
son
of
a
gun
lay
your
weight
on
that
broom
and
let
her
rip
d
ye
hear
aye
aye
sir
nelson
for
that
be
his
name
straighten
himself
and
cruelly
smile
observe
the
sailor
who
be
scrub
and
holy
stone
with
exemplary
industry
and
then
move
towards
them
discharge
salvo
of
blasphemy
on
their
head
of
vary
force
and
character
i
wonder
as
between
the
tremendous
oath
i
heard
the
sigh
of
the
sea
and
the
moan
of
the
wind
how
long
the
almighty
would
restrain
his
hand
i
scrubbed
away
until
i
become
heat
but
my
thought
be
far
from
my
work
i
be
try
to
unravel
vague
idea
about
the
oddness
of
thing
in
this
world
it
seem
to
me
surprising
that
while
so
many
people
on
land
fear
to
take
the
name
of
god
in
vain
men
on
the
great
sea
surround
by
peril
and
wonder
could
shout
aloud
their
defiance
of
heaven
and
hell
there
be
not
a
soul
on
board
with
whom
i
could
exchange
my
inner
thought
and
from
this
period
i
contract
a
habit
of
commune
with
myself
at
eight
bell
i
be
told
i
belong
to
nelson
the
second
mate
watch
and
that
my
berth
be
with
harry
in
the
apprentice
cabin
on
the
main
deck
there
be
no
mention
of
the
cabin
boy

when
the
watch
be

harry
and
i
have
a
talk
this
boy
have
already
make
one
voyage
on
the
windermere
and
though
he
despise
greenhorn
among
whom
he
class
me
he
be
pleased
to
be
good
natured
with
me
probably
because
i
show
such
deference
to
his
spirit
and
experience
he
graciously
promise
to
coach
me
or
rather
put
me
up
to
the
rope
that
i
might
avoid
a
few
of
the
punishment
mate
be
so
quick
to
bestow
on
dull
ship
boy
when
i
told
him
that
i
have
be
engage
as
cabin

he
be
uncommonly
amuse
and
say
that
the
skipper

at
his
old
game
on
the
last
voyage
we
have
two
boy
who
have
be
induced
to
join

the
same
way

as
soon
as
we
be
out
to
sea
nelson
get
a
hint
from
the
cappen
and
fell
on
them
like
a
thousand
of
brick
and
chase
them
forrard
pretty
quick
i
tell
ye
they
be
bully
rag
all
the
way
to

orleans
and
at
the
pier

slop
leave
their
sea
dud
to
me
we
make
a
good
thing

of
the
young
duffer

have
clear
twenty
five
dollar
in

have
but
how
do
the
captain
make
twenty
five
dollar
by
the
boy
on
the
last
voyage
how
well
you
be
a
goose
why
they
left
their
wage
over
two
month
due
in
his
hand
when
they
ran
away
from
the
ship
for
fear
of
bad
treatment
go
home
aye
that
be
the
ticket
and
the
size
of
it
my
little
matey
haze
and
bully
the
young
lubber
well
at
sea
and
they
scoot
ashore
the
first
chance
they
get
be
the
mate
not
hard
on
you
oh
water
take
me
into
his
watch
and
show
a
like
for
me
for
you
see
i
be
not
quite
a
greeny
my
father
saw
me
properly
ship
and
i
sign
article
they
do
n
t
but
come
aboard
with
the
cappen
permission
and
so
do
you
the
skipper
have
to
account
for
me
when
he
get
to
port
but
you
you
may
be
blown
overboard
and
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
i
be
now
as
good
as
an
ordinary
seaman
though
too
young
for
the
forecastle
i
can
furl
royal
as
spry
as
any
bucco
sailor
on
board
and
know
every
rope
on
the
ship
while
you
do
not
know
stem
from
stem
these
glib
nautical
phrase
most
of
which
be
but
vaguely
understood
by
me
his
assurance
his
dare
his
want
of
feeung
make
me
admire
and
wonder
at
him
he
be
a
typical
sea
boy
with
a
glitter
in
his
eye
and
bloom
in
his
smooth
cheek
that
told
of
superabundant
health
and
hardiesse
but
for
one
thing
a
prince
might
have
be
proud
of
him
as
a
son
satan
i
thought
have
already
adopt
him
his
absolute
ignorance
of
religion
his
awful
coarseness
of
speech
remove
him
mile
away
from
me
as
though
he
be
a
brave
young
savage
of
another
nation
and
language
and
utterly
incomprehensible
to
me
he
be
not
to
be
imitate
in
any
way
and
yet
he
obtain
my
admiration
because
he
have
be
to
america
have
manfully
endure
the
torture
of
sea
life
and
bore
himself
indomitably
long
hart
the
cook
be
another
kind
of
hero
to
me
he
stood
over
six
foot
high
in
his
galley
felt
and
his
saffron
complexion
and
crease
neck
spoke
of
foreign
sims
maritime
romance
and
many
voyage
the
gold
earring
he
wore
i
suspect
belong
to
his
dead
wife
his
nethers
consist
of
black
doe
skin
his
body
be
case
in
a
dark
blue
jersey
and
a
blue
phrygian
cap
cover
his
head
he
disdain
the
use
of
sailor
colloquialism
and
spoke
like
a
school
master
in
very
grand
word
my
rustic
innocence
appear
to
have
an
attraction
for
him
on
the
second
even
after
my
recovery
he
offer
the
freedom
of
his
galley
to
me
and
when
i
brought
the
apprentice
kid
he
be
generous
in
his
helping
of
soft
tack
scouse
and
duff
during
the
dog
watch
he
spun
long
yam
about
his
experience
in
deep
sea
ship
and
voyage
to
callao
california
west
coast
of
africa
and
elsewhere
many
of
which
be
horrible
on
account
of
the
cruelty
practise
on
sailor
i
heard
of
poor
sailor
hoist
up
to
the
yard
arm
and
ducked
by
the
run
in
the
sea
until
they
be
nearly
drown
of
men
be
keel
haul
tie
stark
naked
to
the
windlass
and
subject
to
the
most
horrible
indignity
put
over
the
ship
side
to
scrub
the
ship
copper
in
the
roast
hot
sun
and
much
else
which
make
me
thankful
that
the
captain
of
the
day
be
not
so
cruel
as
those
twenty
year
back
his
condescension
to
a
young
lubber
like
myself
and
his
generosity
won
from
me
such
deference
and
civility
that
he
assume
a
kind
of
protectorship
over
me
and
assist
in
the
enlightenment
of
my
understand
about
many
thing
the
crew
consist
mainly
of
anglo
irish
dutchman
one
or
two
english
and
as
many
yankee
they
be
undisciplined
spirit
who
found
the
wild
sea
life
congenial
to
their
half
savage
nature
and
have
form
the
odd
notion
that
to
be
sailor
be
to
be
of
nobler
stufif
than
shoremen
and
ac
cordingly
swagger
magnificently
whenever
they
could
do
it
safely
for
some
reason
they
have
conceive
their
nobility
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
they
have
voluntarily
adopt
a
more
perilous
profession
than
any
practise
by
landsman
they
be
adore
by
the
girl
in
port
and
enjoy
the
privilege
of
gloriously
swear
whenever
they
chose
and
the
pleasure
of
this
conceit
give
them
happiness
shoremen
seldom
swore
except
the
dockmen
who
aped
sailor
manner
and
gait
they
go
to
church
fear
the
constable
seldom
get
drunk
or
go
on
a
spree
sport
glove
and
seem
afraid
of
work
when
they
catch
these
shore
lubber
at
sea
the
sailor
contempt
for
them
be
very
manifest
they
be
delighted
when
they
be
sea
sick
oath
and
blow
be
freely
dealt
to
them
they
take
pleasure
in
provoke
their
aversion
to
slush
and
tar
and
secretly
enjoy
their
cruel
treatment
by
the
mate
as
they
make
me
feel
my
inferiority
to
harry
i
have
since
witness
many
another
treat
in
the
same
way
poor
brute
consider
the
slave
life
they
lead
it
would
be
a
pity
to
deprive
them
of
this
miserable
consolation
the
discipline
of
the
windermere
be
well
begin
by
the
time
i
regain
health
it
be
the
pride
of
the
officer
that
though
the
windermere
be
not
a
black
ball
packet
she
be
big
and
smart
enough
to
be
one
and
they
be
resolve
that
the
custom
of
the
black
bailer
should
prevail
on
board
and
that
the
discipline
should
be
of
the
same
quality
whether
it
come
up
to
the
regulation
standard
i
do
not
know
but
just
as
francis
flog
beat
and
pummel
the
infant
under
his
charge
so
the
ruffian
mate
storm
swore
and
struck
or
boot
the
full
grown
wretch
on
board
the
windermere
the
captain
be
too
high
and
mighty
to
interfere
or
he
may
have
issue
his
order
to
that
purpose
and
be
satisfied
with
the
zealous
service
of
his
mate
at
any
rate
i
scarcely
heard
his
voice
except
during
gale
of
wind
and
then
it
be
stem
and
strident
strange
to
say
the
majority
of
the
sailor
prefer
the
american
ship
with
all
their
brutality
to
the
english
with
their
daily
dos
of
lime
juice
harry
long
hart
and
the
forecastle
argument
which
we
have
perforce
to
hear
as
our
den
adjoin
that
of
the
sailor
sufficiently
inform
me
of
the
fact
that
the
soft
tack
plum
duff
good
mess
beef
of
the
yankee
be
prefer
to
the
weevilly
biscuit
horse
beef
and
gill
of
lime
juice
of
the
british
give
me
say
a
forecastle
orator
a
yankee
ship
and
not
a
lousy
lime
juicer
even
on
the
bad
yankee
ship
afloat
no
bucco
sailor
need
fear
the
mate
if
a
man
know
his
duty
and
wo
not
shirk
he
be
safe
against
the
devil
himself
i
say
watch
bully
water
himself
he
never
drop
on
a
real
shell
back
but
on
some
infernal
land
lubber
who
have
ship
as
an
a
b
when
he
be
not
fit
to
carry
gut
to
a
bear
it
be
the
loutish
dutchman
and
swede
who
have
spoil
these
packet
ship
you
ca
not
expect
mate
in
a
squall
of
wind
that
may
whip
the
mast
off
to
stand
still
until
their
order
enter
the
stupid
head
of
a
dutchman
who
do
n
t
know
a
word
of
english
well
what
must
they
do
the
ship
be
their
first
duty
and
they
fly
at
the
dutchman
and
if
the
dutchman
do
not
understand
that
he
must
skip
he
must
stand
and
be
skin
there
be
my
sentiment
i
heard
such
defence
score
of
time
which
prof
that
the
bad
side
have
something
to
say
for
itself
it
may
have
be
the
shell
back
boast
or
harry
criticism
which
induced
me
when
on
deck
to
observe
more
closely
that
professional
superiority
which
make
the
bucco
sailor
so
fearless
it
seem
to
me
that
though
the
old
hand
knew
their
work
well
they
take
precious
care
to
do
as
little
as
possible
and
have
anyone
ask
me
after
i
have
get
safely
ashore
what
i
thought
of
them
i
should
have
say
that
they
do
more
dust
round
than
real
work
it
be
true
the
old
salt
be
loud
in
their
response
to
the
mate
command
that
they
lead
the
bowline
song
and
the
halliard
chant
be
cheerier
with
their
aye
ayes
belay
vast
haul
and
chorus
that
they
strove
whose
hand
should
be
uppermost
at
the
halliard
and
near
to
the
tackle
but
all
this
do
not
impress
me
so
much
as
they
might
think
it
do
when
the
officer
thunder
out
all
hand
shorten
sail
furl
top
gallant
sail
or
reef
topsail
the
shell
back
appear
to
delay
under
various
shifty
pretext
to
climb
up
the
rig
in
order
that
be
last
they
might
occupy
the
safe
position
at
the
bunt
of
the
sail
and
when
it
be
only
a
four
man
job
the
way
in
which
they
noisily
pass
the
word
along
without
offering
to
move
be
most
artful
at
serve
splice
and
steer
the
skill
of
the
old
hand
count
greatly
no
doubt
but
in
work
aloft
they
be
nowhere
compare
to
those
dutchman
and
norwegian
they
so
much
deride
they
be
in
fact
strategist
in
the
art
of
shirk
sometimes
the
sojering
as
it
be
call
be
a
little
too
conspicuous
and
then
bully
water
with
awful
energy
and
frantic
malice
drew
blood
from
old
salt
and
joskin
indiscriminately
with
iron
belaying
pin
and
kick
and
pound
until
i
sicken
at
the
sound
of
the
deadly
thud
and
the
face
stream
with
blood
but
i
be
compel
to
admit
that
for
some
day
after
there
would
be
a
more
spontaneous
briskness
to
obey
order
and
old
and
young
regard
the
fiery
mate
from
the
comer
of
their
eye
five
day
from
liverpool
there
suddenly
appear
on
deck
three
stowaway
two
irish
boy
of
about
fourteen
and
fifteen
and
an
irishman
rag
haggard
and
spiritless
from
hunger
sickness
and
confinement
of
course
they
have
to
undergo
the
ordeal
of
inspection
by
the
stem
captain
who
contemptuously
dismiss
them
as
though
they
be
too
vile
to
look
at
but
nelson
chivy
the
three
unfortunate
from
the
poop
to
the
bow
to
warm
their
cockle
as
he
phrase
it
the
cry
of
the
young
boy
be
shrillest
and
loud
but
when
he
afterwards
emerge
to
beg
food
we
guess
by
his
roguish
smile
that
he
have
be
least
hurt
harry
express
his
opinion
that
he
be
a
liverpool
rat
who
would
certainly
end
his
day
in
the
state
prison
curiously
enough
the
presence
of
these
two
young
stowaway
act
as
a
buffer
between
me
and
a
considerable
amount
of
inglorious
maul
which
nelson
for
practice
sake
would
have
inflict
on
my
royal
bengal
british
person
as
with
playful
devilry
he
admit
but
the
rogue
do
not
appear
to
be
very
sensitive
about
the
indignity
to
which
they
be
subject
the
young
paddy
disturbed
the
ship
with
shrill
scream
if
nelson
but
raise
his
hand
and
thus
his
rat
wit
save
him
often
o
flynn
the
eldest
boy
would
run
and
dodge
his
tormentor
until
nelson
who
seem
to
love
the
fun
of
lick
them
through
cunning
caught
them
and
then
the
cry
of
the
innocent
would
be
heart
rend
before
many
day
have
pass
i
have
discover
that
nelson
have
also
his
art
though
i
have
never
be
in
a
theatre
and
could
not
understand
at
first
why
one
man
should
assume
so
many
pose
i
should
have
be
blind
not
to
perceive
that
the
real
self
of
nelson
be
kept
in
reserve
and
that
he
amuse
himself
by
behaving
differently
to
each
on
board
he
have
one
way
with
the
captain
another
with
his
colleague
and
various
be
the
style
he
assume
before
the
sailor
from
profound
deference
to
captain
hardinge
and
respectful
fellowship
with
water
he
gradually
rise
in
his
own
estimation
as
he
address
himself
to
the
low
grade
until
to
me
he
be
arrogance
personify
and
to
the
stowaway
a
bom
hellian
with
harry
he
indulge
in
broad
irony
to
the
more
stodgy
of
the
crew
he
be
a
champion
prize
fighter
to
others
he
spoke
with
a
dangerous
smoothness
with
lip
retract
but
bdiind
every
character
he
adopt
stood
the
real
nelson
a
ferocious
and
short
temper
brute
ready
to
blaze
up
into
bloody
violence
until
we
be
abreast
of
biscay
bay
we
experienced
no
bad
weather
but
roll
along
comfortably
under
moderate
breeze
with
a
spiteful
gust
or
two
i
be
gradually
become
season
and
indifferent
to
the
swing
swang
of
the
sea
as
nelson
say
with
a
condescend
but
evil
smile
i
be
fresh
as
a
daisy
the
gale
and
tempest
about
which
harry
and
long
hart
love
to
talk
be
so
long
a
come
that
i
doubt
whether
the
sea
be
really
so
very
dreadful
or
that
the
canvas
tower
would
ever
need
to
be
take
in
from
sunrise
down
to
the
decline
of
day
our
mast
head
drew
apparently
the
same
regular
line
and
curve
against
a
clear
sky
but
now
the
blue
disappear
under
depth
of
cloud
which
intensified
into
blackness
very
rapidly
and
the
whistle
whisper
in
the
shroud
change
their
note
the
sea
abandon
its
mechanical
heave
and
languid
upshoot
of
scatter
crest
whether
the
sky
have
signal
the
change
and
the
sea
obeyed
or
whether
the
element
be
act
simultaneously
i
knew
not
but
just
as
the
cloudiness
have
deepen
a
shadow
pass
over
the
ocean
until
it
be
almost
black
in
colour
and
then
to
windward
i
could
see
battalion
after
battalion
of
white
cap
rush
gaily
exultingly
towards
us
the
watch
be
muster
captain
and
mate
appear
with
oil
skin
ready
and
when
the
wind
begin
to
sing
in
louder
note
and
the
great
packet
surge
over
on
her
side
and
the
water
shot
through
the
scupper
the
captain
shook
his
head
dispar
ingly
and
cry
shorten
sail
mr
water
in
with
royal
and
top
gallant
sail
down
with
the
fly
jib
etc
etc
this
be
the
period
when
i
thought
mr
water
be
at
his
grandest
his
trumpet
like
voice
be
heard
in
larum
tone
as
though
the
existence
of
a
fleet
be
at
stake
and
every
man
jack
seem
electrify
and
flew
to
his
duty
with
all
ardour
nor
be
nelson
behind
water
in
energy
the
warn
sound
of
the
wind
have
announce
that
intensity
of
action
be
expect
from
every
soul
the
wave
leap
over
the
high
foreboard
and
the
ship
be
press
over
until
the
deck
be
as
steep
as
the
roof
of
a
churdi
and
a
foam
cataract
impend
over
us
then
it
be
the
mate
bawl
out
aloud
and
sailor
clamber
up
the
shroud
in
a
frenzy
of
briskness
and
the
deck
hand
bawl
and
sang
after
a
fashion
i
have
not
heard
before
while
block
tam
tammed
recklessly
great
sail
sheet
dance
wildly
in
the
air
and
every
now
and
then
a
thunder
sound
from
bursting
canvas
add
to
the
general
excitement
though
somewhat
bewilder
by
the
windy
blast
the
uproar
of
rush
water
and
the
fury
of
captain
and
crew
i
could
not
help
be
fascinate
by
the
scene
and
admire
the
passionate
energy
of
officer
and
crew
a
gale
at
sea
be
as
stimulate
as
a
battle
when
the
area
of
sail
have
be
reduce
to
the
limit
of
safety
we
have
a
clearer
view
fore
and
aft
and
i
have
more
leisure
to
usten
to
the
wind
music
in
the
shroud
to
observe
the
graver
aspect
of
the
sea
and
to
be
influence
by
unspeakable
impression
what
a
power
this
invisible
element
which
have
stir
the
sea
to
madness
be
if
i
raise
my
head
above
the
bulwark
it
fill
my
eye
with
tear
tore
at
my
hair
drove
up
my
nostril
with
such
force
as
to
make
me
gasp
it
flew
up
our
trouser
and
imder
our
oilskin
jacket
and
inflate
us
imtil
we
resemble
the
plumpest
effigy
conceivable
in
the
height
of
the
turmoil
while
try
to
control
my
idea
i
be
startle
by
the
penetrate
voice
of
water
sing
in
my
ear
now
my
young
pudding
face
joker
why
be
you
stand
ing
here
with
your
mouth
wide
open
get
a
swab
you
monkey
and
swab
up
this
poop
or
i
will
jump
down
your
throat
look
alive
now
you
sweet
scent
son
of
a
sea
cook
that
first
voyage
of
mine
be
certainly
a
remarkable
one
be
it
only
for
the
new
fangled
vocabulary
i
be
constantly
hearing
every
sentence
contain
some
new
word
or
phrase
coin
extempore
and
accentuate
by
a
rope
end
or
ungentle
back
hander
with
gutter
adjective
and
explosive
epithet
every
order
appear
to
require
the
force
of
a
gather
passion
as
though
obedience
be
impossible
without
it
from
this
date
begin
i
think
the
note
of
a
strange
coinci
dence
which
hiis
since
be
so
common
with
me
that
i
accept
it
as
a
rule
when
i
pray
for
a
man
it
happens
that
at
that
moment
he
be
curse
me
when
i
praise
i
be
slander
if
i
commend
i
be
revile
if
i
feel
affectionate
or
sympathetic
towards
one
it
be
my
fate
to
be
detest
or
scorn
by
him
i
first
notice
this
curious
coincidence
on
board
the
windermere
i
bore
no
grudge
and
thought
no
evil
of
any
person
but
prayed
for
all
morning
and
even
extol
the
courage
strength
and
enei
of
my
ship
mate
liken
them
to
sea
lion
and
felt
it
an
honour
to
be
in
the
company
of
such
brave
men
but
invariably
they
damn
my
eye
my
face
my
heart
my
soul
my
person
my
nationality
i
be
damn
aft
and
damn
forward
i
be
wholly
obnoxious
to
everyone
aboard
and
the
only
service
they
ask
of
god
towards
me
be
that
he
should
damn
me
to
all
eternity
it
be
a
new
idea
that
come
across
my
mind
my
memory
clung
to
it
as
a
novelty
and
at
every
instance
of
the
coincidence
i
become
more
and
more
confirm
that
it
be
a
rule
as
apply
to
me
but
until
it
be
establish
i
continued
to
bless
those
who
persecute
me
with
their
hideous
curse
i
be
glad
to
think
that
i
be
sustain
by
a
belief
that
i
be
do
right
for
without
it
i
should
have
give
scope
to
a
ferocious
and
blasphemous
resentment
it
cheer
me
with
a
hope
that
by
and
by
their
curse
would
be
blessing
and
in
the
meantime
my
mind
be
become
as
impervious
to
such
trouble
as
a
swan
back
to
a
shower
of
rain
harry
on
the
contrary
make
a
distinction
he
allow
no
one
to
curse
him
except
the
officer
when
a
sailor
venture
to
swear
at
him
he
return
the
swear
with
interest
and
clenched
his
fist
ready
for
the
violent
sequel
he
have
long
ago
overcome
the
young
boy
squeamishness
at
an
oath
if
anything
he
be
rather
prone
to
take
the
boy
advantage
over
a
man
and
dare
him
to
prove
himself
a
coward
by
strike
one
young
and
weaker
it
be
a
cunning
method
of
fence
which
i
have
since
found
be
frequently
practise
by
those
who
cannot
without
loss
of
manliness
resort
to
scream
when
i
confide
to
him
that
the
crew
of
the
windermere
be
a
very
wicked
set
he
say
the
windermere
be
heaven
compare
to
a
black
bail
packet
ship
i
believe
that
he
would
have
like
to
see
more
belaying
pin
and
marline
spike
thrown
at
the

by
the

the

when
about
four
day
from

they
suddenly
abstain
from
physical
violence
and
except
by
intermittent
fit
of
mild

sarcasm
they
discontinue

before

be
jovially
ebullient
i
heard
one
sailor
remark
upon
this
sudden
change
of
demeanour
in
them
that
the
mate
knew
when
to
bout
face
and

that

hand
could
tell
how
near
they
be
to
the
levee
by
the
way
yankee
mate
behave
and
that
there
be
no
place
so
unwholesome
for
bully
as
the
new

levee
another
sailor

of
the
opinion
that
the

be
more
afraid
of

up
before
the

he
have
often

our

another
of
similar
size
in
tow
and
proceed
up
the
river
with
us
we
be
kept
very
busy
prepare
the
vessel
for
port
but
i
have
abundant
opportunity
to
note
the
strange
shore
and
the
appearance
of
the
great
of
american
river
after
several
hour
steam
we
pass
english
turn
which
harry
described
as
the
place
where
the
english
be
lick
by
the
american
on
the
th
of
january
a
story
that
be
then
incredible
to
me
after
an
ascent
of
about
one
hundred
mile
up
the
river
we
come
in
view
of
the
chief
port
of
the
mississippi
valley
and
in
due
time
our
vessel
become
one
of
three
lie
at
a
pier
head
point
up
among
a
seemingly
countless
number
of
ship
and
river
steamer
range
below
and
above
our
berth
the
boarding
house
tout
pour
aboard
and
take
possession
of
the
sailor
and
before
many
minute
harry
and
i
alone
remain
of
the
crew
that
have
brought
the
big
windermere
across
the
sea
to
new
orleans
though
about
thirty
five
year
have
elapse
since
i
first
stood
upon
the
levee
of
the
crescent
city
scarcely
one
of
all
my
tumultuous
sensation
of
pleasure
wonder
and
curiosity
have
be
forgotten
by
me
the
levee
slop
down
with
a
noble
breadth
to
the
river
and
stretch
for
mile
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
city
and
be
crowd
with
the
cargo
of
the
hundred
of
vessel
which
lay
broadside
to
it
in
some
place
the
freight
lay
in
mountainous
heap
but
the
barrel
and
hogshead
and
cotton
bale
cover
immense
space
though
arrange
in
precise
order
and
with
the
multitude
of
men
white
red
black
yellow
horse
mule
and
dray
and
wagon
the
effect
of
such
a
scene
with
its
fierce
activity
and
new
atmosphere
upon
a
raw
boy
from
st
asaph
may
be
well
imagine
than
described
during
my
fifty
two
day
of
ship
life
there
have
filter
into
my
mind
curious
idea
respect
the
new
land
of
america
and
the
character
of
the
people
in
a
large
measure
they
be
more
complimentary
than
otherwise
but
the
levee
of
new
orleans
carry
with
its
name
a
reputation
for
sling
shot
doctor
liquor
shanghai
ing
and
wharf
rat
which
make
it
a
dubious
place
for
me
when
harry
direct
my
attention
to
the
numerous
liquor
saloon
front
the
river
side
all
the
scandalous
story
i
have
heard
of
knife
fight
and
manslaughter
recur
at
once
to
my
mind
and
make
me
very
shy
of
these
haunt
of
villainy
and
devilry
as
he
could
not
forego
the
pleasure
of
introduce
me
to
a
city
which
he
have
constantly
praise
he
insist
that
i
should
accompany
him
for
a
walk
that
first
night
up
tchapitoulas
street
and
to
some
diggins
where
he
have
acquaintance
i
accepted
his
invitation
without
any
misgive
or
any
other
thought
than
of
satisfy
a
natural
curiosity
i
think
it
be
one
of
the
most
vivid
recollection
i
posse
the
detail
of
my
first
impression
and
an
analysis
of
my
thought
would
fill
many
page
of
the
thousand
of
british
boy
who
have
land
in
this
city
i
fancy
none
be
so
utterly
unsophisticated
as
myself
for
reason
which
have
already
be
related
directly
the
sun
be
set
we
be
relieve
from
duty
and
be
allow
liberty
to
go
ashore
we
flew
over
the
plank
laid
across
the
ship
light
as
young
fawn
and
when
i
felt
the
shore
under
my
foot
i
have
to
relieve
myself
by
an
ecstatic
whirl
or
two
about
harry
cry
out
at
last
at
last
new
orleans
it
be
too
good
to
be
true
i
be
nearly
overwhelmed
with
blissful
feel
that
rise
from
emancipation
i
be
free
and
i
be
happy
yes
actually
happy
for
i
be
free
at
last
the
boy
be
free
we
race
across
the
levee
for
joy
begets
activity
and
activity
be
infectious
what
be
a
vivid
joy
to
me
be
the
delight
of
gratify
pride
to
harry
i
told
you
he
say
beam
what
new
orleans
be
be
it
not
grand
but
grand
do
not
convey
its
character
as
it
appear
to
my
fresh
young
eye
some
other
word
be
want
to
express
the
whole
of
what
i
felt
the
soft
balmy
air
with
its
strange
scent
of
ferment
molasses
semi
bake
sugar
green
coffee
pitchy
stockholm
tar
brine
of

a
great
deal

the
charm
of
romance
to
everything
i
saw
the
people
i
pass
appear
to
me
to
be
nobler
than
any
i
have
see
they
have
a
swing
of
the
body
wholly
un
english
and
their
facial
expression
differ
from
those
i
have
be
accustom
to
i
strove
hard
to
give
a
name
to
what
be
so
unusual
now
of
course
i
know
that
it
be
the
sense
of
equality
and
independence
that
make
each
face
so
different
from
what
i
have
see
in
liverpool
these
people
knew
no
master
and
have
no
more
awe
of
their
employer
than
they
have
of
their
fellow
employee
we
reach
the
top
of
tchapitoulas
street
the
main
commercial
artery
of
the
city
the
people
be
throng
home
from
the
business
quarter
to
the
more
residential
part
they
pass
by
in
many
hundred
with
their
lunch
bucket
and
though
soil
by
their
labour
they
be
not
weary
or
depressed
in
the
vicinity
of
poydras
street
we
halt
before
a
boarding
house
where
harry
be
welcome
with
the
warmth
which
be
the
due
of
the
return
voyager
he
order
dinner
and
with
appetite
sharpen
by
youth
and
ocean
air
we
sat
down
to
a
spread
of
viand
which
be
as
excellent
as
they
be
novel
okra
soup
grit
sweet
potato
brinjails
com
scone
mush
pudding
and
fixing
every
article
but
the
bread
be
strange
and
toothsome
harry
appropriate
my
praise
of
the
meal
to
himself
paid
for
it
with
the
air
of
one
whose
purse
be
deep
beyond
sounding
and
then
invest
a
silver
piece
in
cigar
for
american
boy
always
smoke
cigar
and
when
in
new
orleans
english
boy
love
to
imitate
them
now
when
i
step
on
the
levee
frisky
as
a
lamb
i
be
about
as
good
as
a
religious
observance
of
the
commandment
can
make
one
to
me
those
be
the
principal
boundary
stone
that
separate
the
region
of
right
from
that
of
wrong
between
the
great
landmark
there
be
many
well
know
minor
index
but
there
be
some
which
be
almost
un
discoverable
to
one
so
young
and
untravelled
as
i
be
only
the
angelically
immaculate
could
tread
along
the
limit
of
right
and
wrong
without
a
misstep
after
dinner
we
saunter
through
a
few
street
in
a
state
of
sweet
content
and
by
and
by
enter
another
house
the
proprietress
of
which
be
extremely
gracious
harry
whis
pered
something
to
her
and
we
be
show
to
a
room
call
a
parlour
presently
there
bounce
in
four
gay
young
lady
in
such
scant
clothing
that
i
be
speechless
with
amazement
my
ignorance
of
their
profession
be
profound
and
i
be
willing
enough
to
be
enlighten
but
when
they
proceed
to
take
liberty
with
my
person
they
seem
to
me
to
be
so
appallingly
wicked
that
i
shook
them
off
and
flee
out
of
the
house
harry
follow
me
and
with
all
the
art
he
could
use
try
to
induce
me
to
return
but
i
would
as
soon
have
jumped
into
the
gruel
colour
mississippi
as
have
look
into
the
eye
of
those
giggle
wanton
again
my
disgust
be
so
great
that
i
never
in
after
year
could
overcome
my
repugnance
to
female
of
that
character
then
harry
persuade
me
to
enter
a
bar
room
and
call
for
liquor
but
here
again
i
be
obstinate
drink
yourself
if
you
like
say
i
but
i
belong
to
the
band
of
hope
and
have
sign
the
pledge
so
i
must
not
well
smoke
then
do
something
like
other
fellow
he
say
offering
me
my
choice
as
i
have
never
heard
that
smoking
be
a
moral
off
ence
and
have
a
desire
to
appear
manly
i
weakly
yield
and
put
a
great
cigar
between
my
lip
puffed
proudly
and
with
vigour
but
ala
my
punishment
be
swift
my
head
seem
to
swim
and
my
limb
be
seize
with
a
tremble
and
while
vainly
try
to
control
myself
a
surge
of
nausea
quite
overpower
me
and
i
try
to
steal
back
to
the
ship
as
abjectly
contrite
as
ever
repentant
wretch
could
well
be
thus
end
my
first
night
at
new
orleans
harry
story
of
the
two
english
boy
who
have
be
compel
to
abscond
from
the
windermere
the
voyage
before
recur
to
me
more
than
once
after
nelson
greet
next
morning
hello
you
here
still
i
thought
you
have
vamoose
like
the
irish
stowaway
not
enough
physic
eh
well
sonny
we
must
see
what
we
can
do
for
you
i
be
put
to
cleaning
brass
work
a
mechanical
occupation
that
breed
thought
if
attract
by
a
lively
levee
scene
i
lift
my
eye
one
or
other

out
now
you
scalawag
or
you

with
that
work
you
putty

son
of
a

so
on
ever
some
roar
blasphemy
some
hideous
epithet
with
a
kick
or
a
clout
until
on
the
fifth
day
conviction
stole
upon
every
sense
that
it
be
to
a
set
purpose
and
my
small
remnant
of
self
respect
kindle
into
a
revolt
i
understand
now
that
it
be
the
pitiful
sum
of
money
due
to
me
they
wish
to
save
for
the
ship
owner
or
captain
that
prevent
them
from

may
go
and
be
to
you
such
a
dismissal

a
settlement
just
as
moses
owen

the
moral
courage
to
despatch
me
from
his
presence
these
men
be
at
the
same
game
of
nag
and
it
succeed
in
inspire
indifference
as
to
what
would
become
of
me
i
could
say
at
last
well
to
rot
on
this
foreign
strand
than
endure
this
slave
life
longer
that
even
i
decline
to
go
ashore
with
harry
and
sat
ponder
in
the
loneliness
of
my
cabin
and
prayer
somewhat
fall
into
disuse
of
late
be

and
i
rise
from
my
knee
prim
for
the
venture
habit
of
association
as
usual
with
me
have
knit
some
bond
of
attachment
between
me
and
the
ship
she
connect
me
with
england
by
her
i
come
and
by
her
i
could
return
now
that
be
impossible
i
must
follow
the
stowaway
and
leave
the
float
hell
for
ever
i
lit
the
swing
pewter
lamp
empty
my
sea
bag
on
the
floor
and
out
of
its
content
picked
my
best
shore
clothes
and
the
bishop
bible
i
dress
myself
with
care
and
blowing
out

down
by

by
harry

in
half
stupefy
with
his
excess
roll
into
his
bunk
above

and
when
he
be
unconscious
i
rise
and

out
five
minute
later
i
be
hurry
rapidly
along
the
river
side
of
the
levee

when
about
half
a
mile
from
the
ship
i
plunge
into
the
shadow
cause
by
a
pile
of

after

absolutely
penniless
have
a
choice
of
two
thing
work
or
starve
no
boy
of
my
age
and
vitality
could
deliberately
choose
starvation
the
other
alternative
remain
to
me
and
for
work
work
of
any
kind
i
be
most
ready
with
a
strong
belief
that
it
be
the
only
way
to
achieve
that
beautiful
independence
which
sat
so
well
on
those
who
have
succeed
i
be
quite
of
the
opinion
of
my
aunt
mary
that
roll
stone
gather
no
moss
and
i
want
permanent
work
wherein
i
could
approve
myself
steady
and
zealously
industrious
hitherto
i
have
be
most
unfortunate
in
the
search
respectful
civility
prompt
obedience
and
painstaking
zeal
have
be
at
a
discount
but
such
be
the
buoyancy
of
healthy
youth
i
still
retain
my
faith
that
decent
employment
be
within
reach
of
the
diligent
and
it
be
this
that
i
be
now
bent
upon
hasten
across
the
levee
i
enter
the
great
commercial
street
of
the
city
at
a
point
not
far
from
st
thomas
street
and
after
a
little
inward
debate
continued
down
tchapitoulas
street
along
the
sidewalk
with
all
my
sens
wide
awake
i
read
every
sign
reflectively
the
store
owner
name
be
mostly
foreign
and
suggestive
of
teutonic
and
hibernian
origin
but
the
large
building
be
of
undeniable
anglo
saxon
at
the
outset
lager
beer
saloon
be
frequent
then
follow
more
shanty
with
rusty
tin
roof
but
beyond
these
the
store
be
more
massive
and
uniform
and
over
the
door
w
re
the
inscription
produce
and
commission
merchant
etc
as
i
proceed
look
keenly
about
for
the
favourable
chance
the
door
be
flung
open
one
by
one
and
i
obtain
a
view
of
the
interior
negro
commenced
to
sweep
the
long
alley
between
the
good
pile
and
to
propel
the
dust
and
rubbish
of
the
previous
day

towards
the
open
gutter

out
and

built
up
sack
be
laid
in
orderly
layer
await
removal
by
the
dray
which
at
a
later
hour
would
convey
them
to
the
river
steamer
soon
after
seven
i
have
arrive
near
the
end
of
the
long
street
and
i
could
see
the
colossal
custom
house
and
its
immense
scaffold
so
far
i
have
not
address
myself
to
a
single
soul
and
i
be
think
i
should
have
to
search
in
another
street
when
just
at
this
time
i
saw
a
gentleman
of
middle
age
seat
in
front
of
no
store
reading
a
morning
newspaper
from
his
sober
dark
alpaca
suit
and
tall
hat
i
take
him
to
be
the
proprietor
of
the

back
against
what
appear
to
be
the
solid
granite
frame
of
the
door
with
a
leisured
ease
which
be
a
contrast
to
the
activity
i
have
previously
notice
after
a
second
look
at
the
respectable
figure
and

time
however
mr

as
to
a
big
brother

all
sort
of
question

the
gentleman
who
have
take
me
out
of
the
street
and
start
me
so
pleasantly
in
life
from
mr
richardson
i
learn
that
he
be
a
kind
of
broker
who
dealt
between
planter
up

and
merchant
in

in
st
charles
street
in
a
first
class
boarding
house
and
from
the
style
mr
and
mr
stanley
kept
up
he
thought
they
must
be
pretty
well
off
this
be
the
extent
of
the
information
mr
richardson
could
give
me
which
be
most
gratify
and
assure
me
that
i
have
at
least
one
friend
in
the
strange
city
there
have
be
several
memorable
occasion
in
my
life
but
among
them
this
first
initial
stage
towards
dignity
and
independence
must
ever
be
prominent
what
a
proud
glad
holiday
spirit
move
me
then
i
soon
become
sensible
of
a
kindle
elation
of
feel
for
the
speech
of
all
to
me
be
as
though
everyone
recognise
that
i
have
enter
into
the
great
human
fraternity
the
abruptness
of
the
transition
from
the
slave
of
yesterday
into
the
free
man
of
to
day
endow
with
a
sacred
inviolability
of
person
astonish
me
only
a
few
hour
ago
i
be
as
one
whose
skull
might
be
smash
at
the
impulse
of
a
moment
and
now
in
an
instant
as
it
be
i
be
free
of
the
severe
thraldom
and
elevate
to
the
rank
of
man
messrs
kennicy
and
richardson
be
good
type
of
free
spoken
young
america
they
be
both
touchy
in
the
extreme
and
on
point
of
personal
honour
highly
intolerant
america
breed
such
people
by
thousand
who
appear
to
live
eternally
on
the
edge
of
resentment
and
to
be
as
inflammable
as
tinder
it
be
dangerous
to
deal
with
them
in
badinage
irony
sarcasm
or
what
we
call
chaff
before
the
expiration
of
the
first
day
i
have
note
that
their
high
spirit
scarcely
brook
a
reproof
or
contradiction
the
slightest
approach
to
anything
of
the
kind
excite
them
to
a
strange
heat
when
i
saw
that
they
become
undisguisedly
angry
because
mr
speake

more
spruce

very
high
indeed

me
to
such
a
degree
that

the
severe
moses
thence
into
that
of
uncle
tom
and
afterwards
have
taste
of
the
terrible
discipline
of
an
american
packet
ship
draconian
rule
have
be
prescribed
the
birch
hung
ever
in

but
within
a
few
week
of
arrive
in
america
i
have
become
different
in
temper
and
spirit
that
which
be
natural
in
me
though
so
long
repress
have
sprung
out
very
quickly
under
the
peculiar
influence
of
my
surroundings
the
childish
fear
of
authority
have
flee
for
authority
no
longer
wore
its
stem
relentless
aspect
but
be
sweetly
reasonable
those
who
exercise
it
be
gentle
and
sociable
and
i
repaid
them
with
respect
and
gratitude
to
them
i
owe
my
happiness
and
my
new
feel
of
dignity
make
me
stretch
myself
to
my
full
height
and
revel
luxuriously
in
fond
idea
i
possess
property
in
my
person
which
i
instinctively
value
and
felt
bound
to
cultivate
the
two
foot
square
of
the
street
i
occupy
be
mine
for
the
time
be
and
no
living
man
could
budge
me
except
at
his
peril
the
view
of
the
sky
be
as
freely
mine
as
another
these
american
right
do
not
depend
on
depth
of
pocket
or
stature
of
a
man
but
every
baby
have
as
much
claim
to
them
as
the
proudest
merchant
neither
poverty
nor
youth
be
degrade
nor
be
it
liable
to
abuse
from
wealth
or
age
besides
my
youth
activity
and
intelligence
of
which
i
have
be
taught
the
value
i
have
become
conscious
of
the
fact
that
i
possess
privilege
of
free
speech
free
opinion
immunity
from
insult
oppression
and
the
contempt
of
class
and
that
throughout
america
my
treatment
from
men
would
solely
depend
upon
my
individual
character
without
regard
of
family
or
pedigree
these
be
proud
thought
i
respire
more
freely
my
shoulder
rise
considerably
my
back
straighten
my
stride
become
longer
as
my
mind
comprehend
this
new
feel
of
independence
to
the
extent
of
so
much
i
could
not
be
indebted
to
any
man
living
but
for
the
respectability
of
the
cover
and
comfort
of
the
body
and
the
extension
of
my
right
to
more
ground
than
i
could
occupy
stand
i
must
work
inspire
of
these
thought
i
be
become
as
un
english
in
disposition
as
though
i
have
be
forty
year
in
the
land
and
as
old
sir
thomas
browne
put
it
of
a
constitution
so
general
that
it
consort
and
sympathise
with
thing
american
my
british
antipathy
and
proclivity
be
drop
from
me
as
rapidly
as
the
littleness
of
my
servile
life
be
replace
by
the
felicity
of
freedom
i
share
in
the
citizen
pride
in
their
splendid
port
the
length
and
stability
of
their
levee
their
unparalleled
line
of
shipping
their
magnificent
array
of
steamer
and
their
majestic
river
i
believe
with
them
that
their
custom
house
when
complete
would
be
a
matchless
edifice
that
canal
street
be
unequalled
for
its
breadth
that
tchapitoulas
street
be
beyond
compare
the
busiest
street
in
the
world
that
no
market
equal
those
of
new
orleans
for
their
variety
of
produce
and
that
no
city
not
even
liverpool
could
exhibit
such
mercantile
enterprise
or
such
a
smart
go
ahead
spirit
as
old
and
young
manifest
in
the
chief
city
of
the
south
i
be
not
sure
that
i
have
lose
all
that
lively
admiration
yet
though
i
have
since
see
dozen
of
city
more
populous
more
cultivate
and
more
opulent
many
year
of
travel
have
not
extinguish
my
early
faith
but
it
would
require
age
to
eradicate
my
affection
for
the
city
which
first
taught
me
that
a
boy
may
become
a
man
have
the
joylessness
of
boyhood
endure
a
few
year
longer
it
be
probable
that
the
power
of
joyousness
would
have
dry
up
but
fortunately
though
i
have
see
fifteen
summer
i
be
a
mere
child
in
experience
it
be
only
eighteen
month
since
i
have
left
st
asaph
and
but
two
month
and
a
half
since
i
have
enter
the
world
outside
my
family
since
i
become
a
man
i
have
often
wonder
what
would
have
become
of
me
have
my
melt
mood
that
last
night
at
roscommon
street
last
a
little
longer
it
be
the
turn
point
of
my
life
i
be
dispose
to
think
and
it
be
good
for
me
to
have
have
the
courage
to
say
no
at
that
critical
moment
a
trifle
more
perseverance
on
the
part
of
uncle
tom
would
have
overcome
my
inclination
for
departure
from
england
and
make
me
a
fixture
within
his
own
class
on
that
occasion
my
weakly
half
hearted
negative
serve
me
to
good
purpose
but
i
should
have
be
spar
many
trial
have
i
be
educate
to
utter
my
no
more
often
more
loudly
and
more
firmly
than
i
have
and
i
suppose
most
men
have
have
cause
to
condemn
that
unsatisfactory
education
which
sent
them
into
the
world
so
imperfectly
equip
for
moral
resistance
in
my
opinion
the
courage
to
deliver
a
proper
no
ought
to
be
cultivate
as
soon
as
a
child
intelligence
be
sufficiently
advanced
the
few
time
i
have
be
able
to
say
it
have
be
productive
of
immense
benefit
to
me
though
to
my
shame
be
it
say
i
yearn
to
say
yes
that
soft
habit
of
become
fondly
attach
to
association
which
make
me
weep
on
leave
st
asaph
ffynnon
beuno
brynford
liverpool
and
even
the
windermere
make
me
cling
to
my

in
the
house
of
mr
williams
my
increase
of
pay
enable
me
to
secure
a
large
and
more
comfortable

but
detest

i
remain

oc
cupant
my
self
denial

however
by
a
fine
surplus
of

furtively

as

the

of

about

that
on

sunday

would
be
glad
to
see
me
at
breakfast
when

to
an
ample
room

ously
furnish
and
introduce
me
to
a
fragile
little
lady
who
be
the
picture
of
refinement
my
reception
be
of
such
a
character
that
it
lead
me
to
believe
she
be
as
tender
and
mild
as
her
quiet
and
subdue
look
and
the
book
on
the
centre
table
make
me
think
her
pious
nothing
could
have
be
well
calculate
to
conquer
my
shyness
than
the
gracious
welcome
she
accord
me
we
take
our
respective
place
at
once
she
as
a
motherly
patroness
and
i
as
a
devotedly
grateful
prot
e
fully
sensible
of
what
be
due
to
her
as
the
wife
of
my
benefactor
her
husband
stood
tower
over
me
with
his
hand
on
my
head
and
an
encourage
smile
on
his
face
that
i
might
speak
out
without
fear
and
he
watch
the
impression
i
make
on
his
wife
the
ordeal
of
presentation
be
make
easy
through
her
natural
goodness
and
the
gentle
art
she
possess
of
win
my
confidence
she
place
me
on
a
divan
near
her
and
i
be
soon
prattle
away
with
a
glib
ness
that
a
few
minute
before
would
have
be
deem
impossible
to
such
a
stocky
boy
to
confine
within
a
sentence
my
impression
of
the
first
lady
i
ever
converse
with
be
entirely
beyond
my
power
there
be
an
atmosphere
about
her
in
the
first
place
which
be
wholly
new
the
elaborateness
and
richness
of
dress
the
purity
and
delicacy
of
her
face
the
exquisite
modulation
of
her
voice
the
distinctness
of
her
enunciation
and
the
sweet
courtesy
of
her
manner
i
will
not
say
awed
me
but
it
kindle
as
much
of
reverence
as
ever
i
felt
in
my
life
if
i
be
to
combine
this
with
a
feel
that
the
be
beside
me
might
command
me
to
endure
practically
any
torture
or
dare
any
danger
for
her
sake
it
will
perhaps
sum
up
the
effect
which
this
gentlewoman
make
on
my
raw
mind
it
be
at
this
hour
i
make
the
discovery
of
the
immense
distance
between
a
lady
and
a
mere
woman
and
while
i
gaze
at
her
clear
lustrous
eye
and
note
the
charm
which
played
about
her
feature
i
be
think
that
if
a
lady
could
be
so
superior
to
an
ordinary
housewife
with
her
careless
manner
of
speech
and
matter
of
fact
way
what
a
beautiful
thing
an
angel
must
be
when
we
adjourn
to
the
breakfast
table
i
found
more
material
to
reflect
upon
there
be
about
a
dozen
people
of
about
the
age
and
rank
of
mr
and
mr
stanley
at
the
table
and
it
struck
me
that
there
be
an
almost
impassable
a
loo
henry
m
stanley
gulf
between
me
and
them
their
conversation
be
beyond
my
understand
mostly
though
i
could
spell
and
interpret
each
word
but
the
subject
of
their
talk
left
me
in
the
cloud
their
remark
upon
literature
politics
and
social
life
seem
to
me
most
appropriate
to
book
but
it
surprised
me
to
think
that
people
could
exchange
so
much
learn
across
a
table
with
the
fluency
of
boy
discuss
the
quality
of
pudding
their
soothe
manner
of
address
the
mutual
respect
and
deferent
temper
greatly
elevate
them
above
my
coarsegrained
acquaintance
and
though
they
must
have
guess
by
my
manner
and
age
that
i
do
not
belong
to
their
sphere
they
paid
me
the
honour
of
include
me
in
their
courteous
circle
until
unconsciously
i
be
strain
to
acquit
myself
worthily
altogether
it
be
a
memorable
breakfast
and
when
i
reach
home
it
seem
to
me
that
fortune
be
about
to
spoil
me
otherwise
why
this
glow
and
pride
that
i
felt
after
this
sunday
my
acquaintance
with
mr
stanley
rapidly
ripen
into
something
exceed
common
gratitude
his
bearing
towards
me
be
different
from
that
which
anybody
else
show
to
me
many
be
kind
and
approve
but
nevertheless
no
one
stoop
to
court
my
notice
with
that
warm
genial
manner
which
distinguish
mr
stanley
i
felt
frequently
flatter
by
the
encomium
of
mr
speake
and
the
friendship
of
richardson
but
still
there
be
something
of
reserve
between
us
which
kept
me
somewhat
tongue
tie
in
their
presence
they
never
inquire
about
my
welfare
or
health
or
how
i
like
my
boarding
house
or
what
i
thought
of
anything
or
make
any
suggestion
which
would
stimulate
confidence
their
talk
with
me
be
all
about
the
business
appertain
to
the
store
or
some
hap
hsizard
remark
about
the
weather
or
some
scene
in
the
street
but
mr
stanley
way
be
as
though
it
specially
concerned
him
to
know
everything
about
me
personally
which
have
the
quality
of
draw
me
out
and
make
me
garrulous
to
the
verge
of
familiarity
so
little
by
little
i
come
to
regard
him
as
an
elderly
associate
with
such
a
charm
infectious
frankness
that
i
could
only
for
want
of
a
comparison
remember
my
affection
for
my
old
grandfather
as
correspond
with
the
mixed
feeling
of
regard
and
awe
i
have
towards
him
besides
to
be
in
his
company
even
for
a
brief
time
be
an
education
for
one
so
at
work
loi
ignorant
as
mysell
information
about
somebody
or
something
drop
from
his
lip
with
every
remark

about
the

of
the

custom
of
the
people
the
great
merchant

institution

a
great
interest
for
me
they
be
something
more
than
strange

for
repetition
they
have
association
which
reveal
personality
of
worth
colossal
munificence
remunerative
enterprise
etc
etc
every
sunday
morning
i
spent
with
the
stanley
and
the
instantaneous
impression
i
have
receive
of
their
goodness
be
more
than
confirm
mr
stanley
seem
to
become
at
each
visit
more
tender
and
caressingly
kind
in
the
same
manner
as
he
manifest
a
more
paternal
cordiality
i
yield
myself
wholly
to
their
influence
so
that
my
conduct
when
out
of
their
sight
be
govern
by
the
desire
to
retain
their
good
opinion
without
them
probably
my
love
of
book
would
have
prove
sufficient
safe
guard
against
the
baser
kind
of
temptation
but
with
them
i
be
render
almost
impregnable
to
vice
they
take
me
to
church
each
sabbath
and
in
other
way
manifest
a
protective
care
i
resume
the
custom
of
morning
and
even
prayer
my
industry
at
the
store
be
of
a
more
thoughtful
kind
my
coming
and
going
be
of
more
exemplary
punctuality
the
orderly
industrious
life
i
be
follow
not
only
ensure
me
the
friendship
of
the
stanley
but
won
me
favour
from
mr
speake
who
though
wear
often
a
somewhat
anxious
expression
restrain
himself
whenever
he
have
an
occasion
to
communicate
with
me
in
the
third
month
there
be
a
change
at
the
store
mr
speake
have
some
word
with
mr
kennicy
the
book
keeper
who
be
as
i
say
touchy
resign
on
the
spot
a
mr
j
d
kitchen
be
employ
in
his
stead
and
mr
speake
saw
fit
to
increase
my
salary
to
thirty
dollar
a
month
give
for
his
reason
the
fact
that
the
store
have
never
be
in
such
admirable
order
as
it
have
be
since
i
have
enter
it
i
be
immensely
proud
of
course
at
this
acknowledgement
but
it
be
only
natural
lliat
be
so
susceptible
and
impressionable
it
should
stimulate
me
to
great
effort
to
deserve
his
approbation
enlighten
me
as
it
do
in
duty
expect
of
me
it
might
be
say
to
have
increase
my
interest
in
the
condition
of
the
store
until
it
partook
of
that
which
a
fond
proprietor
might
feel
in
it
envious
or
ill
natured
people
might
have
say
it
be
fussy
or
officious
at
any
rate
this
disposition
to
have
everything
clean
to
keep
the
stack
in
orderly
arrangement
to
be
on
hand
when
want
to
keep
my
note
of
shipment
methodically
to
be
studiously
bent
upon
perfection
in
my
duty
lead
to
the
follow
incident
we
be
order
to
take
stock
and
while
counting
case
and
sack
and
barrel
etc
i
have
now
and
then
to
rearrange
the
stack
because
in
the
hurry
of
business
a
box
of
pickle
or
jam
have
become
mixed
with
biscuit
or
candle
box
and
in
handle
these
article
it
struck
me
that
several
of
them
be
uncommonly
light
i
mention
this
but
it
do
not
attract
much
attention
it
be
discover
also
that
the
coffee
sack
be
much
slacker
than
they
ought
to
be
but
though
the
rent
through
which
the
content
must
have
escape
appear
as
if
make
by
rat
as
the
quantity
of
berry
on
the
ground
be
inadequate
to
the
loss
i
knew
no
other
way
in
which
to
account
for
it
however
when
on
go
to
the
loft
we
gauge
the
content
of
the
wine
puncheons
and
syrup
barrel
and
found
them
to
be
half
empty
matter
begin
to
look
serious
the
leakage
on
the
floor
be
not
sufficient
to
explain
the
loss
of
so
many
gallon
and
the
discussion
between
the
book
keeper
and
shipping
clerk
suggest
trouble
when
the
old
man
would
be
inform
from
what
i
gather
the
former
book
keeper
mr
kennicy
be
suppose
to
be
in
fault
we
be
short
of
several
box
of
biscuit
sardine
and
other
article
and
it
seem
obvious
that
mr
kennicy
must
have
omit
to
enter
sale
on
his
book
and
thus
cause
this
unexpected
discrepancy
mr
speake
as
have
be
anticipate
exhibit
much
vexation
though
in
the
presence
of
mr
kitchen
and
mr
richardson
he
could
only
ask
querulously
how
could
such
article
disappear
in
such
a
disproportionate
manner
we
do
not
sell
by
retail
if
we
sell
wine
or
syrup
at
all
we
would
sell
by
the
cask
or
barrel
and
not
by
the
gallon
the
barrel
seem
to
tally
but
the
content
be
diminish
in
some
mysterious
manner
then
there
be
the
empty
case
of
which
this
boy
have
spoken
how
can
we
account
for
bottle
take
from
one
and
tin
from
another
the
invoice
be
checked
when
the
good
come
in
and
no
deficiency
be
report
to
me
there
be
gross
carelessness
somewhere
and
it
must
be
look
into
both
mr
kitchen
and
mr
richardson
under
this
argument
labour
under
the
sense
of
reproach
and
i
be
not
wholly
free
from
a
feel
of
remissness
i
strove
hard
to
remember
whether
in
convey
the
case
to
their
respective
pile
or
hoist
the
barrel
to
the
loft
a
suspicion
of
light
weight
have
enter
my
mind
and
while
fill
with
a
sense
of
doubt
and
misgive
i
proceed
to
hunt
for
a
broom
to
sweep
up
before
closing
i
found
one
in
the
comer
of
the
back
yard
but
on
draw
it
to
me
a
tin
lunch
bucket
be
disclose
the
sight
of
which
in
such
an
unexpected
place
suggest
that
the
broom
have
be
place
to
screen
it
from
view
on
take
hold
of
it
i
be
amaze
at
its
weight
but
on
lift
the
lid
i
no
longer
wonder
for
it
be
three
fourth
full
of
golden
syrup
it
flash
across
my
mind
that
here
be
the
solution
of
the
mystery
that
troubled
us
and
that
if
one
bucket
be
make
the
mean
of
surreptitiously
convey
golden
syrup
a
second
might
be
use
for
the
same
purpose
on
search
for
the
other
negro
bucket
i
found
it
place
high
above
my
reach
on
a
peg
and
under
his
outdoor
coat
seize
a
board
i
struck
it
underneath
and
a
few
drop
of
a
dark
aromatic
liquor
trickle
down
the
side
as
now
there
could
be
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
culprit
have
be
discover
i
hasten
to
the
office
to
give
my
information
by
great
good
luck
mr
stanley
appear
at
that
moment
and
i
at
once
acquaint
him
with
what
i
have
found
mr
richardson
join
us
and
when
he
have
heard
it
he
become
hotly
indignant
and
cry
i
see
it
all
now
come
on
let
us
inform
mr
speake
and
have
this
affair
clear
up
at
once

and
mr

be
in
the
office
turn
over

upon
them
with
the
discovery

be
go
on
for
goodness
know
how
long
while
breathlessly
discuss
the
matter
we
suddenly
remember
various
strange
proceeding
of
the
negro
and
our
suspicion
be
excite
that
there
must
be
certain
secret
nest
of
store
somewhere
in
the
building
and
richardson
and
i
be
sent
off
to
explore
the
same
idea
seem
to
be
in
our
mind
for
we
first
search
the
dark
alley
between
the
good
pile
and
in
a
short
time
we
have
lit
upon

secret
hoard

article
they
both
deny
all
knowledge
and
affected
the
ignorance
of
innocence
but
when
they
be
sharply
told
to
lead
us
to
their
tin

coffin
cover
with
muslin
but
the
ghastliness
of
death
be
somewhat
relieve
by
the
sunday
costume
in
which
the
defunct
merchant
be
clothed
when
the
traffic
of
the
street
have
cease
and
the
silence
of
the
night
have
fall
on
the
city
the
shadow
in
the
ilhit
room
grow
mysterious
about
midnight
i
doze
a
little
but
suddenly
woke
up
with
an
instinctive
feel
that
the
muslin
have
move
i
sprang
to
my
foot
and
memory
of
spectral
tale
be
revive
be
it
an
illusion
begotten
of
fear
be
mr
speake
really
dead
there
be
at
that
moment
another
movement
and
i
prepared
to
give
the
alarm
but
a
sacrilegious
meow
betrayed
the
character
of
the
ghost
a
second
later
it
be
fell
by
a
bolster
and
in
its
haste
to
escape
the
cat
entangle
its
claw
in
the
muslin
and
tore
and
spat
in
a
frenzy
but
this
be
the
mean
of
save
me
from
the
necessity
of
chase
the
wretched
animal
along
the
corridor
for
as
it
be
rush
through
the
door
i
caught
the
veil
the
next
day
a
long
procession
wound
through
the
street
towards
the
cemetery
the
place
of
interment
be
surround
by
a
high
wall
which
contain
several
square
tablet
commemorative
as
i
suppose
of
the
dead
lie
in
the
earth
but
i
be
much
shock
when
i
learn
that
behind
each
tablet
be
a
long
narrow
cell
wherein
body
be
corrupt
one
of
these
cell
have
just
be
open
and
be
destine
for
the
body
of
my
late
employer
but
unfortunately
for
my
feeling
not
far
off
lay
huddle
in
a
comer
the
relic
of
mortality
which
have
occupy
it
previously
and
which
have
be
ruthlessly
displace

a
short
time

assent
to
her

and
described
himself
as
have
left
liverpool
in
the
ship
pocahontas
as
a
cabin
boy
he
also
have
be
a
victim
to
the
hellish
brutality
of
american
at
sea
the
steward
apparently
have
be
as
callous
and
cruel
as
nelson
of
the
windermere
and
no
sooner
have
his
ship
touch
the
pier
than
the
boy
flee
as
from
a
fury
scarcely
anything
could
have
be
well
calculate
to
win
my
sympathy
than
the
recital
of
experience
similar
to
my
own
by
one
of
my
own
age
and
hail
from
the
same
port
that
i
have
come
from
dick
be
clever
and
intelligent
though
not
well
educate
but
to
make
up
for
his
deficiency
in
learn
he
be
gift
with
a
remarkable
fluency
and
have
one
of
the
cheeriest
laugh
and
a
prettiness
of
manner
which
make
up
for
all
defect
our
bed
be
a
spacious
four
poster
and
four
slim
lad
like
us
might
have
be
easily
accommodate
in
it
i
observe
however
with
silent
surprise
that
he
be
so
modest
he
would
not
retire
by
candle
light
and
that
when
he
get
into
bed
he
lay
on
the
verge
of
it
far
remove
from
contact
with
me
when
i
rise
in
the
morning
i
found
that
he
be
not
undressed
which
he
explain
by
say
that
he
have
turn
in
thus
from
the
habit
of
hold
himself
ready
for
a
call
on
begin
his
voyage
he
have
be
so
severely
thrash
for
a
delay
cause
by
dress
that
he
have
scarcely
dare
to
take
off
his
boot
during
the
whole
voyage
he
also
told
me
that
when
he
have
discover
how
almost
impossible
it
be
to
avoid
a
beating
from
the
steward
and
cook
he
have
resort
to
the
expedient
of
pad
the
seat
of
his
trouser
with
cotton
and
wear
a
pad
of
the
same
material
along
the
spine
but
to
avert
suspicion
that
he
be
thus
cunningly
fortify
against
the
blow
he
have
always
continued
to
howl
as
freely
as
before
the
naivete
of
the
revelation
be
most
amuse
though
i
be
surprised
at
the
shameless
way
in
which
he
disclose
his
trick
and
cowardly
fear
however
it
do
not
deter
me
from
respond
to
his
friendly
advance
and
in
two
day
i
come
to
regard
him
as
a
very
charm
companion
the
third
morning
be
sunday
we
chat
longer
abed
but
when
rise
together
i
cast
a
glance
at
his
hip
and
remark
that
he
need
have
no
fear
of
be
thrash
at
new
orleans
he
appear
a
little
confuse
at
first
but
suddenly
remember
he
say
that
on
the
monday
he
would
have
to
purchase
a
new
pair
of
trouser
and
seek
work
a
little
later
it
struck
me
that
there
be
an
unusual
forward
inclination
of
the
body
and
a
singular
leanness
of
the
shoulder
compare
with
the
fulness
below
the
waist
in
him
and
i
remark
that
he
walk
more
like
a
girl
than
a
boy
so
do
you
he
retort
with
a
liberty
natural
to
our
age
at
which
i
only
laugh
i
propose
to
him
that
we
should
breakfast
at
the
french
market
that
morning
to
which
he
willingly
agree
we
walk
down
levee
street
down
to
the
foot
of
canal
street
where
we
saw
fifty
or
sixty
river
steamer
assemble
which
mass
together
make
a
most
impose
sight
turn
to
take
a
view
of
the
scene
up
river
with
its
mile
upon
mile
of
shipping
its
levee
choked
with
cotton
and
other
cargo
he
say
that
it
be
a
finer
sight
than
even
the
dock
of
liverpool
after
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
sugar
waffle
we
proceed
on
a
tour
through
the
old
quarter
of
the
city
and
wander
past
the
cathedral
of
st
louis
and
through
royal
chartres
burgundy
and
toulouse
street
and
come
home
by
rampart
street
enter
canal
street
and
continued
our
weary
way
through
carondelet
and
st
charles
street
home
where
we
arrive
heat
and
hungry
dick
have
show
himself
very
observant
and
profess
to
be
astonish
at
the
remarkable
variety
of
complexion
and
appearance
of
the
population
so
long
as
we
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
levee
he
have
be
rather
shy
and
have
cast
anxious
glance
about
him
fear
recognition
from
some
of
the
crew
of
the
pocahontas
but
after
we
have
go
into
some
of
the
back
street
he
have
be
more
at
ease
and
his
remark
upon
the
type
of
people
we
met
show
much
shrewdness
monday
morning
i
woke
at
an
early
hour
to
prepare
myself
for
the
week
labour
and
on
look
towards
dick
who
be
still
sound
asleep
be
amaze
to
see
what
i
take
to
be
two
tumour
on
his
breast
my
ejaculation
and
start
woke
my
companion
he
ask
what
be
the
matter
point
to
his
open
breast
i
anxiously
inquire
if
those
be
not
painful
he
redden
and
in
an
irritable
manner
told
me
that
i
have
well
mind
my
own
business
huffed
at
his
ungraciousness
i
turn
resentfully
away
almost
immediately
after
i
remind
myself
of
his
confusion
his
strange
manner
of
enter
a
clean
bed
with
his
clothes
on
his
jealous
avoidance
of
the
light
his
affectation
of
modesty
his
peculiar
suppleness
and
mince
gait
and
the
odd
style
of
his
figure
these
thing
shape
themselves
rapidly
into
proof
that
dick
be
not
what
he
represent
himself
to
be
true
he
have
a
boy
name
he
wore
boy
clothes
he
have
be
a
cabin
boy
but
such
a
strange
boy
i
have
never
see
he
talk
far
too
much
and
too
fluently
he
be
too
tricky
too
nimble
somehow
no
i
be
convince
he
could
not
be
a
boy
i
sat
up
triumphantly
and
cry
out
with
the
delight
of
a
discoverer
i
know
i
know
dick
you
be
a
girl
nevertheless
when
he
face
me
and
unblushingly
admit
the
accusation
it
frighten
me
and
i
sprang
out
of
bed
as
though
i
have
be
scorch
what
i
exclaim
do
you
mean
to
say
you
be
a
girl
yes
i
be
say
she
turn
pale
as
she
become
infect
with
my
excitement
perplexed
at
this
astound
confirmation
of
what
after
all
have
be
only
a
surmise
of
playful
malice
i
stammeringly
demand
well
what
be
your
name
then
it
cannot
be
dick
for
that
belongs
to
a
boy
i
be
alice
heaton
there
now
you
have
my
whole
secret
she
say
with
asperity
alice
heaton
i
echoed
quite
confound
at
the
feminine
name
and
i
reproachfully
ask
if
you
be
a
girl
say
what
do
you
mean
by
come
into
my
bed
and
passing
yourself
off
as
a
boy
she
have
kept
up
bravely
so
far
but
she
now
answer
me
with
tear
and
sob
and
every
doubt
of
her
sex
vanished
while
i
be
in
such
a
medley
of
emotion
that
i
stood
like
one
utterly
bereft
of
sense
not
know
what
to
do
presently
she
say

us
dress
and
i

no
time
in

a
turn
or
two
in
the
yard
return
to
find
her
ready
for
me
now
that
her
sex

reveal
i
wonder
that
i
have
be
so
blind
as
not
to
perceive
it
before
for
in
every
movement
there
be
unmistakeable
femininity
alice
make
me
sit
down
and
the
substance
of
the
story
she
now
told
me

as

twelve
year
of
age
she
begin
to
struggle
with
her
granny
and
in
a
short
time
she
prove
that
her
strength
be
too
great
to
be
beaten
by
an
infirm
old
woman

a
parsimony
which

would
try
her
fortune
as

compel
my
admiration
while

hop
ever
since

fate
be
as
propitious
to
her

be
wise
in
separate
two
young
and
simple
creature
who
might
have
be

through

so
much
fatigue
and
anxiety
that
i
tender
my
service
and
even
beg
her
to
employ
me
in
any
way
after
a
little
hesitation
she
say
i
might
be
useful
in
enable
her
to
take
a
little
rest
if
i
would
sit
at
the
door
and
upon
any
movement
or
sound
within
the
sick
chamber

kept
my
post

through
the
day
and
night
and
though
there

frequent
call
on
margaret
her
snatch
of
rest
serve
to
maintain
her
strength
as

go
off
to
my
labour
i
promise
to
solicit
a
few
day
leave
from
mr
ellison
and
to
return
to
her
within
the
hour
mr
ellison
however
to
whom
i
prefer
my
request
for
a
few
day
liberty
aflfected
to
regard
me
as
though
i
have
uttered
something
very
outrageous
and
curtly
told
me
i
might
go
to
the
d
if
i
like
and
stay
with
him
for
good
such
an
offensive
reply
a
few
month
earlier
would
have
make
me
shrink
into
myself
but
the
new
orleans
atmosphere
ripens
one
sense
of
independence
and
personal
dignity
and
i
reply
with
something
of
the
spirit
that
i
have
admire
in
mr
kennicy
and
mr
richardson
and
say
very
well
sir
you
may
discharge
me
at
once
of
course
to
a
person
of
mr
ellison
sanguinary
hair
and
complexion
the
answer
be
sufficient
to
ensure
my
furious
dismissal
on
the
instant
margaret
be
greatly
vexed
at
my
action
when
she
heard
of
it
but
console
me
by
say
that
a
few
day
liberty
would
do
me
no
harm
my
whole
time
be
now
place
at
her
disposal
and
i
have
reason
to
know
that
my
humble
service
be
a
considerable
relief
and
assistance
to
her
at
this
try
time
meanwhile
poor
mr
stanley
be
become
steadily
bad
and
on
wednesday
night
her
case
be
report
to
be
desperate
by
the
physician
there
be
no
more
sleep
for
any
of
us
until
die
issue
should
be
decide
near
midnight
margaret
with
a
solemn
and
ghastly
face
beckon
me
into
the
sick
lady
room
with
my
heart
throb
painfully
and
expect
i
know
not
what
i
enter
on
tiptoe
i
saw
a
broad
bed
curtain
with
white
muslin
whereon
lay
the
fragile
figure
of
the
patient
so
frail
and
delicate
that
in
my
rude
health
it
seem
insolence
in
me
to
be
near
her
it
have
be
easy
for
me
to
speak
of
illness
when
i
knew
so
little
of
what
it
meant
but
on
regard
its
ravage
and
observe
the
operation
of
death
i
stood
as
one
petrify
margaret
push
me
gently
to
the
bedside
and
i
saw
by
the
dim
light
how
awfully
solemn
a
human
face
can
be
when
in
saintly
peace
slowly
i
understood
how
even
the
most
timid
woman
could
smilingly
welcome
death
and
willingly
yield
herself
to
its
cold
embrace
i
have
hitherto
a
stony
belief
that
those
who
die
have
only
be
conquer
through
a
sheer
want
of
will
on
their
part
all
men
think
all
men
mortal
but
themselves
and
that
the
monster
with
its
horror
of
cold
damp
earth
and
worm
need
only
to
be
defy
to
be
defeat
of
its
prey
while
listen
at
the
door
i
have
wish
th
t
in
some
way
i
could
transfuse
a
portion
of
my
fulness
of
spirit
into
her
that
she
might
have
the
force
to
resist
the
foe
for
surely
with
a
little
more
courage
she
would
not
abandon
husband
friend
and
admirer
for
the
still
company
in
the
churchyard
but
the
advance
of
death
be
not
like
that
of
a
blustering
tyrant
it
be
imperceptible
and
inconceivably
subtle
begin
with
a
little
ache
like
one
of
many
know
before
before
it
have
declare
its
presence
it
have
narcotize
the
faculty
ease
the
beat
of
the
heart
lessen
the
flow
of
blood
weaken
the
pulse
it
have
sent
its
messenger
peace
before
it
to
dispel
all
anxiety
and
regret
and
to
elevate
the
soul
with
the
hope
of
heaven
and
then
it
close
the
valve
she
open
her
mild
eye
and
spoke
word
as
from
afar
be
a
good
boy
god
bless
you
and
while
i
strain
my
hearing
for
more
there
be
an
indistinct
murmur
the
eye
open
wide
and
become
fix
and
a
beautiful
tranquillity
settle
over
the
feature
how
strangely
serene
when
i
turn
to
look
into
margaret
eye
i
knew
death
have
come
by
a
curious
coincidence
captain
stanley
her
brother
in
law
arrive
from
havana
the
next
day
in
a
brig
he
knew
nothing
of
me
there
be
no
reason
he
should
be
tender
to
my
feeling
and
he
intimate
to
me
with
the
frankness
of
a
ship
captain
that
he
would
take
charge
of
everything
even
margaret
subside
before
this
strong
man
and
be
very
miserable
and
with
a
feel
of
irretrievable
loss
i
withdrew
after
a
silent
clasp
of
the
hand
about
three
day
later
i
receive
a
letter
from
margaret
say
that
the
body

to
st
louis
with
it
by
the
steamer
natchez
for
a
period
i
be
too
forlorn
to
heed
anything
greatly
i
either
stayed
at
home
reading
or
brooding
over
the
last
scene
in
mr
stanley
chamber
or
i
wander
aimlessly
about
the
levee
or
cross
over
to
algiers
where
i
sat
on
the
hulk
and
yoang
watch
the
river
flow
with
a
feel
as
of
a
nightmare
on
me
my
unhappy
experience
at
liverpool
have
not
be
without
their
lesson
of
prudence
my
only
extravagance
so
far
have
be
in
the
purchase
of
book
and
even
then
a
vague
presentiment
of
want
have
urge
me
to
be
careful
and
hurry
to
raise
a
shield
against
the
afilictions
of
the
destitute
though
at
liberty
there
be
no
fear
that
i
should
abuse
it
by
and
by
the
cloud
lift
from
my
mind
and
i
set
about

for
work

not
so
kind
this
time
the
mr

not
numerous
after
two
week
diligent
search
there
be
not
a
vacancy
to
be
found
then
i
lower
my
expectation
and
sought
for
work
of
any
kind
i
descend
to
odd
job
such
as
the
saw
of
wood
and
building
wood
pile
for
private
family
the
quality
of
the
work

little
one
day
there
come
a
mate
to
our
boarding
house
who
told
me
that

light
and
agreeable
during
the
remission
of
fever
the
captain
prove
to
be
a
kindly
and
pious
soul
and
his
long
grey
beard

him
a
patriarchal
appearance
and
harmonize
with
his
patient
temper
for
three
week
we
have
an
anxious
time
over
him
but
during
the
fourth

the
air
on
the
poop

communicative
with

of
a
month

with
so
good
a
man
i
be
paid
off
most
handsomely

a
small
sum
as
a
token
of
regard
as

at
this
break
in

only
have
patience
and

but
his
advice
inspire
me
with
hope
and
i
lift
my
head
and
fancy
i
saw
clearer
and
far
all
men
must
pas
through
the
bondage
of
necessity
before
they

by
the
river

likely
to
remain
with
me
forever
the
successive
revelation
of
scenery
and
human
life
under
many
aspect
impressed
me
with
the
extent
of
the
world
mental
exclamation
of
what
a
river
what
a
multitude
of
steamer
what
town
and
what
a
people
greet
each
new
phase
the
intensity
of
everything
also
surprised
me
from
the
resistless
and
deep
river
the
drive
force
within
the
rush
boat
the
gallop
dray
along
the
levee
to
the
hurry
pace
of
everybody

on

incessantly
with
the
sound
of
the
fast
whirl
wheel
the
energy
of
the
mate
and
the
clamour
of
the

feverish
desire
to
join
in
the
bustle

in
my
vein
on

at

extract
from
the
hotel
clerk
the
news
that

his

a

my

down

ran
up

the

over

with
some
emotion
that
my

should
be
his
charge
i
he
have
be
so
powerfully
affected
by
what
margaret
have
told
him
with
all
the
warmth
of
her
irish
nature
of
the
last
scene
at
the
deathbed
of
his
wife
that
he
have
be
unable
to
dissociate
me
from
his
thought
of
her
he
have
wonder
what
i
be
do
what
have
become
of
me
imagine
that
i
be
starve
and
know
how
friendless
and
unsophisticated
i
be
each
conjecture
have
be
dismal
and
pitiful
and
he
have
resolve
on
reach
new
orleans
to
make
diligent
search
for
me
and
take
me
to
himself
while
he
related
his
extraordinary
intention
it
seem
to
me
as
if
my
spirit
be
cast
an
interested
regard
upon
my
own
image
and
be
glory
in
the
wonderful
transformation
that
be
take
place
to
think
that
any
man
should
be
weave
such
generous
design
upon
a
person
so
unworthy
and
insignificant
as
myself
and
plot
a
felicitous
future
for
me
nurse
in
contumely
and
misery
seem
to
me
to
be
too
wonderful
for
belief
then
again
there
be
a
certain
mysterious
coincidence
about
it
which
awed
me
in
my
early
dream
and
fancy
i
have
often
imagine
what
kind
of
a
boy
i
should
be
with
a
father
or
mother
what
ecstasy
it
would
be
if
my
parent
come
to
me
to
offer
a
parent
love
as
i
have
enviously
see
it
bestow
on
other
child
in
my
secret
prayer
something
of
a
wish
of
this
kind
have
be
behind
the
form
of
word
and
now
as
an
answer
from
the
invisible
come
this
astound
revelation
of
his
power
he
have
cast
a
little
leaven
of
kindness
into
the
heart
of
a
good
man
from
the
very
first
encounter
it
have
act
beneficially
for
me
and
now
it
have
leaven
his
whole
nature
until
it
have
become
a
fatherly
affection
which
would
shield
my
youth
from
trial
and
temptation
and
show
me
the
best
side
of
human
nature
before
i
could
quite
grasp
all
that
this
declaration
meant
for
me
he
have
risen
take
me
by
the
hand
and
fold
me
in
a
gentle
embrace
my
sens
seem
to
whirl
about
for
a
few
half
minute
and
finally
i
broke
down
sob
from
extreme
emotion
it
be
the
only
tender
action
i
have
ever
know
and
what
no
amount
of
cruelty
could
have
force
from
me
tear
pour
in
a
torrent
under
the
influence
of
the
simple
embrace

golden
period
of
my
life
begin
from
that
supreme
moment
as
i
glance
back
at
it
from
the
present
time
it
seem
more
like
a
dream
as
unreal
as
a
vision
of
the
night
compare
with
these
matter
of
fact
day
or
the
ruthless
past
it
be
like
a
masquerade
among
goodly
felicity
and
homely
affection
and
its
happy
experience
have
be
too
precious
and
sacred
for
common
diat
though
they
have
lain
near
enough
for
the
fitting
occasion
mould
and
ready
for
utterance
they
have
form
my
best
memory
and
furnish
me
with
an
unfading
store
of
reflection
and
probably
have
have
more
influence
than
any
other
upon
my
conduct
and
manner
for
to
be
lift
out
of
the
depth
of
friendlessness
and
destitution
to
a
paternal
refuge
and
make
the
object
of
care
and
solicitude
so
suddenly
at
a
time
too
when
i
be
most
impressionable
without
an
effort
on
my
own
part
and
without
an
advocate
border
on
the
miraculous
predispose
to
inward
commune
with
a
strong
but
secret
faith
in
providence
i
regard
it
as
principally
the
result
of
a
divine
interposition
the
course
of
which
be
a
mystery
not
to
be
lightly
talk
of
but
to
be
remember
for
its
signifi
cance
after
a
restful
night
and
when
breakfast
have
be
despatch
we
adjourn
to
a
room
use
as
an
office
and
sit
apartment
and
there
i
be
subject
to
a
sympathetic
cross
examination
every
incident
of
my
life
even
to
the
fancy
that
have
flee
across
the
mind
of
callow
boyhood
be
elicit
with
the
assistance
of
his
search
question
and
then
i
be
as
it
be
turn
completely
inside
out
mr
stanley
say
that
what
i
have
told
him
only
bore
out
the
conclusion
he
have
long
before
arrive
at
concern
me
he
have
suspect
that
i
be
an
orphan
or
one
who
have
be
flatly
disown
and
a
waif
expose
to
every
wind
of
chance
and
he
be
glad
that
it
have
deposit
me
in
his
keep
he
express
amazement
that
helpless
child
be
treat
so
unfeelingly
in
england
and
marvel
that
no
one
care
to
claim
them
be
a
childless
man
he
and
his
wife
have
often
prayed
for
the
blessing
of
offspring
until
they
be
weary
with
desire
and
expect
then
they
have
go
to
the
faubourg
st
mary
and
have
visit
the
infant
asylum
with
the
view
of
adopt
some
unclaimed
child
but
they
have
make
no
choice
from
over
fastidiousness

struck
him
and
speake

through

his
estimate
of
my
character

and
in
one
letter
have
predict
that
i
be
cut
out
for
a
great
merchant
who
would
eventually
be
an
honour
to
the
city

while
young
richardson
have
say
i
be
a
prodigy
of
activity
and
quick
grasp
of
business
then
at
some
length
he
related
the
circumstance
which
have
induced
him
to
take
a
warmer
interest
in
me
he
have
often
thought
of
the
start
i
have
give
him
by
the
question
do
you
want
a
boy
sir
it
seem
to
voice
his
own
life
long
wish
but
he
thought
i
be
too
big
for
his
purpose
for
the
sake
however
of
the
long
desire
child
he
determine
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
me
and
have
obtain
my
engagement
with
his
friend
speake
when
he
have
go
home
his
wife
have
be
much
interested
in
the
adventure
with
me
and
have
often
ask
how

proteg
be
get
on
when
she
have
finally
see
me
she
have
say
something
to
him
which
have
give
a
new
turn
to
his
thought
but
as
i
be
already

and
be
likely
to
succeed
he
have
cease
think
about
it
on
margaret
arrival
at
st
louis
with
his
wife
remains
she
have
be
so
eloquent
in
all
the
detail
of
what
have
occur
that
he
inwardly
resolve
that
his
first
object
on
reach
the
city
should
be
to
seek
me
and
undertake
what
god
have
point
out
to
him
namely
to
educate
me
for
the
business
of
life
and
be
to
me
what
my
father
should
have
be
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
be
say
he
as
you
be
wholly
unclaimed
without
a
parent
relation
or
sponsor
i
promise
to
take
you
for
my
son
and
fit
you
for
a
mercantile
career
and
in
future
you
be
to
bear
my
name
henry
stanleyy
have
say
which
he
rise
and
dip
his
hand
in
a
basin
of
water
he
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
my
forehead
and
go
seriously
through
the
formula
of
baptism
end
ing
with
a
brief
exhortation
to
bear
my
new
name
worthily
in
answer
as
it
might
seem
to
the
least
shade
of
doubt
on
my
face
which
he
thought
he
observe
he
give
me
a
brief
summary
of
his
own
life
from
which
i
learn
that
he
have
not
always
be
a
merchant
he
told
me
that
he
have
be
educate
for
the
ministry
and
have
be
ordain
and
for
two
year
have
preach
in
various
place
between
nashville
and
savannah
but
finally
become
lukewarm
he
have
lose
his
original
enthusiasm
for
his
profession
and
have
turn
his
attention
to
commerce
intimacy
with
men
of
business
and
social
life
have
lead
him
by
degree
to
consider
himself
unfitted
for
a
call
which
seem
to
confine
his
natural
activity
but
though
he
have
lose
the
desire
to
exf
ound
the
christian
faith
from
the
pulpit
he
have
not
lose
his
principle
the
great
gain
of
commerce
have
seem
to
him
to
be
more
attractive
than
the
work
of
persuade
men
and
woman
to
be
devout
after
one
or
two
unsuccessful
essay
as
a
storekeeper
he
have
finally
adopt
a
commission
business
and
have
succeed
in
several
profitable
venture
he
thought
that
in
a
few
year
he
would
return
to
the
store
business
and
settle
in
one
of
the
back
country
place
for
which
he
have
a
great
hanker
but
at
present
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
terminate
his
city
connection
much
else
he
related
to
me
for
it
be
a
day
of
revelation
but
to
me
personally
it
matter
little
it
be
quite
sufficient
that
he
be
he
my
first
best
friend
my
benefactor
my
father
only
the
close
student
of
the
previous
page
could
compass
my
feeling
at
find
the
one
secret
wish
of
my
heart
gratify
so
unexpectedly
to
have
an
unbreathed
unformed
wish
plucked
out
of
the
silence
and
fashion
into
a
fact
as
real
as
though
my
dead
father
have
be
restore
to
life
and
claimed
me
be
a
marvel
so
great
that
i
seem
to
be
divide
into
two
individual
one
strenuously
deny
that
such
a
thing
could
be
and
the
other
array
all
the
proof
of
the
fact
it
be
even
more
of
a
wonder
than
that
dick
the
boy
should
be
transform
into
alice
the
girl
but
when
hour
after
hour
pass
and
each
brought
its
substantial
evidence
of
the
change
the
disturbed
faculty
gradually
return
to
their
normal
level
though
now
more
susceptible
to
happiness
than
when
existence
be
one
series
of
mortification
as
we
walk
the
street
together
many
a
citizen
must
have
guess
by
my
glow
face
and
shin
eye
that
i
be
brimful
of
joy
i
begin
to
see
a
new
beauty
in
everything
the
men
seem
pleasanter
the
woman
more
gracious
the
atmosphere
more
balmy
it
be
only
by
severe
suppression
that
i
be
able
to
restrain
myself
from
inmioderate
behaviour
and
break
out
into
hysteric
and
imseemly
ebullience
a
gush
of
animal
enjoyment
in
life
from
this
date
would
sometimes
overtake
me
and
send
me
through
the
street
at
the
rate
of
a
professional
pedestrian
i
would
open
my
mouth
and
drink
the
air
with
deep
disdain
for
all
physical
weakness
i
have
to
restrain
the
electrical
vitality
l
the
mad
humour
for
leap
over
a
dray
or
cart
might
awaken
the
suspicion
of
the
policeman
on
such
day
and
during
such
fit
it
be
indeed
joy
to
be
alive
but
to
be
young
be
very
heaven
most
of
the
day
be
spent
in

me
for
the

it

never

my

before
that
teeth
should

that
a

be
indispensable
or
that
a

to
health
and
comfort
when
we
return
to
mr

have
a
pleasant
time
in
the

the

manliness
to
ape
the
finicky
nicety
of
woman
and
to
be
too
regardful
of
one
personal
appearance

they
heard
my
new
father
descant
so
learnedly
on
the
us
of
tooth
and
nail
brush
i
feel
sure
they
would
have
turn
away
with
grimace
and
shrug
of
dissatisfaction

would
stem

this
store
of

that

for
the
use
of
a

whom
at

time
she
have
seriously
meditate
indenture
to
a
cobbler
but
previous
to
the
assumption
of
my
new
habiliment
i
be
conduct
to
a
long
bath
set
in
a
frame
of
dark
wood
and
while
look
at
it
and
wonder
at
its
splendour
i
heard
so
many
virtue
ascribed
to
its
daily
use
that
i
contract
quite
a
love
for
it
and
vowed
to
myself
that
since
it
a
special
kind
of
leather
appear
to
be
a
panacea
for
so
many
ill
all
that
scent
soap
and
scrub
could
effect
would
be
gladly
test
by
me
i
steep
myself
that
afternoon
as
though
i
would
wash
out
the
stain
ugly
poverty
and
misery
have
impressed
upon
my
person
since
infancy
and
when
i
emerge
out
of
the
bath
my
self
esteem
be
as
great
as
befit
the
name
and
character
i
be
hereafter
to
assume
but
there
be
much
to
improve
inwardly
as
well
as
outwardly
the
odium
attach
to
the
old
name
and
its
dolorous
history
as
it
affected
my
sense
of
it
could
not
be
remove
by
water
but
by
diligent
application
to
a
moral
renovation
and
make
use
of
the
new
life
with
the
serious
intent
to
hold
the
high
ideal
i
knew
of
as
my
exemplar
to
aid
me
in
my
endeavour
my
new
father
be
gentleness

at
first
he
make
no
great
demand
on
me
but
our
intercourse
be
permit
to
grow
to
that
familiar
intimacy
which
inspire
perfect
confidence
there
be
no
fear
that
i
could
ever
be
contemptuous
or
disrespectful
but
have
he
not
allow
a
certain
time
for
familiarise
me
with
his
presence
and
position
towards
me
i
might
not
have
be
able
to
overcome
a
natural
timidity
which
would
have
ill
suit
our
connection
when
i
have
learn
to
touch
him
without
warn
and
yet
receive
a
genial
welcome
laugh
in
his
presence
unchecked
and
even
comb
his
beard
with
my
finger
then
i
come
completely
out
of
my
shell
and
after
that
development

rapid

frequently

at
the

of
an
adult
voice

now
agreeably
reverse

to

anything

out

my

to

me
fit
to

bashfulness

i

to
me
a

judge
our
wandering
from

store
which
the

of
my

necessitate
i

dwell
upon
in
fact
it
would
be
impossible
to
contain
within
a
volume
all
that
i
remember
of
this
and
subsequent
period
i
be
more
concerned
with
the
personal
element
the
cardinal
incident
and
the
trace
of
my
growth
to
maturity
besides
the
bank
of
the
mississippi
and
its
low
tributary
have
little
to
recommend
them
to
a
youngster
after
the
first
expressive
oh
of
admiration
the
planter
mansion
the
settlement
and
city
be
mainly
of
uniform
colour
and
style
of
architecture
when
we
have
see
one
mansion

city
we
seem
to
have

be
a
church

and
there
a

of

presently
after
a
second
view
there
be
as
little
of
last
interest
as
in
the
monotonous
shore
of
the
great
river
i
only
record
such
incident
as
affected
me
and
such
as
clearly
stand
out
conspicuously
in
the
retrospect
which
have
be
not
only
a
delight
to
memory
but
which
i
be
incapable
of
forget
during
nearly
two
year
we
travel
several
time
between
new
orleans
st
louis
cincinnati
and
louisville
but
most
of
our
time
be
spent
on
the
low
mississippi
tributary
and
on
the
shore
of
the
washita
saline
and
arkansas
river
as
the
more
profitable
commission
be
gain
in
dealing
with
country
merchant
between
harrisonburg
and
arka
delphia
and
between
napoleon
and
little
rock
from
these
business
tour
i
acquire
a
well
geographical
knowledge
than
any
amount
of
school
teach
would
have
give
me
and
at
one
time
i
be
profound
in
the
statistic
relate
to
population
commerce
and
navigation
of
the
southern
and
south
western
state
just
as
macaulay
be
say
to
be
remarkable
for
be
able
to
know
a
book
from
begin
to
end
by
merely
turn
over
its
page
i
be
consider
a
prodigy
by
my
father
and
his
intimate
friend
for
the
way
name
and
face
clung
to
my
memory
i
could
tell
the
name
of
every
steamer
we
have
pass
the
characteristic
of
her
structure
and
every
type
of
man
we
met
a
thing
view
or
a
subject
discuss
likely
to
be
useful
become
impressed
indelibly
on
the
mind
probably
this
mental
acquisitiveness
be
stimulate
by
the
idea
that
it
form
the
equipment
of
a
merchant
which
i
believe
it
be
my
ultimate
destiny
to
be
and
that
every
living
man
should
be
a
living
gazetteer
and
posse
fact
and
figure
at
his
finger
end
meantime
my
memory
be
frequently
of
great
use
to
my
father
as
an
auxiliary
to
his
memorandum
book
of
shipment
purchase
and
sale
once
have
see
the
page
i
could
repeat
its
record
with
confidence
and
i
be
often
reward
by
his
admire
exclamation
well
i
never
heard
the
like
it
be
perfectly
astonish
how
you
remember
detail
etc
but
though
eye
and
ear
and
technical
memory
be
well
exercise
it
be
some
time
before
judgement
be
form
understand
be
slow
it
take
long
for
me
to
perceive
wherein
lay
the
superiority
of
one
sugar
over
another
or
why
one
grade
of
flour
fetch
a
high
price
than
another
or
wherein
bourbon
whiskey
be
superior
to
rye
and
to
distinguish
the
vary
merit
of
coffee
tea
etc
what
a
man
say
or
how
he
look
his
dress
appearance
and
so
on
be
ineffaceable
but
the
unwritten
or
untold
regard
him
be
a
blank
to
me
and
when
i
heard
comment
from
bystander
upon
the
nature
of
some
person
i
use
to
wonder
how
they
form
their
opinion
however
the
effect
of
these
criticism
upon
men
and
their
manner
be
to
inspire
me
with
a
desire
to
penetrate
beneath
and
to
school
myself
in
compare
different
people
i
have
abundance
of
opportunity
in
the
multitude
we
met
in
the
crowd
steamer
and
the
many
town
we
visit
but
that
which
would
have
give
the
key
to
the
mystery
be
want
viz
personal
intercourse
in
the
absence
of
direct
conversation
and
dealing
with
people
it
be
difficult
to
discover
the
nature
of
a
spirit
lurk
under
a
fair
outside
when
we
left
new
orleans
at
the
end
of
we
have
brought
with
us
a
portmanteau
packed
with
choice
literature
and
i
be
give
to
understand
that
the
history
of
rome
greece
and
america
poetry
and
drama
be
especially
for
my
use
and
that
i
be
to
pursue
my
study
as
diligently
as
at
a
school
the
practice
of
travel
enable
my
father
to
dispose
himself
comfortably
for
the
indulgence
of
reading
within
a
very
short
time
after
reach
his
cabin
he
act
as
one
who
have
only
change
his
room
and
be
only
concerned
with
his
own
business
with
such
a
man
a
river
voyage
be
no
impediment
to
instruction
he
set
me
an
example
of
application
to
my
book
which
add
to
my
own
love
of
study
enable
me
to
cultivate
indifference
to
what
be
passing
outside
of
our
cabin
our
travel
library
be
constantly
replenish
at
the
large
city
with
essay
memoir
biography
and
general
literature
but
novel
and
romance
be
rigidly
exclude
he
first
taught
me
how
a
book
should
be
read
aloud
and
in
a
few
second
have
correct
a
sing
song
intonation
which
be
annoy
to
him
he
say
that
one
could
almost
tell
whether
a
reader
understood
his
author
by
the
tone
of
his
delivery
and
take
up
a
shakespeare
he
illustrate
it
by
reading
who
steal
my
purse
steal
trash
etc
and
the
various
style
he
adopt
be
well
calculate
to
enforce
his
lesson
from
the
monotone
i
be
unable
to
see
any
beauty
or
point
in
the
quotation
but
when
he
assume
the
tone
of
the
moralist
the
line
certainly
set
me
think
and
the
truth
of
the
sentiment
appear
so
clear
that
i
be
never
able
to
forget
the
quotation
sometimes
also
when
reading
aloud
a
page
of
history
i
would
come
to
a
dull
paragraph
and
my
attention
would
flag
but
he
be
quick
to
detect
this
and
would
compel
me
to
begin
again
because
he
be
sure
that
i
knew
not
what
i
have
be
reading
i
merely
note
this
because
during
two
year
we
read
together
a
large
number
of
book
and
as
i
have
the
benefit
of
his
disquisition
and
comment
on
my
reading
it
will
be
see
that
with
such
a
companion
these
river
voyage
considerably
advanced
my
education
as
much
so
indeed
as
though
i
have
be
with
a
tutor
nor
when
we
drop
our
book
and
promenade
the
deck
be
my
mind
left
to
stagnate
in
frivolity
he
take
advantage
of
every
object
worthy
of
notice
to
impress
on
me
some
useful
or
moral
lesson
to
warn
me
against
error
of
omission
or
commission
whatever
it
may
have
be
in
my
personal
appearance
that
first
attract
him
to
me
it
be
certain
that
the
continued
affection
he
always
show
towards
me
be
secure
by
my
zealous
effort
always
to
follow
his
slightest
suggestion
i
think
it
would
have
be
difficult
to
have
found
a
boy
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mississippi
who
observe
his
parent
wish
with
a
more
scrupulous
exactitude
than
i
do
those
of
my
adopt
father
as
i
come
to
have
an
entire
knowledge
of
him
i
knew
not
which
to
admire
most
the
unvarying
affectionate
interest
he
show
in
my
personal
welfare
or
his
merit
as
a
man
and
moral
guardian
be
of
original
idea
acute
mind
and
impressive
in
sf
eech
the
matter
of
his
con
versation
glue
itself
into
my
memory
and
stir
me
to
thought
i
remember
well
when
one
day
he
reveal
something
of
the
method
he
propose
to
follow
with
me
for
the
perfect
of
my
commercial
education
i
express
a
doubt
as
to
whether
after
all
his
trouble
and
care
i
would
ever
come
up
to
his
expectation
i
say
that
as
to
carry
out
plain
instruction
with
all
good
will
there
need
be
no
fear
i
love
work
and
the
approbation
give
to
fidelity
and
industry
but
when
i
contemplate
be
left
to
my
own
judgement
i
felt
strong
misgiving
how
admirably
he
interpret
my
thought
explain
my
doubt
he
infuse
me
with
such
confidence
that
have
a
store
be
give
me
there
and
then
i
should
have
instantly
accepted
its
management
but
he
say
i
be
not
go
to
part
with
you
yet
you
have
much
to
learn
you
be
a
baby
in
some
thing
yet
because
you
have
be
only
a
few
month
in
the
world
by
the
time
i
have
wound
up
matter
you
will
have
learn
thousand
of
little
trifle
and
will
be
so
ground
in
solid
knowledge
that
you
may
safely
be
trust
under
another
merchant
to
learn
the
minutia
of
business
and
so
get
ready
to
keep
store
with
me
i
suggest
to
him
that
i
labour
under
disadvantage
such
as
hamper
very
few
other
boy
which
would
act
as
a
cl
on
the
free
exercise
of
my
ability
and
that
even
if
other
people
refrain
from
allude
to
my
parish
breeding
the
memory
of
it
would
always
have
a
depress
effect
on
me
but
such
thought
he
met
with
something
like
angry
contempt
i
do
not
know
say
he
what
the
custom
of
the
welsh
people
may
be
but
here
we
regard
personal
character
and
worth
not
pedigree
with
us
people
be
advanced
not
for
what
their
parentage
may
have
be
but
for
what
they
be
themselves
all
whom
i
meet
in
broadcloth
have
risen
through
their
own
effort
and
not
because
they
be
their
father
child
president
buchanan
be
make
our
chief
magistrate
because
he
be
himself
and
not
because
of
his
father
or
his
ancestor
or
because
he
be
poorly
or
richly
brought
up
we
put
a
premium
on
the
proper
exercise
of
every
faculty
and
guarantee
to
every
man
full
freedom
to
well
himself
in
any
way
he
chooses
provide
always
he
do
not
exercise
it
at
the
expense
of
the
right
of
other
people
it
be
only
those
who
refuse
to
avail
themselves
of
their
opportunity
and
shamefully
abuse
them
that
we
condemn
at
other
time
the
vehemence
of
youth
would
frequently
betray
itself
and
if
i
have
not
be
checked
i
should
probably
have
developed
undue
loquacity
be
of
sanguine
temper
by
nature
i
be
lead
through
gush
of
healthy
rapture
into
excess
of
speech
but
he
would
turn
on
me
and
gravely
say
that
he
be
not
accustom
to
carry
magnifier
with
him
that
owe
to
his
own
sense
of
proportion
my
figure
give
him
no
true
idea
of
the
fact
i
wish
to
state
that
my
free
use
of
unnecessary
cipher
only
create
confusion
in
his
mind
sometimes
he
would
assume
a
comical
look
of
incredulity
which
brought
me
to
my
sens
very
quickly
and
make
me
retract
what
i
have
say
and
repeat
the
statement
with
a
more
sacred
regard
for
accuracy
just
so
he
would
say
if
a
thing
be
worth
state
at
all
it
might
as
well
be
state
truly
a
boy
fancy
be
very
warm
i
know
but
if
once
he
acquires
the
habit
of
multiply
his
figure
every
fact
will
soon
become
no
well
than
a
fable
be
an
early
riser
himself
he
insist
on
my
cultivate
the
habit
of
rise
at
dawn
but
he
also
sent
me
to
bed
at
an
early
hour
he
lose
no
occasion
to
urge
me
to
apply
the
morning
hour
to
study
and
really
his
anxiety
that
i
should
snatch
the
fly
minute
appear
to
be
so
great
that
i
be
often
infect
with
it
as
though
they
be
something
tangible
but
so
elusive
that
only
a
firm
grasp
would
avail
if
he
saw
me
idly
gaze
on
the
shore
he
would
recall
me
to
ask
if
i
have
finish
some
chapter
we
have
be
discuss
or
if
i
have
found
a
different
answer
to
his
question
than
i
have
last
give
and
if
he
detect
an
inclination
in
me
to
listen
to
the
talk
of
passenger
round
the
bar
he
would
ask
if
there
be
no
book
in
the
cabin
that
i
must
need
hanker
for
the
conversation
of
idler
ah
the
babble
of
these
toper
if
boil
down
he
would
say
would
not
give
a
drachm
of
useful
knowledge
greatness
never
sprang
from
sudi
fruitless
gossip
those
men
be
merely
waste
time
from
motif
of
selfishness
they
no
doubt
would
be
glad
to
exchange
trivial
talk
with
anyone
big
or
little
who
might
come
near
them
but
it
be
not
to
my
interest
to
be
in
their
company
he
would
put
his
arm
in
mine
and
lead
me
away
to
deliver
himself
of
his
thought
on
the
glory
of
youth
painting
it
in
such
bright
colour
that
before
long
i
would
be
seize
with
a
new
idea
of
its
beauty
and
value
it
appear
to
be
only
a
brief
holiday
which
ought
to
be
employ
for
the
strengthen
of
muscle
gathering
the
flower
of
knowledge
and
cull
the
riper
fruit
of
wisdom
youth
be
really
only
the
period
for
gain
strength
of
bone
to
endure
the
weight
put
on
it

would
proceed
to
apply
these
remark
to
my

be
to
retain

the

to

me
different
circumstance
and
ask
me
what
i
would
do
these
be
generally
difficult
case
wherein
honesty
honour
and
right
do
be
involve
no
sooner
have
i
answer
than
he
would
press
me
with
another
view
of
it
wherein
it
appear
that
his
view
be
just
as
fair
as
the
one
i
have
and
he
would
so
perplex
me
that
i
would
feel
quite
foolish
for
instance
a
fellow
clerk
of
mine
be
secretly
dishonest
but
be
attach
to
me
in
friendship
he
make
free
with
his
employer
till
and
one
day
be
discover
by
me
alone
what
would
i
do
i
would
dissuade
him
but
suppose
despite
his
promise
to
you
he
be
still
continue
to
abstract
small
sum
what
then
i
would
accuse
him
of
it
and
say
to
him
he
be
a
thief
suppose
that
see
you
could
give
no
positive
proof
of
his
tlieft
he
deny
it
then
he
would
be
a
liar
too
and
there
would
be
a
quarrel
and
what
then
that
be
all
what
of
the
employer
in
what
way
be
he
not
in
question
do
he
not
pay
you
for
look
after
his
interest
but
i
do
look
after
his
interest
in
try
to
prevent
the
theft
and
yet
with
all
your
care
of
his
interest
the
pilfer
go
on
and
nobody
know
it
but
you
you
think
then
that
i
ought
to
tell
on
him
and
ruin
him
well
when
you
engage
with
your
employer
do
you
not
make
something
of
a
bargain
with
him
that
for
a
certain
wage
you
would
make
his
interest
your
own
and
keep
him
duly
inform
of
all
that
be
go
on
this
be
one
example
of
the
painstaking
way
in
which
he
would
stir
up
my
reason
power
when
we
walk
through
the
street
he
would
call
my
attention
to
the
face
of
the
passer
by
and
would
question
me
as
to
what
profession
or
trade
they
belong
to
and
when
i
reply
that
i
could
not
guess
them
he
would
tell
me
that
my
eye
be
the
lamp
to
my
foot
and
the
guide
to
my
understand
and
would
show
me
that
though
i
might
not
guess
accurately
each
time
in
many
instance
i
might
arrive
at
the
truth
and
that
whether
wrong
or
right
the
attempt
to
do
so
be
an
exercise
of
the
intellect
and
would
greatly
tend
in
time
to
sharpen
my
wit
moral
resistance

a
favourite
subject
with
him

say
the
practice
of
it
give
vigour
to
the
will
which
require
it
as
much
as
the
muscle
the
will
require
to
be
strengthen
to
resist
unholy
desire
and
low
passion
and
be
one
of
the
best
ally
that
conscience
could
have

be
a
good
friend
and
the
more
frequently
i
listen

it
be
with
its
good
office

i
be

at
school

the
influence
of
the

thus

no

from
the
character

have
obtain
my
most
last
impression
of
american
and
whenever
mention
these
be
the
figure
which
always
rise
first
in
the
mental
view

jonathan

have
never

the
fortune
to

one
who
have
travel
through
two
third
of
the
union
could
scarcely
have
fail
to
meet
him
if
he
be
a
common
type
among
his
kind
my
adopt
father
be
no
mean
ure
i
once
heard
a
man
speak
of
him
as
a
man
of
a
soft
heart
but
a
hard
head
which
i
fancy
have
a
sound
of
depreciation
but
later
i
acknowledge
it
as
just
it
be
some
six
month
or
so
after
my
adoption
that
i
venture
to
broach
a
subject
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
to
me
in
fact
it
be
my
only
remain
secret
from
him
it
have
be
often
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
but
i
have
be
restrain
from
mention
it
through
fear
of
scorn
my
idea
respect
the
deity
i
suspect
be
too
peculiar
to
trust
them
to
speech
and
yet
if
someone
do
not
enlighten
me
i
should
remain
long
in
ignorance
of
the
divine
character
true
certain
coincidence
make
me
secretly
believe
that
god
heard
me
nevertheless
i
burn
to
know
from
an
authoritative
source
whether
i
be
the
victim
of
illusion
or
whether
the
be
of
my
conception
bore
any
resemblance
to
that
of
the
learn
and
old
i
have
met
i
imagine
god
as
a
personality
with
human
feature
set
in
the
midst
of
celestial
glory
in
the
heaven
of
heaven
and
whenever
i
prayed
it
be
to
him
thus
frame
that
i
direct
my
supplication
my
father
do
not
ridicule
this
idea
as
i
fear
he
would
and
i
be
much
relieve
to
hear
him
ask
how
i
have
come
to
form
such
a
fancy
this
be
difficult
to
express
in
word
but
at
last
i
manage
to
explain
that
probably
it
be
from
the
verse
which
say
that
god
have
make
man
after
his
own
inniage
and
because
clergyman
always
look
upward
when
in
church
i
cannot
give
his
own
word
but
this
be
the
substance
of
my
first
intelligible
lesson
on
this
subject
god
be
a
spirit
as
you
have
often
read
a
spirit
be
a
thing
that
cannot
be
see
with
human
eye
because
it
have
no
figure
or
form
a
man
consists
of
body
and
spirit
or
as
we
call
it
soul
the
material
part
of
him
we
can
see
and
feel
but
that
which
animates
him
and
governs
his
every
thought
be
invisible
when
a
person
dy
we
say
his
spirit
have
flee
or
that
his
soul
have
depart
to
its
maker
the
body
be
then
as
insensible
as
clay
and
will
soon
corrupt
and
become
absorbed
by
the
earth
we
cannot
see
the
air
we
breathe
nor
the
strong
wind
which
wreck
ship
and
blow
house
down
yet
we
cannot
live
without
air
and
the
effect
of
the
wind
be
not
dispute
we
cannot
see
the
earth
move
and
yet
it
be
perpetually
whirl
through
space
we
cannot
see
that
which
draw
the
compass
needle
to
the
pole
yet
we
trust
our
ship
to
its
guidance
no
one
saw
the
cause
of
that
fever
which
kill
so
many
people
in
new
orleans
last
summer
but
we
know
it
be
in
the
air
around
the
city
if
you
take
a
pinch
of
gunpowder
and
examine
it
you
cannot
see
the
terrible
force
that
be
in
it
so
it
be
with
the
soul
of
man
while
it
be
in
him
you
witness
his
lively
emotion
and
wonder
at
his
intelligence
and
energy
but
when
it
have
flee
it
leaf
behind
only
an
inert
and
perishable
thing
which
must
be
bury
quickly
well
then
try
and
imagine
the
universe
subject
to
the
same
invisible
but
potent
intelligence
in
the
same
way
that
man
be
subject
to
his
it
be
impossible
for
your
eye
to
see
the
thing
itself
but
if
you
cannot
see
its
effect
you
must
be
bund
day
after
day
year
after
year
since
the
begin
that
active
and
wonderful
intelligence
have
be
keep
light
and
darkness
sun
moon
star
and
earth
each
to
their
course
in
perfect
order
every
living
be
on
the
earth
to
day
be
a
witness
to
its
existence
the
intelligence
that
conceive
this
order
and
decreed
that
it
should
endure
that
still
sustains
it
and
will
outlast
every
atom
of
creation
we
describe
under
the
term
of
god
it
be
a
short
word
but
it
signifies
the
be
that
fill
the
universe
and
a
portion
of
whom
be
in
you
and
me
now
what
possible
figure
can
you
give
of
that
be
that
fill
so
large
a
space
and
be
everywhere
the
sun
be
million
of
mile
from
us
imagine
million
of
mile
on
the
other
side
yet
the
circle
that
would
embrace
those
two
point
be
but
a
small
one
compare
to
the
whole
of
space
however
far
that
space
extends
the
mighty
intelligence
governs
all
you
be
able
to
judge
for
yourself
how
inconceivable
for
the
mind
of
man
god
be
the
bible
say
as
the
heaven
be
high
than
the
earth
so
be
his
way
high
than
our
way
god
be
simply
indefinable
except
as
a
spirit
but
by
that
small
fraction
of
him
which
be
in
us
we
be
able
to
communicate
with
him
for
he
so
order
it
that
we
might
be
exalt
the
more
we
believe
in
him
but
how
then
be
i
to
pray
i
ask
as
my
little
mind
try
to
grasp
this
enormous
space
and
recchled
baffle
and
helpless

in

give
you
a
sum
of
money
which
i
know
to
be
enough
to
take
you
to
new
orleans
and
return
here
if
you
spend
that
money
faithfully
and
properly
it
will
suffice
to

you

if
you
be
foolish
and
waste
it
by
the

we
should
take
if
we
employ
them
wisely
they
will
take
us
safely
to
our
journey
end
but
if
through
their
perversion
we
misuse
them
it
will
be
our
own
fault
by
prayer
our
spirit
conununicate
with
god
we
seek
that
wisdom
moral
strength
courage
and
patience
to
guide
and
sustain
us
on
the
way
the

all

us
grant
our

the

the

be
like
a
feelii
of
restore
health
or
a
burst
of
gladness
it
be
not
necessary
to
make
long
or
loud
prayer
the
whisper
of
a
child
be
heard
as
well
as
the
shout
of
a
nation
it
be
purity
of
life
and
sincerity
of
heart
that
be
want
when
you
approach
the
creator
to
implore
his
assistance
we
must
first
render
the
service
due
to
him
by
our
perfect
conduct
before
we
seek
favour
from
him
but
what
do
the
verse
so
god
create
him
in
his
own
image
mean
then
if
you
still
cling
to
the
idea
that
the
human
form
be
a
tiny
likeness
of
the
almighty
you
be
more
childish
than
i
believe
you
to
be
image
in
the
bible
sense
mean
simply
a
reflection
in
our
soul
and
intelligence
we
reflect
in
a
small
way
god
own
mightier
spirit
and
intelligence
just
as
a
small
pocket
mirror
reflect
the
sun
and
the
sky
or
your
eye
reflect
the
light
have
have
my
doubt
satisfied
upon
these
essential
point
there
be
only
one
thing
more
which
i
crave
to
know
and
that
be
in

ard
to
the
scripture

they
the

him
the
bible

the
standard
of
the
christian
faith
a
fountain
whence
we
derive
our
inspiration
of
piety
and
goodness
a
proof
that
god
interfere
in
human
affair
and
a
guide
to
salvation
he
read
from
timothy
au
scripture
be
give
by
inspiration
of
god
and
be
profitable
for
doctrine
ior
reproof
for
correction
for
instruction
in

that
the

of

unto
all

work
and
from
paul
he
quote
that
it
be
write
for
our
learn
that
we
through
patience
and
comfort
might
have
hope
you
be
not
say
he
to
pay
too
much
attentipn
to
the
set
phrase
but
to
the
matter
and
spirit
of
what
be
write
which
be
for
the
promotion
of
virtue
and
happiness
many
of
the
book
have
be
write
by
men
like
ourselves
who
live
between
two
thousand
and
four
thousand
year
ago
and
they
use
word
peculiar
to
their
own
time
the
mere
text
or
form
of
the
word
they
use
be
not
the
exact
word
of
god
but
be
simply
the
mean
of
convey
the
message
breathe
into
their
understanding
and
naturally
they
deliver
them
in
the
style
of
their
period
and
accord
to
their
ability
with
such
simplicity
as
would
enable
the
common
people
to
comprehend
them
if
i
have
to
convey
to
you
the
proclamation
of
the
president
of
the
united
state
i
should
have
to
write
it
more
simply
and
in
a
form
that
you
would
understand
so
these
divine
proclamation
have
be
give
to
us
by
his
chosen
messenger
more
faithfully
than
literally
the
above
be
a
few
of
the
intelligent
idea
which
i
obtain
from
my
father
and
for
which
i
have
be
as
grateful
as
for
his
unusual
goodness
in
other
respect
probably
many
a
sermon
which
i
have
heard
have
contain
them
in
a
dilute
form
but
they
have
not
be
adapt
to
my
understand
and
his
clear
exposition
of
these
subject
be
an
immense
relief
to
me
it
be
a
fortunate
thing
for
me
that
my
foggy
belief
and
vague
notion
in
regard
to
such
high
matter
could
be
laid
open
with
all
trust
and
confidence

so
qualify
and
tender
before
they
become
too
establish
in
my
mind
otherwise
as
my
own
intelligence
ripen
i
might
have
drift
into
atheistical
indifference
the
substance
of
my
father
saying
which
i
have
always
remember
illustrate
the
bent
of
his
mind
i
carefully
copy
them
into
a
beautiful
memorandum
book
of
which
he
make
me
a
present
new
year
day
i
and
which
i
be
so
proud
of
that
during
the
first
few
day
i
have
fill
more
than
half
of
it
with
the
best
word
of
my
father
it
must
not
be
suppose
that
i
be
at
all
time
deserve
of
his
solicitude
or
equal
to
his
expectation
i
be
one
who
could
not
always
do
the
right
and
proper
thing
for
i
be
often
err
and
perverse
and
at
various
time
must
have
try
him
sorely
my
temper
be
quick
which
with
an
excess
of
false
pride
inspire
me
to
the
vei
e
of
rebellion
a
sense
of
decency
prevent
me
from
any
overt
act
of
defiance
but
the
spirit
be
not
less
fierce
because
i
impose
the
needful
restraint
on
it
outwardly
i
might
be
tranquil
enough
but
my
smother
resentment
be
as
wicked
and
unjustifiable
as
if
i
have
openly
defy
him
a
choleric
disposition
on
his
part
would
have
be
as
a
flame
to
my
nature
and
the
result
might
have
be
guess
happily
for
me
he
be
consistently
considerate
and
decline
to
notice
too
closely
the
flush
face
and
the
angry
sparkle
of
the
eye
which
betoken
revolt
an
occasional
blood
let
might
perhaps
have
be
beneficial
to
me
but
he
have
discover
other
method
just
as
efficacious
for
reduce
me
to
a
state
of
reason
and
never
once
have
recourse
to
threat
my
fit
of
suuenness

be
probably
provoke
by
an
unexpected
sharpness
of
tone
or
a
denial
of
some
liberty
or
graver
censure
than
i
thought
i
deserve
constrain
to
silence
by
the
magnitude
and
character
of
my
obligation
to
him
i
of
course
magnify
my
grievance
and
the
longer
reconciliation

defer
the
large
these
seem

this
dangerous
mood
sought
vent
some
look

some
secret
transmission
of
sympathy
occur
and
in
an
instant
the
evil
humour
vanished
for
week
afterwards
i
would
endeavour
to
atone
for
my
churlish
behaviour
by
a
contrite
submissiveness
which
be
capable
of
undergo
any
penance
i
do
not
punish
you
he
say
because
i
want
you
to
remember
that
you
be
a
little
man
and
the
only
difference
between
us
be
that
i
be
an
old
man
if
i
be
in
the
habit
of
strike
you
you
would
run
away
from
me
or
it
would
be
noticeable
in
you
by
a
slink
gait
or
a
sly
eye
or
a
sullen
disposition
or
a
defiant
look
or
you
would
become
broken
spirit
all
this
i
do
not
want
you
to
be
i
wish
for
your
filial
regard
and
your
respect
which
i
would
not
deserve
if
i
terrify
misery
and
suffer
would
wreck
your
temper
while
kindness
and
reason
will
bring
out
the
best
quality
of
your
nature
for
you
as
well
as
every
child
that
be
bom
posse
something
that
be
good
and
it
be
the
sunshine
of
tenderness
that
make
it
grow
to
one
who
considers
that
neither
the
closest
tie
of
relationship
nor
the
high
claim
of
affection
be
sufficient
to
preserve
the
rebellious
spirit
in
an
angelic
temper
for
a
long
time
this
boyish
inconsistency
and
perverseness
will
be
no
surprise
but
i
be
sensible
that
it
be
only
owe
to
his
patience
that
it
do
not
receive
the
condign
punishment
it
deserve
this
in
itself

an
education
for
i
learn
after
several
experience
not
to
disturb
myself
too
seriously
because
of
a
temporary
change
in
his
manner

mood

to
accept
it
rather
as
be
due
to
some
cross
in
business
or
physical
condition
than
to
any
offence
in
me
and
so
the
customary
cordiality
be
soon
restore
if
i
could
only
have
make
similar
allowance
earlier
and
with
other
person
in
later
life
i
should
have
have
much
less
unhappiness
to
bewail
but
in
his
case
the
necessity
of
do
so
be
impressed
on
me
by
my
intimate
knowledge
of
his
fatherliness

the
constant
sense

i
be
prone
to
regard
at
that
time
as
the
height

the
very
quality
which
be
best
calculate
to
ensure
my
affection

my
shy
confidence

cultivate
in
me
a
fearless
openness
with
the

of
those
fit
of
sullen
resentment
to
which
i
be
now

other

him

unbroken

in
the
luifretting
fair

existence

lie
i
sometimes
imagine
that

something
attractive
in
me

i
myself
be
unconscious
of
the
cause
if
i
review
my
appearance
at
that

can
find
nothing
to
admire
i
be
naturally
shy
silent
short
of
figure
poorly

chose
me
from
the

he
saw
me
to
be
an
object
of
his
charity
i
endeavour
to
be
as
the
phrase
be
good

grateful
but
as
i
have
reason
to
remember
i
be
by
no

perfect
in
my
endeavour
i

docility
be
my

commendable
trait

they
strike
me

my

one
noticeable
incident
outside
of
the
common
in
connection
with
this
period
and
that
occur
in
the
middle
of
i
we
be
passenger
on
the
steamer
little
rock
as
she
be
return
laden
with
cotton
down
the
washita
my
father
have
be
paid
money
due
to
him
for
good
by
a
merchant
near
fairview
and
through
neglect
or
some
other
reason
have
defer
entrust
it
to
the
purser
longer
than
he
ought
we
be
approach
near
sicily
island
when
in
the
gloom
cause
by
the
mountain
pile
of
cotton
bale
i
observe
a
man
linger
rather
suspiciously
near
our
cabin
door
at
first
i
take
him
for
one
of
the
steward
but
on
observe
him
more
particularly
his
conduct
i
thought
suggest
some
nefarious
design
my
father
have
retire
and
accord
to
custom
i
ought
to
have
be
abed
but
the
unusual
freight
of
cotton
the
boat
carry
have
kept
me
in
a
state
of
suppress
excitement
be
light
and
active
i
ensconce
myself
in
a
dark
gap
between
two
tier
of
bale
and
wait
patiently
after
a
little
time
the
man
put
his
ear
to
our
door
and
presently
open
it
and
enter
our
cabin
in
a
few
minute
i
heard
my
father
voice
ask
who
be
there
and
immediately
sound
of
a
struggle
be
heard
upon
this
i
bound
in
and
found
the
stranger
wrestling
with
my
father
and
one
of
the
two
seem
to
be
choke
upon
see
me
the
intruder
turn
rapidly
towards
me
i
saw
the
flash
as
of
steel
and
something
struck
me
between
my
arm
and
left
breast
in
my
overcoat
and
a
piece
of
metal
tinkle
on
the
floor
then
with
a
deep
curse
i
be
flung
aside
and
the
man
flee
along
the
guard
we
instantly
raise
a
cry
of
thief
which
brought
crowd
of
steward
and
passenger
to
us
carry
light
these
reveal
an
open
portmanteau
with
rumple
content
and
the
half
of
a
carve
knife
blade
on
the
floor
on
examine
my
coat
it
be
see
that
it
have
a
cut
as
far
as
the
canvas
stiffen
all
these
evidence
tend
to
prove
that
a
dare
attempt
at
robbery
have
be
make
and
it
be
suspect
by
someone
connect
with
the
boat
the
chief
steward
muster
the
waiter
but
they
all
an
swered
to
their
name
he
next
count
the
carve
knife
and
accord
to
him
one
be
miss
the
incident
cause
quite
a
commotion
for
the
time
but
the
culprit
be
never
discover
beyond
this
incident
we
be
singularly
free
from
mishap
and
excite
episode
upon
water
that
have
be
the
scene
of
many
a
calamity
and
yet
when
i
chance
to
find
myself
among
a
group
of
passenger
i
frequently
heard
terrible
recital
of
experience
at
boiler
explosion
and
shipwreck
and
other
event
hazardous
to
life
we
have
often
be
fellow
passenger
with
gambler
some
of
whom
be
wrought
into
fury
by
their
loss
at
card
but
whether
it
be
owe
to
my
good
or
evil
fortune
i
never
happen
to
be
present
when
the
issue
be
left
to
the
arbitrament
of
revolver
and
bowie
knife
as
there
be
plenty
of
peace
maker
always
ready
to
interfere
at
the
critical
moment
in
september
of
i
we
met
a
tall
and
spruce
gentleman
of
the
name
of
major
ingham
on
board
of
a
steamer
bound
to
new
orleans
from
what
i
gather
he
be
a
south
carolinian
by
birth
but
some
few
year
since
have
remove
to
saline
county
arkansas
and
have
establish
a
plantation
not
far
from
warren
my
father
and
he
have
an
abundant
amount
of
small
talk
together
relate
to
acquaintance
and
locality
which
occupy
their
leisure
during
the
voyage
the
major
also
ingratiate
himself
with
me
and
through
his
description
of
the
forest
of
pine
and
oak
and
account
of
the
wild
animal
such
as
catamount
bear
and
deer
in
his
region
i
become
warmly
attach
to
him
before
reach
new
orleans
we
have
become
so
intimate
that
he
extend
an
invitation
to
me
to
spend
a
month
with
him
on
his
arkansas
plantation
and
on
refer
him
to
father
i
found
that
he
be
not
so
averse
to
the
proposal
as
i
fear
he
would
be
the
subject
be
defer
for
far
consideration
in
the
city
after
about
a
fortnight
stay
at
the
st
charles
hotel
my
father
be
make
anxious
by
a
letter
from
havana
from
his
brother
and
he
resolve
to
go
and
see
him
he
then
disclose
to
me
that
after
much
mental
discussion
he
have
conclude
that
major
ingham
invitation
have
assist
greatly
in
smooth
matter
for
some
time
he
have
be
debate
as
to
how
it
would
be
best
to
take
the
first
step
for
establish
my
future
he
have
be
much
struck
with
the
opportunity
for
do
a
good
business
in
a
country
store
at
some
place
below
pine
bluff
on
the
arkansas
there
be
a
large
number
of
planter
settle
there
and
a
general
supply
store
such
as
he
have
fancy
for
their
convenience
could
not
fail
to
be
a
success
major
ingham
plantation
be
situate
about
forty
mile
back
of
the
arkansas
river
and
at
cypress
bend
there
be
a
friend
of
his
who
upon
a
letter
from
him
would
take
me
in
to
teach
me
the
detail
of
a
country
merchant
business
here
be
an
opportunity
of
approach
his
project
in
a
methodical
way
without
loss
of
time
his
brother
illness
at
havana
have
cause
some
confusion
in
his
affair
and
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
cross
the
gulf
and
set
thing
in
order
meantime
i
have
a
safe
escort
to
within
a
day
drive
of
the
merchant
store
to
which
after
be
tire
of
the
plantation
i
be
to
go
to
be
ground
in
the
minutia
of
a
retail
store
and
in
a
few
month
he
would
have
wound
up
his
commission
business
and
be
able
to
avail
himself
of
my
local
knowledge
and
proceed
to
choose
the
best
locality
i
saw
no
objection
to
any
of
his
arrangement
as
they
rather
coincide
with
my
secret
ambition
which
have
be
foster
by
many
previous
allusion
to
such
a
scheme
as
have
be
now
explain
the
suddenness
of
the
part
be
somewhat
of
a
drawback
to
the
beauty
of
the
project
but
as
accident
be
the
cause
and
his
absence
be
to
be
only
for
a
few
month
during
which
we
could
often
correspond
i
become
inclined
with
the
sanguineness
of
my
nature
to
anticipate
much
enjoyment
from
the
novelty
of
the
situation
in
my
highly
colour
fancy
i
saw
illimitable
pine
wood
infest
by
indian
and
by
wild
cat
and
other
savage
feline
and
the
fact
that
i
be
about
to
prepare
myself
to
be
a
dealer
in
merchandise
preliminary
to
a
permanent
establishment
appear
such
an
enchant
prospect
that
i
felt
no
disposition
to
peer
into
sober
reality
could
we
have
foreseen
however
that
this
part
so
calmly
propose
and
so
trustfully
accepted
be
to
be
for
ever
both
of
us
would
have
shrunk
from
the
thought
of
it
but
unknown
to
ourselves
we
have
arrive
at
the
part
of
the
way
and
though
we
both
sincerely
hop
the
way
would
meet
we
be
glide
along
steep
plane
which
would
presently
precipitate
us
into
the
wide
gulf
of
separation
from
the
moment
it
be
agree
to
part
for
a
while
my
father
lose
no
opportunity
to
fill
me
with
practical
counsel
which
have
my
memory
be
a
knapsack
i
could
have
extract
at
will
for
consolation
and
guidance
unfortunately
for
some
thing
my
memory
be
like
a
sieve
it
retain
the
large
rule
but
drop
the
lesser
one
it
preserve
certain
principle
that
have
an
affinity
with
my
nature
but
the
multitude
of
minor
one
that
he
have
attempt
to
graft
on
my
nature
fell
away
one
by
one
i
be
to
be
industrious
orderly
honourable
and
steady
patient
and
oblige
but
something
of
these
i
would
naturally
have
show
under
any
circumstance
but
contact
with
real
life
discovers
that
these
virtue
be
insufficient
to
keep
us
serene
and
immaculate
that
the
spirit
of
youth
require
its
sensibility
to
be
discipline
in
many
way
before
it
endures
with
sweetness
and
patience
the
spurns
and
gibe
and
mock
of
a
rude
world
it
frequently
meet
condition
wherein
nothing
will
avail
but
force
of
a
most
strenuous
kind
when
the
hour
come
for
my
father
departure
major
ingham
and
i
accompany
him
on
board
the
havana
steamer
the
last
part
occur
in
the
state
room
at
that
moment
there
be
a
wild
flutter
of
the
heart
and
something
like
an
ugly
cloud
of
presentiment
vague
shadow
of
unknown
evil
to
come
which
start
strong
doubt
of
the
wisdom
of
part
come
over
me
all
at
once
but
as
usual
when
clear
expression
be
most
need
i
be
too
tongue
tie
for
much
speech
so
many
idea
throng
for
utterance
and
i
turn
away
as
though
stricken
dumb
half
an
hour
later
the
steamer
be
only
discernible
by
its
trail
of
smoke
after
he
have
go
the
flood
gate
be
open
the
feeling
relieve
themselves
by
torrent
of
word
and
my
loss
and
loneliness
press
hard
upon
the
sens
much
as
i
have
value
him
it
need
this
time
of
anguish
to
reveal
fully
what
he
have
be
to
me
then
pang
after
pang
of
poignant
contrition
pierce
me
through
and
through
i
be
dissatisfied
with
the
sum
of
my
conduct
with
his
own
profession
that
i
have
be
to
him
what
he
have
hop
and
wish
if
he
have
but
return
there
and
then
with
tiie
clear
light
that
fell
on
my
deficiency
now
how
i
should
have
striven
to
satisfy
my
own
exact
idea
of
what
be
due
to
him
this
little
absence
with
its
unutterable
remorse
have
be
more
efficacious
in
show
me
my
own
inwardness
than
all
his
unselfish
generosity
nearly
five
and
thirty
year
have
pass
since
and
i
have
not
experienced
such
wretchedness
as
i
do
that
night
follow
his
departure
a
very
little
more
and
i
think
it
would
have
exceed
the
heart
power
to
bear
my
emotion
be
much
more
distress
than
anyone
could
have
judged
from
my
appearance
i
caught
a
view
of
myself
in
a
mirror
and
my
face
struck
me
as
exhibit
an
astonish
contrast
to
the
huge
disorder
beneath
it
for
the
first
time
i
understood
the
sharpness
of
the
pang
which
pierce
the
soul
when
a
love
one
lie
with
fold
hand
icy
cold
in
the
sleep
of
death
i
vexed
myself
with
ask
have
my
conduct
be
as
perfect
as
i
then
wish
it
have
be
have
i
fail
in
aught
have
i
esteem
him
as
he
deserve
then
a
crave
wish
to
hear
him
speak
but
one
word
of
consolation
to
utter
one
word
of
blessing
make
me
address
him
as
though
he
might
hear
but
no
answer
come
and
i
experienced
a
shiver
of
sadness
and
wish
that
i
could
die
i
have
often
look
back
upon
the
boy
who
sat
like
a
stone
in
his
father
chair
for
hour
revolve
with
fix
eye
and
unmoved
face
all
that
this
part
seem
to
him
to
mean
up
to
a
certain
point
he
trace
minutely
all
its
detail
go
over
every
word
and
little
act
and
then
a
great
blank
wall
met
him
into
which
he
strove
and
strove
again
to
penetrate
and
be
bafiled
resume
his
mental
rehearsal
before
major
ingham
turn
his
step
homeward
i
receive
a
letter
from
my
father
duly
announce
his
arrival
at
the
island
of
cuba
after
describe
the
passage
across
the
gulf
he
go
on
to
say
that
the
more
he
thought
of
his
plan
the
more
he
be
inclined
to
regard
the
major
invitation
as
a
happy
incident
in
his
programme
he
have
often
ponder
over
the
best
mean
of
start
me
in
a
business
for
which
i
have
a
decide
bent
and
he
have
be
sound
several
country
merchant
with
a
view
of
give
me
a
preliminary
training
but
he
have
constantly
defer
a
decision
in
the
hope
of
find
something
that
more
nearly
suit
his
idea
now
however
it
all
seem

self
full
of
practical

a
novelty

have
a
letter
of
my
own
sent
from
such
a
distance
i
read
it
over

great
solace

driven
a
few
mile
inland
to
ingham

i
be
as
unaware
of
the
real
status
of
my
host
among
his
neighbour
as
i
be
of
the
size
of
his
domain
it
then
appear
in
my
eye
immense
but
be
mostly
a
pine
forest
in
the
midst
of
which
some
few
score
of
black
men
have
clear
a
large
space
for

unpainted
it
have
an
air
of
domestic
comfort
my
welcome
from
mr
ingham
left
nothing
to
be
desire
the
slave
of
the
house
throng
in
her
train
and
curtsy
and
bobbed
with
every
token
of
genuine
gladness
to
the
massa
as
they
call
him
and
then
be
good
enough
to
include
me
in
their
bountiful
joy
the
supper
which
have
be
get
ready
be
something
of
a
banquet
for
it
be
to
celebrate
the
return
of
the
planter
and
be
calculate
to
prove
to
him
that
though
new
orleans
hotel
might
furnish
more
variety
home
after
all
have
its
attraction
in
pure
clean
well
cooked
viand
when
the
hearth
log
begin
to
crackle
and
the
firelight
dance
joyfully
on
the
family
circle
i
begin
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
charm
and
be
ready
to
view
my
stay
in
the
western
wood
with
interest
and
content
but
there
be
one
person
in
the
family
that
cause
a
doubt
in
my
mind
and
that
be
the
overseer
he
join
us
after
supper
and
almost
immediately
i
contract
a
dislike
for
him
his
vulgarity
and
coarseness
revive
recollection
of
levee
men
his
garb
be
offensive
the
pantaloon
stu
fed
into
his
boot
the
big
hat
the
slouch
of
his
carriage
his
rough
boisterousness
be
all
objectionable
and
more
than
all
his
accent
and
the
manner
of
his
half
patronise
familiarity
i
set
him
down
at
once
as
one
of
those
men
who
haunt
liquor
saloon
and
be
proud
to
claim
acquaintance
with
bar
tender
something
in
me
perhaps
my
ofiishness
may
probably
have
struck
him
with
equal
repulsion
under
pretence
of
weariness
i
sought
my
bed
for
the
circle
have
lose
its
charm
the
next
day
the
diet
be
not
so
sumptuous
the
breakfast
at
seven
the
dinner
at
noon
and
the
supper
at
six
consist
of
pretty
much
the
same
kind
of
dish
except
that
there
be
good
coffee
at
the
first
meal
and
plenty
of
good
milk
for
the
last
the
rest
mainly
consist
of
boil
or
fry
pork
and
bean
and
com
scone
the
pork
have
an
excess
of
fat
over
the
lean
and
be
follow
by
a
plate
full
of
mush
and
molasses
i
be
never
very
particular
as
to
my
diet
but
as
day
after
day
follow
the
want
of
variety
cause
it
to
pall
on
the
palate
provide
other
thing
have
not
tend
to
make
me
critical
i
might
have
gratefully
endure
it
but
what
affected
me
principally
be
the
encomium
lavish
upon
this
style
of
cookery
by
the
overseer
who
whether
with
the
view
of
curry
favour
with
mr
ingham
or
to
exasperate
my
suppress
squeamishness
would
bawl
out
i
guess
you
ca
not
beat
this
howsumdever
you

up

fixin
in
them
ar
mississippi
town
with
such
society
and
fare
i
could
not
help
feel
depressed
but
the
tall
pine
forest
with
its
mysterious
light
and
shade
have
its
compensation
as
in
process
of
time
the
planter
intend
to
extend
his
clearing
and
raise
more
cotton
every
tree
fell

in

the
cultivable

permission

many

as
i
like
and
like
a
ruthless
youth
with
latent
destructive
propensity
i
found
an
extraordinary
pleasure
in
lay
low
with
a
keen
axe
the
broad
pine
i
welcome
with
a
savage
delight
the
apparent
agony
the
portentous
shiver
which
ran
from
root
to
topmost
plume
the
thunderous
fall
and
the
wild
recoil
of
its
neighbour
as
it
rebound
and
quiver
before
it
lay
its
still
length
after

manly
work

demand
the
exertion
of
every
ounce
of

sat
down
to
breakfast
with
a
glow
which
make
the
major
and
his
wife
cheerier
and
then
strode
off
to
join
in
the
war
against
the
pine
with
a
springy
pace
how
long
this
toil
would
have
retain
its
sportive
aspect
for
me
i
know
not
but
i
owe
it
to
the
overseer
that
i
cease
to
love
it
he
be
a
compound
of
a
legree
and
nelson
with
an
the
cruel
slave
driver
in
uncle
tom
cabin
comparable
with
nelson
bully
of
the
windermere
admixture
of
mannerism
peculiarly
his
own
it
be
his
duty
to
oversee
all
the
gang
the
hoers

and

with
which
i
work
the
men
become
subdue
and
stop
their
innocent
chaff
and
play
he
have
two
favourite
song
one
be
about
his
deah
lucindah
and
the
other
about
the
chill
wind
of
december
which
he
hum
in
a
nasal
tone
when
within
speak
distance
of
me
while
the
crack
of
his
black
snake
whip
kept
time
but
as
he
saunter
away
to
other
part
i
felt
he
be
often
restive
at
my
presence
for
it
impose
a
certain
restraint
on
his
nature
one
day
however
he
be
in
a
bad
humour
than
usual
his
face
be
longer
and
malice
gleam
in
his
eye
when
he
reach
us
we
miss
the
usual
tune
he
cry
out
his
command
with
a
more
imperious
note
a
young
fellow
name
jim
be
the
first
victim
of
his
ire
and
as
he
be
carry
a
heavy
log
with
myself
and
others
he
could
not
answer
him
so
politely
as
he
expect
he
flick
at
his
naked
shoulder
with
his
whip
and
the
lash
fly
unexpectedly
near
me
cause
us
both
to
drop
our
spike
unassisted
by
us
the
weight
of
the
log
be
too
great
for
the
others
and
it
fell
to
the
ground
crush
the
foot
of
one
of
them
meantime
furious
at
the
indignity
i
have
engage
him
in
a
wordy
contest
hot
word
even
threat
be
exchange
and
have
it
not
be
for
the
cry
of
the
wound
man
who
be
held
fast
by
the
log
we
should
probably
have
fought
the
end
of
it
be
i
retire
from
the
field
burning
with
indignation
and
disgust
with
his
abominable
brutality
i
sought
major
ingham
whom
i
found
recline
his
length
in
an
easy
chair
on
the
verandah
not
hearing
the
righteous
condemnation
i
have
hop
he
would
express
and
surprised
at
his
want
of
feel
i
hotly
protest
against
the
cruelty
of
the
overseer
in
attack
a
man
while
all
his
strength
be
need
to
preserve
others
from
peril
and
declaim
against
him
for
use
a
whip
in
proximity
to
my
ear
which
make
the
major
smile
compassionately
at
my
inexperience
in
such
matter
this
be
too
much
for
my
patience
and
i
then
and
there
announce
my
intention
to
seek
the
hospitality
of
mr
war
his
neighbour
as
i
could
not
be
any
longer
the
guest
of
a
man
who
receive
my
complaint
so
unsympathetically
on
hearing
me
say
this
mr
ingham
come
out
of
the
house
and
express
so
much
concern
at
this
sudden
rupture
of
our
relation
that
i
regret
have
be
so
hasty
and
the
major
try
to
explain
how
planter
be
compel
to
leave
field
work
in
charge
of
their
overseer
but
it
be
too
late
word
have
be
uttered
which
left
a
blister
in
the
mind
personal
dignity
have
be
grossly
wound
the
major
have
not
the
art
of
salve
sore
of
this
kind
and
i
doggedly
clung
to
my
first
intention
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
i
have
left
the
plantation
with
a
small
bundle
of
letter
and
paper
and
be
trudge
through
the
wood
to
mr
war
plantation
we
have
all
our
sudden
like
and
dislike
the
first
view
of
the
comfortable
homeliness
of
mr
war
house
give
me
an
impression
of
family
felicity
and
when
the
old
man
with
several
smile
member
of
his
family
come
to
the
door
it
appear
to
me
as
if
it
revive
a
picture
i
have
see
somewhere
in
wale
and
all
my
heart
go
out
to
those
who
be
in
the
house
strange
to
say
in
proportion
to
the
period
spent
at
major
ingham
i
posse
a
more
vivid
recollection
of
the
night
i
pass
at
mr
war
and
my
thought
have
more
often
revert
to
the
more
ancient
house
and
its
snugness
and
pleasant
detail
than
to
the
other
as
i
do
not
mention
anything
about
the
cause
of
my
departure
from
his
neighbour
plantation
it
be
tacitly
understood
that
i
be
only
rest
for
the
night
previous
to
resume
my
journey
next
morning
and
they
do
not
press
me
to
stay
i
beg
however
mr

to
do
me
the
favour
to
send
a
buggy
for
my
trunk
the
next
morning
when
it
arrive
i
repacked
it
and
leave
it
in
his
charge
i
set
off
on
a
tramp
across
country
to
the
arkansas
reject
many
an
offer
of
aid
up
to
the
last
minute
the
road
wound
up
and
down
pine
clothed
hill
and
be
a
sandy
loam
be
dry
and
tolerably
smooth
in
the
hollow
i
generally
found
a
stream
where
i
quenched
my
thirst
but
i
remember
to
have
travel
a
considerable
distance
for
a
young
pedestrian
without
meeting
any
water
and
to
have
reflect
a
little
upon
what
the
pain
of
die
from
thirst
would
be
like
i
rest
at
a
small
farm
house
that
night
and
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
be
once
more
footing
it
bravely
more
elate
perhaps
than
my
condition
justified
i
regard
myself
as
be
upon
a
fine
adventure
the
narra
tion
of
which
would
surprise
my
father
my
eye
travel
through
far
reach
colonnade
of
taper
pine
and
flourish
oak
and
for
a
great
part
of
the
time
i
lose
consciousness
of
my
circumstance
while
my
mind
be
absorbed
in
interminable
imaginings
of
impossible
discovery
and
incident
i
saw
myself
the
hero
of
many
a
thrill
surprise
and
look
dreamily
through
the
shade
as
though
in
some
place
like
them
i
would
meet
the
prey
beast
whom
it
would
be
my
fortune
to
strike
dead
with
my
sta
f
but
invariably
on
be
brought
to
a
proper
sense
of
the
scene
and
my
real
condition
i
recognize
how
helpless
i
be
against
a
snarl
catamount
or
couchant
panther
i
be
devoutly
thankful
that
arkansas
be
so
civilise
that
my
courage

in
no
fear
of

have
to

arrangement

a
bom
salesman
and
i
have
never

the
poorer
class
of

he
dazzle
by
his
eloquent
commendation
his
elaborate
courtesy
and
the
way
he
make
them
conceited
with
their
own
superior
knowledge
of
what
be
genuine
and
rich
if
the

whisper
friendly
advice
as
to
the
quality
of
the

and
besiege
her
with
such
attention
that
the
poor
thing
be
compel
to
buy
with
the
planter
who
be
of
vary
mood
mr
cronin
bore
himself
with
such
rare
good
humour
and
tact
that
one
found
a
pleasure
in
watch
the
stem
lip
relax
and
the
benignant
look
come
to
their
gloomy
eye
he
would
go
forward
to
meet
them
as
they
step
across
the
threshold
with
hearty
abandon
and
joviality
put
fervour
into
his
handshake
sincerity
into
his
greet
and
welcome
into
his
every
act
he
anxiously
enquire
after
their
health
condole
with
them
in
their
fever
sympathise
with
them
in
their
trouble
about
their
cotton
crop
and
soon
found
excuse
to
draw
them
to
the
liquor
apartment
where
he
make
them
taste
mr
altschul
late
importation
accord
to
mr
cronin
the
cobweb
be
clear
by
the
preliminary
drink
and
it
enable
both
salesman
and
buyer
to
take
a
dieerier
view
of
thing
and
to
banish
thought
that
would
impede
business
naturally
the
planter
care
little
for
cotton
print
or
jaconet
though
they
often
carry
daintily
pencil
conunissions
from
the
lady
at
home
which
mr
cronin
satisfactorily
execute
at
once
on
the
plea
that
lady
must
be
serve
first
but
when
these
be
dispose
of
always
with
reverent
regard
for
the
fair
sex
mr
cronin
flung
off
his
tenderness
and
become
the
genial
salesman
again
have
the
gentleman
see
the
new
califomian
saddle
or
the
late
thing
in
rifle
shot
gun
that
would
kill
duck
at
ninety
yard
those
who
heard
him
expatiate
upon
the
merit
of
fire
arm
wonder
at
the
earnestness
he
threw
into
his
language
and
at
the
minute
knowledge
he
seem
to
posse
of
the
property
of
each
article
or
the
subject
be
saddle
i
heard
with
amazement
about
the
comparative
excellency
of
the
califomian
english
and
cavalry
article
and
thought
his
remark
ought
to
be
print
in
this
way
with
regard
to
rifle
i
soon
get
to
know
all
about
the
merit
of
the
ballard
sharp
jocelyn
rifle
their
special
mechanism
trajectory
penetration
and
range
if
i
allude
to
the
revolver
his
face
glowed
with
a
child
rapture
as
he
dilate
upon
the
superiority
of
the
tranter
over
the
colt
or
the
old
fashion
pepper
box
but
when
he
take
up
a
beautiful
smith
and
wesson
he
become
intoxicate
with
his
own
bewildering
fluency
and
his
gesture
be
those
of
an
oratorical
expert
then
some
other
excuse
would
be
found
for
adjourn
to
the
liquor
room
where
he
continued
to
hold
forth
with
his
charm
persuasiveness
until
he
succeed
in
effect
a
sale
of
something
mr
cronin
be
indeed
an
artist
but
mr
altschul
do
not
appreciate
him
as
his
genius
deserve
the
proprietor
laid
too
much
stress
upon
his
propensity
to
drink
which
be
certainly
incurable
and
too
little
upon
the
profit
accrue
to
him
through
his
agency
he
also
suspect
him
of
gross
familiarity
with
female
slave
which
in
mr
altschul
eye
be
unpardonable
therefore
though
he
be
invaluable
to
me
as
a
model
salesman
poor
cronin
be
oblige
to
leave
after
a
while
waldron
in
a
short
time
found
counter
work
too
irksome
and
frivolous
for
his
nature
and
he
also
left
then
two
young
men
very
proud
and
high
stomach
and
not
over
genial
to
customer
be
engage
instead
but
by
this
time
i
have
become
sufficiently
acquaint
with
the
tone
of
the
planter
community
to
be
able
to
do
very
well
with
a
few
instruction
from
mr
altschul
i
have
learn
that
in
the
fat
cypress
land
there
be
a
humanity
which
be
very
different
from
that
complaisant
kind
dwell
in
city
it
have
be
drawn
from
many
state
especially
from
the

and
white

from
a
wider

which
include
europe
several
of
the
richer
men
own

from
six
to
ten
square
mile
they
live
like
princeling
be
owner
of
hundred
of

over
whom
they
be
absolute
except
as
to
life

all
their

cater
to
their
egotism
though
genially
sociable
to
each
other
to
landless
people
like
myself
they
conduct
themselves
as
though
they
be
under
no
obligation
such
manner
as
they
exhibit
be
not
so
much
due
to
neighbourly
good
feel
as
to
their
dislike
of
consequence
which
might
result
from
a
wanton
offishness
when
they
emerge
from
their
respective
territory
to
the
common
view
their
bearing
seem
to
say
that
they
yield
to
us
every
privilege
belonging
to
free
white
but
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
to
behave
as
they
deem
fitting
to
their
state
and
of
air
any
peculiarity
unquestioned
and
unremarked
by
the
commonalty
they
be
as
exclusive
as
the
proud
county
family
of
wale
it
may
easily
be
see
then
what
a
sight
our
store
present
when
about
a
dozen
magnate
of
this
kind
fresh
from
their
cotton
principality
and
arm
cap
k
pie
each
in
his
own
peculiar
dress
assemble
in
it
in
time
of
course
i
become
use
to
it
and
consider
their
anxiety
the
malarial
climate
and
the
irritate
ague
cake
they
behave
well
on
the
whole
their
general
attitude
be
however
stiff
and
constrain
each
slightly
raise
his
hat
as
he
come
in
and
their
sir
be
more
formal
and
punctilious
than
as
neighbour
or
fellow
dtizens
they
ought
to
have
be
my
proud
fellow
clerk
be
dispose
to
think
it
be
the
dread
of
the
pistol
which
make
them
so
guard
in
speech
and
action
but
i
thought
that
it
be
the
fear
of
compromise
the
personal
dignity
by
a
disgraceful
squabble
with
men
untaught
in
the
form
of
good
society
arkansas
be
sometimes
know
as
the
bear
state
and
many
of
its
people
at
that
time
be
singularly
bearish
and
rude
the
self
estimate
of
such
men
be
sometimes
colossal
and
their
vanity
as
sensitive
as
hair
trigger
none
of
them
could
boast
of
the
piety
of
saint
but
nearly
all
have
be
influence
by
the
religion
of
their
mother
just
as
much
as
might
enable
them
to
be
distinguish
from
barbarian
it
be
wonderful
what
trivial
cause
be
sufficient
to
irritate
them
a
little
preoccupation
in
one
own
personal
affair
a
monosyllabic
word
a
look
of
doubt
or
a
hesitate
answer
make
them
flare
up
hotly
the
true
reason
for
this
excessive
sensitiveness
be
that
they
have
live
too
much
within
their
own
fence
and
the
tadtumity
engender
by
exclusiveness
have
affected
their
habit
however
amiable
they
might
originally
have
be
their
isolation
have
promote
the
growth
of
egotism
and
self
importance
this
be
the
essence
of
provincialism
wherever
it
be
met
with
in
country
or
in
city
life
few
visit
our
store
who
do
not
bear
some
sign
of
the
pernicious
disease
which
afflict
old
and
young
in
the
bottom
land
of
the
arkansas
i
have
not
be
a
week
at
the
store
before
i
be
delirious
from
the
fever
which
accompanies
ague
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
be
diet
on
calomel

my

this
be
a

to
my
bilious
fellow

one

reflective
people
will
see
in
this

another
obstacle

the
poor
american
settler
the
irish
employee
the
german
jew
storekeeper
in
a
brief
time
grow
as
liable
to
burst
of
deadly
passion
or
fit
of
cold
blood
malignity
as
the
rginian
aristocrat
in

take
to
assert
an
opinion

hear
it
contradict
without
resort
to
lethal
weapon
but
in
arkansas
to
refute
a
statement
be
tantamount
to
give
the
lie
direct
and
be

such
folk
be
probably
late
immigrant
and
not
old
citizen
it
struck
even
a
youth
like
me
as
be
ridiculous
for
a
servile
german
jew
pedlar
to
fancy
himself
insult
by
a
casual
remark
from
some
mean
and
ill
breed
white
and
to
feel
it
necessary
to
face
the
tube
of
a
backwoodsman
when
he
might
have
ignore
him
and
his
rudeness
altogether
it
be
hard
to
understand
why
he
should
resent
his
honour
be
doubt
except
from
a
mistaken
sense
of
his
importance
for
the
ill

conmiunity
he
have
trebly

already
by

the

of
a

therefore
every

his
mettle
at
south

about
nine
mile
below

a
storekeeper

pride
himself
more
upon

the
perilous
venture
and
at

mr

smitten
with
the
mania
there
be
no

that
have
his
courage

blinking
at

by

of

on
the

i
inwardly
held
that
liquory
ebullience

among
our

a

one
day
he
and
some
chance
acquaintance
have
commenced
a
bottle
of
bourbon
and
under
the
influence
of
the
liquor
he
become
objectionable
and
hint
to
one
of
the
salesman
that
it
be
rot
gut
dilute
with
swamp
water
at
the
commencement
it
be
take
to
be
the
rough
pleasantry
of
a
drunken
rustic
but
as
coleman
reiterate
the
charge
the

patience
be
exhaust
and
he
retort
that
swamp
water
be
wholesome
for

such
as
he
after
this
one
savage
retort
provoke
another

coleman
drew
his
revolver
but
as
he
aim
it
i
crooked
his
elbow
and
the
bullet
pierce
the
roof
almost
immediately
after
the

have
flung
himself
against
his
opponent
and
we
all
three
come
to

such
a
number

and
so
many
expose

i
sat

and
saw
that
each
time
his
back
be
turn
two
men
abstract
stocking
thread
spool
and
riband
stuff
them
into

withdrew
and
call
simon
mr
altschul
burly
slave
and
instruct
him
how
to
assist
me
a
few
second
after
re
enter
the
store
the
two
half
of
the
front
door
be
suddenly
flung
to
and
bar
and
a
cry
of
thief
be
raise
there
be
a
violent
movement
towards
me
but
simon
flourish
a
big
knife
above
his
head
and
swore
he
would
use
it
if
they
do
not
stand
still
and
be
search
those
who
be
conscious
of
their
innocence
side
with
us
and
through
their
help
we
turn
out
a
pretty
assortment
of
small
good
which
the
clerk
by
refer
to
his
sale
book
found
have
not
be
sell
i
go
out
to
shoot
turtle
dove
one
holiday
and
aim
at
one
on
a
branch
about
thirty
foot
above
the
road
and
overhang
it
almost
immediately
after
old
hubbard
the
planter
emerge
into
view
from
round
the
comer
in
a
tear
rage
and
present
his
shot
gun
at
me
see
no
one
else
near
and
assume
that
he
be
under
some
great
mistake
i
ask
what
the
matter
be
upon
which
he
boldly
accuse
me
of
shoot
at
him
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
face
to
show
the
wound
as
there
be
not
the
slightest
trace
of
even
a
bruise
i
laugh
at
him
as
it
seem
to
me
that
only
an
overdose
of
whiskey
could
account
for
such
a
paroxysm
of
passion
since
my
arrival
at
auburn
i
have
receive
three
letter
from
my
father
from
havana
within
a
period
of
about
nine
week
then
month
after
month
of
absolute
silence
follow
the
last
letter
have
state
that
his
brother
be
convalescent
and
that
in
about
a
month
he
intend
to
return
to
new
orleans
and
would
then
pay
me
a
visit
until
well
into
march
be
in
daily
expectation
of
hearing
from
him
or
see
him
in
person
but
we
be
destine
never
to
meet
again
he
die
suddenly
in
i
only
heard
of
his
death
long
after
in
the
mean
time
wholly
unheeded
by
me
astound
national
event
have
occur
several
of
the
southern
state
have
openly
defy
the
united
state
government
fort
arsenal
and
ship
of
war
have
be
seize
by
the
revolt
state
and
what
be
of
more
importance
to
me
the
fort
below
new
orleans
have
be
take
by
the
louisiana
troop
these
event
be
know
to
reader
of
newspaper
in
arkansas
but
the
only
newspaper
take
at
the
auburn
store
be
a
pine
bluff
weekly
which
as
i
seldom
saw
it
i
never
imagine
would
gontain
any
news
of
personal
interest
to
me
it
be
not
until
march
that
i
begin
dimly
to
comprehend
that
something
be
transpire
which
would
involve
every
individual
dr
goree
our
neighbour
planter
happen
to
meet
mr
w
h
crawford
an
ex
representative
of
geoi
a
at
our
store
and
begin
discuss
politics
their
determine
accent
and
resolute
gesture
rouse
my
curiosity
and
i
heard
them
say
that
the
state
of
alabama
georgia
louisiana
and
others
have
already
form
a
separate
government
and
that
one
call
jeff
davis
have
be
proclaim
president
of
the
new
government
and
they
wonder
why
arkansas
be
so
slow
to
join
the
confederate
etc
etc
this
be
news
to
me
and
when
they
unfolded
their
respective
newspaper
and
read
extract
from
them
it
dawn
upon
me
that
if
i
wish
to
post
myself
upon
the
grave
national
affair
i
should
have
to
read
those
stupid
sheet
which
hitherto
i
have
regard
as
be
only
fit
for
merchant
and
beard
men
thus
stimulate
to
think
that
the
event
of
the
time
affected
the
people
of
arkansas
county
even
youth
like
myself
i
begin
to
read
the
pine
bluff
paper
and
to
be
more
inquisitive
and
it
be
not
long
before
i
have
a
vague
conception
that
the
country
be
in
a
terribly
disturbed
state
and
that
there
would
be
war
notwithstanding
the
information
glean
from
person
who
give
themselves
little
trouble
to
satisfy
a
strange
boy
it
be
not
until
young
dan
goree
return
from
nashville
college
that
i
could
assimilate
properly
all
that
i
have
heard
young
dan
be
a
boy
of
about
my
own
age
and
be
the
son
of
such
a
politician
as
dr
goree
be
naturally
much
more
advanced
in
political
matter
than
l
he
it
be
who
in
friendly
converse
act
as
my
mentor
and
give
me
the
first
intelligent
exposition
of
how
affair
stood
between
the
two
section
of
the
union
it
be
from
him
i
learn
that
the
election
of
abe
lincoln
in
the
november
previous
have
create
a
hostile
feel
in
the
south
because
this
man
have
declare
himself
oppose
to
slavery
and
as
soon
as
he
become
president
in
march
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
free
all
the
slave
of
course
say
he
in
that
event
all
slave
holder
would
be
ruin
his
father
own
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
slave
worth
from
to
a
head
and
to
deprive
him
of
property
that
he
have
bought
with
cash
be
pure
robbery
that
be
the
reason
that
all
the
people
of
the
south
be
rise
against
the
northern
people
and
they
would
fight
to
the
last
man
when
the
state
of
arkansas
secede
then
every
man
and
boy
would
have
to
proceed
to
the
war
and
drive
those
wretched
abolitionist
back
to
their
home
which
would
be
an
easy
task
as
one
southerner
be
well
than
ten
of
those
northern
fellow
many
of
whom
have
never
see
a
gun
dan
thought
that
the
boy
of
the
south
arm
with
whip
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
lick
the
thieve
hound
i
need
not
pursue
the
theme
but
it
be
from
such
a
source
that
i
obtain
my
elementary
lesson
in
american
politics
from
the
time
when
in
december
i
have
read
some
leaderette
about
the
louisiana
l
slative
assembly
politics
have
be
repulsively
dry
to
me
and
newspaper
be
only
useful
for
their
shipping
and
trade
detail
specially
interest
to
me
however
be
it
to
know
that
missouri
and
its
metropolis
st
louis
would
assuredly
join
the
south
though
i
be
sadden
to
learn
that
cincinnati
and
louisville
be
enemy
what
curious
emotion
that
word
enemy
cause
in
me
people
i
knew
well
with
whom
i
have
worship
boy
with
whom
i
have
contract
delightful
friendship
at
newport
and
covington
to
be
enemy
then
i
wonder
how
we
be
to
obtain
our
good
in
future
consignment
of
arm
medicine
dry
good
and
ironware
have
come
to
us
from
st
louis
cincinnati
and
even
chicago
the
condition
of
trade
would
be
altogether
alter
it
be
not
however
until
i
have
propound
the
question
as
to
how
the
seizure
of
the
mississippi
fort
affected
people
who
be
abroad
and
wish
to
return
home
that
i
understood
how
deeply
involve
i
be
by
this
rupture
of
relation
between
the
north
and
south
i
be
told
that
all
communication
be
stop
that
ship
come
in
from
sea
would
be
turn
back
or
else
if
they
be
permit
to
come
in
by
the
cruiser
outside
would
certainly
not
be
permit
to
leave
that
every
ship
insist
on
go
to
new
orleans
would
be
search
and
if
anything
likely
to
assist
the
enemy
be
found
she
would
be
detain
and
perhaps
confiscate
and
that
as
no
vessel
be
permit
to
enter
the
river
so
none
would
have
the
privilege
of
leave
here
be
something
wholly
unexpected
my
father
be
shut
out
and
i
be
shut
in
he
could
not
come
to
me
nor
could
i
join
him
in
some
mysterious
way
somebody
have
built
an
impassable
wall
round
about
us
and
the
south
be
like
a
jail
and
its
inhabitant
have
be
deprive
of
the
liberty
of
leave
from
the
moment
that
i
fully
realise
this
fact
everything
bore
a
different
aspect
to
what
it
have
before
i
be
a
strange
boy
in
a
strange
land
in
the
same
condition
of
friendlessness
as
when
i
flee
from
the
windermere
i
have
prepared
myself
to
convince
my
father
that
the
valley
of
the
arkansas
be
not
a
fit
place
to
live
in
my
star
bone
and
hollow
eye
should
speak
for
me
and
we
would
try
the
washita
valley
or
ascend
the
arkansas
towards
little
rock
where
the
country
be
healthier
but
anywhere
rather
than
in
such
a
pestilential
place
as
the
swamp
land
of
arkansas
but
my
intention
have
come
to
naught
my
cherished
hope
must
be
abandon
i
be
strand
effectually
and
i
have
no
option
but
to
remain
with
mr
altschul
it
be
an
evil
hour
to
meditate
any
design
of
a
personal
nature
for
the
sentiment
of
the
period
be
averse
from
it
the
same
unperceivable
power
that
have
imprison
me
in
the
fever
and
ague
region
of
arkansas
be
rapidly
become
formidable
man
after
man
unresistingly
succumbed
to
its
influence
even
the
woman
and
child
cry
for
war
there
be
no
fiery
cross
but
the
wire
flash
the
news
into
every
country
place
and
town
and
wherever
two
met
the
talk

all
about
war
most
of
the
cotton
state
have
already
secede
and
as
our
state
be
their
sister
in
sentiment
habit
and
blood
arkansas
be
bound
to
join
her
sister
and
hasten
with
her
son
to
the
battle
field
to
conquer
or
die
early
in
may
the
state
representative
met
at
little
rock
and
adopt
the
ordinance
of
secession
whereupon
the
fight

of
the
people

in

uttered
by
ancient
greek
and
roman

by
every
stripling
the
rich
planter
forgot
their
pride
and
exclusiveness
and
go
out
and

among
the

an
honourable
death
be
well
than

life
etc
etc
in
the
strident
tone
of
passion
they
say
they
would
welcome
a
bloody
grave
rather
than
survive
to
see
the
proud
foe
violate
their
altar
and
their
hearth
and
desecrate
the
sacred
soil

warlike
fire
that
burn
within

intense
heat

glowed
within
the
bosom
of
the
woman
no
suggestion

possible
in
their
presence
if
every

themselves

out

discover
it
to
be
a
chemise

such
as
a
negro
lady
maid
might
wear
i
hastily
hid
it

yes
at
my
present
age
the
whole
thing
appear
to
be
a
very
laughable
affair
altogether
but
at
that
time
it
be
far
from
be
a
laugh
matter
he
praise
my
courage
and
my
patriotism
and
say
i
should
win
undying
glory

see
what
we

do

i
be
now
about
to
begin
a
period
last
about
six
year
which
be
it
possible
i
should
gladly
like
to
re
live
not
with
a
view
of
repeat
its
woe
and
error
pain
and
inconsistency
but
of
rectify
the
mistake
i
make
so
far
i
have
make
none
of
any
importance
but
enlist
in
the
confederate
service
because
i
receive
a
packet
of
female
clothes
be
certainly
a
grave
blunder
but
who
be
able
to
withstand
his
fate
or
thwart
the
design
of
providence
it
may
have
be
time
for
me
get
close
on
to
eighteen
to
lose
some
of
the
soft
illusion
of
boyhood
and
to
undergo
the
toughen
process
in
the
trail
of
wan
look
backward
upon
the
various
incident
of
these
six
year
though
they
appear
disjoint
enough
i
can
dimly
see
a
connection
and
how
one
incident
lead
to
the
other
until
the
curious
and
somewhat
involve
design
of
my
life
and
its
purpose
be
consummate
but
this
enlistment
be
as
i
conceive
it
the
first
of
many
blunder
and
it
precipitate
me
into
a
veritable
furnace
from
whidi
my
mind
would
have
quickly
recoil
have
i
but
know
what
the
process
of
harden
be
to
be
just
as
the
fine
edge
of
boyish
sensitiveness
be
blunt
somewhat
by
the
dare
blasphemy
of
the
windermere
ofiicers
so
modesty
and
tenderness
be
to
be
shock
by
intercourse
with
men
who
cast
off
sweet
manner
with
their
civilian
clothes
and
abandon
themselves
to
the
rude
style
of
military
life
a
host
of
influence
be
at
work
sap
moral
scruple
the
busy
day
the
painful
event
the
excitement
of
the
camp
the
general
irreligiousness
the
disregard
of
religious
practice
the
contempt
for
piety
the
licentious
humour
of
the
soldier
the
reckless

lavish
destruction
of

the
gluttonous
desire

kill
the

of

the

it
the

of

finally
all
that
be
weak
vain
and
imfixed
in
my

nature

conspire
to
make
me
as
indifferent
as
any
of
my
fellow
to
all
sacred
duty
i
have
to
learn
that

excess
be
permissible
my
only
consolation
during
this
curious
volta

in

be
that
i
be
an
instrument
in

and
could
no
more
free

afterwards
in
the
way
of
many
land
it
be
not
likely
any
of
them
would
many
of
them
go
to
the
war
as
passionate
patriot
in
the
spirit
of
religious
duty
bless
by
their
family
others
with
an
appetite
for
glory
the
desire
of
applause
a
fondness
for
military
excitement
or
because
they
be
infect
with
the
general
craze
or
to
avoid
tedious
toil
or
from
the
wildness
of
youth
etc
it
be
passionate
patriotism
that
be
the
rule
and
brought
to
its
standard
all
sort

condition

it
be
this
burning
passion
that
govern
all

mould
public
life
to
its
will
now
all
men

to
the

up

perspiration

the
limy
dust
from
the

highway

our
throat

sober
down

to

darkly
stain
our

coat
about
the

it

down
our

into
our

where
mingle
with
the
dust

form
a
gritty
mud
which

hardness
of
the

our

us
sorely
the
strap
and
belt
become
painfully
constrictive
and
impede
respiration
but
through
fear
of
dhame
we
endure
all
without
complaint
at
the
end
of
the
hour
we
be
halt
for
five
minute
rest
and
then
resume
the
march
like
all
new
recruit
we
carry
a
number
of
thing
that
veteran

with
for
instance
keepsake
and
personal
treasure
mine
be
a
daguerreotype
of
my
adopt
father
and
a
lock
of
his
grey
hair
very
trivial
and
valueless
to
others
but
my
own
peculiar
treasure
carry
in
my
knapsack
to
be
look
at
every
sunday
morning
when
we

of

besides

luggage
which
with
heavy
musket
bayonet
accoutrement
and

of
water
weigh
about
sixty
pound
and
more
in
some
case
for
grow
and
lean
youth
this
be
a
tremendous
weight
and
during
the
second
hour
the
sense
of
oppression
and
soreness
rapidly
increase
but
except
more
frequent
change
of
the
musket
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
we
bat
nothing
of
our
resolve
to
endure
after
the
second
halt
we
be
sensibly
lamer
the
gravel
create
blister
and
the
warm
mud
act
like
a
poultice
on
the
foot
the
military
erectness
give
way
to
a
weary
droop
and
we
lean
forward
more
we
be
painfully
scald
restlessly
shift
our
weapon
and
try
score
of
little

copious
draught
of
water
and
still
the
perspiration
roll
in
a
shower
down
our
half
blind
face
and
the
symptom
of
collapse
become
more
and
more
pronounce
finally
the
acutest
point
of
endurance
be
reach
and
nature
revolt
our
foot
be
blister
our
agony
be
unendurable
and
despite
official
warn
and
menace
we
hopped
to
the
road
side
whip
oflf
our
boot
to
relieve
our
burning
foot
after
a
little
rest
we
rise
and
limp
after
the
company
but
the
column
have
stretch
out
to
a
tremendous
length
with
its
long
wagon
train
and
to
overtake
our
friend
seem
hopeless
as
we
limp
along
the
still
untired
soldier
mocked
and
jeered
at
us
and
this
be
very
hard
to
endure
but
by
and
by
the
straggler
become
more
numerous
the
starch
appear
to
be
take
out
of
the
strong
and
the
longer
the
march
continued
the
great

the
multitude
of
the
weary
who
crawl
painfully
in

of
the
column

the
little
rock

our
arrival
at
camp
late
at
night

should
have
be
sham
for
ever
but
fortunately
they
knew
nothing
of
this
and
blessing
the
night
which
hid
our
roast
face
and
sorry
appearance
we
have
no
sooner
reach
the
precinct
of
the

next

of
us

more
fit
for

after

we
be
in

then
armstrong
the
old

that
we
should
shed
our
knapsack
of
all
rubbish
and

his

his
advice

when
we
note
the
lighten
weight
of
our
knapsack
after
this
ruthless
ransackment
we
felt
fitter
for
the
march
than
on
the
day
we
depart
from
the
arkansas
river
our
surroundings
at

novel
for

sixty
mile
from

about
but
in
the
third
week
it
seem
to
threaten
us
all
and
i
remember
how
the
soldier
resort
to
the
prayer
meeting
in
each
company
and
how
solemn
they
be
at

on
sunday
the
pressure
of
an
impend
calamity
lay
heavy
upon
us
all

as

what

by
the
brief
description
of
the
first

it
take
some
time
to
bring
tiie
body
to
a
suitable
state
for
ungrudging
acceptance
of
the
hard
condition
of
campaign
so
that
it
can
find
comfort
on
a
pike
or
in
a
graveyard
with
a
stone
for
a
pillow
and
ease
on
clod
despite
drench
rain
and
chill
dew
then
the
stomach
have
to
get
accustom
to
the
soldier
diet
of
fry
or
raw
bacon
and

nerve
have
to
be
inure
to
bear
without
shrink
the
repeat
shock
and
alarm
of
the
camp
the
spirit
have
to
be
taught
how
to
subject
itself
to
the
spurns
and
contumely
of
superior
and
senior
without
show
of
resentment
and
the
mind
must
endure
the
blunting
and
deaden
of
its
sensibility
by
the
hot
iron
of
experience
during
the
long
march
from
little
rock
to
columbus
we
become
somewhat
season
and
campaign
grow
less
and
less
unpleasant
our
ordinary
march
be
now
more
in
the
nature
of
an
agreeable
relief
from
monotonous
camp
duty
we
be
not
so
captious
and
ready
to
take
offence
as
at
first
and
some
thing
that
be
once
most
disagreeable
be
now
regard
as
diversion
i
now
fully
accepted
it
as
a
rule
that
a
soldier
must
submit
to
military
law
but
many
like
myself
have
lose
a
great
deal
of
that
early
enthusiasm
for
a
soldier
life
by
the
time
we
have
reach
columbus
it
have
struck
us
when
at
picket
duty
alone
in
the
dark
that
we
have
be
great
fool
to
place
ourselves
voluntarily
in
a
position
whence
we
could
not
retreat
without
forfeit
of
life
and
that
by
a
monosyllable
we
have
make
our
comrade
our
possible
enemy
upon
a
single
breach
of
our
oath
we
have
condemn
ourselves
to
a
servitude
more
slavish
than
that
of
the
black
plantation
hand
about
whose
condition
north
and
south
have
declare
war
to
the
death
we
could
not
be
sell
but
our
liberty
and
life
be
at
the
disposal
of
a
congress
about
which
i
at
least
knew
nothing
except
that
somewhere
it
have
assemble
to
make
such
law
as
it
pleased
neither
to
captain
smith
nor
to
lieutenant
mason
nor
even
to
my
messmate
armstrong
could
i
speak
with
freedom
any
of
them
might
strike
me
and
i
should
have
to
submit
they
could
make
me
march
where
they
pleased
stand
sentry
throughout
the
night
do
fatigue
duty
until
i
drop
load
my
back
as
they
would
a
mule
ride
me
on
a
rail
make
a
target
of
me
if
i
take
a
quiet
nap
at
my
post
and
there
be
no
possible
way
out
of
it
to
say
the
truth
i
have
not
even
a
desire
to
shirk
the
duty
i
have
undertaken
i
be
quite
prepared
and
ready
to
do
all
that
be
require
for
i
love
the
south
because
i
love
my
southern
friend
and
have
absorbed
their
spirit
into
every
pore
nevertheless
when
far
remove
from
the
hubbub
of
camp
at
my
isolated
post
my
reason
could
not
be
prevent
from
take
a
cynical
view
of
my
folly
in
devote
myself
to
be
food
for
powder
when
i
might
have
be
free
as
a
bird
to
the
extent
of
my
mean
and
if
among
my
vague
fancy
i
have
thought
that
by
gallantry
i
might
win
promotion
such
as
would
be
some
compensation
for
the
sacrifice
of
my
liberty
that
idea
have
be
explode
as
soon
as
i
have
measure
myself
by
himdreds
of
cleverer
abler
and
braver
men
and
saw
that
they
even
have
no
chance
of
anything
but
to
fill
a
nameless
grave
the
poetry
of
the
military
profession
have
depart
under
the
stress
of
many
pain
the
wear
and
tear
and
the
certainty
that
soldier
be
to
consist
of
contunonplace
inarches
and
squalid
camp
life
the
punishment
inflict
on
such
as
be
remiss
in
their
duty
during
the
march
have
open
my
eye
to
the
consequence
of
any
misdemeanour
or
an
untimely
ebullience
of
youthful
spirit
i
have
see
unfortunate
culprit
horse
on
triangular
fence
rail
and
jerked
up
by
vicious
bearer
to
increase
their
pain
others
straddle
ignominiously
on
pole
or
fetter
with
ball
and
chain
or
subject
to
head
shave
or
tie
up
with
the
painful
buck
and
gag
or
hoist
up
by
the
thumb
while
no
one
be
free
of
fatigue
duty
or
exempt
from
fog
to
someone
or
other
the
livelong
day
those
who
be
innocent
of
all
breach
of
good
order
and
discipline
have
reason
to
lament
have
sacrifice
their
independence
for
our
brigade
commander
and
regimental
officer
be
eat
up
with
military
zeal
and
be
resolve
upon
training
us
to
the
perfection
of
soldierly
efficiency
and
like
bully
water
of
the
windermere
seem
to
think
that
it
be
incumbent
on
them
to
get
the
full
value
of
our
keep
and
pay
out
of
us
they
clung
to
the
antiquate
notion
that
soldier
be
appoint
as
much
to
drudge
for
their
personal
service
as
for
the
purpose
of
war
besides
the
morning
and
even
muster
the
nine
o
clock
dress
parade
the
drill
from
that
hour
to
noon
the
cleaning
of

and
accoutrement
the
frequent
interruption
of
rest
by
the
long
roll
heard
in
the
dead
of
night
the
guard
duty
or
picket
we
have
to
cook
our
provision
put
up
the
officer
tent
make
their
bed
soft
as
straw
and
hay
or
grass
could
make
them
collect
fuel
for
their
fire
dig
ditch
around
their
tent
and
fag
for
them
in
numberless
way
these
make
a
mighty
list
of
harassment
which
on
account
of
the
miserably
hard
fare
and
insufficient
preparation
of
it
weigh
on
our
spirit
like
lead
tend
to
diminish
our
number
by
disease
and
sent

to
the

the

grey
for

consist
mostly
of
yoimg
men
and
lad
who
be
as
ignorant
of
the
art
of
convert
their
ration
of
raw
beef
and
salt
pork
field
bean
and
flour
into
digestible
food
as
they

they
be
daily
serve
with
ration
which
they
might
eat
raw
or
treat
as
they
like
of
course
they
learnt
how
to
cook
in
time
but
meanwhile
they
make
sorry
mess
of
it
and
suffer
accordingly
those
with
good
constitution
survive
their
apprenticeship
and
youth
open
air
and
exercise
enable
them
to
bear
it
a
long
time
but
when
with
improper
food
the
element
chill
and
heat
us
with
abrupt
change
and
arbitrary
officialism
employ
its
wit
to
keep
us
perpetually
on
the
move
it
becomes
evident
now
why
only
the
hardiest
be
enable
to
bear
the
drudgery
and
vexation
impose
upon
them
and
why
disease
slew
more
than
two
third
of
the
whole
number
of
soldier
who
perish
during
the
wan
the
fault
of
the
american
generalship
be
that
it
devote
itself
solely
to
strategy
and
fight
and
provide
commissariat
supply
but
seldom
or
never
to
the
kindly
science
of
health
preservation
the
officer
knew
how
to
keep
their
horse
in
good
condition
but
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
see
an
officer
who
examine
the
state
of
our
mess
or
stoop
to
show
that
though
he
be
our
military
superior
he
could
take
a
friendly
and
neighbourly
interest
in
our
well
be
and
that
his
rank
have
not
estrange
his
sympathy
if
at
the
muster
a
soldier
be
ill
he
be
put
on
the
sick
list
but
it
never
seem
to
have
struck
any
officer
from
general
lee
down
to
the
third
lieutenant
of
an
infantry
company
that
it
might
be
possible
to
reduce
the
number
of
invalid
by
pay
attention
to
the
soldier
joy
and
comfort
the
raw
provi
sion
be
excellent
and
abundant
and
they
only
need
to
be
properly
prepared
to
have
make
us
robust
and
strong
just
as
the
regimental
physician
and
his
assistant
be
requisite
for
the
cure
of
illness
a
r
mental
chef
as
superior
of
the
company
cook
would
have
be
useful
for
the
pre
ventian
of
it
in
fifty
per
cent
of
the
case
but
the
age
be
not
advanced
enough
to
recognise
this
although
i
be
apt
to
assign
cause
for
thing
in
my
old
age
it
must
not
be
suppose
that
i
as
a
boy
could
then
know
much
about
such
matter
i
be
fortunately
bless
with
the
power
of
endurance
and
be
of
so
elastic
a
disposition
that
i
could
act
my
part
without
cavil
or
criticism
at
that
time
i
felt
that
i
have
no
other
business
in
the
world
than
to
eat
work
and
use
my
eye
wit
and
power
as
a
soldier
and
to
be
as
happy
as
my
circumstance
would
allow
and
i
do
not
think
i
make
myself
obnoxious
to
any
living
soul
within
our
mess
we
be
not
without
our
disagreement
and
i
have
to
bear
my
share
of
banter
from
my
elder
but
none
can
say
this
be
he
whom
we
have
sometime
in
derision
and
a
proverb
of
reproach
we
account
his
life
madness
and
his
end
to
be
without
honour
the
exigency
of
war
necessitate
our
removal
by
train
from
columbus
to
cave
city
kentucky
where
we
arrive
about
the
th
of
november
we
remain
in
this
camp
until
about
the
middle
of
february
the

during
the
time
we
remain
there
no

but
we
make
several
midnight
march
towards
green
river
and
post
ourselves
in
position
to
surprise
the
enemy
expect
to
come
from
munfordville
during
the
winter
in
this
camp
i
won
the
approval
of
the
mess
by
an
aptitude
for
lessen
the
inconvenience
imder
which
we
suffer
in
mid
winter
and
my
success
in
forage

under

sibley
tripod

besides
endanger
our
foot
and
bedding

us
i
suggest
that
we
should
sink
a
hearth
and
build
a
fire
place
with
a
flue
and
regular
chimney
of
mud
outside
and
with
the
help
of
the
veteran
slate
the
work
be
execute
so
well
that
our
tent
be
always
warm
and
clear
of
smoke
while
the
edge
of
the
hearth
make
comfortable
seat
by
which
we
could
toast
our

my
return
be
not
greet
with
any
rapturous
applause
however
by
christmas
eve
i
have
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
temper
of
the
people
about
and
my
mind
be
store
with
information
regard
secessionist
unionist
and
lane
and
farm
to
a
radius
of
five
mile
around
the
camp
just
on
the
edge
of
my
circle
there
lay
one
fat
farm
towards
green
river
the
owner
of
which
be
a
yank
and
his
neighbour
told
me
he
correspond
with
the
enemy
for
a
foot
soldier
the
distance
be
somewhat
far
but
for
a
horseman
it
be
nothing
the
day
before
christmas
through
the
assistance
of
a
man
name
tate
i
have
the
promise
of
a
mule
and
have
obtain
the
countersign
from
armstrong
i
set
out
as
soon
as
it
be
dark
to
levy
a
contribution
on
the
unionist
farmer
it
be
about
ten
o
clock
by
the
time
i
reach
the
place
tie
my
mule
in
the
angle
of
a
fence
i
climbed
over
and
explore
the
ground
in
cross
a
field
i
come
to
half
a
dozen
low
mound
which
i
be
certain
contain
store
of
potato
or
something
of
the
kind
i
burrow
into
the
side
of
one
of
them
with
my
bayonet
and
presently
i
smell
apple
these
be
even
well
than
potato
for
they
would
do
splendidly
for
dumpling
i
half
fill
a
sack
with
them
after
burrowing
into
two
or
three
others
i
come
to
one
which
contain
the
winter
store
of
potato
and
i
soon
rake
out
enough
to
make
a
load
i
hurry
with
my
booty
to
my
mule
and
secure
it
on
the
mule
then
think
that
a
goose
or
even
a
duck
or
a
fowl
or
two
would
make
our
christmas
dinner
complete
i
be
tempt
to
make
a
quest
for
them
anticipate
as
i
crept
towards
the
farm
the
glory
i
should
receive
from
my
mess
i
reach
the
out
house
with
every
faculty
strain
and
i
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
wring
the
neck
of
a
goose
a
duck
and
two
fowl
i
ought
to
have
have
the
discretion
to
retire
now
but
the
ambition
to
extinguish
malone
and
slate
to
see
the
grin
of
admiration
on
armstrong
face
and
newton
story
open
his
eye
and
tomasson
compel
to
pay
homage
to
worth
left
me
still
dissatisfied
and
just
then
scent
a
hog
pen
i
quietly
move
towards
it
by
the
light
of
a
feeble
moon
i
work
into
the
piggy
home
and
there
cuddle
about
the
ham
of
their
mother
i
saw
the
pinky
form
of
three
or
four
plump
shoat
aye
a
tender
shoat
roast
brown
and
crisp
would
be
the
crown
of
a
christmas
dinner
i
bound
lightly
as
a
lean
fox
into
the
sty
snatch
a
young
porkling
up
by
the
heel
create
a
terrify
clamour
by
the
act
we
be
all
alarmed
the
mother
hoarsely
grunt
the
piggy
squeal
in
a
frightful
chorus
the
innocent
rent
the
midnight
air
with
his
cry
but
determine
not
to
lose
my
prize
i
scramble
over
end
its
fear
and
struggle
by
one
fierce
slash
dumped
the
carcase
into
the
sack
and
then
hasten
away
light
be
visible
in
the
farm
house
door
slam
and
by
a
broad
beam
of
light
i
saw
a
man
in
the
doorway
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
a
second
later
a
shower
of
pellet
whistle
about
me
fortunately
without
harm
which
sent
me
tear
madly
towards
my
mule
in
a
few
minute
bath
in
perspiration
i
be
astride
of
my
mule
with
my
sack
of
dead
meat
in
front
of
me
and
potato
and
apple
thump
the
side
of
my
animal
as
i
rode
away
towards
camp
long
before
dawn
i
make
my
triumphant
appearance
in
front
of
my
tent
and
be
reward
by
every
member
of
the
mess
with
the
most
grateful
acknowledgement
the
christmas
dinner
be
a
splendid
success
and
over
twenty
invite
guest
sat
down
to
it
and
praise
be
on
every
lip
but
without
the
apple
dumpling
and
fritter
it
would
not
have
be
complete
to
us
youngster
secretly
i
be
persuade
that
it
be
as
wrong
to
rob
a
poor
unionist
as
a
secessionist
but
the
word
forage
whidi
by
general
consent
be
bestow
on
such
deed
mollify
my
scruple
forager
be
sent
out
by
the
authority
every
otiier
day
and
even
authorise
to
seize
supply
by
force
and
accord
to
the
ntiilitary
education
i
be
receive
i
do
not
appear
to
be
so
very
wicked
as
my
conscience
be
inclined
to
make
me
out
to
be
when
i
set
out
forage
in
the
daytime
i
be
amply
furnish
with
fund
and
sought
some
fraternal
secesh
towards
green
river
beyond
the
picket
an
old
secessionist
lady
and
i
become
great
friend
trust
one
another
without
reservation
i
would
give
her
ten
dollar
at
a
time
to
invest
in
egg
butter
and
fowl
and
she
would
trust
me
with
bowl
tin
and
linen
to
take
the
article
to
camp
the
old
lady
be
wont
to
bless
my
honest
face
and
to
be
emotional
as
i
told
her
of
the
suffering
of
my
fellow
dixie
at
camp
out
in
the
snow
and
wintry
gale
her
large
faith
in
me
and
her
good
heart
make
me
so
scrupulous
that
i
ran
many
risk
to
restore
her
property
to
her
her
feature
and
widowed
condition
the
sight
of
her
dairy
utensil
clean
and
smell
of
laitage
cream
and
cheese
revive
please
recollection
of
kine
and
their
night
stall
and
lead
on
to
aunt
mary
and
her
chimney
side
from
that
moment
i
be
her
most
devote
admirer
through
her
favouritism
for
me
our
mess
be
often
able
to
lend
a
pound
of
fresh
butter
and
a
dozen
g
to
the
officer
mess
one
of
the
most
singular
characteristic
of
my
comrade
be
their
readiness
to
take
offence
at
any
reflection
on
their
veracity
or
personal
honour
and
the
most
certain
provocation
of
fury
be
to
give
anyone
the
lie
they
could
stand
the
most
vulgar
horse
play
sarcastic
badinage
and
cut
joke
with
good
humour
but
if
that
imhappy
word
escape
one
in
heat
or
playful
malice
it
act
on
their
nerve
as
a
red
rag
be
say
to
do
on
a
mad
bull
the
glory
of
a
native
southerner
consists
in
be
repute
brave
truth
tell
and
reverent
towards
woman
on
such
subject
no
joking
be
permissible
he
who
venture
to
cast
a
doubt
upon
either
be
liable
to
be
call
upon
at
an
instant
to
withdraw
it
and
if
an
angry
tone
make
the
doubter
writhe
and
indispose
to
submit
there
be
sure
to
be
a
scene
to
withdraw
a
word
at
an
imperious
command
be
to
confess
oneself
inferior
in
courage
to
him
who
challenged
and
as
all
pride
themselves
on
be
of
equal
rank
and
similarly
endow
with
the
best
quality
of
manhood
i
never
met
one
who
be
morally
brave
enough
to
confess
his
fault
and
apologise
unless
he
be
compel
by
overwhelm
odds
during
that
winter
i
absorbed
so
many
of
these
chivalrous
idea
that
i
be
in
a
fair
way
of
become
as
great
a
fire
eater
as
any
son
of
the
south
have
it
not
be
for
newton
story
and
armstrong
who
knew
intuitively
when
to
interpose
their
authority
tomasson
rudeness
which
flare
me
up
many
a
time
would
i
be
sure
have
be
follow
by
deplorable
consequence
there
be
young
dan
also
he
be
often
in
a
wrangle
mood
and
by
his
over
insistent
glorification
of
southern
chivalry
brought
us
within
a
hair
breadth
of
trigger
the
tedium
of
camp
life
at
cave
city
be
relieve
by
outbreak
of
this
kind
for
when
we
be
not
require
to
exhibit
our
courage
against
the
common
foe
the
spirit
of
mischief
found
it
an
easy
task
to
influence
our
susceptiveness
when
discuss
such
dear
and
near
matter
as
valour
chastity
honour
and
chivalry
the
four
chiefest
virtue
of
the
south
it
be
not
an
easy
task
to
identify
myself
in
the
sunken
hearth
of
the
tent
at
cave
city
talk
grandly
upon
such
theme
but
several
scene
recur
to
the
mind
and
compel
me
to
the
humiliate
confession
that
it
be
i
this
life
do
not
tend
to
awaken
spiritual
thought
or
religious
observation
when
after
a
long
lapse
from
piety
i
strove
to
correct
my
err
disposition
with
the
aid
of
prayer
how
very
faint
hearted
i
felt
i
shrank
from
the
least
allusion
to
any
goody
goodiness
manifest
i
become
shame
face
if
i
be
accuse
of
be
pious
the
bible
be
only
open
by
stealth
and
i
be
as
ready
to
deny
that
i
prayed
as
peter
be
to
deny
christ
a
word
or
act
of
my
neighbour
become
as
perilous
to
my
spiritual
feeling
as
a
gust
of
east
wind
be
to
a
sufferer
from
influenza
every
hour
brought
its
obstacle
but
i
come
by
degree
to
realise
that
just
as
one
must
concentrate
his
reason
faculty
for
the
solution
of
a
problem
i
must
if
i
hop
to
win
in
the
great
fight
summon
every
good
thought
to
my
assistance
and
resolutely
banish
all
false
pride
but
these
be
not
my
bad
fault
tomasson
mad
humour
be
as
infectious
as
dan
dissertation
upon
southern
chivalry
indoors
he
be
jestive
amuse
vulgarly
entertain
outdoors
he
make
us
all
join
him
in
uproarious
laughter
the
prank
of
a
mule
the
sight
of
a
tall
hat
the
apparition
of
a
black
coat
a
child
a
woman
a
duel
between
two
cock
a
culprit
undergo
penance
it
matter
not
what
tickle
his
humorous
nerve
and
instigate
him
to
bawl
and
yell
and
break
out
into
explosion
of
laughter
and
whether
we
laugh
at
him
or
at
that
which
have
caught
his
fancy
in
a
second
we
have
join
in
the
yell
the
company
become
smitten
with
it
then
the
regiment
and
finally
the
army
be
convulse
in
idiotic
cachinnation
i
really
blush
at
the
folly
that
people
like
tomasson
often
lead
us
into
but
after
all
these
occasional
burst
of
jolly
imbecility
be
only
a
way
these
free
bom
nature
take
to
express
their
animal
discontent
and
mild
melancholy
under
the
humiliate
circumstance
of
that
crude
period
it
be
really
pathetic
after
a
mild
parox
ysm
of
this
kind
to
hear
them
sigh
and
turn
to
each
other
and
ask
who
would
sell
a
farm
to
become
a
soldier
from
the
day
when
personal
decoration
be
not
expect
from
the
private
soldier
and
we
learn
that
endurance

more

a
steady
deterioration

our
appearance

place
we
allow

acquaint
with
the
science
of

in
the
gross
fashion

the
commissariat
every
soldier
have
his
lawful
allowance

as
to
its
us
and
effect
no
one
seem
to
be
concerned
future
command
general
will
doubtless
remedy
this
and
when
they
meditate
stake
their
cause
and
reputation
on
a
battle
they
will
like
the
woodman
about
to
do
a
good
day
work
at

that
their

best
possible

general
johnston

to

an

of
nearly

and
well
fed

by

of

that

a
fourth
of
our

lad
under
twenty
and
that
such
a
strenuous
task
be
before
them
it
suggests
itself
to
me
that
the
omission
to
take
the
physical
power
of
those
youth
into
their
calculation
have
as
much
to
do
with
the
failure
of
the
project
as
the
obstinate

of

remember
it
because
while
we
stood
at
ease
he
drew
my
attention
to
some
violet
at
his
foot
and
say
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
put
a
few
into
my
cap
perhaps
the
yank
wo
not
shoot
me
if
they

in
our

at

so
near
their
merry
mood

to
the

we
load
our
musket
and
arrange
our
cartridge

ready
for

our
weapon
be
the
obsolete
flintlock
and
the
ammunition
be

which
contain
powder
a
round

then
the

call

we
knew
that
the
dixie

be
present
to
a
man
soon
after
there
be
a
commotion
and
we

up

along

labour

we
tramped
solenmly
and
silently
through
the
thin
forest
and
over
its
grass
still
in
its
wither
and
wintry
hue
i
notice
that
the
sun
be
not
far
from

that
our
regiment

its
formation
admirably
that
the
wood
would
have
be
a
grand
place
for
a
picnic
and
i
thought
it
strange
that
a
sunday
should
have
be
chosen
to
disturb
the
holy
calm
of
those
wood
before

a
quarter
past

they
be
at

noticeable
in
everybody
the
fire
continued
at
interval
deliberate
and
scatter
as
at
target
practice
we
drew
nearer
to
the
fire
and
soon
a
sharper
rattle
of
musketry
be
heard
that
be
the
enemy
wake
up
we
say
within
a
few
minute
there
be
another
explosive
burst
of
musketry
the

by

with

at
two

yard
far
a
dreadful
roar
of

out
from
a
regiment

by
another
far
off
and
the
sound
have
scarcely
die
away
when
regiment
after

blaze
away
and
make
a
continuous
roll
of
sound
we
be
in
for
it
now
say
henry
but
as
yet
we
have
see
nothing
though
our

tingle
under
the
animate
volley
forward

urge
captain

in
response
we
surge
forward
for
the
first
time
mar
the
alignment
we
trample
recklessly
over
the
grass
and
young
sprout
beam
of
sunlight
stole
athwart
our
course
the
sun
be
up
above
the
horizon
just
then
we
come
to
a
bit
of
packland
and
overtook
our
skirmisher
who
have
be
engage
in
explore
our
front
we
pass
beyond
them
nothing
now
stood
between
us
and
the
enemy
there
they
be
be
no
sooner
uttered
than
we
crack
into
them
with
level
musket
aim
low
men
command
captain
smith
i
try
hard
to
see
some
living
thing
to
shoot
at
for
it
appear
absurd
to
be
blazing
away
at
shadow
but
still
advance
fire
as
we
move
i
at
last
saw
a
row
of
little
globe
of
pearly
smoke
streak
with
crimson
break
out
with
spurtive
quickness
from
a
long
line
of
bluey
figure
in
front
and
simultaneously
there
broke
upon
our
ear
an
appal
crash
of
sound
the
series
of
fusillade
follow
one
another
with
startle
suddenness
which
suggest
to
my
somewhat
moidered
sense
a
mountain
upheaved
with
huge
rock
tumble
and
thunder
down
a
slope
and
the
echo
rumble
and
recede
through
space
again
and
again
these
loud
and
quick
explosion
be
repeat
seemingly
with
increase
violence
until
they
rise
to
the
high
pitch
of
fury
and
in
unbroken
continuity
all
the
world
seem
involve
in
one
tremendous
ruin
this
be
how
the
conflict
be
ushered
in
as
it
affected
me
i
look
around
to
see
the
effect
on
others
or
whether
i
be
singular
in
my
emotion
and
be
glad
to
notice
that
each
be
possess
with
his
own
thought
all
be
pale
solemn
and
absorbed
but
beyond
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
discover
what
they
thought
of
it
but
by
transnndssion
of
sympathy
i
felt
that
they
would
gladly
prefer
to
be
elsewhere
though
the
law
of
the
inevitable
kept
them
in
line
to
meet
their
destiny
it
might
be
mention
however
that
at
no
time
be
we
more
instinctively
inclined
to
obey
the
voice
of
command
we
have
no
individuality
at
this
moment
but
all
motion
and
thought
be
surrender
to
the
unseen
influence
which
direct
our
movement
probably
few
bother
their
mind
with
self
questioning
as
to
the
issue
to
themselves
that
properly
belongs
to
other
moment
to
the
night
to
the
interval
between
wake
and
sleep
to
the
first
moment
of
the
dawn
not
when
every
nerve
be
tense
and
the
spirit
be
at
the
high
pitch
of
action
though
one
sens
be
pretematurally
acute
and
engage
with
their
impression
we
ply
our
arm
load
and
fire
with
such
nervous
haste
as
though
it
depend
on
each
of
us
how
soon
this
fiendish
uproar
would
be
hush
my
nerve
tingle
my
pulse
beat
double
quick
my
heart
throbbed
loudly
and
almost
painfully
but
amid
all
the
excitement
my
thought
swift
as
the
flash
of
lightning
take
all
sound
and
sight
and
self
into
their
purview
i
listen
to
the
battle
r
ing
far
away
on
the
flank
to
the
thunder
in
front
to
the
various
sound
make
by
the
leaden
storm
i
be
angry
with
my
rear
rank
because
he
make
my
eye
smart
with
the
powder
of
his
musket
and
i
felt
like
cuff
him
for
deafen
my
ear
i
knew
how
captain
smith
and
lieutenant
mason
look
how
bravely
the
dixie
grey
banner
ruffle
over
newton
story
head
and
that
all
hand
be
behaving
as
though
they
knew
how
long
all
this
would
last
back
to
myself
my
thought
come
and
with
the
whir
bullet
they
flee
to
the
blue
bloused
rank
afront
they
dwelt
on
their
movement
and
read
their
temper
as
i
should
read
time
by
a
dock
through
the
lurid
haze
the
contour
of
their
pink
face
could
not
be
see
but
their
gappy
hesitate
incoherent
and
sensitive
line
reveal
their
mood
clearly
we
continued
advance
step
by
step
load
and
fire
as
we
go
to
every
forward
step
they
take
a
backward
move
load
and
fire
as
they
slowly
withdrew
twenty
thousand
musket
be
be
fire
at
this
stage
but
though
accuracy
of
aim
be
impossible
owe
to
our
labour
heart
and
the
jarring
and
excitement
many
bullet
found
their
destine
billet
on
both
side
after
a
steady
exchange
of
musketry
which
last
some
time

at
this
juncture
our
men
raise
a
yell

to
it
and
burst
out
into
the

than
all

when
we
arrive
upon
the
place
where
they
have
stood
they
have
vanished
then
we
caught

from
the
shock
of

our
delay

not

long
enough
to
give
them
time
to

impression
that
with
the
capture
of
the
first
camp
the
battle
be
well
nigh
over
but
in
fact
it
be
only
a
brief
prologue
of
the
long
and
exhaustive
series
of
struggle
which
take
place
that
day
continue
our
advance
we
come
in
view
of
the
top
of
another
mass
of
white
tent
and
almost
at
the
same
time
be
met
by
a
furious
storm
of
bullet
pour
on
us
from
a
long
line
of
blue
coat
whose
attitude
of
assurance
prove
to
us
that
we
should
have
tough
work
here
but
we
be
so
much
hearten
by
our
first
success
that
it
would
have
require
a
good
deal
to
have
halt
our
advance
for
long
their
opportunity
for
make
a
full
impression
on
us
come
with
terrific
suddenness
the
world
seem
bursting
into
fragment
cannon
and
musket
shell
and
bullet
lent
their
several
intensity
to
the
distract
uproar

i
have
not
a
fraction
of
an

have
be
spell
bound
by
the
energy

to
us
i
liken
the
cannon
with
their
deep
bass
to
the
roar
of
a
great
herd
of
lion
the
rip
crack
musketry
to
the
incessant
yap
of
terrier
the
windy
whisk
of
shell
and
zip
of
minie
bullet

the
swoop

at

expose
for
a
few
second
to
this
fearful
downpour

heard
the
order
to
lie
down

and
continue
your
fire
before
me
be
a
prostrate
tree
about
fifteeu
inch
in
diameter
with
a
narrow
strip
of
light
between
it
and
the
ground
behind
this
shelter
a
dozen
of
us
flung
ourselves
the
security
it
appear
to
offer
restore
me
to
my
individuality
we
could
fight
and
think
and
observe
well
than
out
in
the
open
but
it
be
a
terrible
period
how
the
cannon
bellow
and
their
shell
plunge
and
bound
and
flew
with
screech
hiss
over
us
their
sharp
rend
explosion
and
hurtle
fragment
make
us
shrink
and
cower
despite
our
utmost
effort
to
be
cool
and
collect
i
marvel
as
i
heard
the
unintermitting
patter
snip
thud
and
hum
of
the
bullet
how
anyone
could
live
under
this
rain
death
i
could
hear
the
ball
beating
a
merciless
tattoo
on
the
outer
surface
of
the
log
ping
vivaciously
as
they
flew
off
at
a
tangent
from
it
and
thud
into
something
or
other
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
a
second
one
here
and
there
found
its
way
under
the
log
and
bury
itself
in
a
comrade

one
man
raise
his
chest
as
if
to
yawn
and
jostled
me
i
turn
to
him
and
saw
that
a
bullet
have
gore
his
whole
face
and
penetrate
into
his
chest
another
ball
struck
a
man
a
deadly
rap
on
the
head
and
he
turn
on
his
back

his
ghastly

face

curse
upon

the
ground
until
every
ounce
of
courage
be
chill
he
lift
his
head
a
little
too
high
and
a
bullet
skim
over
the
top
of
the
log
and
hit
him
fairly
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
and
he
fell
heavily
on
his
face
but
his
thought
have
be
instantaneously

and
the
officer
with
one
voice
order
the
charge
and

of
forward
forward

us
as
with
a
spring
to
our
foot
and
change
the
complexion
of
our
feeling
the
pulse
of
action
beat
feverishly
once
more
and
though
overhead
be
crowd
with
peril
we
be
unable
to
give
it
so
much
attention
as
when
we
lay
stretch
on
the
groimd
just
as
we
bent
our
body
for
the
onset
a
boy
voice
cry
out
oh
stop
please
stop
a
bit
i
have
be
hurt
and
ca
not

i
turn
to
look
and
saw
henry
parker
stand
on
one
and
dolefully
r
arding
his
smash
foot
in
another
second

stride
impetuously
towards
the
enemy
vigorously
ply
our
musket
stop
only
to
prime
the
pan
and
ram
the
load
down
when
with
a
spring
or
two
we
would
fetch
up
with
the
front

and
fire
our
progress
be
not
so
continuously
rapid
as
we
desire
for
the
blue
be
obdurate
but
at
this
moment
we
be
gladden
at
the
sight
of
a
battery
gallop
to
our
assistance
it
be
time
for
the
nerve
shake
cannon
to
speak
after
two
round
of
shell
and
canister
we
felt
the
pressure
on
us
slightly
relaxed
but
we
be
still
somewhat
sluggish
in
disposition
though
the
officer
voice
rang
out
imperiously
newton
story
at
this
juncture
strode
forward
rapidly
with
the
dixie
banner
until
he
be
quite
sixty
yard
ahead
of
the
foremost
find
himself
alone
he
halt
and
turn
to
us
smilingly
say
why
do
not

come
on
boy
you
see
there
be
no
danger
his
smile
and
word
act
on
us
like
magic
we
raise
the
yell
and
sprang
lightly
and
hopefully
towards
him
let
give
them

say
one
plug

by
thousand
forward

not
give
them
breathing
time

cry
we
instinctively
obeyed
and
soon
come
in
clear
view
of
the
blue
coat
who
be
scornfully
imconcemed
at
first
but
see
the
leap
tide
of
men
come
on
at
a
tremendous
pace
their
front
dissolve
and
they
flee
in
double
quick
retreat
again
we
felt
the
glorious
joy
of
hero
it
carry
us
on
exultantly
rejoice
in
the
spirit
which
recognises
nothing
but
the
prey
we
be
no
longer
an
army
of
soldier
but
so
many
school

in
which
length
of

the
rush
through
them
and
clean
beyond
it
be
now
about
ten
o
clock
my
physical
power
be
quite
exhaust
and
to
add
to
my
discomfiture
something
struck
me
on
my
belt
clasp
and
tumble
me
headlong
to
the
ground
i
could
not
have
be
many
minute
prostrate
before
i
recover
from
the
shock
of
the
blow
and

to
find
my
clasp
deeply
dent
and
crack
my
company

not
in
sight
i
be
grateful
for
the
rest
and
crawl
feebly
to
a
tree
and
plunge
my
hand
into
my
haversack
ate
ravenously
within
half
an
hour

renovate
i
struck
north
in
the
direction
which
my
regiment
have
take
over
a
ground
strewn
with
body
and
the
debris
of
war
the
desperate
character
of
this
day
battle
be
now
brought
home
to
my
mind
in
all
its
awful
reality
while
in
the
tumultuous
advance
and
occupy
with
a
myriad
of
excite
incident
it
be
only
at
brief
interval
that
i
be
conscious
of
wound

but
now
in
the
trail
of
pursuer
and
pursue
the
ghastly
relic
appalled
every
sense
i
felt
curious
as
to
who
the
fall
grey
be
and
move
to
one
stretch
straight
out
it
be
the
body
of
a
stout
english
sergeant
of
a
neighbour

member
of
which
hail
principally
from
the

john

he
be
now
lifeless
and
lay
with
his
eye
wide
open
regardless
of
the
scorch
sun
and
the
tempestuous
cannonade
which
sound
through
the
forest
and
the
musketry
that
crackle
incessantly
along
the
front

by
him

a
young
lieutenant

judging
by
the
new
gloss
on
his

some

clean
bullet

through

in
various
posture
each
by
its
own
pool
of
viscous
blood
which
emit
a
peculiar
scent
which
be
new
to
me
but
which
i
have
since
learn
be
inseparable
from
a
battle

a
still
large
group

a
mass
of
horror
that
will
always
be
remember
at
the
mention
of
shiloh

can
never

the
impression
those
wide
open
dead
eye
make
on
me
each
seem
to
be
start
out
of
its
socket
with
a
look
similar
to
the
fix

gaze
of
an
infant

the
die
have

something
appal
at
the

ask
myself
that
at
the

wonder
why
their
casket

my
surprise
be
that
the
form
we
make
so
much
of
and
that
nothing
be
too
good
for
should
now
be
mutilate
hack
and
outrage

that
the

indelibly

in
my
memory
and
among
many
other
scene
with
which
it
be
now

i
cannot
forget
that
half
mile
square
of
woodland
light
brightly
by
the
sun
and
litter
by
the
form
of
about
a
thousand
dead
and
wound
men
and
by
horse
and
military
equipment
it
form
a
picture
that
may
always
be
reproduce
with
an
almost
absolute
fidelity
for
it
be
the
first
field
of
glory
i
have
see
in
my
may
of
life
and
the
first
time
that
glory
sicken
me
with
its
repulsive
aspect
and
make
me
suspect
it
be
all
a
glitter
lie
in
my
imagination
i
saw
more
than
it
be
my
fate
to
see
with
my
eye
for
imder
a
flag
of
truce
i
saw
the
bearer
pick
up
the
dead
from
the
field
and
lay
them
in
long
row
beside
a
wide
trench
i
saw
them
laid
one
by
one
close
together
at
the
bottom
thankless
victim
of
a
perish
cause
and
all
their
individual
hope
pride
honour
name
bury
under
oblivious
earth
my
thought
revert
to
the
time
when
these
fester
body
be
idolize
object
of
their
mother
passionate
love
their
father
stand
by
half
fear
to
touch
the
frg
le
little
thing
and
the
wing
of
dvil
law
out
spread
to
protect
parent
and
child
in
their
family
love
their
come
and
go
follow
with
pride
and
praise
and
the
blessing
of
the
almighty
over
shadow
all
then
as
they
be
near
manhood
through
some
strange
warp
of
society
men
in
authority
summon
them
from
school
and
shop
field
and
farm
to
meet
in
the
wood
on
a
sunday
morning
for
mutual
butchery
with
the
deadliest
instrument
ever
invent
civil
law
religion
and
morality
complaisantly
stand
aside
while
young
men
who
have
be
preach
and
moralize
to
for
year
be
let
loose
to
engage
in
the
carnival
of
slaughter
only
yesterday
they
profess
to
shudder
at
the
word
murder
to
day
by
a
strange
twist
in
human
nature
they
lust
to
kill
and
be
hound
on
in
the
work
of
destruction
by
their
pastor
elder
mother
and
sister
oh
for
once
i
be
begin
to
know
the
real
truth
man
be
bom
for
slaughter
all
the
pain
take
to
soothe
his
savage
heart
be
tmavailing
holy
word
and
heavenly
hope
have
no
last
effect
on
his
bestial
nature
for
when
once
provoke
how
swiftly
he
flung
aside
the
sweet
hope
of
heaven
and
the
dread
of
hell
with
which
he
amuse
himself
in
time
of
ease
as
i
move
horror
stricken
through
the
fearful
shamble
where
the
dead
lay
as
thick
as
the
sleeper
in
a
london
park
on
a
bank
holiday
i
be
unable
to
resist
the
belief
that
my
education
have
be
in
abstract
thing
which
have
no
relation
to
our
animal
existence
for
if
human
life
be
so
disparage
what
have
it
to
do
with
such
high
subject
as
god
heaven
and
immortality
and
to
think
how
devotional
men
and
woman
pretend
to
be
on
a
sunday
oh
cunning
cruel
man
he
knew
that
the
sum
of
all
real
knowledge
and
effort
be
to
know
how
to
kill
and
mangle
his
brother
as
we
be
do
to
day
reflect
on
my
own
emotion
i
wonder
if
other
youth
would
feel
that
they
have
be
delude
like
myself
with
man
fine
polemic
and
name
of
thing
which
vanished
with
the
reality
a
multitude
of
angry
thought
surge
through
me
which
i
cannot
describe
in
detail
but
they
amount
to
this
that
a
cruel
deception
have
be
practise
on
my
blank
ignorance
that
my
atom
of
imagination
and
feel
have
be
darken
and
that
man
be
a
portentous
creature
from
which
i
recoil
with
terror
and
pity
he
be
certainly
terrible
and
hard
but
he
be
no
more
to
me
now
than
a
two
legged
beast
he
be
cunning
beyond
find
out
but
his
morality
be
only
a
mask
for
his
wolfish
heart
thus
scoff
and
rail
at
my
infatuation
for
moral
excellence
as
practise
by
humanity
i
sought
to
join
my
company
and
regiment
the
battle
field
maintain
the
same
character
of
undulated
woodland
be
in
general
low
ridge
separate
by
broad
depression
which
sunk
occasionally
into
ravine
of
respectable
depth
at
various
place
wide
clearing
have
be
make
and
i
come
across
a
damp
bottom
or
two
cover
with
shrub
for
a
defensive
force
there
be
several
position
that
be
admirable
as
ralljdng
point
and
it
be
perhaps
owe
to
these
and
the
undoubted
courage
exhibit
by
the
federal
troop
that
the
battle
be
so
protract
though
our
attack
have
be
a
surprise
it
be
certain
that
they
fought
as
though
they
be
resolve
to
deny
it
and
as
the
ground
to
be
won
from
the
enemy
be
nearly
five
mile
in
depth
and
every
half
mile
or
so
they
stood
and
obstinately
contest
it
all
the
honour
of
the
day
be
not
to
be
with
us
i
overtook
my
regiment
about
one
o
clock
and
found
that
it
be
engage
in
one
of
these
occasional
spurt
of
fury
the
enemy
resolutely
maintain
their
ground
and
our
side
be
prepare
for
another
assault
the
fire
be
alternately
brisk
and
slack
we
lay
down
and
avail
ourselves
of
tree
log
and
hollow
and
annoyed
their
upstanding
rank
battery
pound
battery
and
meanwhile
we
hug
our
rest
place
closely
of
a
sudden
we
rise
and
race
towards
the
position
and
take
it
by
sheer
weight
and
impetuosity
as
we
have
do
before
about
three
o
clock
the
battle
grow
very
hot
the
enemy
appear
to
be
more
concentrate
and
immovably
sullen
both
side
fire
well
as
they
grow
more
accustom
to
the
din
but
with
assistance
from
the
reserve
we
be
continually
press
them
towards
the
river
tennessee
without
ever
retreat
an
inch
about
this
time
the
enemy
be
assist
by
the
gun
boat
which
hurl
thdr
enormous
projectile
far
beyond
us
but
though
they
make
great
havoc
among
the
tree
and
create
terror
they
do
comparatively
little
damage
to
those
in
dose
touch
with
the
enemy
the
scream
of
the
big
shell
when
they
first
begin
to
sail
over
our
head
have
the
effect
of
reduce
our
fire
for
they
be
as
fascinate
as
they
be
distract
but
we
become
use
to
them
and
our
attention
be
be
claimed
more
in
front
our
officer
be
more
urgent
and
when
we
saw
the
grow
dyke
of
white
cloud
that
signal
the
bullet
storm
we
could
not
be
indifferent
to
the
more
immediate
danger
dead
body
wound
men
writhe
in
agony
and
assume
every
distressful
attitude
be
frequent
sight
but
what
make
us
heart
sick
be
to
see
now
and
then
the
well
groom
charger
of
an
officer
with
fine
saddle
and
scarlet
and
yellow
edge
cloth
and
brass
tipped
holster
or
a
stray
cavalry
or
artillery
horse
gallop
between
the
line
snort
with
terror
while
his
entrails
soil
with
dust
trail
behind
him
our
officer
have
continued
to
show
the
same
alertness
and
vigour
throughout
the
day
but
as
it
drew
near
four
o
clock
though
they
stix
ve
to
encourage
and
urge
us
on
they
b
an
to
abate
somewhat
in
their
energy
and
it
be
evident
that
the
pluckiest
of
the
men
lack
the
spontaneity
and
spring
ardour
which
have
distinguish
them
earlier
in
the
day
several
of
our
company
lag
wearily
behind
and
the
remainder
show
by
their
drawn
face
the
effect
of
their
effort
yet
after
a
short
rest
they
be
able
to
make
splendid
spurt
as
for
myself
i
have
only
one
wish
and
that
be
for
repose
the
long
continued
excitement
the
successive
tauten
and
relax
of
the
nerve
the
quenchless
thirst
make
more
intense
by
the
fume
of
sulphurous
powder
and
the
cake
grime
on
the
lip
cause
by
tear
the
paper
cartridge
and
a
raven
hunger
all
combine
have
reduce
me
to
a
walk
automaton
and
i
earnestly
wish
that
night
would
come
and
stop
all
far
effort
finally
about
five
o
clock
we
assault
and
capture
a
large
camp
after
drive
the
enemy
well
away
from
it
the
front
line
be
as
thin
as
that
of
a
skirmish
body
and
we
be
order
to
retire
to
the
tent
there
we
hungrily
sought
after
provision
and
i
be
lucky
in
find
a
supply
of
biscuit
and
a
canteen
of
excellent
molasses
which
give
great
comfort
to
myself
and
friend
the
plunder
in
the
camp
be
abundant
there
be
bedding
clothing
and
accoutrement
without
stint
but
people
be
so
exhaust
they
could
do
no
more
than
idly
turn
the
thing
over
night
soon
fell
and
only
a
few
stray
shot
could
now
be
heard
to
remind
us
of
the
thrill
and
horrid
din
of
the
day
except
the
huge
bomb
from
the
gun
boat
which
as
we
be
not
far
from
the
blue
coat
discomforted
only
those
in
the
rear
by
eight
o
clock
i
be
repeat
my
experience
in
the
region
of
dream
indifferent
to
columbiads
and
mortar
and
the
torrential
rain
which
at
midnight
increase
the
misery
of
the
wound
and
tentless
an
hour
before
dawn
i
awoke
from
a
refresh
sleep
and
after
a
hearty
replenishment
of
my
vitals
with
biscuit
and
molasses
i
conceive
myself
to
be
fresher
than
on
sunday
morning
while
await
day
break
i
gather
from
other
early
riser
their
idea
in
regard
to
the
event
of
yesterday
they
be
under
the
impression
that
we
have
gain
a
great
victory
though
we
have
not
as
we
have
anticipate
reach
the
tennessee
river
van
dom
with
his
expect
reinforcement
for
us
be
not
likely
to
make
his
appearance
for
many
day
yet
and
if
general
buell
with
his
troop
have
join
the
enemy
during
the
night
we
have
a
bad
day
work
before
us
we
be
short
of
provision
and
ammunition
general
sidney
johnston
our
chief
commander
have
be
kill
but
beauregard
be
safe
and
unhurt
and
if
buell
be
absent
we
would
win
the
day
at
daylight
i
fell
in
with
my
company
but
there
be
only
about
fifty
of
the
dixie
present
almost
immediately
after
symptom
of
the
come
battle
be
manifest
regiment
be
hurry
into
line
but
even
to
my
inexperienced
eye
the
troop
be
in
ill
condition
for
repeat
the
effort
of
sunday
however
in
brief
time
in
consequence
of
our
picket
be
driven
in
on
us
we
be
move
forward
in
skirmish
order
with
my
musket
on
the
trail
i
found
myself
in
active
motion
more
active
than
otherwise
i
would
have
be
perhaps
because
captain
smith
have
say
now
mr
stanley
if
you
please
step
briskly
forward
this
single
out
of
me
wound
my
amour
propre
and
sent
me
forward
like
a
rocket
in
a
short
time
we
met
our
opponent
in
the
same
formation
as
ourselves
and
advance
most
resolutely
we
threw
ourselves
behind
such
tree
as
be
near
us
fire
load
and
dart
forward
to
another
shelter
presently
i
found
myself
in
an
open
grassy
space
with
no
convenient
tree
or
stiunp
near
but
see
a
shallow
hollow
some
twenty
pace
ahead
i
make
a
dash
for
it
and
ply
my
musket
willi
haste
i
become
so
absorbed
witii
some
blue
figure
in
front
of
me
that
i
do
not
pay
sufficient
heed
to
my
companion
grey
the
open
space
be
too
dangerous
perhaps
for
their
advance
for
have
they
emerge
i
should
have
know
they
be
press
forward
see
my
blue
in
about
the
same
proportion
i
assume
that
the
grey
be
keep
their
position
and
never
once
thought
of
retreat
however
as
despite
our
fire
the
blue
be
come
uncomfortably
near
i
rise
from
my
hollow
but
to
my
speechless
amazement
i
found
myself
a
solitary
grey
in
a
line
of
blue
skirmisher
my
companion
have
retreat
the
next
i
heard
be
down
with
that
gun
secesh
or
i
drill
a
hole
through
you
drop
it
quick
half
a
dozen
of
the
enemy
be
cover
me
at
the
same
instant
and
i
drop
my
weapon
incontinently
two
men
sprang
at
my
collar
and
mardied
me
unresisting
into
the
rank
of
the
terrible
yankee
be
a
prisoner
when
the
sens
have
be
concentrate
upon
a
specific
object
with
the
intensity
which
a
battle
compels
and
be
forcibly
and
suddenly

about
by
another
will
the
immediate
result
be
at
first
stupefy
before
my
consciousness
have
return
to
me
i
be
be
propel
vigorously
from
behind
and
i
be
in
view
of
a
long
sway
line
of
soldier
who
be
march
to
meet
us
with
all
the
precision
of
drill
and
with
such
a
dose
front
that
a
rabbit
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
break
through
this
sight
restore
me
to
all
my
faculty
and
i
remember
i
be
a
confederate
in
misfortune
and
that
it
behove
me
to
have
some
regard
for
my
uniform
i
heard
burst
of
vituperation
from
several
hoarse
throat
which
straighten
my
back
and
make
me
defiant
where
be
you
take
that
fellow
to
drive
a
bayonet
into
the
let
him
drop
where
he
be
they
cry
by
the
dozen
with
a
german
accent
they
grow
more
excite
as
we
drew
nearer
and
more
men
join
in
the
opprobrious
cliorus
then
a
few
dash
from
the
rank
with
level
bayonet
to
execute
what
appear
to
be
the
general
wish
i
look
into
their
face
deform
with
fear
and
fury
and
i
felt
intolerable
loathe
for
the
wild
eyed
brute
thdr
eye
project
and
distend
appear
like
spot
of
pale
blue
ink
in
face
of
dough
reason
have
flee
altogether
from
their
feature
and
to
appeal
for
mercy
to
such
blind
ferocious
animalism
would
have
be
the
height
of
absurdity
but
i
be
absolutely
indifferent
as
to
what
they
might
do
with
me
now
could
i
have
multiply
myself
into
a
thousand
such
unintellectual
look
lout
might
have
be
brush
out
of
existence
with
ease
despite
their
number
they
be
apparently
new
troop
from
such
back
land
as
be
favour
by
german
inunigrants
and
though
of
sturdy
build
another
such
mass
of
savagery
and
stupidity
could
not
have
be
found
within
the
four
comer
of
north
america
how
i
wish
i
could
return
to
the
confederate
and
tell
them
what
kind
of
people
be
oppose
them
before
their
bayonet
reach
me
my
two
guard
who
be
ruddy

ohioan
flung
themselves
before
me
and
present
their
rifle
cry
here
stop
that
you
fellow
he
be
our
prisoner
a
couple
of
officer
be
almost
as
quick
as
they
and
flourish
their
sword
and
amid
an
expenditure
of
profanity
drove
them
quickly
back
into
their
rank
curse
and
blackguarding
me
in
a
manner
truly
american
a
company
open
its
line
as
we
pass
to
the
rear
once
through
i
be
comparatively
safe
from
the
union
troop
but
not
from
the
confederate
missile
which
be
drop
about
and
strike
men
right
and
left
quicken
our
pace
we
soon
be
beyond
danger
from
my
friend
after
which
i
look
about
with
interest
at
the
force
that
be
march
to
retrieve
their
shame
of
yesterday
the
troop
we
saw
belong
to
buell
who
have
cross
the
texmessee
and
be
now
join
by
grant
they
present
a
brave
even
impose
sight
and
in
their
new
uniform
with
glossy
knapsack
rubber
undimmed
brass
resplendent
they
approach
nearer
to
my
idea
of
soldier
than
our
dingy
grey
troop
much
of
this
fine
show
and
seem
steadiness
be
due
to
their
newer
equipment
and
as
yet
unshaken
nerve
but
though
their
movement
be
firm
they
be
languid
and
lack
the
elan
the
bold
confidence
of
the
southerner
give
twenty
four
hour
rest
and
the
enjoyment
of
cooked
ration
i
felt
that
the
confederate
would
have
crumple
up
the
handsome
unionist
within
a
brief
time
though
my
eye
have
abundant
matter
of
interest
within
their
range
my
mind
continually
hark
back
to
the
miserable
hollow
which
have
disgrace
me
and
i
kept
wonder
how
it
be
that
my
fellow
skirmisher
have
so
quickly
disappear
i
be
inclined
to
blame
captain
smith
for
urge
me
on
when
within
a
few
minute
after
he
must
have
withdrawn
his
men
but
it
be
useless
to
trouble
my
mind
with
conjecture
i
be
a
prisoner
shameful
position
what
would
become
of
my
knapsack
and
my
little
treasure
letter
and
souvenir
of
my
father
they
be
lose
beyond
recovery
on
the
way
my
guard
and
i
have
a
discussion
about
our
respective
cause
and
though
i
could
not
admit
it
there
be
much
reason
in
what
they
say
and
i
marvel
that
they
could
put
their
case
so
well
for
until
now
i
be
under
the
impression
that
they
be
robber
who
only
sought
to
desolate
the
south
and
steal
the
slave
but
accord
to
them
have
we
not
be
so
impatient
and
flown
to
arm
the
influence
of
abe
lincoln
and
his
fellow
abolitionist
would
not
have
affected
the
southerner
pecuniarily
for
it
might
have
be
possible
for
congress
to
compensate
slave
owner
that
be
by
buying
up
all
slave
and
afterwards
set
them
free
but
when
the
southerner
who
be
not
averse
to
sell
their
slave
in
the
open
market
refuse
to
consider
anything
relate
to
them
and
begin
to
seize
upon
government
property
fort
arsenal
and
war
ship
and
to
set
about
establish
a
separate
system
in
the
country
then
the
north
resolve
that
this
should
not
be
and
that
be
the
true
reason
of
the
war
the
northern
people
care
nothing
for
the
nigger
the
slavery
question

the
most
famous
and
to
both

at
the
close
of

contest
withdrew

in
perfect
order

we
be
a
sad
lot
of
men
i
feel
convince
that
most
of

felt
with
myself
that
we
be

star
wretch

special
object
of
an
unkind
fate
we
make
no

what

the

of
any
beggarly
individual
amongst
us
all
he
possess
in
the
world
be
a
thin
dingy

of
his

misfortune

be

as
he
could
bear
without

bother

that
of

at
us
how
beautiful

clean

acconunodating
between

may
have
be
about
twenty
of
these
structure
about
thirty
foot
apart
and
stand
in
two
row

i
estimate
that
there
be
enough
prisoner
within
it
to
have
form
a
strong
brigade
say
about
three
thousand
men
when
we
arrive
i
remember
by
the
regimental
badge
which
they
wore
on
their
cap
and
hat
that
they
belong
to
the

butternut

grey
to
whatever
it
be
due
the
appearance
of
the
prisoner
startle
me
the
southerner
uniform
be
never
pretty
but
when
rotten
and
rag
and
swarm
with
vermin
they
heighten
the
disreputability
of
their
wearer
and
if
anything
be
need
to
increase
our
dejection
after
take
sweep
glance
at
the
arid
mud
soil
of
the
great
yard
the
butternut

grey

the
sight
of
ash

posture
that

a
command
of

i
make
some
remark
to
him
upon
the
card

group
opposite

suddenly
i
felt
a
gentle
stroke
on
the
back
of
my
neck
and
in
an
instant
i
be
unconscious
the
next
moment
i
have
a
vivid
view
of
the
village
of
tremeirchion
and
the
grassy
slope
of
the
hill
of
hiraddog
and
i
seem
to
be
hover
over
the
rook

glide
to

of
my

in

and
seem
ck
unto
death
i
take
a
position
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
saw
myself
with
head
bent
down
listen
to
her
part
word
which
sound
regretful
as
though
conscience
smote
her

so
kind
as
she
might
have

heard
the

i
believe
you

it
be
neither
your
fault
nor
mine
you
be
good
and
kind
to
me

thing
be
so
order
that
you
have
to
be
what
you

i
also
dearly
wish
to
love
you
but
i
be
afraid
to
speak
of
it
l
you
would
check
me
or
say
something
that
would
offend
me
i
feel
our
part
be
in
this
spirit
there
be
no
need
of
regret
you
have
do
your
duty
to
me
and
you
have
child
of
your
own
who
require
all
your

to
me
since

farewell
i
put
forth
my
hand
and
felt
the
clasp
of
the
long
thin
hand
of
the
sore
sick
woman
i
heard
a
murmur
of
farewell
and
immediately
i
woke
it
appear
to
me
that
i
have
but
close
my
eye
i
be
still
in
the

recline
attitude
the

engage
in
their
card
game
wilkes
be
in

position
nothing

i
ask
what

what

he
what
make
you
ask
it
be
but
a
moment
ago
you
be
speak
to
me
oh
i
thought
i
have
be
asleep
a
long
time
on
the
next
day
the
th
april
my
aunt
mary
die
at
fynnon
beuno
i
believe
that
the
soul
of
every
human
be
have
its
attendant
spirit
a
nimble
and
delicate
essence
whose
method
of
action
be
by
a
subtle
suggestion
which
it
contrives
to
insinuate
into
the
mind
whether
asleep
or
awake
we
be
too
gross
to
be
capable
of
understand
the
signification
of
the
dream
the
vision
or
the
sudden
presage
or
of
divine
the
source
of
the
premonition
or
its
purport
we
admit
that
we
be
liable
to
receive
a
fleeting
picture
of
an
act
or
a
figure
at
any
moment
but
except
be
struck
by
certain
strange
coincidence
which
happen
to
most
of
us
we
seldom
make
an
effort
to
unravel
the
mystery
the
swift
dart
messenger
stamp
an
image
on
the
mind
and
display
a
vision
to
the
sleeper
and
if
as
sometimes
follow
among
trick
and
twist
of
an
errant
mind
or
reflex
act
of
the
memory
it
happens
to
be
a
true
representation
of
what
be
to
happen
or
have
happen
thousand
of
mile
away
we
be
left
to
grope
hopelessly
as
to
the
manner
and
meaning
of
it
for
there
be
nothing
tangible
to
lay
hold
of
there
be
many
thing
relate
to
my
existence
which
be
inexplicable
to
me
and
probably
it
be
best
so
this
death
bed
scene
project
on
my
mind
screen
across
four
thousand
five
hundred
mile
of
space
be
one
of
these
mystery
after
wilkes
and
i
have
thoroughly
acquaint
ourselves
with
all
the
evil
and
the
good
to
be
found
at
camp
douglas
neither
of
us
saw
any
reason
at
first
why
we
could
not
wait
with
patience
for
the
exchange
of
prisoner
but
as
time
pass
we
found
it
to
be
a
dreary
task
to
endure
the
unchanging
variety
of
misery
surround
us
i
be
often
tempt
with
an
impulse
to
challenge
a
malignant
sentry
bullet
by
cross
that
ghastly
dead
line
which
i
saw
every
day
i
come
out
a
more
unlovely
sight
than
a
sick
secessionist
in
a
bilious
butternut
it
be
scarcely
possible
to
conceive
though
he
have
be
naked
and
soil
by
his
own
filth
there
would
still
have
remain
some
element
of
attractiveness
in
him
but
that
dirty
ill
make
nut
colour
homespun
aggravate
every
sense
and
make
the
poor
sickly
wretch
unutterably
ugly
in
our
treatment
i
think
there
be
a
purpose
if
so
it
may
have
be
from
a
belief
that
we
should
ihe
sooner
recover
our
sens
by
experience
as
much
misery
pain
privation
and
sorrow
as
could
be
contain
within
a
prison
and
therefore
the
authority
rigidly
exclude
every
medical
pious
musical
or
literary
charity
that
might
have
alleviate
our
suffering
it
be
a
barbarous
age
it
be
true
but
there
be
sufficient
christian
family
in
chicago
who
i
be
convince
only
need
a
suggestion
to
have
form
society
for
the
relief
of
the
prisoner
and
what
an
opportunity
there
be
for
such
to
strengthen
piety
to
promote
cheerfulness
soothe
political
ferocity
and
subdue
the
brutal
and
vicious
passion
which
possess
those
thousand
of
unhappy
youth
intunured
within
the
horrible
pen
left
to
ourselves
with
absolutely
nothing
to
do
but
to
brood
over
our
position
bewail
our
lot
catch
the
taint
of
disease
from
each
other
and
passively
abide
in
our
prison
pen
we
be
soon
in
a
fair
state
of
rot
while
yet
alive
the
reaction
from
the
excitement
of
the
battle
field
and
the
cheerful
presence

and
the

across

but
after
a
few
day
it
set
in
strong
upon
us
when
once
within
the
bleak
camp
at
chicago
everything
we
saw
and
touch
add
its
pernicious
influence
the
melancholy
face
of
those
who
be
already
weary
with
their
confinement
the

of
the

the

owe
our
fellow

themselves

by
the
authority
but
when
the
authority
be
as
ignorant
as
ourselves
i
cannot
believe
their
neglect
of
us
be
intentional
we
be
simply
doom
every
morning
the
wagon
come
to
the
hospital
and
dead
house
to
take
away
the
body
and
i
saw
the
corps
roll
in
their
blanket
take
to
the
vehicle
and
pile
one
upon
another
as
the
new
zealand
frozen
mutton
carcase
be
cart
from
the
dock
the
statistic
of
andersonville
be
believe
to
show
that
the
south
be
even
more
callous
towards
their
prisoner
than
the
authority
of
camp
douglas
be
i
admit
that
we
be
well
fed
than
the
union
prisoner
be
and
against
colonel
milligan
and
mr
shipman
i
have
not
a
single
accusation
to
make
it
be
the
age
that
be
brutally
senseless
and
heedlessly
cruel
it
be
lavish
and
wasteful
of
life
and
have
not
the
least
idea
of
what
civilise
warfare
ought
to
be
except
in
strategy
it
be
at
the
end
of
the
flint
lock
age
a
stupid
and
heartless
age
which
believe
that
the
application
of
every
variety
of
torture
be
well
for
discipline
than
kindness
and
be
guilty
during
the
war
of
enormity
that
would
tax
the
most
saintly
to
forgive
just
as
the
thirty
be
stupider
and
crueller
than
the
fifty
and
the
fifty
be
more
bloody
than
the
seventy
in
the
mercantile
marine
service
so
a
war
in
the
ninety
will
be
much
more
civilize
than
the
civil
war
of
the
sixty
those
who
have
survive
that
war
and
have
see
brotherly
love
re
establish
and
reconciliation
complete
when
they
think
of
andersonville
libby
camp
douglas
and
other
prison
and
of
the
blood
shed
in
battle
and
skirmish
must
in
this
present
peaceful
year
need
think
that
a
moral
epidemic
rag
to
have
make
them
so
intensely
hate
then
what
they
profess
to
love
now
though
a
democratic
government
like
the
american
will
always
be
more
despotic
and
arbitrary
than
that
of
a
constitutional
monarchy
even
its
army
will
have
its
red
cross
society
and
prisoner
aid
society
and
the
sight
we
saw
at
camp
douglas
will
never
be
see
in
america
again
be
colonel
milligan
living
now
he
would
admit
that
a
well
system
of
latrine
a
ration
of
soap
some
travel
arrangement
for
lavatory
a
commission
superintendent
over
each
barrack
a
brass
band
the
loan
of
a
few
secondhand
book
magazine
and
the
best
class
newspaper
with
all
war
news
cut
out
would
have
be
the
salvation
of
two
third
of
those
who
die
at
camp
douglas
and
by
show
how
superior
the
united
state
government
be
to
the
confederate
state
would
have
sent
the
exchange
prisoner
back
to
their
home
in
a
spirit
more
reconcile
than
they
be
those
in
authority
to
day
also
know
that
though
when
in
battle
it
be
necessary
to
fight
with
all
the
venom
of
fiend
for
victory
once
the
rifle
be
laid
down
and
a
man
becomes
a
prisoner
a
gracious
treatment
be
more
efficacious
than
the
most
revolt
cruelty
still
the
civilize
world
be
densely
ignorant
it
have
improve
immensely
in
thirty
year
but
from
what
i
have
see
in
my
travel
in
many
land
it
be
less
dispose
to
be
kind
to
man
than
to
any
other
creature
and
yet
none
of
all
god
creature
be
more
sadly
in
need
of
protection
than
he
the
only
official
connect
with
camp
douglas
whom
i
remember
with
pleasure
be
mr
shipman
the
commissary
he
be
gentlemanly
and
white
haired
which
add
to
his
unvarying
benevolence
and
politeness
cause
him
to
be
regard
by
me
as
something
of
an
agreeable
wonder
in
that
pestful
yard
after
some
two
day
acquaintance
while
draw
the
ration
he
sound
me
as
to
my
intention
i
scarcely
comprehend
him
at
the
outset
for
camp
douglas
be
not
a
place
to
foster
intention
he
explain
that
if
i
be
tire
of
be
a
prisoner
i
could
be
release
by
enrol
myself
as
a
unionist
that
be
become
a
union
soldier
my
eye
open
very
wide
at
this
and
i
shook
my
head
and
say
h
no
i
could
not
do
that
nothing
could
have
be
more
unlikely
i
have
not
even
dream
that
such
an
act
be
possible
a
few
day
later
i
say
to
mr
shipman
they
have
take
two
wagon
load
of
dead
men
away
this
morning
he
give
a
sympathetic
shrug
as
if
to
say
it
be
all
very
sad
but
what
can
we
do
he
then
held
forth
upon
the
superiority
of
the
north
the
certainty
of
defeat
for
the
south
the
pity
it
be
to
see
young
men
throw
their
life
away
for
such
a
cause
as
slavery
and
so
on
in
short
all
that
a
genuinely
kind
man
but
fervidly
northern
could
say
his
love
embrace
northerner
and
southerner
alike
for
he
saw
no
distinction
between
them
except
that
the
young
brother
have
risen
to
smite
the
elder
and
must
be
punish
until
he
repent
but
it
be
useless
to
try
and
influence
me
by
political
reason
in
the
first
place
i
be
too
ignorant
in
politics
and
too
dow
of
comprehension
to
follow
his
reasoning
in
the
second
place
every
american
friend
of
mine
be
a
southerner
and
my
adopt
father
be
a
southerner
and
i
be
blind
through
my
gratitude
and
in
the
third
place
i
have
a
secret
scorn
for
people
who
could
kill
one
another
for
the
sake
of
african
slave
there
be
no
blackies
in
wale
and
why
a
sooty
face
nigger
from
a
distant
land
should
be
an
element
of
disturbance
between
white
brother
be
a
puzzle
to
me
i
should
have
to
read
a
great
deal
about
him
ascertain
his
wrong
and
his
right
and
wherein
his
enslavement
be
unjust
and
his
liberty
be
desirable
before
i
could
venture
upon
give
an
opinion
adverse
to
southerner
as
i
have
see
him
in
the
south
he
be
a
half
savage
who
have
be
export
by
his
own
countryman
and
sell
in
open
market
agreeable
to
time
honour
custom
have
the
southerner
invade
africa
and
make
captive
of
the
black
i
might
have
see
some
justice
in
decent
and
pious
people
exclaim
against
the
barbarity
but
so
far
as
i
knew
of
the
matter
it
be
only
the
accident
oif
a
presidential
election
which
have
involve
the
north
and
south
in
a
civil
war
and
i
could
not
take
it
upon
me
to
do
anything
more
than
stand
by
my
friend
but
in
the
course
of
six
week
more
powerful
influence
than
mr
shipman
gentle
reason
be
undermine
my
resolve
to
remain
as
a
prisoner
these
be
the
increase
in
sickness
the
horror
of
the
prison
the
oily
atmosphere
the
ignominious
cartage
of
the
dead
the
useless
flight
of
time
the
fear
of
be
incarcerate
for
year
which
so
affected
my
spirit
that
i
felt
a
few
more
day
of
these
scene
would
drive
nie
mad
finally
i
be
persuade
to
accept
with
several
other
prisoner
the
term
of
release
and
enrol
myself
in
the
u
s
artillery
service
and
on
the
th
june
be
once
more
free
to
inhale
the
fresh
air
but
after
two
or
three
day
service
the
germ
of
the
prison
disease
which
have
swept
so
many
score
of
fine
young
fellouv
s
to
untimely
graf
broke
out
with
virulence
in
my
system
i
disguise
my
complaint
as
much
as
be
possible
for
have
be
a
prisoner
i
felt
myself
liable
to
be
suspect
but
on
the
day
of
oiu
arrival
at
harper
ferry
dysentery
and
loi
ir
fever
laid
me
prostrate
i
be
conveyed
to
the
hospital
and
remain
there
until
the
nd
june
when
i
be
discharge
out
of
the
service

my
condition

this
time
be
as
low
as
it
would
be
possible
to
reduce
a
human
be
to
outside
of
an
american
prison
i
have
not
a
penny
in
my
pocket

pair
of
blue
military
trouser

nethers

dark
serge

my
back
and
a
mongrel

i
knew
not
where
to
go
the
seed
of
disease
be
still
in
me
and
i
could
not
walk
three
hundred
yard
without
stop
to
gasp
for
breath
as
like
a
log
i
lay
at
night
under
the
star
heat
by
fever
and
bleeding
internally
i
thought
i
ought
to
die
accord
to
what
i
have
see
of
those
who
yield
to
death
as
my
strength
depart
death
advanced
and
there
be
no
power
or
wish
to
resist
left
in
me
but
with
each
dawn
there
would
come
a
tiny
bit
of
hope
which
make
me
forget
all
about
death
and
think
only
of
food
and
of
the
necessity
of
find
a
shelter
hagers
town
be
but
twenty
four
mile
from

but
it
take
me
a
week
to
reach
a
farm
house
not
quite
half

i
beg
permission
to
occupy
an
out

may

the

red
under

of
a

wretched
object

possibly
as
i
felt
i
be
by
the
manner

good
fellow

to
hide
his
disgust
what
of
it
he
spread
some
hay
in
the
out
house
and
i
drop
on
it
without
the
small
wish
to
leave
again
it
be
several
day
before
i
woke
to
consciousness
to
find
a

under
me

different
clothes
on
me

have
a
clean
cotton

me

he

the

of
the

in
his
absence
by
dint
of
assiduous
kindness
and
a
diet
of
milk

gain
strength
slowly
until
i

to
sit
in

of
an
occasional

to
magnify
what
i
meant
to
become
though
what
i
be
the
excellence
of
my
present
position
be
not
so
obvious
to
myself
like
a
bride
array
herself
in
her
best
for
her
lover
i
have
arrange
my
story
to
please
one
who
would
at
last
i
hop
prove
an
affectionate
mother
but
i
found
no
affection
and
i
never
again
sought
for
or
expect
what
i
discover
have
never
exist
i
be
told
that
i
be
a
disgrace
to
them
in
the
eye
of
their
neighbour
and
they
desire
me
to
leave
as
speedily
as
possible
this
experience
sank
so
deep
and
together
with
the
life
in
earlier
year
have
so
marked
an
effect
on
stanley
character
that
it
seem
best
to
give
it
to
the
reader
just
as
he
note
it
down
as
he
niused
over
his
life
near
its
close
when
fame
and
prosperity
come
to
him
he
be
just
to
the
claim
of
blood
and
give
practical
help
but
the
tenderness
which
lay
deep
in
his
nature
and
the
repeat
and
hopeless
rebuff
it
encounter
produce
in
the
reaction
an
habitual
strong
self
suppression
the
tenderness
be
there
through
all
the
stir
year
of
action
and
achievement
but
it
be
guard
against
such
ehocks
as
have
earlier
wound
it
by
an
habitual
reserve
and
an
austere
sdi
command
he
return
to
america
and
with
a
sort
of
rebound
towards
the
world
of
vigorous
action
threw
himself
for
a
time
into
the
life
of
the
sea
the
motive
apparently
be
partly
as
a
ready
mean
of
livelihood
and
partly
a
relish
for
adventure
and
adventure

certainly
found
through

just
how

why
he

we
know
the
where
and
no
ambitious
r

could
ask
a
well
chance
for
his

it
in
his

to
have
his

welcome
by

three
month
later
in

and
stanley
left

then
for
a
twelve
month
his
diary
give
only
such
glimpse
of
him
as
an
occasional
name
of
a
place
with
date
st
joseph
missoiuri
across
the
plain
indian
salt
lake
city
denver
black
hawk
omaha
apparentiy
through
this
time
he
be
impel
by
an
overflow
youthfiu
energy
and
an
innate
love
of
novelty
and
adventure
in
his
later
year
he
told
how
in
his
early
day
his
exuberant
vigour
be
such
that
when
a
horse
stood
across
his
path
his
impulse
be
not
to
go
round
but
to
jump
over
it
and
he
have
a
keen
relish
for
the
sight
and
novelty
the
many
colour
life
of
the
west
so
he
go
light
heartedly
on
his
way
for
to
admire
and
for
to
see
for
to
behold
the
world
ao
wide
through
this
period
he
seem
to
have
do
more
or
less
newspaper
correspondence
and
to
have
tend
towards
that
as
a
profession
here
belongs
an
episode
which
be
told
in
one
of
the
autobiographic
fragment
the
reckless
frolic
of
boy
recount
with
the
sobriety
of
age
be
connect
with
the
press
my
acquaintance
be
sought
by
some
theatrical
people
in
omaha
at
which
be
young
and
foolish
i
be
much
gratify
after
a
benefit
performance
which
i
be
principally
the
mean
of
get
up
for
them
i
sup
with
them
and
for
the
first
time
i
drank
so
much
wine
that
i
taste
the
joy
and
misery
of
intoxication
my
impression
will
not
be
forgotten
for
though
the
faculty
of
self
restraint
be
helpless
the
brain
be
not

that
i
do
not
know
what
i
be
about
i
be
conscious
of
an
irrepressible
hilarity
which
provoke
me
to
fling
decorum
to
the
wind
and
of
be
overwhelmingly
aflfec
tionate
to
my
boon
companion
the
woman
of
the
party
appear
more
beautiful
than
houri
especially
one
for
whom
i
felt
ecstatic
tenderness
when
we
have
sup
and
drank
and
exhaust
our
best
story
about
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
we
agree
to
separate
the
lady
to
their
own
home
but
we
men
to
a
frokc
or
lark
in
the
open
the
effect
of
wine
be
at
its
high
we
sallied
out
sing
we
wo
not
go
home
till
morning
i
be
soon
conscious
that
my
tread
be
different
that
the
sidewalk
remind
me
of
the
deck
of
a
ship
in
a
gale
the
lamp
post
be
not
perpendicular
and
lean
perilously
over
which
make
me
babble
about
the
singular
waywardness
and
want
of
uprightness
in
house
and
lamp
post
and
awning
column
and
the
curious
elasticity
of
the
usually
firm
earth
i
wish
to
halt
and
meditate
about
this
sudden
change
of
thing
in
general
scrap
of
marine
song
about
the
briny
ocean
brave
sailor
boy
and
good
ship

on
her
water
be
suggest
to
me
by
the
rock
ground
and
burst
in
fluent
song
from
my
lip
a
noisier
set
than
we
become
it
be
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
i
wonder
now
we
be
not
shot
at
for
the
omaha
people
be
not
very
remarkable
for
forbearance
when
angered
and
a
charge
of
small
shot
would
have
be
no
more
than
we
each
of
us
well
deserve
but
someone
suggest
that
vengeful
men
be
after
us
and
that
be
enough
to
send
us
scamper
each
to
his
home
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
reach
my
place
without
accident
and
without
meeting
a
single
constable
and
plunge
into
bed
i
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
my
iirst
wake
make
me
aware
of
a
rack
headache
and
a
deep
conviction
that
i
have
behave
disgracefully
i
be
enrich
however
by
an
experience
that
have
last
all
my
life
for
i
then
vowed
that
this
should
be
the
last
time
i
would
have
to
condemn
myself
for
a
scandalous
act
of
the
kind
what
an
egregious
fool
i
have
be
hang
n
and
all
his
gang
be
my
thought
for
many
a
day
like
david
copperfield
first
supper
party
one
such
lesson
be
enough
for
a
man
who
be
to
do
a
man
s
part
he
never
again
fell
under
circe
spell
but
the
hunger
for
robust
exploit
be
there
and
he
have
found
a
companion
of
landred
taste
with
w
h
cook
in
may
he
start
for
denver
we
bought
some
plank
and
tool
and
in
a
few
hour
construct
a
flat
bottom
boat
have
furnish
it
with
provision
and
arm
against
the
indian
towards
even
we
float
down
the
platte
river
after
twice
upset
and
many
adventure
and
narrow
escape
we
reach
the
missouri
river
from
omaha
they
travel
to
boston
where
in
july
they
take
a
sail
ship
for
smyrna
they
have
plan
to
go
far
into
asia
the
precise
nature
of
their
plan
be
not
recount
but
there
be
little
doubt
that
stanley
be
act
partly
as
a
newspaper
correspondent
what
be
the
base
of
supply
or
how
ambitious
be
their
hope
be
not
told
but
they
go
on
their
own
resource
and
be
well
provide
with
money
stanley
seem
from
the
first
to
have
command
good
price
for
his
newspaper
work
and
he
note
that
he
early
take
warn
from
the
extravagance
and
dissipation
which
brought
many
a
bright
young
fellow
in
the
profession
to
grief
i
practice
a
rigid
economy
punish
my
appetite
and
little
by
little
the
sum
acquire
through
this
abstinence
begin
to
impart
a
sense
of
security
and
give
an
independence
to
my
bearing
which
however
i
might
strive
to
conceal
it
betrayed
that
i
be
deliver
from
the
dependent
state
thus
presumably
he
have
save
the
sinew
of
war
for
this
expedition
the
opening
stage
from
the
approach
to
the
asian
shore
be
crowd
with
interest
stanley
record
with
enthusiasm
the
appeal
of
classic
and
biblical
association
the
strangeness
and
fascination
of
oriental
scenery
the
aspect
of
country
and
people
on
leave
smyrna
they
plunge
into
the
interior
it
be
his
first
draught
of
the
wonder
world
of
the
orient
and
he
drank
eagerly
but
a
speedy
change
fell
on
the
traveller
first
the
american
lad
whom
they
have
brought
with
them
as
an
attendant
out
of
sheer
mischief
set
a
fire
ablaze
which
spread
and
threaten
wide
destruction
bring
upon
them
a
crowd
of
infuriate
villager
whom
they
have
great
difficulty
in
appease
then
when
they
have
penetrate
into
wilder
r
ons
they
fell
in
with
a
treacherous
guide
who
brought
upon
them
a
horde
of
turkoman
they
be
severely
beaten
and
robbed
of
all
their
money
twelve
hundred

all
their

from
place
to
place
for
five
day
with
indignity
and
abuse
to
escape
imminent
death
only
by
the
intervention
of
a
benevolent
old
man
the
semi

when

settle
down
we
grow
pale

without

they
move
us
by
their

they

that
the

be
primarily
due
not

rash
act
the
speech
of
general
hancock

the
peace
commissioner
faithfully
reflect
the
sentiment
of
the
most
cultivate
american
towards
them
and
be
genuine
exhortation
to
the
indian
to
stand
aside
from
the
over
whelm
wave
of
white
humanity
which
be
resistlessly

towards

the

of
the
indian

no
less
faithfully
reflect
their
proud
contempt
of
danger

betray
in
many
instance
a
consciousness
of
the
sad
destiny
await
them
in
all
this
stanley
be
unconsciously
acquire
a
preliminary
lesson
in
deal
with
savage
race
the
tone
in
which
sherman
henderson
and
commissioner
taylor
spoke
to
the
indian
now
as
to
warrior
now
as
to
child
give
hint
which
later
stanley
put
to
good
use
and
the
experience
of
the
indian
suggests
a
parallel
with
that
of
the
congo
native
as
each
met
the
white
the
wise
and
generous
purpose
of
men
like
sherman

taylor
as
afterwards
of
stanley
be
woefully
impede
in
their
execution
by
the

my

to

take
me
on

call
to
mr
julia
ward
howe
of
boston
and
then
to
the
greek
seminary
where
i
saw
some
young
greek
with
feature
not
unworthy
of
the
praise
commonly
ascribed
to
greek
beauty
on
the
way
to
the
square
evangelides
observe
my
favourable
impression
take
advantage
of
my
frank
admiration
and
suggest
that
i
should
marry
a
greek
girl
up
to
this
moment
it
never
have
enter
my
mind
that
it
must
be
some
day
my
fate
to
select
a
wife
rapidly
my
mind
revolve
this
question
to
marry
require
mean
large
mean
than
i
have
my
twelve
hundred
pound
would
soon
be
spent
and
on
four
hundred
pound
a
year
and
that
depend
on
the
will
of
one
mem
it
would
be
rash
to
venture
with
an
extravagsmt
woman
yet
the
suggestion
be
delicious
from
other
point
of
view
a
wife
my
wife
how
grand
the
proprietorship
of
a
fair
woman
appear
to
be
love
with
heart
and
soul
above
all
else
for
ever
united
in
thought
and
sympathy
with
a
fair
and
virtuous
be
whose
very
touch
give
strength
and
courage
and
confidence
oh
dear
how
my
warm
imagination
glow
at
the
strange
idea
evangelides
meanwhile
observes
me
and
cimningly
touch
the
colour
of
my
lively
fancy
becomes
eloquent
upon
greek
beauty
the
virtue
and
the
constant
affection
of
greek
woman
but
how
be
it
possible
for
a
wanderer
like
myself
to
have
the
opportunity
of
meeting
such
a
creature
as
you
describe
i
have
no
rest
place
and
no
home
i
be
here
to
day
and
off
to
morrow
it
be
not
likely
that
a
man
can
become
so
infatuate
with
a
woman
at
a
glance
or
that
she
would
follow
a
stranger
to
the
church
and
risk
her
happiness
at
a
nod
why
will
you
distract
a
poor
fellow
with
your
rapture
upon
the
joy
of
marriage
and
much
else
with
breathless
haste
i
retort
i
look
at
evangelides
and
saw
his
age
to
be
great
beard
white
as
snow
though
his
face
be
unwrinkled
swiftly
i
try
to
dive
beneath
that
fair
exterior
and
somehow
i
compare
him
to
a
homer
or
some
other
great
classic
who
love
to
be
the
cicerone
of
youth
and
take
no
note
of
his
own
year
the
charm
of
hellas
fell
upon
me
and
i
n
elded
a
patient
hearing
to
the
fervid
word
and
all
discretion
flee
despite
inward
admonition
to
beware
of
rashness
he
say
he
would
be
my
proxy
and
would
choose
a
damsel
worthy
of
every
praise
for
beauty
and
for
character
like
one
who
hop
and
yet
doubt
believe
and
yet
suspect
i
say
very
well
if
you
can
show
me
such
a
girl
as
you
describe
i
will
use
my
best
judgement
and
tell
you
later
what
i
think
of
her
and
so
it
be
agree
in
the
even
i
walk
in
the
square
with
evangelides
who
suddenly
ask
me
what
i
thought
of
his
own
daughter
calliope
though
sorely
tempt
to
laugh
i
do
not
but
say
gravely
that
i
thought
she
be
too
old
for
me
the
fact
be
calliope
be
not
a
beauty
and
though
she
be
only
nineteen
accord
to
her
father
yet
she
be
not
one
to
thaw
my
reserve
august
st
this
morning
evangelides
propose
his
daughter
in
sober
serious
earnest
and
it
require
in
order
not
to
ojffend
very
guard
language
to
dispel
any
such
strange
illusion
upon
my
soul
this
be
get
amuse
it
be
scarcely
credible
that
a
father
would
be
so
indifferent
to
his
daughter
happiness
as
to
cast
her
upon
the
first
stranger
he
meet
what
be
there
in
me
that
urge
him
to
choose
me
for
a
son
in
law
though
he
claim
to
be
a
rich
man
i
do
not
think
he
have
sufficient
hundred
to
induce
me
to
entertain
the
offer
my
liberty
be
more
precious
than
any
conceivable
amount
of
gold
august
nd
rode
out
during
the
morning
into
the
country
beyond
hermopolis
and
cross
the
mountain
to
the
village
of
analion
i
be
delighted
with
all
i
saw
the
evidence
of
rural
industry
the
manifest
sign
of
continuous
and
thoughtful
care
of
property
the
necessity
for
strictest
economy
and
unceasing
toil
to
make
both
end
meet
the
beauty
of
the
stainless
sky
and
the
wide
view
of
dark
blue
sea
which
lay
before
me
on
every
side
if
it
be
calculate
on
the
part
of
evangelides
he
could
scarcely
have
do
anything
well
than
propose
this
ride
for
what
i
saw
during
the
ride
by
recall
all
i
have
read
of
greece
make
greek
thing
particularly
dear
to
me
when
i
return
to
the
town
i
quite
understood
byron
passion
for
hellas
in
the
even
evangelides
walk
with
me
on
a
visit
to
a
family
which
live
on
another
side
of
the
square
we
be
receive
by
a
very
respectable
old
gentleman
in
sober
black
and
a
stout
lady
who
in
appearance
dress
and
surroundings
show
that
she
study
comfort
evangelides
seem
to
be
on
good
term
with
them
and
they
all
bandy
small
change
of
g
stp
in
a
delightfully
frank
and
easy
manner
presently
into
the
sit
room
glide
a
young
lady
who
come
as
near
as
possible
to
the
realisation
of
the
ideal
which
my
fancy
have
portrayed
after
the
vision
of
marriage
have
be
excite
by
evangelides
frolicsome
talk
she
after
a
formal
introduction
subside
on
a
couch
demure
and
wrap
in
virgin
modesty
her
name
be
virginia
and
well
it
befit
her
where
have
i
see
her
face
or
whom
do
she
recall
my
memory
flee
over
score
of
face
and
picture
and
instantly
i
bethought
me
of
the
empress
eugenie
when
she
be
the
countess
montijo
a
marvellous
likeness
in
profile
and
style
she
be
about
sixteen
and
if
she
can
speak
english
who
know
simultaneously
with
the
drift
of
my
thought
evangelides
in
the
easy
manner
lead
the
conversation
with
the
senior
to
marriage
of
young
people
he
be
so
point
that
i
become
uneasy
my
face
begin
to
bum
as
i
felt
the
allusion
get
personal
jove
what
a
direct
people
these
greek
be
not
a
particle
of
reserve
no
shilly
shallying
or
beating
about
the
bush
but
i
say
be
your
daughter
ripe
for
marriage
if
so
here
be
a
fine
young
fellow
quite
ready
evangelides
be
nearly
as
plain
as
this
then
the
mother
turn
to
me
and
ask
be
you
married
heaven
forbid
say
i
why
she
say
smile
with
proud
consciousness
of
superior
knowledge
on
her
face
be
marriage
so
dreadful
i
be
sure
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
not
thought
of
the
subject
oh
well
i
hope
you
will
think
of
it
now
there
be
many
fair
woman
in
greece
and
greek
woman
make
the
best
wife
i
be
quite
ready
to
believe
you
and
if
i
met
a
young
greek
lady
who
thought
as
much
of
me
as
i
of
her
i
might
be
tempt
to
sacrifice
my
independence
i
answer
more
with
a
view
to
avoid
an
awkward
silence
than
with
a
desire
to
keep
up
such
a
terribly
personal
conversation
with
stranger
i
be
sure
say
the
lady
if
you
look
around
you
will
find
a
young
lady
after
your
heart
i
bow
but
my
face
be
aflame
with
astonish
effrontery
evangelides
maintain
the
point
conversation
until
i
saw
my
own
uneasiness
reflect
in
rginia
face
who
grow
alternately
crimson
and
pak
both
colour
agree
with
her
and
i
pity
her
distress
and
frown
on
evangelides
who
however
be
incorrigible
then
i
begin
to
ask
myself
be
this
really
greek
custom
or
be
it
merely
a
frantic
zeal
on
evangelides
part
be
this
the
siren
isle
wherein
the
famed
ulysses
be
so
bewitch
or
be
the
atmosphere
of
the
cyclades
fatal
to
bachelorhood
it
would
never
do
to
tell
in
detail
all
i
thought
or
give
all
my
self
questioning
but
ever
and
anon
in
my
speculation
i
stole
a
glance
at
virginia
face
and
each
glance
start
other
query
be
this
to
be
a
farcical
adventure
or
shall
it
be
serious
i
felt
that
only
the
mute
maiden
could
answer
such
a
question
susceptible
and
romantic
i
know
i
be
but
it
require
more
than
a
pretty
face
to
rouse
passionate
love
we
rise
to
go
each
protest
that
we
have
pass
a
pleasant
even
the
lady
of
the
house
promise
half
seriously
to
find
a
nice
wife
for
me
do
say
i
and
i
will
be
eternally
grateful
good
bye
miss
virginia
good
bye
she
say
timidly
blushing
painfully
i
note
she
have
a
french
accent
i
find
she
only
know
a
few
word
of
english
but
she
be
fluent
in
french
here
then
come
another
obstacle
i
could
make
no
love
in
french
without
explode
at
my
own
ignorance
of
it
but
there
be
no
doubt
that
so
far
as
beauty
go
virginia
be
sufficient
september
th
after
a
short
absence
i
have
return
evangelides
welcome
me
effusively
pass
the
even
with
virginia
family
there
be
two
brother
of
virginia
fine
young
fellow
present
and
a
sister
it
be
clear
that
my
letter
have
be
a
subject
of
family
discussion
for
every
eye
be
marked
by
a
more
discern
glance
than
would
have
be
noticeable
otherwise
even
on
the
little
girl
face
i
read
wonder
if
he
will
suit
me
as
a
brother
in
law
i
wish
i
could
say
to
her
so
far
as
you
and
virginia
be
concerned
i
do
not
think
you
will
have
cause
for
regret
on
the
whole
the
ordeal
be
not
unsatisfactory
i
be
conscious
that
virginia
be
favourable
no
decision
have
be
arrive
at
yet
but
i
feel
that
where
there
be
so
many
head
in
council
father
mother
brother
relative
friend
and
evangelides

be
a
deal
to
debate
september
loth
a
friend
of
the
family
come
into
my
room
this
afternoon
and
be
in
feature
voice
and
conduct
infectiously
congratulatory
he
told
me
that
the
marriage
be
as
good
as
conclude
that
i
have
only
to
name
the
day
i
gasped
and
with
good
reason
here
be
an
event
which
i
have
always
consider
as
sacred
mysterious
require
peculiar
influence
and
circumstance
to
bring
within
range
of
possibility
so
imminent
that
it
depend
only
on
my
own
wish
incredulous
i
ask
but
be
you
certain
as
certain
as
i
be
alive
i
have
only
just
left
them
and
come
expressly
to
enquire
your
wish
in
the
matter
feel
that
retreat
be
as
undesirable
as
it
would
be
offensive
i
reply
then
of
course
as
my
business
admits
of
no
delay
i
should
like
the
marriage
to
take
place
next
sunday
all
right
he
say
next
sunday
will
suit
us
perfectly
and
he
left
me
quiver
almost
and
certainly
agitate
in
the
even
i
visit
the
house
i
be
allow
to
see
virginia
and
in
a
short
time
whatever
misgiving
i
may
have
have
as
to
the
wisdom
of
my
act
be
banish
by
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
the
trust
visible
in
her
eye
there
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
ultimate
responsiveness
to
the
height
and
depth
of
love
as
yet
naturally
there
be
no
love
but
it
be
budding
and
if
allow
to
expand
there
would
be
no
flaw
in
the
bloom
if
i
know
myself
at
all
i
think
that
my
condition
be
much
the
same
ah
that
i
knew
of
her
i
admire
and
if
she
be
as
constant
in
goodness
as
she
be
beautiful
there
would
be
no
reason
to
regret
have
be
so
precipitate
from
these
rapid
reflection
i
be
recall
by
the
mother
remark
which
in
a
short
time
satisfied
me
that
the
marriage
be
not
so
positively
determine
upon
as
i
have
be
lead
to
believe
that
afternoon
as
she
go
on
i
perceive
it
be
not
settle
at
all
the
same
fear
i
have
felt
of
commit
an
imprudence
be
sway
her
she
say
that
i
be
quite
a
stranger
of
whose
antecedent
everyone
in
syra
be
quite
ignorant
and
she
be
therefore
oblige
to
ask
me
to
have
patience
until
all
reasonable
assurance
have
be
give
that
i
be
what
i
represent
myself
to
be
the
wisdom
of
this
act
i
could
not
but
applaud
the
mother
be
just
and
prudent
and
my
respect
for
her
increase
stillt
it
be
tantalise
my
dedsion
to
marry
though
so
quickly
arrive
at
cost
me
a
struggle
and
some
grief
my
independence
i
value
greatly
freedom
be
so
precious
to
me
to
be
able
to
wander
where
i
like
at
a
moment
thought
with
only
a
portmanteau
to
look
after
i
should
not
have
barter
for
a
fortune
but
now
after
look
into
the
face
of
such
a
sweet
girl
as
virginia
and
see
her
readiness
to
be
my
companion
for
well
or
for
bad
and
believe
that
she
would
not
hinder
my
movement
the
disagreeability
of
be
wed
have
be
remove
and
i
have
be
brought
to
look
upon
the
event
as
rather
desirable
well
so
be
it
i
say
though
i
be
sorry
and
perhaps
you
may
be
sorry
but
i
cannot
deny
that
you
be
just
and
wise

go
away
shortly

i
feel
that
she
be
a
treasure
and
my
admiration
if
encourage
would
soon
be
convert
into
love
and
if
once
i
love
i
be
lose
however
the
possibility
of
lose
her
serf
to
restrain
me

i
new
year
s
day
many
people
have
greet
me
and
express
their
wish
that
it
should
be
a
happy
one
and
that
i
should
see
many
more
such
day
they
be
no
doubt
sincere
but
what
avail
their
wish
and
what
be
happiness
what
a
curious
custom
it
be
to
take
this
day
above
all
others
to
speak
of
happiness
when
inwardly
each
must
think
in
his
soul
that
it
admonishes
him
of
the
lapse
of
time
and
what
enormous
arrears
there
still
remain
to
make
up
the
sum
of
his
happiness
as
for
me
i
know
not
what
i
lack
to
make
me
happy
i
have
health
youth
and
a
free
spirit
but
what
to
morrow
may
bring
forth
i
cannot
tell
therefore
take
care
to
keep
that
health
the
knowledge
that
every
moment
make
me
old
the
fluctuation
to
which
the
spirit
be
subject
hour
by
hour
for
ever
remind
me
that
happiness
be
not
to
be
secure
in
this
world
except
for
brief
period
and
for
a
houseless
friendless
fellow
like
myself
those
period
when
we
cast
ofif
all
thought
which
tends
to
vex
the
mind
cannot
by
any
possibility
be
frequent
but
if
to
be
happy
be
to
be
without
sorrow
fear
anxiety
doubt
i
have
be
happy
and
if
i
could
find
an
island
in
mid
ocean
remote
from
the
presence
or
reach
of
man
with
a
few
necessary
sufficient
to
sustain
life
i
might
be
happy
yet
for
then
i
could
forget
what
reminds
me
of
unhappiness
and
when
death
come
i
should
accept
it
as
a
long
sleep
and
rest
but
as
this
wish
of
mine
cannot
be
gratify
i
turn
to
what
many
will
do
to
day
meditate
think
with
regret
of
all
the
thing
left
undone
that
ought
to
have
be
do
of
word
say
that
ought
not
to
have
be
uttered
of
vile
thought
that
stain
the
mind
and
resolve
with
god
help
to
be
well
nobler
purer
may
heaven
assist
all
who
wish
the
same
and
fill
their
heart
with
goodness
january
th
six
day
of
this
new
year
be
already
go
and
one
of
the
resolution
which
i
make
on
the
first
day
i
have
be
compel
to
break
i
have
mentally
resolve
to
smoke
no
more
from
a
belief
that
it
be
a
vice
and
that
it
be
my
duty
to
suppress
it
for
six
day
i
strove
against
the
hanker
though
the
desire
surge
up
strongly
to
day
i
have
yield
to
it
as
the
effort
to
suppress
it
absorbed
too
mudi
of
my
time
and
now
i
promise
myself
that
i
shall
be
moderate
in
order
to
soothe
the
resentment
of
my
monitor
still
no
news
of
livingstone
and
scant
hope
of
any
stanley
critically
examines
aden

its
unfortified
condition

of

be
to
be
dread
for
their
propensity
to
gossip

it

always
malicious
and
vile

how
i
should
like
to
discover
my
island
and
be
free
of
them
apropos
of
this
it
reminds
me
of
my
journey
to

handsome
young
fellow
perhaps
a
year
or
so
young
than
myself
be
fellow
passenger
in
the
same
coup
they
be
inexperienced
and
shy
i
be
neither
the
one
nor
with
the
pride
of
age
be
i
the
other
i
have
provide
myself
with
a
basket
of
orange
and
a
capacious
cooler
they
have
not
and
when
we
come
abreast
of
the
dazzle
sand
and
to
the
warm
smother
mirage
and
the
fine
sand
come
fly
sting
hot
against
the
face
they
be
oblige
to
unbutton
and
mop
their
face
and
they
look
exceedingly
uncomfortable
then
it
be
that
i
conquer
my
reserve
and
spoke
and
offer
orange
water
sandwich
etc
their
shyness
vanished
they
ate
and
laugh
and
enjoy
themselves
and
i
with
them
the
pipe
and
cigar
come
next
and
be
entertainer
as
it
be
i
do
my
best
for
the
sake
of
good
fellowship
and
i
talk
of
goshen
pithom
and
ram
es
moses
well
and
what
not
we
come
at
last
to
suez
and
be
know
at
the
hotel
i
be
at
once
serve
with
a
room
while
i
be
wash
i
heard
voice
i
look
up
my

an
eight
foot
partition
in
the
next

my
young
friend
of
the
journey
and
they
be
speak
of
me
old
be
the
say
that
listener
hear
no
good
of
themselves
but
have
i
be
a
leper
or
a
pariah
i
could
not
have
be
more
foully
and
slanderously
abuse
this
be
the
third
time
within
fourteen
month
that
i
have
know
englishman
who
after

polite
to
my

slander
me
behind
my
back
yes
this
soulless
gossip
be
to
be
dread
i
have
learn
that
if
they
entertain
me
with
gossip
about
someone
else
they
be
likely
enough
to
convey
to
somebody
else
similar
tale
about
me
a
city
of
egypt
mention
in
ezodus
i
zi
along
with
rameses
in
the
enforce
leisure
of
a
mediterranean
trip
come
a
piece
of
self
observation
february
th
at
sea
under
a
divine
heaven
there
be
a
period
which
mark
the
transition
from
boy
to
man
when
the
boy
discard
his
error
and
his
awkwardness
and
put
on
the
man
mask
and
adopts
his
way
the
duration
of
the
period
depends
upon
circumstance
and
not
upon
any
define
time
with
me
it
last
some
month
and
thoug
h
i
feel
in
idea
more
manly
than
when
i
left
the
state
i
be
often
remind
that
i
be
still
a
boy
in
many
thing
in
impulse
i
be
boy
like
but
in
reflection
a
man
and
then
i
condemn
the
boy
like
action
and
make
a
new
resolve
how
many
of
these
resolution
will
be
require
before
they
be
capable
of
restrain
not
only
the
impulse
but
the
desire
when
every
action
will
be
the
outcome
of
deliberation
i
be
still
a
boy
when
i
obey
my
first
thought
the
man
take
that
thought
and
view
it
from
many
side
before
action
i
have
not
come
to
that
yet
but
after
many
a
struggle
i
hope
to
succeed
day
should
speak
and
a
multitude
of
year
should
teach
wisdom
it
be
well
for
me
that
i
be
not
so
rich
as
the
young
man
i
met
at
cairo
who
have
money
enough
to
indulge
every
caprice
i
thank
heaven
for
it
for
if
he
be
half
as
hot
blood
and
impulsive
as
i
be
surely
his
life
will
be
short
but
necessity
have
ordain
that
my
strength
and
youth
should
be
direct
by
others
and
in
a
different
sphere
and
the
more
task
i
receive
the
happier
be
my
life
i
want
work
dose
absorb
and
congenial
work
only
so
that
there
will
be
no
time
for
regret
and
vain
desire
and
morbid
thought
in
the
interval
book
come
handy
i
have
picked
up
helvetius
and
zimmerman
in
alexandria
and
though
there
be
much
wisdom
in
them

have
ever
met
many
side
in
his
sensitiveness
to
the
attraction
and
charm
of
life
there
be
some
aspect
against
which
he
be
proof
at
odessa
he
fell
in
with
highly
congenial
english
society

at
the
close
of
his
visit
he
touch
on
one
aspect
that
repel
and
one
that
attract
him

a

sight
to

the
first
i
have
ever
see
and
i
thank
my
star
that
it
be
not
my
fate
to
see
many
more
such
the
mad
jollity
and
abandon
wherein
both
sex
seem
agree
to
think
of
nothing
but
their
youth
and
opportunity
positively
abash
me
to
decline

drawn
within
the
whirl
of
dissipation

to
discountenance
fair
gauzy
nymph
who
insidiously
tempt
one
to
relax
austere
virtue
be
not
easy
but
the
shame
of
it
more
than
any
morality
prevent
me
from
avail
myself
of
the
licence
at
the
cathedral
i
heard
the
most
glorious
vocal
music
it
have
ever
be
my
lot
to
hear
there
be
one
voice
a
priest
that
rang
like
a
clarion
through
the
building
so
flawless
in
its
rich
tone
that
every
heart
i
should
fancy
be
fill
with
admiration
and
when
the
choir
join
in
the
anthem
and
fill
the
entire
concave
with
their
burst
of
harmony
and
the
organ
roll
its
stream
of
tremulous
sound
in
unison
i
become
weak
as
a
child
with
pure
rapture
and
unstrung
nerve
that
half
hour
in
the
cathedral
be
unforgettable
whether
it
be
due
to
the
air
of
odessa
the
perfect
health
i
enjoy
the
warm
hospitality
i
receive
or
what
i
be
inclined
to
think
that
for
once
i
have
know
a
brief
period
of
ideal
pleasure
unmarred
by
a
single
hour
of
unhappiness

both
in

in
his

something
of
the

through
my
complete

i
have
lose
by

with
a

herald
and
other
american
newspaper
strange
connection
but
yet
strangest
of
all
be
the
change
wrought
in
me
by
the
reading
of
the
bible
and
these
newspaper
in
melancholy
africa
my
sickness
be
frequent
and
during
my
first
attack
of
african
fever
i
take
up
the
bible
to
while
away
the
tedious
feverish
hour
in
bed
though
incapacitate
from
the
march
my
temperature
be
constantly
at
fahr
it
do
not
prevent
me
from
reading
when
not
light
head
i
read
job
and
then
the
psalm
and
when
i
recover
and
be
once
more
in
march
state
i
occupy
my
mind
in
camp
in
glance
at
the
newspaper
intelligence
and
then
somehow
or
another
my
view
towards
newspaper
be
entirely
recast
not
as
regard
my
own
profession
which
i
still
esteem
very
highly
perhaps
too
highly
but
as
to
the
use
and
abuse
of
newspaper
solitude
taught
me
many
thing
and
show
newspaper
in
quite
a
new
light
there
be
several
subject
treat
in
a
manner
that
wild
nature
seem
to
scorn
it
appear
to
me
that
the
reading
of
anything
in
the
newspaper
except
that
for
which
they
be
intend
namely
news
be
a
waste
of
time
and
deteriorative
of
native
force
and
worth
and
personality
the
bible
however
with
its
noble
and
simple
langus
e
i
continued
to
read
with
a
high
and
truer
understand
than
i
have
ever
before
conceive
its
powerful
verse
have
a
different
meaning
a
more
penetrative
influence
in
the
silence
of
the
wild
i
come
to
feel
a
strange
glow
while
absorbed
in
its
pagesf
and
a
charm
peculiarly
appropriate
to
the
deep
melancholy
of
african
scenery
when
i
laid
down
the
book
the
mind
conmienced
to
feed
upon
what
memory
suggest
then
rise
the
ghost
of
bygone
yearning
haunt
every
cranny
of
the
brain
with
number
of
baffle
hope
and
unfulfilled
aspiration
here
be
i
only
a
poor
journalist
with
no
friend
and
yet
possess
by
a
feel
of
power
to
achieve
how
could
it
ever
be

verse
of
scripture

iteratingly
through
my

to
my
own

work
upon
itself
and
nothing
be
so
soothe
and
sustain
as
when
i
remember
the
long
neglect
comfort
and
support
of
lonely
childhood
and
boyhood
i
flung
myself
on
my
knee
and
pour
out
my
soul
utterly
in
secret
prayer
to
him
from
whom
i
have
be
so
long
estrange
to
him
who
have
lead
me
here
mysteriously
into
africa
there
to
reveal
himself
and
his
will
i
become
then
inspire
with
fresh
desire
to
serve
him
to
the
utmost
that
same
desire
which
in
early
day
in
new
orleans
fill
me
each
morning
and
sent
me
joyfully
skip
to
my
work
as
see
in
my
loneliness
there
be
this
difiference
between
the
bible
and
the
newspaper
the
one
remind
me
that
apart
from
god
my
life
be
but
a
bubble
of
air
and
it
bade
me
remember
my
creator
the
other
foster
arrogance
and
worldliness
when
that
vast
upheaved
sky
and
mighty
circumference
of
tree
clad
earth
or
sere
downland
marked
so
emphatically
my
personal
littleness
i
felt
often
so
subdue
that
my
black
follower
might
have
discern
have
they
be
capable
of
reflection
that
africa
be
change
me
it
may
be
take
for
grant
that
some
of
the
newspaper
issue
which
i
take
up
one
after
another
when
examine
under
this
new
light
be
uncommonly
poor
specimen
of
journalism
though
all
contain
some
fact
appertain
to
the
progress
of
the
world
affair
in
which
every
intelligent
man
ought
to
be
concerned
these
be
so
few
and
meagre
that
they
be
overwhelmed
by
the
vast
space
devote
to
stupid
personality
which
be
either
offensively
flatter
or
carpingly
derogatory
and
there
come
column
of
crime
record
and
mere
gutter
matter
it
be
during
these
day
i
learn
that
as
teeth
be
give
to
chew
our
bread
and
taste
to
direct
our
sense
of
its
quality
so
knowledge
and
experience
be
capable
of
direct
the
judgement
and
from
that
period
to
this
i
have
never
allow
another
to
govern
my
decision
upon
the
character
of
any
person
or
to
pervert
my
own
idea
as
to
the
right
and
wrong
of
a
matter
i
find
if
one
wish
to
be
other
than
a
mere
number
he
must
learn
to
exercise
his
own
discretion
i
have
practise
these
rule
ever
since
and
i
remember
my
delight
when
i
first
found
that
this
method
have
so
train
and
expand
my
judgement
that
my
view
upon
thing
affect
other
people
or
affair
in
which
i
have
no
personal
concern
be
in
harmony
with
those
express
by
the
best
lead
journal
a
multitude
of
record
of
african
travel
have
be
read
by
me
during
twenty
four
year
but
i
do
not
remember
to
have
come
across
anything
which
would
reveal
the
inward
transition
in
the
traveller
own
feeling
from
those
which
move
him
among
his
own
kindred
to
those
he
feel
when
he
discovers
himself
to
be
a
solitary
white
man
in
the
new
world
of
savage
africa
and
all
the
pageantry
of
civilisation
its
blessing
its
protection
its
politics
its
energy
and
power
all
have
become
a
mere
memory
i
be
but
a
few
day
in
the
wilderness
on
the
other
side
of
the
kingani
river
when
it
dawn
upon
me
with
a
most
sober
effect
the
sable
native
regard
me
with
as
much
curiosity
as
i
should
have
r
arded
a
stranger
from
mar
he
saw
that
i
be
outwardly
human
but
his
desire
to
know
whether
my
faculty
and
usage
be
human
as
well
be
very
evident
and
until
it
be
gratify
by
the
put
of
my
hand
into
his
and
speak
to
him
his
doubt
be
manifest
my
mission
to
find
livingstone
be
very
simple
and
be
a
clear
and
definite
aim
all
i
have
to
do
be
to
free
my
mind
from
all
else
and
relieve
it
of
every
earthly
desire
but
the
find
of
the
man
whom
i
be
sent
to
seek
to
think
of
self
friend
banking
account
life
insurance
or
any
worldly
interest
but
the
one
sole
purpose
of
reach
the
spot
where
livingstone
might
happen
to
rest
could
only
tend
to
weaken
resolution
intense
application
to
my
task
assist
me
to
forget
all
i
have
left
behind
and
all
that
might
lie
ahead
in
the
future
in
some
way
it
produce
a
delightful
tranquillity
which
be
foreign
to
me
while
in
europe
to
be
indifferent
to
the
obituary
the
paper
may
publish
to
morrow
that
never
even
a
thought
should
glemce
across
the
mind
of
law
court
jail
tombstone
not
to

what
may
disturb
a

of
the

or
the
nerve
excite
about

flood
war
and
other
national
evil
be
a
felicity
few
educate
men
in
britain
know
and
it
compensate
me
in
a
great
measure
for
the
distress
from
heat
meagreness
of
diet
malaria
and
other
ill
to
which
i
become

soon
after
enter

every
day
add
something
to
my
experience
i
saw
that
excite
adventure
could
not
happen
so
often
as
i
have
anticipate
that
the
fever
in
africa
be
less
frequent
than
in
some
part
of
the
mississippi
valley
that

not

quite
as
many
bright
picture
to
be
met
with
as
there
be
dark
trouble
taught
patience
and
with
the
exercise
of
patience
come
great
self
control
and
experience
my
idea
respect
my
zanzibari
and
unyamwezi
follower
be
modify
after
a
few
week
observation
and
trial
of
them
certain
vice
and
folly
which
clung
to
their
uneducated
nature
be
the
source
of
great
trouble
though
there
be
brave
virtue
in
most
of
them
which
atone
for
much
that
appear
incorrigible
wellington
be
report
to
have
say
that
he
never
knew
a
good
temper
man
in
india
and
sydney
smith
thought
that
sweetness
of
temper
be
impossible
in
a
very
cold
or
a
very
hot
climate
witih
such
authority
it
be
somewhat
bold
perhaps
to
disagree
but
after
experience
of
livingstone
pocock
swinburne
surgeon
parke
and
other
white
men
one
must
not
take
these
remark
too
literally
as
for
my
black
follower
no
quality
be
so
conspicuous
and
unvarying
as
good
temper
and
i
think
that
since
i
have
more
occasion
to
praise
my
black
follower
than
blame
them
even
i
must
surely
take
credit
for
be
more
often
good
temper
than
bad
and
besides
i
felt
great
compassion
for
them
how
often
the
verse
in
the
psalm
recur
to
me
like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
own
child
it
be
on
my
first
expedition
that
i
felt
i
be
ripen
hitherto
my
faculty
have
be
too
busy
in
receive
impression
but
like
the
young
com
which
greedily
absorbs
the
rain
and
cool
dew
and
on
approach
maturity
begin
to
yellow
under
summer
sun
so
i
begin
to
feel
the
benefit
of
the
myriad
impression
and
i
grow
to
govern
myself
with
more
circumspection
on
the
th

we
begin
to
ascend
the
usagara

in

almost
without

for
nearly
six

we
be

left
as
my

become
thoroughly
disorganize
during
my
flight
with
the
arab
from
the
fatal
campaign
against
mirambo
i
turn
my
attention
to
form
another
which
whether
i
should
continue
my
search
for
the
lose
traveller
or
abandon
it
and
turn
my
face
homeward
would
be
equally
necessary
and
as
during
such
an
unquiet
period
it
would
be
a
task
require
much
time
and
patience
i
meanwhile
consult
my
chart
and
the
best
inform
native
as
to
the
possibility
of
evade
the
hostile
band
of
mirambo
by
take
a
circuitous
route
round
the
disturbed
territory
finally
on
the
th
of
september
set
out
from
the
arab
settlement
at
kwihara
to
resume
the
journey
so
long
interrupt
i
have
be
detain
three
month
at
unyan
yembe
by
an
event
totally
unlooked
for
when
the
expedition
left
the
sea
almost
every
day
of
this
interval
have
witness
trouble
some
trouble
have
attain
the
magnitude
of
public
and
private
calamity
many
arab
friend
have
be
massacre
many
of
my
own
people
either
have
be
slain
in
battle
or
have
perish
from
disease
over
forty
have
desert
one
of
my
white
companion
be
dead
the
other
have
become
a
mere
burden
all
the
transport
animal
but
two
have
die
day
of
illness
from
fever
have
alternate
with
day
of
apparent
good
health
my
joy
have
be
few
indeed
but
my
misery
many
yet
this
day
the
third
expedition
that
i
have
organise
through
great
good
fortune
numbered
nearly
sixty
picked
men
almost
all
of
whom
be
well
arm
and
load
with
every
necessary
that
be
portable
bound
to
demonstrate
if
somewhere
in
the
wild
western
land
the
lose
traveller
live
or
be
dead
the
conclusion
i
have
arrive
at
be
that
though
mirambo
and
his
horde
effectually
close
the
usual
road
to
lake
tanganyika
a
flank
march
might
be
make
sufficiently
distant
from
the
disturbed
territory
and
sufficiently
long
to
enable
me
to
strike
west
and
make
another
attempt
to
reach
the
arab
colony
on
lake
tanganyika
i
calculate
that
from
two
hundred
to
three
hundred
mile
extra
march
would
enable
me
to
reach
ujiji
safely
agreeably
to
this
determination
for
twenty
two
day
we
travel
in
a
south
westerly
direction
during
which
i
estimate
we
have
perform
a
journey
of
two
hundred
and
forty
mile
at
a
place
call
mpokwa
mirambo
capital
lie
due
north
ten
day
distant
i
turn
westward
and
after
thirty
five
mile
gradually
turn
a
little
to
the
westward
of
north
at
the
th
mile
of
this
northerly
journey
we
come
to
the
ferry
of
the
malagarazi
river
mirambo
be
at
that
point
eight
day
march
direct
east
of
us
from
whence
i
take
a
north
westerly
course
straight
for
the
port
of
the
arab
colony
on
the
great
lake
with
the
exception
of
a
mutiny
among
my
own
people
which
be
soon
forcibly
crush
and
considerable
suffer
from
famine
i
have
met
with
no
adventure
which
detain
me
or
interrupt
my
rapid
advance
on
the
lake
at
the
river
just
mention
however
a
rumour
reach
me
by
a
native
caravan
of
a
white
man
have
reach
ujiji
from
manyuema
a
country
situate
a
few
hundred
mile
west
of
the
lake
which
startle
us
all
greatly
the
caravan
do
not
stay
long
the
ferriage
of
the
river
be
always
excite
the
people
be
native
of
west
tanganyika
the
evidence
such
as
it
be
brief
and
give
in
a
language
few
of
my
people
could
understand
be
conclusive
that
the
stranger
be
elderly
grey
beard
white
and
that
he
be
a
man
wear
clothes
somewhat
of
the
pattern
of
those
i
wore
that
he
have
be
at
ujiji
before
but
have
be
year
absent
in
the
western
country
and
that
he
have
only
arrive
either
the
same
day
they
have
left
ujiji
with
their
caravan
or
the
day
before
to
my
mind
startle
as
it
be
to
me
it
appear
that
he
could
be
no
other
than
livingstone
true
sir
samuel
baker
be
know
to
be
in
central
africa
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
nile
lake
but
he
be
not
grey
beard
a
traveller
might
have
arrive
from
the
west
coast
he
might
be
a
portuguese
a
german
or
a
frenchman
but
then
none
of
these
have
ever
be
heard
of
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ujiji
therefore
as
fast
as
doubt
arose
as
to
his
personality
argument
be
as
quickly
found
to
dissipate
them
quicken
by
the
hope
that
be
inspire
in
my
mind
by
this
vague
rumour
i
cross
the
malagarazi
river
and
soon
after
enter
tiie
country
of
the
factious
and
warlike
wahha
a
series
of
misfortune
commenced
at
the
first
village
we
come
to
in
uhha
i
be
summon
to
halt
and
to
pay
such
a
tribute
as
would
have
beggar
me
have
i
yield
to
reduce
it
however
be
a
severe
task
and
strain
on
my
patience
i
have
receive
no
previous
warn
that
i
should
be
subject
to
such
extortionate
demand
which
make
the
matter
bad
the
inevitable
can
always
be
endure
if
due
notice
be
give
but
the
suddenness
of
a
mishap
or
an
evil
rous
the
combative
instinct
in
man
before
pay
or
even
submit
to
the
thought
of
payment
my
power
of
resistance
be
carefully
weigh
but
i
become
inclined
to
moderation
upon
be
assure
by
all
concerned
that
this
would
be
the
only
instance
of
what
must
be
endure
unless
we
chose
to
fight
after
long
hour
of
haggle
over
the
amount
i
paid
my
forfeit
and
be
permit
to
proceed
the
next
day
i
be
again
halt
and
summoaed
to
pay
the
present
demand
be
for
two
bale
of
cloth
this
lead
to
half
form
resolution
to
resist
to
the
death
then
anxious
conjecture
as
to
what
would
be
the
end
of
this
rapacity
the
manner
of
the
wahha
be
confident
and
supercilious
this
could
only
arise
from
the
knowledge
that
whether
their
demand
be
agreeable
or
not
to
the
white
man
the
refusal
to
pay
could
but
result
in
gain
to
them
after
hour
of
attempt
to
reduce
the
sum
total
i
submit
to
pay
one
bale
and
a
quarter
again
i
be
assure
this
would
be
the
last
the
next
day
i
rise
at
dawn
to
resume
the
march
but
four
hour
later
we
be
halt
again
and
forfeit
another
half
bale
notwithstanding
the
most
protract
and
patient
hag
g
g
on
my
part
and
for
the
third
time
i
be
assure
we
be
safe
from
far
demand
the
native
and
my
own
people
combine
to
comfort
me
with
this
assurance
i
heard
however
shortly
after
that
uhha
extend
for
two
long
march
yet
far
west
know
this
i
decline
to
believe
them
and
begin
to
form
plan
to
escape
from
uhha
i
purchase
four
day
ration
as
a
provision
for
the
wilderness
and
at
midnight
i
rouse
the
caravan
have
noiselessly
packed
the
good
the
people
silently
stole
away
from
the
sleep
village
in
small
group
and
the
guide
be
direct
as
soon
as
we
should
be
a
little
distance
off
to
abandon
the
road
and
march
to
the
southward
over
the
grassy
plain
after
eighteen
hour
march
through
an
unpeopled
wilderness
we
be
safe
beyond
uhha
and
the
power
of
any
chief
to
exact
tribute
or
to
lay
down
the
arbitrary
law
fight
or
pay
a
small
stream
now
cross
be
the
boundary
line
between
hateful
uhha
and
peaceful
ukaranga
that
even
we
slept
at
a
chief
village
in
ukaranga
with
only
one
more
march
of
six
hour
it
be
say
intervene
between
us
and
the
arab
settlement
of
ujiji
in
which
native
rumour
locate
an
old
grey
beard
white
man
who
have
but
newly
arrive
from
a
distant
western
country
it
be
now
two
hundred
and
thirty
five
day
since
i
have
left
the
indian
ocean
and
fifty
day
since
i
have
depart
from
unyanyembe
at
cock
crow
of
the
eventful
day
the
day
that
be
to
end
all
doubt
we
strengthen
ourselves
with
a
substantial
taeaif
friday
november
lo
and
as
the
sun
rise
in
the
east
we
turn
our
back
to
it
and
the
caravan
be
soon
in
full
swing
on
the
march
we
be
in
a
hilly
country
thickly
wooded
tower
tree
nod
their
head
far
above
tall
bush
fill
darkly
the
shade
the
road
wind
like
a
serpeift
narrow
and
sinuous
the
hollow
all
musical
with
the
murmur
of
living
water
and
their
sibilant
echo
the
air
cool
and
fragrant
with
the
smell
of
strange
flower
and
sweet
gum
then
my
mind
lighten
with
plea
ant
presentiment
and
conscience
complaisantly
approve
what
i
have
do
hitherto
you
can
imagine
the
vigour
of
our
pace
in
that
cool
and
charm
twilight
of
the
forest
shade
about
eight
o
clock
we
be
climb
the
side
of
a
steep
and
wooded
hill
and
we
presently
stood
on
the
very
crest
of
it
and
on
the
furthest
adge
look
out
into
a
realm
of
light
wherein
i
saw
as
in
a
paint
picture
a
vast
lake
in
the
distance
below
with
its
face
luminous
as
a
mirror
set
in
a
frame
of
dimly
blue
mountain
on
the
far
side
they
seem
to
be
of
appal
height
on
the
hither
side
they
rise
from
low
hill
line
the
shore
in
advance
unes
separate
by
valley
until
they
terminate
at
the
base
of
that
tall
mountain
brow
whereon
i
stood
look
down
from
my
proud
height
with
glad
eye
and
exultant
feeling
upon
the
whole
prospect
on
our
admire
people
who
press
eagerly
forward
to
gaze
upon
the
scene
contentment
diffuse
itself
immediately
inspire
a
boisterous
good
humour
for
it
meant
a
crown
rest
from
their
daily
round
of
mile
and
a
holiday
from
the
bearing
of
burden
certainly
an
agreeable
change
from
the
early
reveille
and
hard
fare
of
the
road
with
thought
still
gladder
if
possible
than
ever
the
caravan
be
urge
down
the
descent
the
lake
grow
large
into
view
and
smile
a
broad
welcome
to
us
until
we
lose
sight
of
it
in
the
valley
below
for
hour
i
strode
nervously
on
tear
through
the
cane
brake
of
the
valley
brushing
past
the
bush
on
the
hill
slope
and
crest
fling
gay
remark
to
the
wonder
villager
who
look
on
the
almost
aying
column
in
mute
surprise
until
near
noon
when
have
cross
the
last
valley
and
climbed
up
to
the
summit
of
the
last
hill
lo
lake
tanganyika
be
distant
from
us
but
half
a
mile
before
such
a
scene
i
must
halt
once
more
to
me
a
lover
of
the
sea
its
roll
wave
its
surge
and
its
moan
the
grand
lake
recall
my
long
forgotten
love
i
look
enrapture
upon
the
magnificent
expanse
of
fresh
water
and
the
white
tipped
billow
of
the
inland
sea
i
see
the
sun
and
the
clear
white
sky
reflect
a
million
million
time
upon
the
dance
wave
i
hear
the
sound
surge
on
the
pebbled
shore
i
see
its
crispy
edge
curl
over
and
creep
up
the
land
to
return
again
to
the
watery
hollow
below
i
see
canoe
far
away
from
the
shore
lazily
rock
on
the
undulate
face
of
the
lake
and
at
once
the
sight
appeal
to
the
memory
of
my
men
who
have
long
ago
handle
the
net
and
the
paddle
hard
by
the
lake
shore
embower
in
palm
on
this
hot
noon
the
village
of
ujiji
brood
drowsily
no
living
thing
can
be
see
move
to
break
the
stilly
aspect
of
the
outer
line
of
the
town
and
its
deep
shade
the
green
swarded
hill
on
which
i
stood
descend
in
a
gentle
slope
to
the
town
the
path
be
see
of
an
ochreous
brown
curve
down
the
face
of
the
hill
until
it
enter
under
the
tree
into
the
town
i
rest
awhile
breathless
from
my
exertion
and
as
the
straggler
be
many
i
halt
to
re
unite
and
re
form
for
an
impose
entry
meantime
my
people
improve
their
personal
appearance
they
clothed
themselves
in
dean
dress
and
snowy
cloth
be
fold
roimd
their
head
when
the
laggard
have
all
be
gather
the
gun

to
rouse
up
the
sleep
town
it
be
an
immemorial
custom
for
a
caravan
creep
not
up
into
a
friendly
town
like
a
thief
our
brave
knew
the
custom
well
they
therefore
volleyed
and
thunder
their
salute
as
they
go
march
down
the
hill
slowly
and
with
much
self
contain
dignity
presently
there
be
a
tumultuous
stir
visible
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
town
group
of
men
in
white
dress
with
arm
in
their
hand
burst
from
the
shade
and
seem
to
hesitate
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
they
then
come
rush
up
to
meet
us
pursue
by
hundred
of
people
who
shout
joyfully
while
yet
afar

noisy
welcome

foremost
who
come
on
bound
up
cry
out
why
we
take
you
for
mirambo
and
his
bandit
when
we
heard
the
boom
of
the
gun

be
an
age
since
a
caravan
have
come
to

with

and
bow
their
salute
hundred
of
them
jostled
and
trod
on
one
another
heel
as
they
each
strove
to
catch
a
look
at
the
master
of
the
caravan
and
i
be
about

son
of
us
and
maintain
an
inharmonious
orchestral
music
of
drum
and
horn
i
be
indebted
for
this
loud
ovation
to
the
cheerful
relief
the
people
felt
that
we
be
not
mirambo
bandit
and
to
their
joy
at
the
happy
rupture
of
the
long
silence
that
have
perforce
exist
between
the
two
trading
colony
of
unyanyembe
and
ujiji
and
because
we
brought
news
which
concerned
every
householder
and
freeman
of
this
lake
port
after
a
few
minute
we
come
to
a
halt
the
guide
in
the
van
have
reach
the
market
place
which
be
the
central
pcnnt
of
interest
for
there
the
great
arab
chief
and
respectability
of
ujiji
have
gather
in
a
group
to
await
event
thither
also
they
have
brought
with
them
the
venerable
european
traveller
who
be
at
that
time
rest
among
them
the
caravan
press
up
to
them
divide
itself
into
two
line
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
as
it
do
so
disclose
to
me
the
prominent
figure
of
an
elderly
white
man
clad
in
a
red
flannel
blouse
grey
trouser
and
a
blue
cloth
gold
band
cap
up
to
this
moment
my
mind
have
verged
upon
non
belief
in
his
existence
and
now
a
nag
doubt
intrude
itself
into
my
mind
that
this
white
man
could
not
be
the
object
of
my
quest
or
if
he
be
he
would
somehow
contrive
to
disappear
before
my
eye
would
be
satisfied
with
a
view
of
him
consequently
though
the
expedition
be
oiganized
for
this
supreme
moment
and
every
movement
of
it
have
be
confidently
order
with
the
view
of
discover
him
yet
when
the
moment
of
discovery
come
and
the
man
himself
stood
reveal
before
me
this
constantly
recur
doubt
contribute
not
a
little
to
make
me
unprepared
for
it
it
may
not
be
livingstone
after
all
doubt
suggest
if
this
be
he
what
shall
i
say
to
him
my
imagination
have
not
take
this
question
into
consideration
before
all
around
me
be
the
inunense
crowd
hush
and
expectant
and
wonder
how
the
scene
would
develop
itself
under
all
these
circumstance
i
could
do
no
more
than
exercise
some
restraint
and
reserve
so
i
walk
up
to
him
and
doff
my
helmet
bow
and
say
in
an
inquire
tone
dr
livingstone
i
presume
smile
cordially
he
lift
his
cap
and
answer
briefly
yes
this
end
all
scepticism
on
my
part
my
face
betrayed
the
earnestness
of
my
satisfaction
as
i
extend
my
hand
and
add

r

of

take
place
between

such
as

forest
plum
and
wild
fruit
jam
besides
sweet

then
a
silver

full
of

and
beautiful
china

to

from

this
already
magnificent

mohammed
bin

great
tray
load
with
cake
curry
hash
and
stew
and
three
separate
hillock
of
white
rice
and
we
look
at
one
another
with
a
smile
of
wonder
at
this
ujiji

we
drew
near
to
it
and
the
doctor
uttered
the
grace
for
what
we
be
go
to
receive
make
us
o
lord
sincerely
thankful
i
need
not
linger
over
a
description
of
livingstone
all
this
may
be
found
in
book
in
mine
among
the
number
but
i
will
note
some
other
discovery
relate
to
him
which
i
make
which
may
not
be
found
in
book
at
various
time
i
have
remark
that
the
question
most
frequently
give
to
me
have
be
why
do
not
livingstone
return
of
his
own
accord
when
he
found
his
energy
wan
age
creep
on
him
and
fetter
him
in
its
strong
bond
his
mean
so
reduce
that
he
be
unable
to
accomplish
anything
even
if
youth
could
have
be
restore
to
him
briefly
i
will
answer
that
his
return
to
home
and
kindred
be
prevent
by
an
over
scrupulous
fidelity
to
a
promise
that
he
have
make
to
his
friend
sir
r
murchison
that
he
would
set
the
matter
of
that
watershed
north
of
the
tanganyika
at
rest
but
strive
as
he
might
misfortune
dog
him
dauntlessly
he
urge
his
step
forward
over
the
high
plateau
between
nyasa
and
tanganyika
but
steadily
evil
in
various
disguise
haunt
him
first
his
transport

die
his
indian
escort
malinger
and
halt
faint
hearted
on
the
road
until
they
be
dismiss
then
his
johanna
escort
played
the
same
trick
and
desert
him
after
which
his
porter
under
various
pretence
abscond
the
native
take
advantage
of
his
weakness
and
tyrannise
over
him
at
every
opportunity
a
canoe

on

the

of
his
limb
dysentery
robbed
him
of
the
vital
constituent
of
his
body
still
after
a
time
he
rise
from
his
sick
bed
and
press
on
unfalteringly
the
watershed
when
he
reach
it
grow
to
be
a
tougher
problem
than
he
have
conceive
it
to
be
on
the
northern
slope
a
countless
multitude
of
stream
pour
northward
into
an
enormously
wide

they
form
a

of
such
volume

so
remote
from
all

yet
so
large
heedless
of
his

his
fidelity
to
his

him
on
with
the
zeal
of
an

at
ujiji
there
be
nothing
there
for
him

a

at
an
extortionate

a

a

livingstone
and
myseljf
met
as
already
described
our
meeting
take
place
on
the
loth
november
it
found
him
reduce
to
the
low
ebb
in
fortune
by
his
endless
quest
of
the
solution
to
the
problem
of
that
mighty
river
lualaba
which
at
a
distance
of
three
hundred
mile
from
lake
tanganyika
flow
parallel
with
the
lake
northward
in
body
he
be
as
he
himself
express
it
a
mere
ruckle
of
bone
the
effect
of
the
meeting
be
a
rapid
restoration
to
health
he
be
also
place
above
want
for
he
have
now
store
in
abundance
sufficient
to
have
kept
him
in
comfort
in
ujiji
for
year
or
to
equip
an
expedition
capable
of
solve
within
a
few
month
even
that
tough
problem
of
the
lualaba
there
be
only
one
thing
want
to
complete
the
old
man
happiness
that
be
an
obedient
and
tractable
escort
could
i
have
furnish
this
to
him
there
and
then
no
doubt
livingstone
would
have
be
alive
to
day
because
after
a
few
day
rest
at
ujiji
this
be
write
in
d
s
we
should
have
part
he
to
return
to
the
lualaba
and
trace
the
river
perhaps
down
to
the
sea
or
until
he
found
sufficient
proof
that
it
be
the
congo
which
would
be
about
seven
hundred
mile
north
west
of
nyangwe
i
journeying
to
the
east
coast
as
my
people
however
have
only
be
engage
for
two
year
no
bribe
would
have
be
sufficient
to
have
make
them
tractable
for
a
great
period
but
inasmuch
as
livingstone
would
not
relinquish
his
unfinished
task
and
no
men
of
the
kind
he
need
be
procurable
at
ujiji
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
return
with
me
to
unyanyembe
and
rest
there
until
i
could
provide
him
with
the
force
he
need
to
this
the
last
of
many
proposition
make
to
him
he
agree
after
explore
together
the
north
end
of
lake
tanganyika
and
disprove
the
theory
that
the
lake
have
any
connection
with
the
albert
nyanza
we
set
out
from
ujiji
on
the
th
december
and
arrive
at
unyanyembe
on
the
i
th
february
january
have
some
modest
sport
among
some
zebra
and
secure
a
quantity
of
meat
which
will
be
useful
livingstone
this
afternoon
get
upon
his
favourite
topic
the
zambesi
mission
the
portuguese
and
arab
slave
trade
and
these
subject
invariably
bring
him
to
relate
incident
about
what
he
have
witness
of
african
nature
and
aptitude
i
conclude
from
the
importance
he
attache
to
these
that
he
be
more
interested
in
ethnology
than
in
topographical
geography
though
the
nile
problem
and
the
central
line
of
drainage
be
frequently
on
his
lip
they
be
second
to
the
humanity
observe
on
his
wandering
which
whether
at
the
morning
coffee
tiffin
or
dinner
occupy
him
throughout
the
meal
the
manyuema
woman
must
have
attract
him
by
their
beauty
from
which
i
gather
that
they
must
be
superior
to
the
average
female
native
he
speaks
of
their
large
eye
their
intelligent
look
and
pretty
expressive
arch
way
then
he
refers
to
the
custom
at
cazembe
court
and
the
kindness
receive
from
the
woman
there
in
a
little
while
i
be
listen
to
the
atrocity
of
taga
moyo
the
half
caste
arab
who
surround
a
manyuema
market
and
with
his
long
shirt

fire
most
murderous
volley
on
the

as
they
be
innocently
chaffer
about
their
ware
then
there
be
real
passion
in
his
ian
guage
and
i
fancj
from
the
angry
glitter
in
his
eye
that
be
it
in
his
power
tagamoyo
and
his
gang
should
have
a
quick
taste
of
the
terror
he
have
inspire
among
the
simple
people
of
manyuema
he
be
truly
pathetic
when
he
describes
the
poor
enchain
slave
and
the
unhappy
being
whose
neck
he
have
see
gall
by
the
tree
fork
lumber
and
totter
along
the
path
watch
by
the
steady
cruel
eye
of
their
driver
the
topic
change
so
abruptly
that
i
find
it
almost
impossible
to
remember
a
tithe
of
them
and
they
refer
to
thing
about
which
i
know
so
little
that
it
will
be
hard
to
miake
a
summary
of
what
i
be
told
at
each
meal
one
cannot
always
have
his
note
book
handy
for
we
drop
upon
a
subject
so
suddenly
and
often
in
my
interest
i
forget
what
i
ought
to
do
i
must
trust
largely
to
the
fact
that
i
be
become
steep
in
livingstonian
idea
upon
everything
that
be
african
from
pity
for
the
big
stomach
picaninny
cling
to
the
waist
string
of
its
mother
to
the
missionary
bishop
and
the
great
explorer
burton
speke
and
baker
he
be
a
strong
man
in
every
way
with
an
individual
tenacity
of
character
his
memory
be
retentive
how
he
can
remember
whittier
poem
couplet
out
of
which
i
hear
frequently
as
well
as
from
longfellow
i
cannot
make
out
i
do
not
think
he
have
any
of
these
book
with
him
but
he
recites
them
as
though
he
have
read
them
yesterday
march
livingstone
revert
again
to
his
charge
against
the
missionary
on
the
zambesi
and
some
of
his
naval
officer
on
the
expedition
i
have
have
some
intrusive
suspicion
thought
that
he
be
not
of
such
an
angelic
temper
as
i
believe
him
to
be
during
my
first
month
with
him
but
for
the
last
month
i
have
be
drive
them
steadily
from
my
mind
or
perhaps
to
be
fair
he
by
his
conversation
by
his
prayer
his
action
and
a
more
careful
weigh
and
a
wider
knowledge
of
all
the
circumstance
assist
me
to
extinguish
them
livingstone
with
all
his
frankness
do
not
unfold
himself
at
once
and
what
he
leaf
untold
may
be
just
as
vital
to
a
righteous
understand
of
these
dispute
as
what
he
have
say
some
reparation
i
owe
him
for
have
be
on
the
verge
of
prejudice
before
i
even
saw
him
i
expect
and
be
prepared
to
meet
a
crusty
misanthrope

and
i
be
on
my
guard
that
the
first
offence
should
not
come
from
me
but
i
met
a
sweet
opposite
and
by
leap
and
bound
my
admiration
grow
in
consequence
when
however
he
reiterate
his
complaint
against
this
man
and
the
other
i
felt
the
faintest
fear
that
his
strong
nature
be
oppose
to
forgiveness
and
that
he
be
not
so
perfect
as
at
the
first
blush
of
friendship
i
thought
him
i
grow
shy
of
the
recurrent
theme
l
i
should
find
my
fear
confirm
have
i
left
him
at
ujiji
i
should
have
lose
the
chance
of
view
him
on
the
march
and
obtain
that
more
detailed
knowledge
i
have
by
which
i
be
able
to
put
myself
into
his
place
and
feel
something
of
his
feeling
to
understand
the
position
well
it
be
an
ungrateful
task
to
have
to
reproach
the
missionary
for
their
over
zeal
against
the
slave
trader
though
he
quite
share
their
hatred
of
the
trade
and
all
connect
with
it
but
to
be
himself
chain
as
he
be
with
have
be
the
cause
of
their
militant
behaviour
to
be
blame
for
their
neglect
of
their
special
duty
and
for
their
folly
by
the
very
men
whom
he
have
assist
and
advise
be
too
much
but
in
think
that
it
be
rather
a
weakness
to
dwell
on
these
bitter
memory
i
forgot
that
he
be
speak
to
me
who
have
remind
him
of
his
experience
and
who
pester
him
with
question
about
this
year
and
another
upon
this
topic
and
that
and
i
thought
that
it
be
not
fair
to
retaliate
with
inward
accusation
that
he
be
make
too
much
of
these
thing
when
it
be
my
own
fault
then
i
thought
of
his
loneliness
and
that
to
speak
of
african
geography
to
a
man
who
be
himself
in
africa
be
not
only
not
entertain
but
unnecessary
and
that
to
refuse
to
speak
of
personal
event
would
from
the
nature
of
a
man
be
impute
to
him
as
reserve
and
perhaps
something
bad
these
thing
i
revolve
cause
by
observation
on
his
daily
method
of
life
his
pious
habit
in
the
boat
the
tent
and
the
house
at
kwikuru
just
before
the
day
we
get
our
letter
from
europe
i
go
to
the
cook
ulimengo
who
be
act
in
ferajji
place
and
be
half
mad
with
the
huge
dos
of
quinine
i
have
take
and
distressingly
weak
i
sharply
scold
him
for
not
cleaning
his
coffee
pot
and
say
that
i
taste
the
verdigris
in
every
article
of
food
and
i
violently
ask
if
he

meant
to
poison
us
i
show
him
the
kettle
and
the
pot
and
the
loathsome
green
on
the
rim
he
turn
to
me
with
astound
insolence
and
sneeringly
ask
if
i
be
any
well
than
the
big
master
and
say
that
what
be
goodior
him
be
good
for
me
the
little
master
i
clout
him
at
once
not
only
for
his
insolent
question
but
because
i
recognise
a
disposition
to
fight
ulimengo
stood
up
and
laid
hold
of
me
on
free
myself
i
search
for
some
handy
instrument
but
at
this
juncture
livingstone
come
out
of
the
tent
and
cry
out
to
ulimengo
poli
poli
hapo
gently
there
what
be
the
matter
mr
stanley
almost
breathless
between
passion
and
quinine
i
splutter
out
my
explanation
then
lift
his
right
hand
with
the
curve
forefinger
he
say
i
will
settle
this
i
stood
quiet
but
what
with
unsatisfied
rage
and
shameful
weakness
the
tear
roll
down
as
copiously
as
when
a
child
i
heard
him
say
now
ulimengo
you
be
a
big
fool
a
big
thick
head
fellow
i
believe
you

a
very
wicked
man
your
head
be
full
of
lie
idea

me
now
and
open
your
ear
i
be
a
mgeni
guest
and
only
a
mgeni
and
have
nothing

do
with
this
caravan
everything
in
the
camp
be
my
friend
the
food

eat
the
clothes
on
my
back
the
shirt
i
wear
all
be
his
all
the
bale
and
bead
be
his
what
you
put
in
that
belly
of
yours
come
from
him
not
from
me
he
pay
your
wage
the
tent
and
the
bed
clothes
belong
to
him
he
come
only
to
help
me
as
you
would
help
your
brother
or
your
father
i
be
only
the
big
master
because
i
be
old
but
when
we
march
or
stop
must
be
as
like
not
me
try
and
get
all
that
into
that
thick
skull
of
yours
ulimengo
do
not
you
see
that
he
be
very
ill
you
rascal
now
go
and
ask
his
pardon
go
on
and
ulimengo
say
he
be
very
sorry
and
want
to
kiss
my
foot
but
i
would
not
let
him
then
livingstone
take
me
by
the
arm
to
the
tent
say
come
now
you
must
not
mind
him
he
be
only
a
half
savage
and
do
not
know
any
well
he
be
probably
a
banyan
slave
why
should
you
care
what
he
say
they
be
all
alike
unfeeling
and
hard
little
by
little
i
soften
down
and
before
night
i
have
shaken
hand
with
ulimengo
it
be
the
memory
of
several
small
event
which
though
not
worth
recount
singly
muster
in
evidence
and
strike
a
last
impression
you
bad
fellow
you
very
wicked
fellow
you
blockhead
you
fool
of
a
man
be
the
strong
term
he
employ
where
others
would
have
clubbed
or
clout
or
ban
and
blast
his
manner
be
that
of
a
cool
wise
old
man
who
felt
offend
and
look
grave
march
sunday
service
at
a
m
refer
to
his
address
to
his
men
after
the
sunday
service
be
over
he
ask
me
what
conclusion
i
have
come
to
in
r
rd
to
the
african
power
of
receive
the
gospel
well
really
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
not
thought
much
of
it
the
african
appear
to
me
very
dense
and
i
suppose
it
will
take
some
time
before
any
headway
will
be
make
it
be
a
slow
affair
i
think
altogether
you
do
not
seem
to
me
to
go
about
it
in
the
right
way
i
do
not
mean
you
personally
but
missionary
i
cannot
see
how
one
or
two
men
can
hope
to
make
an
impression
on
the
mind
of
so
many
million
when
all
around
them
be
the
whole
world
continue
in
its
own
humdrum
fashion
absorbed
in
its
avocation
and
utterly
regardless
of
the
tiny
village
or
obscure
district
where
the
missionary
preach
the
gospel
how
would
you
go
about
it
he
ask
i
would
certainly
have
more
than
one
or
two
missionary
i
would
have
a
thousand
scatter
not
all
over
the
continent
but
among
some
great
tribe
or
cluster
of
tribe
organise
systematically
one
or
two
for
each
village
so
that
though
the
outskirt
of
the
tribe
or
area
where
the
gospel
be
at
work
might
be
disturbed
somewhat
by
the
evil
example
of
those
outside
all
within
the
area
might
be
safely
and
uninterruptedly
progress
then
with
the
pupil
who
would
be
turn
out
from
each
village
there
would
be
new
force
to
start
elsewhere
outside
the
area
in
a
way
that
be
just
my
opinion
but
someone
must
begin
the
work
christ
be
the
beginner
of
the
christianity
that
be
now
spread
over
a
large
part
of
the
world
then
come
the
twelve
apostle
and
then
the
disciple
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
be
the
beginner
for
attack
central
africa
and
that
others
will
shortly
come
and
after
those
there
will
come
the
thousand
worker
that
youspeak
of
it
be
verydarkand
dreary
but
the
promise
be
commit
thy
way
to
the
lord
trust
in
him
and
he
shall
bring
it
to
pas
i
may
fall
by
the
way
be
unworthy
to
see
the
dawn
i
thought
i
have
see
it
when
the
zambezi
mission
come
out
but
the
darkness
have
settle
ain
darker
than
ever
it
will
come
though
it
must
come
and
i
do
not
despair
of
the
day
one
bit
the
earth
that
be
the
whole
earth
shall
be
fill
with
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
water
cover
the
sea
loneliness
be
a
terrible
thing
especially
when
i
think
of
my
child
i
have
lose
a
great
deal
of
happiness
i
know
by
these
wandering
it
be
as
if
i
have
be
bom
to
exile
but
it
be
god
do
and
he
will
do
what
seemeth
good
in
his
own
eye
but
when
my
child
and
home
be
not
in
my
mind
i
feel
as
though
appoint
to
this
work
and
no
other
i
be
away
from
the
perpetual
hurry
of
civilisation
and
i
think
i
see
far
and
clear
into
what
be
to
come
and
then
i
seem
to
understand
why
i
be
lead
away
here
and
there
and
cross
and
baf
ed
over
and
over
again
to
wear
out
my
year
and
strength
why
be
it
but
to
be
a
witness
of
the
full
horror
of
this
slave
trade
which
in
the
language
of
bum
be
send
these
pitiless
half
caste
like
bloodhound
from
the
slip
with
woe
and
murder
o
er
the
land
my
business
be
to
publish
what
i
see
to
rouse
up
those
who
have
the
power
to
stop
it
once
and
for
all
that
be
the
begin
but
in
the
end
they
will
also
send
proper
teacher
of
the
gospel
some
here
and
some
there
and
what
you
think
ought
to
be
do
will
be
do
in
the
lord
good
time
see
yonder
poor
o

wight
so
abject
mean
and
vile
who
begs
a
brother
of
the
earth
to
give
him
leave
to
toil
i
have
often
quote
those
line
of
bum
to
myself
on
my
travel
in
manyuema
when
i
saw
the
tremble
native
just
on
the
run
when
they
suspect
that
we
be
arab
about
to
take
them
from
their
home
and
compel
them
to
carry
their
steal
ivory
oh
well
there
be
a
good
god
above
who
take
note
of
these
thing
and
will
at
the
proper
moment
see
that
justice
will
be
measure
out
to
these
monster
march
this
be
the
last
day
of
my
stay
with
dear
old
livingstone
the
last
night
we
shall
be
together
be
present
and
i
cannot
evade
the
morrow
i
feel
as
though
i
should
like
to
rebel
against
the
necessity
of
departure
the
minute
beat
fast
and
grow
into
hour
our
door
to
night
be
close
and
we
both
think
our
own
thought
what
his
be
i
know
not
mine
be
sad
my
day
seem
to
have
be
spent
far
too
happily
for
now
that
the
last
day
be
almost
go
i
bitterly
regret
the
approach
of
the
part
hour
i
now
forget
the
successive
fever
and
their
agony
and
the
semi
madness
into
which
they
often
plunge
me
the
regret
i
feel
now
be
great
than
any
pain
i
have
endure
but
i
cannot
resist
the
sure
advance
of
time
which
be
fly
to
night
far
too
fast
what
must
be
must
be
i
have
often
part
with
friend
before
and
remember
how
i
linger
and
wish
to
put
it
off
but
the
inevitable
be
not
to
be
prevent
fate
come
and
at
the
appoint
hour
stood
between
us
to
night
i
feel
the
same
ache
pain
but
in
a
great
degree
and
the
farewell
i
fear
may
be
for
ever
for
ever
and
for
ever
echo
the
reverberation
of
a
woeful
whisper
i
have
receive
the
thanks
that
he
have
repress
all
these
month
in
the
secrecy
of
his
heart
uttered
with
no
mince
phrase
but
pour
out
as
it
be
at
the
last
moment
until
i
be
so
affected
that
i
sobbed
as
one
only
can
in
uncommon
grief
the
hour
of
night
and
the
crisis
and
oh
as
some
dreadful
doubt
suggest
the
eternal
part
his
sudden
outburst
of
gratitude
with
that
kind
of
praise
that
steal
into
one
and
touch
the
softer
part
of
the
ever
veil
nature
all
have
their
influence
and
for
a
time
i
be
as
a
sensitive
child
of
eight
or
so
and
yield
to
such
burst
of
tear
that
only
such
a
scene
as
this
could
have
force
i
think
it
only
need
this
soften
to
secure
me
as
his
obedient
and
devote
servitor
in
the
future
should
there
ever
be
an
occasion
where
i
could
prove

zeal

will
forget
the
number
of
his
appeal
the
constant
recurrence
to
the
dismal
topic
and
the
long
line
of
his
travel
may
be
accepted
as
proof
of
his
heartiness

he

the
first
to
penetrate
to
those
land
in
the

his
be
the

heard
speak
in
the

of
eastern
sunda
of
the
beauty
of
the
christian
religion

he
be
the
first
preacher
who
dare
denounce
the
red
hand
arab
for
his
wickedly
aggressive
act
in

of
the
most
learn
geographer
of

he
imitate
the
humility
of
the
founder
of
his
religion
and
spoke
in
fervent
strain
of
the
heavenly
message
of
peace
and
good
will
should
i
ever
return
to
the
scene
that
we
knew
together
my
mind
would
instantaneously
revert
to
the
good
man
whom
i
shall
never
see
more
be
it
a
rock
he
sat
upon
a
tree
upon
which
he
rest
ground
that
he
walk
upon
or
a
house
that
he
dwelt
in
my
first
thought
would
naturally
be
that
it
be
associate
with
him
but
my
belief
be
that
tjiey
would
flush
my
mind
with
the
goodness
and
nobleness
of
his
expression
appeal
to
me
though
so
silently
to
remember
and
consider
and
strive
i
remember
well
when
i
gaze
at
ujiji
five
year
later
from
the
same
hill
as
where
i
have
announce
the
come
of
my
caravan
i
have
not
be

much
of
him
until
that
mo

when
all
at
once
above
the
palm
grove
of
ujiji
and
the
long
broad
stretch
of
blue
water
of
the
lake
beyond
loom
the
form
of
livingstone

the
well
remember
blue
grey
coat
of
his

costume
and
the
blue
naval
cap

regard
me
with
eye
so
trustful
and
face
so
grave
and
sad
it
be
the
expression
of
him
that
so
follow
and
cling
to
me
and
indeed
be
ever
present
when
i
think
of
him
though
it
be
difficult
to
communicate
to
others
the
expression
that
i
first
study
and
that
most
attract
me
there
be
an
earnest
gravity
in
it
life
long
ago
shorn
of
much
of
its
beauty
i
may
say
of
all
its
vulgar
beauty
and
coarser
pleasure
a
mind
long
abstract
from
petty
discontent
by
preference
feed
on
itself
almost
glorifjdng
in
itself
as
all
sufficient
to
produce
content
therefore
a
composure
settle
calm
and
trustful
even
my
presence
be
impotent
to
break
him
from
his
habit
of
abstraction
i
might
have
take
a
book
to
read
and
be
silent
if
i
look
up
a
few
minute
later
i
discover
him
deeply

in
his

they
be
not
worth
it
my
young
friend
and
let
me
suggest
that
if
i
have
any
possibly
i
should
wish
to
keep
them
after
which
i
invariably
let
him
alone

in

mood
sometimes
these
thought
be
humorous

his
face
wear
a
smile
he
would
impart
the
reason
with
some
comic
story
or
adventure
i
have
met
few
so
quickly
responsive
to
gaiety
and
the
lighter
mood
none
who
be
more
sociable
genial
tolerant
and
humorous
you
must
think
of
him
as
a
content
soul
who
have
yield
himself
with
an
entire
and
love
submission
and
who
labour
to
the
best
of
his
mean
and
ability
awaken
to
the
toil
of
the
day
and
resign
himself
without
the
least
misgive
to
the
rest
of
the
night
believe
that
the
effect
of
his
self
renunciation
would
not
be

there

the

an

of
three
thousand
with

of

him
as

with
entire
self
possession
with
composure
ivith
a
natural
and
effective
oratory
and
with
the
evident
purpose
to
speak
his
mind
to
everybody
without
the
slightest
deference
or
hesitation
but
in
his
journal
he
record
that
his
stage
fright
be
so
extreme
he
could
only
begin
after
three
trial
at
the
request
of
the
royal
geographical
he
have
prepared
a

paper
deal
only
with
the
exploration
of
the
north
end
of
lake

but
unexpectedly
he
be
call
on
to
give
some
account
of
his
whole
expedition
he
told
his
story
and
read
his
paper
a
general
discussion
follow
turn
mainly
on
certain
geographical
question
and
at
the
end
stanley
be
call
on
for
some
final
word
and
wing
word
they
be
of
passionate
ardour
and
directness
on
some
of
the
geographical
opinion
there
be
criticism
and
a
special
attack
be
make
on
the
theory
to
which
livingstone
inclined
that
the
river
lualaba
be
the
source
of
the
nile
stanley
have
grave
doubt
of
that
theory
which
he
be
destine
ultimately
to
disperse
but
for
livingstone
sake
he
want
it
treat
at
least
with
respect
in
die
discussion
there
be
allusion
to
himself
perhaps
tactless
rather
than
intentional
as
when
mr

sir
francis
gal

remark
that
they
be
not
met
to
listen
to

to
serious
fact
i
whether
malicious
or
only
maladroit
such
allusion
be
weight
by
what
have
go
before
in
the
press
stanley
sununed
up
with
a
fervent
eulogy
of

comparison

from

nap
to
dogmatise
about

the
reality
for
year
amid
savage
and
elemental

one
cannot
doubt
that
his
own
essential
veracity
and
manliness
stamp
themselves
on
the
mind
of
his
audience

in

the

of
intelligent

beyond

the
genuineness
of

from
pure
sympathy
reflection
and
conviction
to
modify
my
judgement
about
others
when
anyone
be
about
to
become
an
object
of
popular
i
e
f
newspaper
censure
i
have
be
taught
to
see
how
the
scavenger
beetle
of
the
press
contrive
to
pick
up
an
infinitesimal
grain
of
fact
like
the
african
mud
roll
beetle
until
it
becomes
so
monstrously
exaggerated
that
it
be
absolutely
a
mass
of
filth
the
pity
of
it
be
that
most
of
the
writer
foiiget
for
whom
they
write
we
be
not
all
club
lounger
or
draw
room
gossip
nor
be
we
all
infect
with
the
prevail
madness
of
believe
everything
we
see
in
the
newspaper
we
do
not
all
belong
to
that
large
herd
of
unthinking
soul
who
say
surelyi
where
there
be
so
much
smoke
there
must
be
a
fire
those
stupid
soul
who
never
knew
that
as
likely
as
not
the
fire
be
harmless
enough
and
that
the
alarm
cloud
of
smoke
be
owe
to
the
reporter
briarwood
therefore
i
say
the
instant
i
perceive
whether
in
the
press
or
in
society
a
charge
level
at
some
person
countryman
or
foreigner
i
put
on
the
brake
of
reason
to
prevent
my
be
swept
along
by
the
general
rage
for
scandal
and
abuse
and
hold
myself
unconscious
of
the
charge
until
it
be
justified
by
conviction
all
the
action
of
my
life
and
i
may
say
all
my
thought
since
have
be
strongly
colour
by
the
storm
of
abuse
and
the
wholly
unjustifiable
report

about
me
then
so
numerous
be
my
enemy
that
my
friend
become
dumb
and
i
have
to
resort
to
silence
as
a
protection
against
outrage
it
be
the
one
good
extract
from
my
persecution
that
ever
since
i

restrain
myself
from

how
to
behave
in
the
presence
that
i

above
all
i
be
not

about
what

should
see
or

i
almost
laugh
in

when
he
charge
me
with
the
last
for
i
doubt
whether
the

would
be
less
apt
for
gossip
about
such
thing
than
i
as
for
kneel
i
be
pleased
to
forget
it
we
stood
for
a
while
in
a
gay
salon
and
presently
her
majesty
follow
by
princess
beatrice
enter
we
all
bow
most
profoundly
and
the
queen
advance
sir
henry
introduce
me
in
a
short
sentence
i
regard
her
with
many
feeling
first
as
the
great
lady
in
the
land
the
mistress
of
a
great
empire
the
head
of
brave
soldier
and
sailor
whom
i
have
see
in
various
land
and
sea
the
central
figure
to
which
englishman
everywhere
look
with
eye
of
love
and
reverence
and
lastly
as
that
mysterious
personage
whom
i
have
always
heard
spoken
of
ever
since
i
could
understand
anything
as
the
queen
and
poor
blind
sir
henry
to
think
that
i
would
venture
to
speak
or
write
about
this
lady
whom
in
my
heart
of
heart
next
to
god
i
worship
besides
only
of
late
she
have
honour
me
with
a
memorial
which
be
the
more
priceless
that
it
be
give
when
so
few
believe
me
the
word
majesty
do
not
rightly
describe
her
bearing
i
have
often
see
more
majestic
creature
but
there
be
an
atmosphere
of
conscious
potency
about
her
which
would
have
marked
her
in
any
assemblage
even
without
the
trapping
of
royalty
the
word
royal
aptly
describes
another
characteristic
which
clung
to
her
short
in
stature
as
she
be
and
not
majestic
the
very
carriage
of
her
person
bespeaks
the
fact
of
her
be
aware
of
her
own
inviolability
and
unapproach
ableness
it
be
far
from
be
haughty
and
yet
it
be
command
and
serenely
proud
the
conversation
which
be
principally
about
livingstone
and
africa
though
it
do
not
last
more
than
ten
minute
give
me
abundant
matter
to
think
about
from
have
have
such
good
opportunity
to
look
into
her
eye
and
absorb
as
it
be
my
impression
such
as
they
be
what
i
admire
most
be
the
sense
of
power
the
eye
reveal
and
a
quiet
but
unmistakeable
kindly
condescension
and
an
inimitable
calmness
and
self
possession
i
be
glad
to
have
see
her
not
only
for
the
honour
and
all
that
but
also
i
think
because
i
have
carry
something
away
to

over
at
leisure

when

plainly
i
have
near

by
a

wound
during

discussion
as
to
whether
lake
victoria
be
one
lake
as
he
maintain
it
to
be
or
whether
as
assert
by
captain
burton
james
mcqueen
and
other
theorist
it
consist
of
a
cluster
of
lake
lake

a

lake
must
naturally
posse
an
outlet
somewhere
it
have
not
be
circumnavigate
and
be
therefore
unexplored
i
will
settle
that
problem
also
then
i
may
be
able
to
throw
some
light
on

west
to
know
the
extent
of
that

would
be
worth
some
trouble
surely
if
i
can
resolve
any
of
these
which
such
traveller
as
dr
livingstone
captain
burton
speke

nay
mr

that
nothing

include
so
many
danger

that
it
would
be

there

this
be
a

by
dint
of
diplomatic
suavity
we
postpone
the
conflict
for
many
day
we

from

just
twelve
mile

reflect
on
the

before

i
no

that
the

at

give
birth
to
that

river
the
source
of

have
be
the

so
much
speculation
and
the

of
so
many
explorer
this
bold
hypothesis
be
warmly
dispute
by
many
principally
by
his

this
lead
to

travel
overland
captain
burton

his

theorist
decline
to

satisfied
consequently
it
be
interest
to
know
by
actual
survey
what
be
the
character
of
this
victoria
nyanza
be
it
really
one
lake

a
cluster

i
have
thought
there
could
be
no
well
way
of
settle
once

the
vexed
question
than
by

purpose
i

stone
which
flew
by
our
head
dangerously
near
through
the
dark
continent
they
then
chant
a
war
song
and
one
cheer
by
the
sound
become
bolder
and
whirl
a
rock
at
my
head
i
fire
a
revolver
into
the
water
and
the
warrior
at
once
sprang
into
the
lake
and
dive
as
though
in
search
of
the
bullet
not
find
it
i
suppose
they
swam
away
and
left
the
fine
canoe
in
our
hand
we
be
delighted
of
course
at
the
fun
we
beg
them
to
come
back
after
much
coax
they
return
and
get
into
their
canoe
we
spoke
oh
so
blandly
to
them
they
be
respectful
but
laugh
as
they
diought
of
the
boom
boom
boom
of
the
pistol
they
give
me
a
bunch
of
banana
and
we
mutually
admire
one
another
at
last
we
part
another
gale
visit
us
at
usuguru
blowing
as
though
from

its
force
seem
to

the

suddenly
the
temperature
fell
qp
hailstone
as
large
as
filbert
pelt
us
and
for
fully
ten
minute
we
cower
under
the
icy
shower
then
such
tropical
torrent
of
rain
pour
that
every
utensil
be

to
bale
the

to
prevent
founder
the

last
for
hour
but
near
night
we
uncovered
bale
the
boat
dry
and
crept
for
refuge
through
the
twilight
into
a
wild
arbour
on
an
island
there
to
sleep
a
few
day
later
we
coast
by
the

lackadaisical
so
fatally
encourage
manner
they
become
rude
insolent
and
finally
belligerent
of

it
result
in
a
violent
rupture
there
be
an
explosion
one
of

peace
and

an

a

of
canoe
search
for
a
crocodile
at
which
i
might
take
aim
they
discover
a
small
specimen

on
a

at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
yard
to
represent
all
the
son
of

a
great
responsibility
but
i
be
happy
to
say
that
my
good
luck
do
not
desert
me
the
head
of
the
young
reptile
be
nearly
sever
from
the
body
by
a
three
ounce
ball
and
this
feat
be
accepted
as
a
conclusive
and
undeniable
proof
that
all
white
men
be
dead
shot
in
person
mtesa
be
slender
and
tall
probably
six
foot
one
inch
in
height
he
have
very
intelligent
and
agreeable
feature
which
remind
me
of
some
of
the
face
of
the
great
stone
image
at
thebe
and
of
the
statue
in
the
museum
at
cairo
he
have
the
same
fulness
of
lip
but
their
grossness
be
relieve
by
the
general
expression
of
amiability
blend
with
dignity
that
pervades
his
face
and
the
large
lustrous
lambent
eye
that
lend
it
a
strange
beauty
and
be
typical
of
the
race
from
which
i
believe
him
to
have
sprung
his
face
be
of
a
wonderfully
smooth
surface
when
not
engage
in
council
he
throw
off
unreservedly
the
bearing
that
distinguishes
him
when
on
the
throne
and
give
rein
to
his
humour
indulge
in
hearty
peal
of
laughter
he
seem
to
be
interested
in
the
discussion
of
the
manner
and
custom
of
european
court
and
to
be
enamour
of
hearing
of
the
wonder
of
civilisation
he
be
ambitious
to
imitate
as
much
as
lie
in
his
power
the
wa
of
the
european
when
any
piece
of
information
be
give
him
he
take
upon
himself
the
task
of
translate
it
to
his
wife
and
chief
though
many
of
the
latter
understand
the
language
of
the
east
coast
as
well
as
he
do
himself
though
at
this
period
i
only
stayed
with
him
about
twelve
day
as
i
be
anxious
about
my
camp
at
kagehyi
yet
the
interest
i
conceive
for
the
emperor
and
his
people
at
this
early
stage
be
very
great
he
himself
be
probably
the
main
cause
of
this
the
facility
with
which
he
comprehend
what
be
allude
to
in
conversation
the
eagerness
of
his
manner
the
enthusiasm
he
displayed
when
the
wonder
of
civilisation
be
broach
to
him
tempt
me
to
introduce
the
subject
of
christianity
and
i
delayed
my
departure
from
uganda
much
longer
than
prudence
counsel
to
impress
the
first
rudimentary
lesson
on
his
mind
i
do
not
attempt
to
confuse
him
with
any
particular
doctrine
nor
do
i
broach
abtruse
theological
subject
which
i
knew
would
only
perplex
him
the
simple
story
of
the

my
gallant
boat
on
our
shoulder
and
after
a
march
of
nearly
two
hundred
and
twenty
mile
arrive
at
the
superb
river
on
the
bank
of
which
livingstone
have
die
where
i
first
sight
it
the
lualaba
be
fourteen
hundred
yard
wide
a
noble
breadth
pale
grey
in
colour
wind
slowly
from
south
and
by
east
in
the
centre
rise
two
or
three
small
islet
green
with
the
foliage
of
tree
and
the
verdure
of
sedge
it
be
my
duty
to
follow
it
to
the
ocean
whatever
might
hap
during
the
venture
we
press
on
along
the
river
to
the
arab
colony
of
mwana
mamba
the
chief
of
which
be
tippu
tib
a
rich
arab
who
possess
hundred
of
arm
slave
he
have
give
considerable
assistance
to
cameron
a
heavy
fee
i
thought
would
bribe
him
to
escort
me
some
distance
until
the
seduction
of
nyangwe
would
be
left
far
behind
i
suppose
tippu
tib
you
would
have
no
objection
to
help
me
for
a
good
sum
i
do
not
know
about
that
he
say
with
a
smile
i
have
not
many
men
with
me
now
many
be
at
imbarri
others
be
trading
in
manyuema
how
many
men
have
you
perhaps
three
hundred
say
two
hundred
and
fifty
they
be
enough
yes
add
to
your
people
but
not
enough
to
return
alone
after
you
would
leave
me
through
such
a
country
as
lie
beyond
nyangwe
but
my
friend
think
how
it
would
be
with
me
with
half
a
continent
before
me
ah
well
if
you
white
people
be
fool
enough
to
throw
away
your
life
that
be
no
reason
why
arab
should
we
travel
litde
by
little
to
get
ivory
and
slave
and
be
year
about

a
kind
of
savage
tel

i

her
final

sight
of
her
long

the
water
with
uniform
movement
alarmed
the
unsophisticated
aborigine
they
yield
at

and
the
double

to
the
left
bank
we
pass
our
first
night
in
the

in
the
morning
the

the

the

bore
us
down

one
another
for
three
day
nothing
could
be
more
pacific
than
the
solitary

glide
down
on
the
face
of
the
stream
without
a
movement
of
oar
or
paddle
but
its
appearance
nevertheless
be
hail
by
the
weird
war
cry
of
the
wenya
the
village
below
heard
the
note

with
terror
and
echoed
the

nothing

be
in

where
we
might
rest
but
as
day
after

pass
on
we
found
the

to
listen
but
the

stanley

by
some
call
quixotic
by
others
an

a
buccaneer
others
profess
to
be

he
put

he
excuse
himself
on
the
plea
of
physical
exhaustion
and
unfitness
for
far
undertaking
but
he
have
other
reason
in
his
strong
preference
for
england

his
support

after

advanced
with
my

within
ten

i
have
toil
at
this
work
the
best
part
of
two
year
and
whenever
i
cast
a
retrospective
glance
at
what
the
task
have
cost
me
i
felt
that
it
be
no
joke
and
such
that
no
money
would
bribe
me
to
do
over
again
such
a
long
time
have
elapse
since
ngalyema
have
receive
his

that
he
affected
to
forget
that
he
have

i
still
continued
to

with
diagonal
stripe
of
ochre

though
he

so
much
money
from
me
by
pretence
i
be
not
so
indignant
at
this
as
at
the
audacity
with
which
he
chose
to
forget
the

and
the
impudent
demand
for

and
in
its
shadow
be
a
cool
place
where
the

would
gladly
rest
after
a
ten

up
and

my

affectionately
bade
him

ngalyema
might
fairly

pronounce
a
reform

and
the
friendship
between
him
and
stanley
become
life
long
some
of
you
may
perhaps
wonder
at
the
quiet
inoffensive
ness
of
the
native
who
on
a
former
expedition
have
worried
my
soul
by
their
ferocity
and
wanton
attack
night
and
day
but
a
very
simple
explanation
of
it
may
be
found
in
livingstone
last
journal
date
th
october
he
say
muini
mukata
who
have
travel
far
than
most
arab
say
to
me
if
a
man
go
with
a
good
natured
civil
tongue
he
may
pas
through
the
bad
people
in
africa
unharmed
this
be
true
but
time
also
be
require
one
must
not
run
through
a
country
but
give
the
people
time
to
become
acquaint
with
you
and
let
their
bad
fear
subside
now
on
the
expedition
across
africa
i
have
no
time
to
give
either
to
myself
or
to
them
the
river
bore
my
heavy
canoe
downward
my
good
would
never
have
endure
the
dawdle
require
by
this
system
of
teach
every
tribe
i
met
who
i
be
to
save
myself
and
my
men
from
certain
starvation
i
have
to
rush
on
and
on
right
through
but
on
this
expedition
the
very
necessity
of
make
road
to
haul
my
enormous
six
ton
wagon
give
time
for
my
reputation
to
travel
ahead
of
me
my

my

into

friendly
ally
strong
porter
and
firm
friend
i
be
greatly
forbear
also
but
when
a
fight
be
inevitable
through
open
violence
it
be
sharp
and
decisive
consequently
the
native
rapidly
learn
that
though
everything
be
to
be
gain
by
friendship
with
me
war
brought
nothing
but
ruin
so
it
be
that
he
go
among
these
fierce
savage
as
a
messenger
of
good
tidings
and
they
welcome
him

put
his
superiority
over
them
to
use
in

bridge
across
the
gulf
between
their
mind
and
his

not
only
their
language
but
their
ceremonial

himself
to
their
form
of
justice
and
way
of
settle
dispute
as
in
the
rite
of
blood
brotherhood
he
brought
them
not
only
personal
good
will
and
kind
treatment
but
the
practical
advantage
of
civilisation
everywhere
he
found
eagerness
to
trade
and
the
possibility
of
commercial

that
should
be
profitable

both

of

with

but
neither
in
the
formal

in
the
actual

there
the

trace
of
spoliation
of

and

which
be

later
when
stanley
have
left
the

it
be
agree

one
of
his
typical
treaty
that
the
term
cession
of

do
not
mean
the
purchase
of
the

by

my

sir
henry

once
told
me
that
at
the
time
of
his
early
expedition
he
estimate
that
more
than
a
million
native
be
slain

but
too
frequent
be
theopposite
story
the
subordinate
indolence
neglect
perhaps
desertion
and
the
decadence
of
the
station
the
painful
element
in
the
story
and
ominous
of
future
consequence
be
the
failure
among
the
men
sent
out
from
europe
as
his
assistant
there
be
many
and
honourable
exception
and
these
he
praise
warmly

so

the

tell
often
of
the
failure
and
the
private
note
book
detail
the
story
more
plainly
and
tell
too
something
of
his
difficulty
with
his
native
helper
all
the
officer
before
i
sent
them
to
their
post
be
instruct
by
me
orally
and
in
write
in
the
very
minutia
of
their
duty
especially
in
the
mode
of
conduct
to
be
adopt
towards
the
native
the
ridiculous
inadequacy
of
our
force
as
oppose
to
the
native
population
require
that
each
officer
should
be
more
prudent
than
brave
more
tactful
than
zealous
such
conduct
invariably
make
the
native
pleasantly
dispose
to
us
if
some
character
among
them
presume
to
think
that
forbearance
sprang
from
cowardice
and
be
inclined
to
be
aggressive
the
same
prudence
which
they
have
practise
previously
would
teach
them
how
to
deal
with
such
it
be
mainly
impressed
on
the
officer
that
they
be
to
hold
their
post
more
by
wit
than
by
force
for
the
latter
be
out
of
the
question
except
after
forethought
and
in
combination
with
headquarters
this
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
young
officer
be
as
ignorant
of
diplomacy
as
child
their
instinct
be
to
be
disciplinary
and
dictatorial
the
cut
tone
of
command
be
offensive
to
savage
and
terrify
to
them
as
individual
captain
d
exceed
his
instruction
in
assume
the
responsibility
of
provoke
the
arab
at
stanley
fall
he
study
only
his
own
fight
instinct
and
british
resentment
against
the
slaver
at
an
early
period
he
be
too
brusque
the
congot
and
the
found
of
us
free
state
this
repel
confidence
and
rouse
resentment
while
he
be
expect
to
represent
civil
law
of
the
most
paternal
character
he
regard
the
thirty
houssas
soldier
under
his
command
as
qualify
him
for
the
role
of
a
military
dictator
and
as
soon
as
he
appear
in
that
character
the
arab
become
unanimous
in
assert
their
independence
before
a
man
with
thirty
soldier
can
adopt
such
a
tone
he
surely
ought
to
have
be
prepared
for
the
consequence
but
he
seem
to
have
do
nothing
except
challenge
the
arab
he
knew
he
have
so
many
round
of
ammunition
but
his
ammunition
be
damp
and
he
be
not
aware
of
it
i
know
that
many
of
my
officer
be
inclined
to
regard
me
as
hard
i
may
now
and
then
have
deserve
that
character
but
then
it
be
only
when
nought
but
hardness
avail
when
i
meet
chronic
stupidity
laziness
and
utter
indifference
to
duty
expostulation
cease
and
coercion
or
hardness
begin
his
associate
have
be
the
principal
cause
of
the
exhibition
of
this
quality
and
with
some
of
them
he
have
be
very
unfortunate
to
describe
bracconier
case
for
example
would
fill
a
good
size
book
others
be
equally
impenetrable
to
reason
and
persuasion
intuitively
i
felt
that
braconnier
though
polite
and
agree
this
note
from
stanley
pocket
book
refers
to
an
officer
in
charge
of
the
statmi
of

of

in
civil
term
that
the

declare
that
the

have
sought

threaten
captain
d
scoffed
at
him
and
dare
him
to
do
hb
bad
the
arab
thereupon
come
down
and
shot
everyone
with
the
exception
of
captain
d
and
one
or
two
others
who
escape
in
a
terrible
plight
the
station
be
burnt
and
everything
utterly
destroyed
when
i
ask
stanley
what
he
would
have
do
whether
he
would
have
return
the
poor
beaten
slave
wife
to
her
cruel
owner
stanley
reply
certainly
rather
than
ha
ve
my
station
wreck
and
the
life
entrust
to
me
sacrifice
but
it
would
never
have
come
to
that
i
should
have
receive
the
arab
with
deference
and
much
ceremony
and
after
refreshment
and
compliment
i
should
have
attempt
some
compromise
such
as
by
offering
to
buy
the
woman
for
cloth
and
bead
or
else
i
should
have
return
her
on
receive
solemn
assurance
that
she
would
be
mercifully
treat
i
should
explain
that
i
be
not
free
that
if
i
hand
the
woman
back
after
she
have
sought
my
protection
my
chief
hearing
of
it
would
cut
off
my
head
but
i
would
give
money
for
her
the
arab
would
have
understood
this
kind
of
talk
he
would
have
treat
with
me
all
would
have
go
well
and
we
should
have
part
the
best
of
friend
it
be
necessary
to
use
your
wit

never
to
lose
sight
of
the
consequence
of
your
act
d

able
be
not
to

with
any
practical
work
his
education

character
have
utterly
unfitted
him
for
work
of
any
kind
he
be
ask
to
superintend
a
little
road
make
he
sought
a
nice
shady
place
and
fell
asleep
and
his
men
of
course
while
they
admire
him
for
his
easy
disposition
do
what
be
most
agreeable
to
them
and
dawdle
over
their
work
by
which
we
lose
two
day
when
myself
incapacitate
by
a
sudden
stroke
of
fever
i
request
him
to
supervise
the
descent
of
the
boiler
wagon
down
a
hill
not
ten
minute
later
the
boiler
and
wagon

he

brought
to
me
half
dead
from
his
injury
he
be

chief
of
leopoldville

in
four
month
the

and
he
and
his
men

reduce
to
a
state
of
siege
he
allow
a
young
austrian
lieutenant
and
six
zanzibaris
to
enter
a
small
unsuitable
canoe
and
attempt
to
ascend
the
congo
within
fifteen
minute
of
their
departure
they
be
all
drown
there
be
always
another
side
to
these
accusation
and
those
inclined
to
believe
bracconier
ridiculous
charge
of
my
hardness
should
try
first
how
they
would
like
to
endure
three
year
of
indolence
and
incapacity
before
they
finally
dismiss
the
fellow
let
those
who
criticise
me
ascertain
whether
this
man
distinguish
himself
in
other
field
and
other
mission
though
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
a
brussels
draw
room
he
would
be
found
to
be
an
agreeable
companion
but
not
in
africa
where
work
have
to
be
do
and
progress
make
then
as
regard
the
colour
people
good
as
the
majority
of
zanzibaris
be
some
of
them
be
indescribably
and
for
me
most
unfortunately
dense
one
man
who
from
his
personal
appearance
might
have
be
judged
to
be
among
the
most
intelligent
be
after
thirty
month
experience
with
his
musket
unable
to
understand
how
it
be
to
be
load
he
never
could
remember
whether
he
ought
to
drop
the
powder
or
the
bullet
into
the
musket
first
another
time
he
be
sent
with
a
man
to
transport
a
company
of
men
over
a
river
to
camp
after
wait
an
hour
i
strode
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
found
them
paddle
in
opposite
direction
each
blame
the
other
for
his
stupidity
and
be
in
a
passion
of
excitement
unable
to
hear
the
advice
of
the
men
across
the
river
who
be
bawling
out
to
them
how
to
manage
their
canoe
another
man
be
so
ludicrously
stupid
that
he
generally
be
save
from
punishment
because
his
mistake
be
so
absurd
we
be
one
day
float
down
the
congo
and
it
be
near
camp
time
i
bade
him
as
he
happen
to
be
bowman
on
the
occasion
to
stand
by
and
seize
the
grass
on
the
bank
to
arrest
the
boat
when
i
should
call
out
in
a
little
while
we
come
to
a
fit
place
and
i
cry
hold
hard
kirango
please
god
master
he
reply
and
forthwith
sprang
on
shore
and
seize
the
grass
with
both
hand
while
we
of
course
be
rapidly
swept
down
river
leave
him
alone
and
solitary
on
the
bank
the
boat
crew
roar
at
the
ridiculous
sight
but
nevertheless
his
stupidity
cost
the
tire
men
a
hard
pull
to
ascend
again
for
not
every
place
be
available
for
a
camp
he
it
be
also
who
on
an
occasion
when
we
require
tiie
branch
of
a
specie
of
arbutus
which
overhung
the
river
to
be
cut
away
to
allow
the
canoe
to
be
brought
nearer
to
the
bank
for
safety
actually
go
astride
of
the
branch
and
chopped
away
until
he
fell
into
the
water
with
the
branch
and
lose
our
axe
he
have
seat
himself
on
the
outer
end
of
the
branch
the
colour
men
accepted
the
reproach
they
deserve
with
such
good
nature
that
however
stupid
they
be
i
could
not
help
forgive
and
forget
but
it
be
not
so
with
the
officer
their
amour
propre
be
so
much
offend
that
if
i
venture
on
a
rebuke
it
be
remember
with
so
much
bitterness
that
an
officer
who
be
continually
err
be
also
constantly
in
a
resentful

who
would

that
out
of
five
intelligent
belgian
officer
bidding
a
sixth
ban
voyage
not
one
could

by

the

suspicion
that
the

go

his
doom

they
do
without
so
much
as
a
protest
and
though
the
two
unhappy
voyager
save
their
life
by
spring
on
shore
their
boat
and
all
their
effect
be
swept
over
a
cataract
not
long
after
another
of
these
officer
who
belong
to
a
boat
club
on
a
belgian
river
thought
he
would
establish
one
of
his
own
on
the
upper
congo
as
a
first
step
he
purchase
an
elegant
canoe
pay
heavily
for
it
he
attach
a
keel
piece
to
it
make
a
mast
and
a
sail
and
one
day
he
go
sail
smoothly
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
where
it
be
four
mile
wide
presently
have
get
beyond
view
of
his
station
the
wind
die
away
and
he
be
carry
down
by
the
mighty
flood
he
begin
to
cry
out
for
aid
as
he
have
forgotten
his
paddle
but
his
cry
could
not
be
heard
he
be
alone
on
the
wide
water
towards
midnight
his
men
get
anxious
set
out
in
search
of
him
and
after
many
hour
found
him
nearly
distract
with
terror
and
brought
him
to
camp
vow
he
would
never
again
trust
himself
alone
on
the
congo
a
short
time
after

by
cannibal
with
eleven
zanzibaris
who
accompany
them
the
detail
of
the
story
go
to
prove
that
in
this
case
again
the
military
officer
prove
his
inaptitude
to
learn
though
in
other
way
the
young
man
be
exemplary
still
the
disposition
to
blunder
seem
so
prevalent
that
he
who
be
responsible
for
the
good
management
of
their
affair
might
well
be
pardon
if
in
his
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
those
under
him
he
should
exact
obedience
in
a
more
peremptory
tone
than
formerly
another
officer
have
his
station
burn
twice
with
all
the
property
store
in
it
he
be
relieve
of
his
charge
and
ap
point
to
an
honourable
mission
but
after
set
out
he
suddenly
decide
to
abandon
his
people
leave
them
to
find
their
own
way
whilst
he
slip
off
to
the
coast
to
buy
a
pair
of
boot
as
he
say
no
one
could
have
appear
more
astonish
than
he
be
when
after
the
third
glare
o
fence
he
be
told
that
he
be
no
longer
need
another
officer
be
supply
with
a
small
company
of
choioe
men
and
i
instruct
him
to
build
a
station
with
a
friendly
tribe
which
have
desire
it
for
the
opening
of
trade
within
a
few
day
he
begin
shoot
promiscuously
at
the
native
with
a
revolver
and
on
one
of
his
men
expostulate
with
him
he
turn
the
weapon
upon
his
faithful
servant
and
shot
him
in
the
head
upon
which
the
remainder
of
the
men
flung
themselves
upon
him
and
have
disarm
him

him

a
dangerous
lunatic
though
no
one
would
have
suppose
from
his
appearance
and
language
that
he
be
thus
afflict
i
could
go
on
with
page
of
these
extraordinary
misadventure
all
of
which
i
have
to
endure
with
some
of
the
officer
who
be
sent
out
to
me
i
but
cite
these
few
instance
take
at
random
to
prove
that
there
be
another
view
to
be
take
when
the
responsible
head
of
an
expedition
or
enterprise
of
this
kind
be
charge
with
be
hard
one
be
not
likely
to
be
hard
with
person
who
perform
their
duty
but
it
be
difficult
to
be
mild
or
amiable
with
people
who
be
absolutely
incapable
and
who
will
not
listen
to
admonition
without
bristling
with
resentment
the
only
power
i
possess
with
officer
of
this
kind
be
that
of
dismissal
which
i
forbore
to
use
too
frequently
because
in
do
so
i
punish
the
association
it
be
only
in
extreme
case
that
the
power
be
exercise
in
europe
of
course
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
many
word
or
sore
feeling
but
in
africa
i
could
not
lose
eighty
pound
for
a
solitary
evidence
of
incapacity
i
practise
forbearance
i
try
to
instruct
to
expostulate
to
admonish
once
twice
thrice
i
make
every
effort
to
teach
and
train
but
at
last
when
nothing
avail
i
be
force
to
have
recourse
to
dismissal
be
of
an
open
temper
and
frank
disposition
and
always
willing
to
hear
what
my
officer
or
men
have
to
sayi
though
as
a
leader
of
men
i
could
not
hob
nob
with
my
officer
they
ought
to
have

no
difficulty
in

me
the
black
man
certainly
be
never
at
a
loss
to
do
so
no
man
be
free
from
imperfection
but
when
one
be
genially
dispose
and
evinces
good
will
a
man
who
fastens
upon
one
imperfection
and
constantly
harp
upon
that
show
his
own
narrow
mindedness
and
incapacity
i
have
have
no

on
any

no
one
who
could
possibly

shock
sight

it

strange
that
no

at

my

my

it
i
ever
turn

it
occupy
my

i

on
it
at

only
those

regard

the

his

to

be
rapid
strength
have
return
during
the
feast
and
there
rise
a
general
demand
that
we
should
continue
the
journey
in
order
that
we
might
delight
our
eye
by
the
grass
land
of
which
we
now
begin
to
hear
the
first
rumour
on
the
twelfth
day
after
quit
ibwiri
we
emerge
from
the
sombre
twilight
of
the
forest
into
the
unclouded
light
of
a
tropic
sky
a
feel
of
exultation
immediately
possess
me
as
if
i
have
be
release
from
purgatory
to
disport
myself
in
the
mead
of
heaven
the
very
air
be
greedily
sniffed
the
first
smell
of
it
that
come
to
my
open
nostril
seem
as
if
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
there
somewhere
lay
a
great
dairy
and
cattle
pen
and
almost
at
once
i
sight
startle
game
in
close
consult
on
the
knoll
and
mound
stamp
and
snort
in
the
first
energy
of
alarm
the
first
view
of
the
green
roll
plain
be
as
of
a
grassy
eden
which
have
be
newly
fashion
with
a
beautiful
shapeliness
with
a
new
sun
and
a
brand
new
sky
of
intense
blue
it
transfigure
every
face
in
an
instant
and
the
homeliest
feature
be
lit
up
by
sincere
emotion
of
gratitude
as
though
some
dream
of
bliss
have
be
realise
by
one
impulse
we
start
to
run
our
exhilarate
blood
seem
foam
champagne
and
sent
us
leap
over
the
soft
sward
and
the
limb
which
have
previously
strain
heavily
through
the
forest
thicket
dance
as
freely
as
those
of
bound
kid
on
the
th
december
one
hundred
and
sixty
nine
day
from
yambuya
the
expedition
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
grassy
plateau
and
look
down
upon
the
albert
nyanza
whose
water
as
report
by
emin
be
constantly
navigate
by
his
steamer
the
khedive
and
nyanza
after
sufficiently
enjoy
the
prospect
we
commenced
the
steep
descent
of
two
thousand
seven
hundred
foot
to
the
lake
and
early
next
morning
reach
the
shore
which
have
be
our
goal
on
inquire
from
the
native
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
white
man
with
the
smoke
boat
they
declare
most

positively
that
they
have
not
see
any
white
man
or
steamer
since
colonel
mason
visit
ten
year
before
our
position
be
a
cruel
one
the
foreign
office
have
furnish
me
with
copy
of
all
emin
letter
and
from
their
tone
character
and
number
of
statement
i
have
form
what
probably
every
one
else
have
an
opinion
of
a
military
governor
who
with
two
steamer
and
steel
boat
have
he
a
in
the
habit
of
visit
the
various
lake
port
i
ask
again
and
again
if
a
white
man
have
be
see
and
i
receive
an
answer
always
in
the
negative
i
have
left
my
steel
boat
at
ipoto
because
of
our
deplete
number
no
food
be
obtainable
on
the
alkalise
plain
bordering
the
lake
the
native
canoe
be
only
suitable
for
inshore
fishing
and
calm
weather
and
there
be
not
a
tree
visible
out
of
which
a
sizeable
canoe
could
be
make
after
consult
with
the
officer
i
found
that
they
also
be
surprised
at
the
inexplicable
absence
of
news
of
emin
and
a
great
many
guess
wide
of
the
truth
as
it
appear
later
be
make
but
no
amount
of
guess
would
feed
two
hundred
hungry
men
strand
on
a
naked
lake
shore
i
therefore
resolve
after
three
day
halt
to
retrace
our
step
to
ibwiri
and
there
erect
a
small
fort
for
the
protection
of
the
ammunition
and
as
a
rest
place
for
my
sick
after
which
we
could
return
once
more
to
the
lake
and
launch
my
boat
on
its
water
sail
in
search
of
the
miss
pasha
agreeably
to
this
resolution
i
turn
my
back

twenty

amongst
them

could
have
act
the
part
of
hospitable
and
pleasant
host
so
well
as
emin
i
quite
understood
now
how
dr

be
cordial
in
manner
well

be
at
an
end
for
emin
have
provide
abundance
of
grain
tod
as
the
main
object
of
the
expedition
be
now
within
view
of
be
achieve
my
feeling
all
round
be
those
of
unal
loyed
pleasure
many
a
time
afterwards
i
look
back
upon
this
period
as
upon
a
delightful
holiday
until
the
th
of
may
our
respective
camp
be
dose
together
and
we
daily
met
and
chat
about
various
thing
during
which
naturally
the
topic
as
to
whether
he
would
stay
in
equatoria
or
accompany
me
to
the
coast
come
up
for
discussion
frequently
but
from
the
begin
to
the
end
of
our
meeting
i
be
only
conscious
that
i
be
profoundly
ignorant
of
his
intention
on
some
day
after
a
friendly
dinner
the
night
previous
he
held
out
hope
that
he
might
accompany
me
but
the
day
follow
he
would
say
no
if
my
people
go
i
go
if
they
stay
i
stay
for
ten
day
i
assent
to
this
but
it
become
impressed
on
my
mind
that
he
have
a
personal
objection
to
go
to
egypt
from
a
fear
that
he
might
be
shelve
and
his
life
would
become
waste
in
a
cairene
or
stamboul
coffee
house
the
ideal
governor
whom
i
have
imagine
have
be
altogether
replace
by
a
man
who
have
other
view
than
those
of
his
government
what
those
view
be
i
could
never
gather
definitely
for
as
have
be
observe
the
impression
of
one
day
be
displace
by
that
of
the
next
and
his
real
opinion
upon
any
topic
save
an
abstract
question
be
too
transient
to
base
a
conclusion
upon
altogether
i
spent
twenty
five
day
with
emin
i
then
retrace
my
step
to
fort
boido
after
carefully
provision
one
hundr
and
seven
men
and
serve
out
twenty
five
day
ration
to
each
man
i
commenced
the
search
for
the
rear
column
on
the
i
th
june
i
have
often
be
ask
how
i
dare
to
face
that
terrible
and
hungry
forest
alone
after
such
awful
experience
if
i
suggest
admonition
of
duty
and
conscience
as
be
sufficient
motif
i
seldom
fail
to
notice
a
furtive
shrug
but
really
i
fail
to
see
what
else
could
have
be
do
the
rear
column
be
as
much
a
part
of
the
expedition
as
the
advance
and
have
there
be
only
twenty
black
it
would
have
be
as
much
my
duty
to
seek
them
as
to
find
what
have
become
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
zanzibaris
with
five
white
officer
as
for
send
any
of
my
own
officer
to
perform
such
an
important
mission
well
there
be
a
say
which
i
believe
in
thoroughly
if
you
want
a
thing
do
you
must
do
it
yourself
besides
these
motif
i
be
too
nervously
anxious
about
the
long
absent
column
which
have
be
instruct
to
follow
us
and
the
suspense
be
intolerable
it
be
also
principally
this
nervous
anxiety
about
these
miss
people
that
drove
me
through
the
great
forest
at
such
a
rate
that
what
have
take
us
one
hundred
and
twenty
nine
day
be
now
perform
in
sixty
two

up
my
field
glass
i
discover
a
red
flag
hoist
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
crept
into
my
mind
a
light
puff
of
wind
unrolled
the
flag
for
an
instant
and
the
white
crescent
and
star
be
reveal
i
sprang
to
my
foot
and
cry

query
rapidly
put
and
answer
as
we
stood
by
the
gate
at
the
water
side
prepared
me
to
hear
as
deplorable
a
story
as
could
be
render
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
series
of
derangement
that
an
organize
body
of
men
could
possibly
be
plunge
into
if
i
be
to
record
all
that
i
saw
at
banalya
in
its
deep
intensity
of
unqualified
misery
it
would
be
like
strip
the
bandage
off
a
vast
slough
ulcer
striate
with
bleedii

be
no
longer
the
funeral
procession
which
have
slowly
drag
itself
through
the
shade
of
the
forest
the
year
before
they
knew
that
they
be
homeward
bound
and
fascinate
by
mem
cry
of
the
pastoral
plain
and
unencumbered
with
load
they
march
in
high
spirit
about
a
month
march
from
fort
bodo
i
cast
off
the
canoe
and
struck
overland
by
a
shorter
way
presently
i
enter
the
land
inhabit
by
pigmy
this
race
of
dwarf
have
dwelt
in
this
section
of
the
country
since
the
remotest
time
before
history
the
tallest
male
discover
by
me
do
not
exceed
four
foot
six
inch
the
average
specimen
be
about
four
foot
two
inch
in
height
while
many
a
child
bearing
pigmy
woman
do
not
exceed
three
foot
high
in
the
more
easterly
part
of
the
forest
there
be
several
tribe
of
this
primeval
race
of
man
they
range
from
the
ihuru
river
to
the
awamba
forest
at
the
base
of
ruwenzori
i
found
two
distinct
type
one
a
very
degrade
specimen
with
ferrety
eye
close
set
and
an
excessive
prognathy
of
jaw
more
nearly
approach
what
one
might
call
a
cousin
of
the
simian
than
be
suppose
to
be
possible
yet
thoroughly
human
the
other
be
a
very
handsome
type
with
frank
open
innocent
countenance
very
prepossess
i
have
considerable
experience
of
both

be
wonderfully
quick
with
their
weapon
and
wound
to
death
several
of
my
follower

custom
in
the

be
to
shoot
at
sight
and
their
craft
quick
sight
correct
aim
and
general
expertness
add
to
the
fatal
character
of
the
poison
of
their
arrow
make
them
no
despicable
antagonist
the

i
have
see

it
have
be
terribly
hard
work
as
she
be
such
an
inveterate
scold
by
her
action
she
seem
to
say
you
may
beat

you
may

i
can
still
scold
and
scold
i
will
until
i
drop
i
have
a
pigmy
boy
of
eighteen
who
work
with
a
zeal
that
i
do
not
think
possible
to
find
out
of
civilisation
time
be
too
precious
to
him
to
waste
in
talk
on
the
march
he
stoutly
held
his
place
near
the
van
and
on
reach
camp
he
literally
rush
to
collect
fuel
and
make
his
master
fire
his
mind
seem
ever
concentrate
on
his
work
when
i
once
stop
him
to
ask
his
name
his
face
seem
to
say
please
do
not
stop
me
i
must
finish
my
task
and
i
never
heard
his
voice
while
he
be
with
me
though
he
be
not
dumb
another
of
my
pigmy
follower
be
a
young
woman
of
whom
i
could
honestly
say
that
she
be
virtuous
and
modest
though
nude
it
be
of
no
use
for
any
stalwart
young
zan
zibari
to
be
cast
lover
eye
at
her
she
resolve
that
she
have
duty
to
perform
and
she
do
them
without
deign
to
notice
the
love
sick
swain
of
our
camp
her
master
tea
or
coffee
be
far
too
important
to
be
neglect
his
tent
require
her
vigilant
watchfulness
her
master
comfort
be
unspeakably
precious
in
her
eye
and
the
picture
of
the
half
naked
pigmy
girl
abjure
frivolity
and
render
due
fidelity
and
simple
devotedness
because
it
be
her
nature
to
will
remain
long
in
my
mind
as
one
of
many
pleasantness
to
be
remember
i
have
often
be
ask
whether
i
do
not
think
the
pigmy
to
be
a
degenerate
stock
of
ordinary
humanity
in
my
opinion
tribe
and
nation
be
subject
to
the
same
influence
as
family
if
confine
strictly
to
itself
even
a
nation
must
in
time
deteriorate
asia
and
africa
contain
several
isolated
fragment
of
what
be
once
powerful
nation
and
yet
more
numerous
relic
of
once
populous
tribe
it
be
not
difficult
to
judge
of
the
effect
on
a
race
of
three
thousand
year
isolation
intermarriage
and
a
precarious
diet
of
fungi
wild
fruit
lean
fibrous
meat
of
animal
and
dry
insect
the
utter
absence
of
sunshine
the
want
of
gluten
and
saccharine
body
in
their
food
scarcely
tend
to
promote
increase
of
stature
or
strength
of
limb
and
as
it
be
say
where
there
be
no
progress
there
must
be
decay
i
suppose
that
some
deterioration
must
have
occur
since
the
existence
of
the
pigmy
become
know
as
the
result
of
their
ancestor
have
capture
the
five
nassamonian
explorer
twenty
six
century
ago
as
described
by
the
father
of
history
on
every
map
since
hekateus
time
year
b
c
they
have
be
locate
in
the
region
of
the
mountain
of
the
moon
on
the
th
of
december
we
burst
out
of
the
great
forest
on
the
edge
of
the
plantation
of
fort
bodo
and
by
o
clock
the
volley
of
the
rifle
woke
up
the
garrison
at
the
fort
to
the
fact
that
after
one
hundred
and
eighty
eight
day
absence
we
have
return
what
a
difference
there
be
between
the
admirable
station
with
its
model
farm
like
appearance
and
banalya
but
there
be
one
mystery
yet
remain
the
pasha
and
jephson
have
promise
to
visit
fort
bodo
within
two
month
after
my
departure
say
about
the
middle
of
august
it
be
now
past
the
middle
of
december
and
nothing
have
be
heard
of
them
but
the
cure
of
all
doubt
grief
misery
and
mystery
be
action
and
therefore
i
could
not
remain
passive
at
fort
bodo
i
allow
myself
three
day
rest
only
and
then
set
out
for
lake
albert
for
the
third
time
on
the
th
of
january
when
only
one
day
march

from
the
albert
lake
a
packet
of
letter
be
place
in
my
hand
they
be
from
emin
pasha
and
mr
jephsoa
there
be
a
long
account
from
jephson
state
that
he
and
the
pasha
be
prisoner
to
the
revolt
troop
of
the
province
since
the
i
th
august
the
very
day
after
we
have
discover
the
founder
rear
column
at
banalyal
there
be
some
expression
in
poor
mr
jephson
letter
whidi
put
a
very
relief
less
aspect
on
his
case
if
i
do
not
see
you
again
commend
me
to
my
friend
the
pasha
also
seem
to
think
that
nothing
could
be
bad
than
the
outlook
for
he
specially
recommend
his
child
to
my
care
now
reading
such
word
a
month
after
they
be
write
be
not
very
assure
however
i
picked
up
a
crumb
of
comfort
in
the
fact
that
mr
jephson
say
he
could
come
to
me
if
he
be
inform
of
my
arrival
which
i
decide
be
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do
accordingly
an
imperative
message
be
sent
to
him
not
to
debate
but
to
act
and
like
a
faithful
and
obedient
officer
he
step
into
a
canoe
and
come
after
shake
hand
and
congratulate
him
upon
his
narrow
escape
from
be
a
footman
to
the
emperor
of
the
soudan
i
say
well
jephson
speak
be
the
pasha
decide
by
this
what
to
do
now
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
know
no
more
what
the
pasha
intend
do
now
than
i
do
nine
month
ago
what
after
nine
month
intercourse
with
him
quite
so
not
a
bit
it
be
not
long
before
the
mystery
that
have
struck
me
the
year
before
be
clear
up
the
pasha
have
be
deceive
by
the
fair
spoken
obsequious
egyptian
and
soudanese
officer
and
through
his
good
natured
optimism
we
also
have
be
deceive
they
have
revolt
three
time
and
have
refuse
to
obey
any
order
he
have
give
them
this
be
the
fourth
and
final
revolt
as
early
as
gessi
pasha
have
drawn
general
gordon
attention
to
the
state
of
affair
in
equatoria
and
have
report
that
immediately
the
communication
with
khartoum
have
be
suspend
by
the
closing
of
the
upper
nile
by
the
sudd
the
indiscipline
have
be
such
as
to
cause
anxiety
in
emin
pasha
have
flee
from
the
st
battalion
and
until
his
imprudent
resolve
to
take
mr
jephson
among
the
rebel
have
held
no
communication
with
em
the
nd
battalion
also
only
perform
just
such
service
as
pleased
them
when
he
condescend
to
use
coax
while
the
irregular
of
course
would
follow
the
majority
of
the
regular
this
much
be
clear
from
the
narrative
write
and
oral
of
mr
jephson
i
resolve
to
try
once
more
and
asc
tain
what
measure
agreeable
to
him
i
should
take
do
he
wish
an
arm
rescue
or
be
it
possible
for
him
to
do
anything
such
as

varied
from
six

seventy

between
eighteen
thousand

nineteen
thousand

away
from

his

suddenly
put
a
barrier

strange
way
between
us
if
the
british
consul
general
express
a
desire
to
pay
a
visit
to

first
three
week
found
that
thing
be
not
so
pleasant
for
him
as
formerly
if
i
sent
my
black
boy
sali
to
him
with
a
note
of

the
german

my
friendly
note
ask
him
to

some
regard
to
his
reputation
be
at
once
show
by
him
to
major
wissmann
it
be
curious
too
how
the
pasha
who
thought
at
equatoria
that
his
people
be
so
dear
to
him
that
he
profess
himself
ready
to
sacrifice
his
future
for
them
drop
his
dear
people
from
his
mind
and
told
them
with
a
brutal
frankness
that
he
have
nothing
far
to
do
with
them
the
muster
and
pay
roll
of
the
rescue
egyptian
be
therefore
not
sent
to
egypt
and
the
poor
fellow
wait
month
for
the
many
year
pay
due
to
them
inasmuch
as
no
one
knew
anything
of
the
account
finally
in
march
the
secret
be
out
the
pasha
have
engage
himself
to
the
german
on
the
th
of

and
then
it
transpire
that
all
these
strange
and
wholly
unnecessary
act
be
with
a
view
to
cut
himself
adrift
from
all
connection
with
his

not

affront
at
their

reject
so
churlishly
and
from
the
offend
tone
which
the
press
now
assume
may
be
gather
the
nature
of
my
own
feeling
when
i
first
become
acquaint
with
his
uncertain
disposition
and
his
capricious
and
eccentric
nature
but
in
its
furious
disai

a
large
portion
of
the
press
be
unable
to
discriminate
between
emin
and
me
day
after
day
it
lavish
the
foulest
accusation
and
the
most
violent
abuse
against
me
it
be
state
by
the
newspaper
that
i
have
capture
emin
by
force
that
i
have

a

the

joy
which
cause
each

black

to

exultation
when
we
first
beheld
lake

knew
that
the
goal
be
won
and
that
the
long
train
of
sad
memory
have
be
left

deserve
that
i
should
have
be
able

the
uttermost
honour
but
it
be
simply
impossible
i
console
myself
however
that
through
this
mission
i
have
be
supply
with
a
store
of
remarkable
reminiscence
that
i
have
explore
the
heart
of
the
great
primeval
forest
that
i
have
have
unique
experience
with
its
pigmy
and
cannibal
that
i
have
discover
the
long
lose
snowy
mountain
of
the

the

of
the
albertine

four
european

british
french
german

portuguese
have
be

sphere
of

shall
be
in
the

in
the
dark

with
a

to
exercise
their
beneficent
power
for
its
redemption
from
the
state
of
darkness
and
woe
in
which
it
have
too
long
remain
in
england
there
arose
bitter
oontroveibies
over
story
of
doings
by
some
of
the
rear
column
there
be
no
occasion
to
reopen
these
controversy
but
stanley
in
a
letter
cable
from
america
to
the
time
dealt
with
the
imputation
that
cruelty
to
the
native
be
an
ordinary
incident
of
english
advance
in
africa
and
tbh
repression
of
his
sentiment
deserves
permanent
reccxd
to
the
editor
of
the
time
sir
now
that
the
storm
of
controversy
as
to
the
rearguard
of
the
emin
relief
expedition
have
somewhat
clear
away
and
as
an
appendix
if
i
may
so
call
it
to
my
letter
of
december
i
will
ask
you
to
allow
me
a
few
more
word
final
word
on
my
part
as
i
hope
and
deal
mainly
with
the
most
serious
aspect
of
the
affair
the
impressic
i
pnxiuced
upon
other
nation
by
the
disclosure
of
certain
act
do
by
englishman
in
africa
it
be
hardly
yet
time
for
me
to
express
the
sorrow
i
truly
feel
at
the
pain
these
inevitable
disclosure
have
brought
upon
men
and
woman
innocent
of
any
fault
but
no
one
be
likely
to
question
the
earnestness
of
my
r
ret
at
a
result
so
directly
counter
to
the
wish
close
to
my
heart
as
it
be
this
be
an
opportunity
give
to
compete
nation
to
cast
a
slur
upon
british
enterprise
in
africa
beyond
and
above
any
personal
question
whatever
stand
the
honour
of
the
english
name
i
wish
therefore
to
say
with
whatever
weight
my
long
experi
ence
may
give
my
word
that
i
believe
that
conduct
sudi
as
that
above
allude
to
be
entirely
unusual
and
exceptional
among
englishman
engage
in
pioneer
work
in
africa
i
believe
no
nation
have
surpass
the
english
in
tone
temper
and
principle
in
deal
with
the
n
ro
race
on
the
other
hand
there
have
be
many
english
explorer
from
my
revere
master
david
livingstone
down
to
my
own
com
rades
in
the
advance
guard
of
this
last
expedition
who
have
united
in
quite
a
singular
degree
gentleness
with
valour
for
myself
i
lay
no
claim
to
any
exceptional
fineness
of
nature
but
i
say
begin
life
as
a
rough
ill
educate
impatient
man
i
have
found
my
school
in
these
very
african
experience
which
be
now
say
by
some
to
be
in
themselves
detrimental
to
european
character
i
have
learnt
by
actual
stress
of
imminent
danger
in
the
first
place
that
self
control
be
more
indispensable
than
gunpowder
and
in
the
second
place
that
persistent
self
control
under
the
provocation
of
african
travel
be
impossible
without
real
heartfelt
sympathy
for
the
native
with
whom
one
have
to
deal
if
one
r
ards
these
native
as
mere
brute
then
the
annoyance
that
their
folly
and
vice
inflict
be
indeed
intolerable
in
order
to
rule
them
and
to
keep
one
life
amongst
them
it
be
needful
resolutely
to
regard
them
as
child
who
require
indeed
different
method
of
rule
from
english
or
american
citizen
but
who
must
be
rule
in
precisely
the
same
spirit
with
the
same
absence
of
caprice
and
anger
the
same
essential
reject
to
our
fellow
men
in
proof
of
the
fact
that
british
explorer
as
a
whole
have
learnt
these
lesson
i
would
point
simply
to
the
actual
state
of
british
influence
in
africa
that
influence
believe
me
could
neither
have
be
acquire
nor
maintain
by
physical
force
alone
so
long
as
englishman
in
africa
continue
in
the
future
the
conduct
which
have
on
the
whole
distinguish
them
in
the
past
i
fear
for
them
no
rivalry
in
the
great
work
of
tropical
civilisation
a
work
which
cannot
be
successfully
carry
out
in
the
commercial
and
still
less
in
the
military
spirit
alone
it
be
only
by
shew
ourselves
superior
to
the
savage
not
only
in
the
power
of
inflict
death
but
in
the
whole
manner
of
regard
life
that
we
can
attain
that
control
over
them
which
in
their
present
stage
be
necessary
to
their
own
welfare
even
more
than
to
ours
africa

not
by
timid
hindoo
or
puny
australian
aborigine
but
by
million
of
robust
courageous
men
it
be
no
cant
or
sentimentalism
it
be
an
obvious
dictate
of
ordinary
prudence
to
say
that
if
we
be
to
hold
these
men
in
such
control
as
shall
make
africa
equal
to
any
continent
in
serviceableness
to
mankind
at
lai
e
it
be
by
moral
superiority
first
of
all
that
control
must
be
won
and
must

to
his
lieutenant

and

a

against

and
take
away

the
officer
each
in
turn
be
summon
to
the
scene
make
a
hot
defence
in
such
language
and
manner
that
stanley
dismiss
them
from
the
expedition
on
the
spot
one
of
their
brotihier
officer
intercede
and
be
told
that
the
lieutenant
disrespect
be
evidently
the
culmination
of
secret
disaffection
and
grumbiing
stanley
say
to
them
never
a
sail
ship
sail
from
a
port
but
some
of
the
crew
have
take
the
first
opportunity
to
try
it
on
with
the
captain
in
every
group
or
band
of
men
it
appear
to
be
a
rule
that
there
must
be
a
struggle
for
mastery
and
an
attempt
to
take
the
leader
measure
before
they
can
settle
down
to
their
proper
position
i
hope
you
who
remain
will
understand
that
there
can
be
only
one
chief
in
command
in
this
expedition
and
i
be
that
chief
and
in
all
matter
of
duty
i
expect
implicit
obedience
and
respect
thus
stanley
address
his
officer
the
two
who
have
offend
make
manly
apology
which
be
accepted
and
they
be
re
store
to
their
place
with
the
handshake
of
reconciliation
the
incident
terminate
so
far
as
stanley
be
concerned
but
what
he
call
stupid
personality
in
certain
publish
diary
move
him
to
write
out
his
own
full
and
private
statement
of
this
and
some
later
fiction
which
there
seem
no
occasion
now
to
reproduce
but
we
be
indebted
to
it
for
some
portraiture
as
wdl
as
for
an
eroosition
of
the
social
and
individual
experience
generate
in
the
african
wild
which
may
well
be
give
here
for
one
so
young

ability

sterling
sense
be
remarkable
and
in
military
pliancy
at
the
word
of
commsind
he
be
a
bom
soldier
this
be
a
merit
whidi
be
inestimable
in
a
tropical
country
where
duty
have
to
be
do
a
leader
in
a
climate
like
that
of
africa
cannot
sugar
coat
his
order
and
a
certain
directness
of

must
be
expect
under
such

when
a

with
his
unsophisticated

it
be
impossible
to
bear
a
grudge
against
him
outside
of
his
profession
he
be
not
so
experienced
as
stair
when
place
in
chaise
of
a
company
his
muster
book
soon
fell
into
confusion
but
by
the
erasure
and
re
arrangement
it
be
evident
that
he
do
his
best
such
men
may
blunder
over
and
over
again
and
receive
absolution
he
possess
a

of
genuine
wit
and
humour
and
the
innocent
pleasure
he
show
when
he
brought
snules
to
our
face
endear
him
to
me
this
childlike
naivete
which
distinguish
him

as
in

have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
afifectionateness
with
which
everyone
regard
him
but
he
be
super
excellent
among
the
sick
and
suffer
then
his
every
action
become
precise
firm
and
masterful
there
be
no
shade
of
doubt
on
his
face
not
a
quiver
of
his
nerve
his
eye
grow
luminous
with
his
concentrate
mind
few
people
at

know
what
an

grows
as

as

it
destroys
the

discloses
the

sinew
and
have
penetrate
to
the

consumes
it
and
then
eats
its
way
round
the
limb
the
sight
be
awful
the
stench
be
horrible
yet
parke

from
twenty

at

could
take
off
my

out
of
pure
reverence
to
his
heroism
skill
and
endure
patience
when

be
wound
with
a
poison
arrow
he
deliberately
suck
it
though
have
the
poison
be

it
might
have
be
a
highly
dangerous
proceed
all
the
white
pass
through
h
hand
and
if
they
do
not
owe
their

to

they
owe
him
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
for
relief
ease
and
encouragement
as
well
as
incomparable
nursing

food
for
an

for
such
prolong

to
maintain
his
tenderness

in

fractious

be
a
constant
marvel
to
me

often
press
on
me
could
the
wound

sick
zanzibaris
have
spoken
their
opinion
of
him
they
would
have
say
he
be
not
a
man
but
an
angel
for
the
attribute
he
show
to
the
suffer
be
so
unusually
noble
and
exquisitely
tender
that
poor
wayward
human
nature
wore
for
once
a
divine
aspect
to
them
and
jephson
so
honourable
and
high
mind
though
of
a
vehement
character
at
first
one
of
his
intelligence
and
heart
be
not
long
in
adapt
himself
to
circumstance
he
developed
quickly
take
the
rough
work
of
a
pioneer
with
the
indifference
of
a
veteran
he
be
endow
with
a
great
stock
of
physical
energy
than
any
of
the
others
and
exhibit
most
remarkable
endurance
at
first
i
fear
that
he
be
inclined
to
be
too
rough
on
his
company
but
this
be
before
he
master
the
colloquial
expression
which
with
old
traveller
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
stick
when
a
young
englishman
replete
with
animal
vigour
and
brace
for
serious
work
have
to
lead
a
hundred

so
raw

who
cannot
understand
a

he
say
a
good
deal
of
ungentle
hustle
must
be
expect
but
as
soon
as
he
be
able
to
express
himself
in
the
vernacular
both
commander
and
native
soon
lose
that
morbid
fault
find
to
which
they
be
formerly
dispose
and
the
stick
becomes
a
mere
badge
of
authority
chaff
or
a
little
mild
malice
spice
with
humour
be
often
more
powerful
than
the
rod
with
african
by
the
time
we
issue
from
the
forest
jephson
have
become
a
most
valuable
officer
with
his
strong
brave
and
resolute
nature
capable
for
any
work
if
i
be
to
sum
up
the
character
of
jephson
in
one
word
i
should
say
it
be
one
of
fine
manliness
and
courage
nelson
also
be
a
fine
fellow
with
whom
i
do
not
remember
to
have
have
a
single
misunderstand
consider
that
we
be
a
thousand
and
thirty
day
together
in
africa
and
in
the
gloomiest
part
of
it
for
most
of
that
time
it
appear
to
me
wonderful
that
we
pull
tc
ether
so
well
india
be
a
very
old
land
and
provide
countless
aid
to
comfort
which
be
a
great
balm
for
trouble
yet
as
the
congo
climate
be
more
try
than
that
of
india
and
be
quite
barren
of
the
comfort
which
be
suppose
to
sweeten
an
englishman
temper
it
ought
not
to
be
expect
that
five
englishman
should
have
be
able
to
pierce
through
darkest
africa
without
a
tiff
or
two
as
the
precede
chapter
record
all
the
misunderstanding
that
occur
between
us
i
felt
justified
on
reach
the
sea
in
say
well
do
to
each
of
them
not
even
a
saint
be
proof
against
a
congest
liver
and
a
miserable
diet
of
horse
food
and
animal
provender
and
yet
during
their
severe
experience
of
the
forest
the
officer
be
in
well
temper
than
when
ascend
the
congo
they
enjoy
regular
meal
the
toughest
human
patience
may
be
stretch
to
break
when

be
rioting
in

when
the

that
my

i
upon
the
strength
of

acquaintance
i
found
that
the
young

be
apt
to
become
overweening
miliar
and
oblivious
of
etiquette
and
discipline
from
that
date
i
take
to
living
alone
by
which
my
judgement
of

be
in
no
danger
of
be
bias
by
their
convivial
discourse
and
i
be
preserve
from
the
contempt
which
too
often
proceeds
from
familiarity
no
doubt
i
be
debar
by
this
isolation
from
much
that
be
entertain
and
innocent
as
well
as
deprive
of
that
instruction
which
simple
youngster
of
the
jolly
and
silly
age
be
prone
to
impart
to
their
senior
but
that
be
my
loss
not
theirs
on
the
other
hand
my
opinion
of
them
be
not
likely
to
be
tincture
by
malicious
gossip
which
be
generally
outspoken
at
a
din
table
or
in
a
camp
and
i
certainly
discountenance
grumbler
and
caviller
on
an
african
expedition
there
often
arises
a
necessity
for
sudden
order
which
must
be
follow
by
prompt
obedience
and
the
stem
voice
and
peremptory
manner
at
such
time
be
apt
to
jar
on
the
nerve
of
a
subaltern
whose
joke
be
lately
receive
with
laughter
unless
he
be
one
whose
temper
be
control
by
his
judgement
when
a
young
white
officer
quits
england
for
the
first
time
to
lead
black
he
have
get
to
learn
and
unlearn
a
great
deal
all
that
he
know
be
his
mother
tongue
and
the
art
of
reading
write
and
criticise
in
africa
he
find
himself
face
to
face
with
a
new
people
of
different
manner
and
custom
with
whom
he
cannot
exchange
a
word
he
can
do
nothing
for
himself
there
be
no
service
that
he
can
do
with
his
arm
he
cannot
even
cook
his
food
or
set
up
his
tent
or
carry
his
bed
he
have
to
depend
on
the
black
men
for
everything
but
if
he
have
a
patient
temper
and
self
control
he
can
take
instruction
from
those
who
know
the
native
and
in
many
little
way
he
can
make
himself
useful
if
he
be
faultfinding
proud
and
touchy
it
will
be
month
before
he
be
worth
his
salt
in
these
early
day
he
must
undeceive
himself
as
to
his
merit
and
learn
that
if
he
be
humour
and
pet
more
than
the
black
it
be
not
because
of
his
white
skin
but
because
of
his
childish
helplessness
and
in
the
hope
that
when
his
eighteen
month
apprenticehip
be
over
he
will
begin
to
show
that
his
keep
be
to
some
purpose
we
must
have
white
men
in
africa
but
the
raw
white
be
as
great
a
nuisance
there
during
the
first
year
as
a
military
recruit
who
never
saw
a
gun
till
he
enlist
in
the
second
year
he
begin
to
mend
during
the
third
year
if
his
nature
permit
it
he
have
developed
into
a
superior
man
whose
intelligence
may
be
of
transcendent
utility
for
direct
mass
of
inferior
men
i
speak
from
a
wide
experience
of
white
men
whom
i
have
have
under
me
in
africa
one
cannot
be
always
expostulate
with
them
or
court
their
affection
and
soothe
their
amour
propre
but
their
excessive
susceptibility
while
their
body
be
be
harrow
by
the
stem
process
of
acclimatization
require
great
forbearance
it
take
the
officer
some
month
to
learn
that
when
they
stood
at
the
head
of
their
company
and
i
repeat
for
the
benefit
of
the
native
in
their
own
language
the
order
already
give
to
them
in
english
i
be
not
speak
about
themselves
by
and
by
as
they
picked
up
a
word
or
two
of
the
native
language
they
become
less
suspicious
and
be
able
to
distinguish
between
directness
of
speech
and
an
affront
i
of
course
knew
that
their
follower
whom
they
have
regard
as
merely
naked
nigger
be
faithful
willing
hard
work
creature
who
only
want
fair
treatment
and
good
food
to
make
them
love
able
at
this
early
period
my
officer
be
possess
with
the
notion
that
my
manner
be
hard
because
i
have
not
many
compliment
for
them
that
be
a
kind
of
pap
which
we
may
offer
woman
and
boy
but
it
be
not
necessary
for
soldier
and
men
unless
it
be
deserve
it
be
true
that
in
the
forest
their
demeanour
be
heroic
but
i
prefer
to
wait
until
we
be
out
of
it
before
tell
them
my
opinion
just
as
wage
be
paid
after
the
work
be
finish
and
an
epitaph
be
best
write
at
the
close
of
life
besides
i
thought
they
be
superior
nature
and
require
none
of
that
encouragement
which
the
more
childish
black
almost
daily
receive
in
think
of
my
own
conduct
i
be
at
a
disadvantagei
as
there
be
no
likelihood
that
i
should
appear
to
others
as
i
appear
to
myself
i
may
have
be
in
the
habit
of
give
unmeasured
offence
each
day
by
my
exclusiveness
but
i
be
simply
carry
out
what
african
experience
have
taught
me
be
best
my
companion
have
more
to
learn
from
me
than
i
have
to
learn
from
them
for
the
first
eighteen
month
they
mess
together
but
during
the
latter
half
of
the
journey
they
also
live
apart
experience
have
taught
them
the
same
lesson
as
i
have
learn
to
some
my
solitary
life
might
present
a
cheerless
aspect
but
it
be
not
so
in
reality
the
physical
exercise
of
the
day

a
pleasant
sense
of
fatigue
and
my
endless
occupation

too

and
interest
to
allow
room
for
baser
thought
there
be
a
strange
poverty
about
our
existence
which
could
not
well

anywhere
the
climate
give
warmth
and
so
we
need
no
fuel

for

only
be

presentable

an

be
not

my

that
my

so
greatly
distinguish
themselves
i

frequently

ask
as

whether
i
never

the
time
when
the

away

death
by

no
i
do
not
despair
but
as
i
be
not
wholly
free
from
morbid
thought
i
may
be
say
to
have
be
on
the
edge
of
it
for
quite
two
month
how
will
all
this
end
be
a
question
that
i
be
compel
to
ask
myself
over
and
over
again
and
then
my
mind
would
speculate

by
if
we

to
find
substantial
food
even
the

must
cease
their

pas
away

the

men
no

a

the

wrench

down

will
lie
to

as
i
thought
of
this

the
chief
feel
i
think
be
one
of
pity
that
so
much
unselfish
effort
should
finish
in
a
heap
of
notiiingness
i
should
not
venture
to
say
that
my
comrade
share
in
such
thought
i
could
see
that
they
be
anxious
and
that
they
would
prefer
a
good
loaf
of
bread
to
the
best
sermon
but
their
face
betrayed
no
melancholy
gravity
such
as
follow
morbid
speculation
probably
the
four
bmve
young
heart
together
manage
to
be
more
cheerful
than
i
who
be
solitary
and
thus
they
be
able
to
cheat
their
mind
out
of
any
disposition
to
brood
while
however
one
part
of
my
nature
dwelt
upon
stem
possibility
and
analyse
with
painful
minuteness
the
sensation
of
those
who
daily
perish
from
hunger
another
part
of
me
w

excessively
defiant

in

fertile
in
expedient
to
extricate
the
expedition
from
its
impend
fate
and
be
often
for
no
know
reason
exhilarant
with
prescience
of
ultimate
triumph
one
half
of
me
felt
quite
ready
to
seek
a
recess
in
the
wood
when
the
time
would
come
the
other
half
be
aggressive
and
obstinately
bent
upon
not
yield
and
unceasingly
alert
day
and
night
in
seek
method
to
rescue
us
all
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
time
have
come
to
pray
and
submit
but
i
still
felt
rebellious
and

stratagem

into

before

a

farewell

i

to

the
splendid
energy
with
which
jephson
hasten
to
the

of
his
poor
comrade
along
a
track
strewn
with
the
ghastly
relic
of
humanity

the
strong

patient
endurance
of
nelson
who
for
week
be
condemn
to
sit
alone
amid
the

come
the

of
parke

together
to
struggle
for
month
against
the
worry
band
of
manyuema

fitful
temper
and

would
have

one

of
the

a

those
of

who
still

would

who
put
the
crown

cop
stone
on
the
edifice
of
african
exploration
and
so
complete
the
task
begin
twenty
four
century
ago
with
the
voyage
of
king
necho
phcenician
captain
and
the
periplus
of
hanno
it
be
stanley
who
gather
up
the
thread
brought
together
the
loose
end
and
united
the
discovery
of
his
predecessor
into
one
coherent
and
connect
whole
he
link
the
result
of
livingstone
exploration
with
those
of
speke
and
grant
and
burton
and
so
enable
the
great
lacustrine
and
riverine
system
of
equatorial
africa
to
become
intelligible
without
him
the
work
of
his
most
illustrious
predecessor
might
still
have
remain
only
a
collection
of
splendid
fragment
stanley
exhibit
their
true
relation
to
one
another
and
show
what
they
meant
he
be
the
great
we
may
say
the
final
systematiser
of
african
geography
and
his
achievement
in
this
respect
can
neither
be
supersede
nor
surpass
if
only
because
the
opportunity
exists
no
longer
as
a
fact
stanley
not
only
complete
but
he
also
correct
the
chief
of
all
livingstone
discovery
the
missionary
traveller
be
steadily
convinc
that
the
nile
take
its
rise
in
lake
tanganyika
or
rather
that
it
pass
right
through
that
inland
sea
stanley
when
he
have
found
the
doctor
and
restore
the
weary
old
man
spirit
and
confidence
induced
him
to
join
in
an
exploration
trip
round
the
north
end
of
tanganyika
which
prove
that
there
be
no
river
flow
out
of
the
lake
and
therefore
that
no
connection
be
possible
widi
the
nile
system
but
livingstone
still
believe
that
he
be
on
the
track
of
the
great
egyptian
stream
he
persist
in
r
arding
his
lualaba
as
one
of
the
feeder
of
the
nile
and
he
be
in
search
of
the
three
fountain
of
herodotus
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lake
bangweolo
when
he
make
his
last
journey
it
be
reserve
for
stanley
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
the
lualaba
and
to
identify
it
with
the
mighty
watercourse
which
after
cross
the
equator
empty
itself
not
into
the
mediterranean
but
into
the
south
atlantic
stanley
r
arded
himself
and
rightly
as
the
geographical
l
atee
and
executor
of
livingstone
from
the
scottish
missionary
during
those
four
month
spent
in
his
company
in
the
autumn
of
the
young
adventurer
acquire
the
passion
for
exploration
and
the
determination
to
clear
up
the
unsolved
enigma
of
the
dark
continent
before
that
he
do
not
seem
to
have
be
especially
captivate
by
the
geographical
and
scientific
side
of
travel
he
like
visit
strange
country
because
he
be
a
shrewd
observer
with
a
lively
journalistic
style
which
could
be
profitably
employ
in
describe
people
and
place
but
the
find
of
livingstone
make
stanley
an
explorer
and
his
own
nature
make
him
in
a
sense
a
missionary
though
not
quite
of
the
livingstone
kind
he
be
a
man
who
be
happiest
when
he
have
a
mission
to
accomplish
some
great
work
entrust
to
him
which
have
to
be
get
through
despite
of
difficulty
and
danger
and
when
the
famous
travdler
laid
down
his
tire
bone
in
the
wilderness
stanley
felt
that
it
be
decreed
for
him
to
carry
on
the
work
so
he
have
say
himself
in
the
opening
passage
of
the
book
in
which
he
described
the
voyage
down
the
congo
when
he
return
to
england
in
after
the
ashanti
war
it
be
to
learn
that
livingstone
be
dead
the
effect
which
this
news
have
upon
me
after
the
first
shock
have
pass
away
be
to
fire
me
with
a
resolution
to
complete
his
work
to
be
if
god
will
it
the
next
martyr
to
geographical
science
or
if
my
life
be
to
be
spar
to
dear
up
not
o
y
the
secret
of
the
great
river
throughout
its
course
but
also
all
that
remain
still
problematic
and
incomplete
of
the
discovery
of
burton
and
speke
and
speke
and
grant
the
solemn
day
of
the
burial
of
the
body
of
my
great
friend
arrive
i
be
one
of
the
pall
bearer
in
westminster
abbey
and
when
i
have
see
the
coffin
lower
into
the
grave
and
have
heard
the
first
handful
of
earth
thrown
over
it
i
walk
away
sorrow
over
the
fall
of
david
livingstone
there
must
have
be
some
among
those
present
at
the
memorial
service
in
westminster
abbey
on
may
who
recall
these
simply
impressive
word
and
they
may
have
wonder
why
the
great
englishman
who
uttered
them
be
not
to
lie
with
the
great
dead
of
england
at
livingstone
side
it
be
not
merely
on
geographical
science
that
stanley
have
left
a
permanent
impress
so
that
while
civilise
record
last
his
name
can
no
more
be
forgotten
than
those
of
columbus
and
the
cabot
of
hudson
and
bartolomeo
diaz
his
life
have
have
a
last
effect
upon
the
course
of
international
politics
the
partition
of
africa
and
its
definite
division
into
formal
area
of
administration
or
influence
might
have
be
delayed
for
many
decade
but
for
his
sudden
and
startle
revelation
of
the
interior
of
the
continent
he
initiate
unconsciously
no
doubt
and
involuntarily
the
scramble
for
africa
in
which
germany
france
great
britain
italy
belgium
and
portugal
have
take
part
the
opening
up
of
the
congo
region
by
his
two
great
expedition
of
precipitate
a
result
which
may
have
be
ultimately
inevitable
but
would
perhaps
have
be
long
delayed
without
his
quicken
touch
the
political
map
of
africa
as
it
now
appear
and
be
likely
to
appear
for
many
generation
to
come
be
not
the
work
of
stanley
but
without
stanley
it
would
not
have
assume
its
present
shape
his
place
be
among
those
who
have
set
the
landmark
of
nation
and
mould
their
destiny
when
you
converse
with
him
at
least
in
his
later
year
you
easily
discover
that
he
have
a
firm
grasp
of
the
general
sequence
of
european
and
oriental
history
and
a
considerable
insight
into
modem
ethnological
and
archaeological
learn
he
have
form
independent
and
original
idea
of
his
own
on
these
subject
and
when
he
talk
as
he
sometimes
would
of
the
sabasans
and
the
phoenician
and
the
early
arab
voyager
you
saw
that
to
the
rapid
observation
of
the
man
of
action
he
have
add
much
of
the
system
atising
and
deductive
faculty
of
the
scholar
he
possess
the
instinct
of
arrangement
which
be
the
foundation
of
all
true
scholarship
and
perhaps
of
all
great
practical
achievement
as
well
his
intellectual
power
be
i
think
seldom
appreciate
at
its
true
value
its
full
measure
be
not
give
in
his
book
in
spite
of
their
vigorous
style
their
dramatic
method
of
narration
and
their
brilliant
pictorial
passage
but
nearly
everything
he
write
be
in
the
nature
of
rather
hurry
journalism
the
main
object
of
which
be
to
explain
what
have
happen
or
to
describe
what
have
be
see
not
in
these
graphic
volume
but
in
the
achievement
which
give
rise
to
them
be
stanley
mental
capacity
make
manifest
he
be
not
only
a
born
commander
prompt
dare
undaunted
irresistible
but
also
a
great
administrator
a
great
practical
thinker
he
thought
out
his
problem
with
slow
thorough
patience
examine
every
aspect
of
them
and
consider
all
the
possible
alternative
so
that
when
the
time
come
for
action
he
knew
what
to
do
and
have
no
need
to
hesitate
his
fiery
sudden
deed
be
more
often
the
result
of
a
long
process
of
thought
than
of
a
rapid
inspiration
the
new
york
correspondent
of
the
time
who
knew
him
well
tell
an
illustrative
story
he
and
his
whole
party
have
embark
on
lake
tanganyika
know
that
the
bank
be
people
some
with
friendly
some
with
hostile
tribe
his
canoe
move
on
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
near
shore
sometimes
the
friendly
people
come
off
to
sell
their
boat
load
of
v
etables
and
fruit
but
suppose
they
be
not
friendly
say
stanley
to
himsdf
then
what
so
one
day
there
approach
a
fleet
of
canoe
with
all
the
usual
sign
of
friendly
commerce
they
be
pile
high
with
banana
i
thought
say
stanley
they
have
a
large
supply
and
the
boat
be
deep
in
the
water
still
there
be
nothing
that
look
reauy
suspicious
there
be
just
men
enough
to
paddle
the
canoe
no
more
i
let
them
come
close
but
i
kept
my
eye
on
them
and
my
hand
on
the
trigger
of
my
elephant
gun
they
be
but
a
few
yard
off
when
i
saw
a
heap
of
banana
stir
i
fire
instantly
and
instantly
the
water
be
black
with
hundred
of
arm
black
men
who
have
be
hidden
beneath
the
banana
heap
i
do
not
think
many
of
them
get
ashore
if
i
have
stop
to
think
they
would
have
be
aboard
us
and
it
be
we
who
should
not
have
get
ashore
but
i
have
do
my
thinkii
before
they
come
near
similarly
he
spoke
of
gordon
end
if
he
say
i
have
be
aent
to
get
the
khartoum
garrison
away
i
should
have
thought
of
that
and
nothing
else
i
should
have
calculate
the
chance
make
out
exactly
what
resistance
i
would
have
to
encounter
and
how
it
could
be
overcome
and
laid
all
my
plan
with
the
single
object
of
accomplish
my
purpose
i
believe
though
he
do
not
say
so
that
he
thought
the
retreat
could
have
be
effect
or
the
town
held
till
the
relief
column
arrive
if
proper
measure
have
be
take
and
the
one
definite
aim
have
be
kept
steadily
in
view
all
the
time
that
be
his
principle
of
action
when
he
have
an
object
to
fulfil
a
commission
to
carry
out
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
till
the
work
be
do
difficulty
toil
hardship
sacrifice
of
all
kind
of
time
of
men
of
money
be
only
incident
in
the
journey
that
lead
to
a
goal
to
be
reach
if
human
endeavour
could
gain
it
no
honour
he
write
no
reward
however
great
can
be
equal
to
the
subtle
satisfaction
that
a
man
feel
when
he
can
point
to
his
work
and
say
see
now
the
task
i
promise
you
to
perform
with
all
loyalty
and
honesty
with
might
and
main
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability
be
to
day
finish
this
be
the
prime
article
in
stanley
confession
of
faith
to
do
the
work
to
which
he
have
set
his
hand
and
in
do
it
like
tennyson
ulysses
to
strive
to
seek
to
find
and
not
to
yield
both
aspect
of
his
character
the
practical
and
the
intellectual
be
reveal
in
the
two
great

the

the

remarkable
if
judged
by

in
the

of

which
place
stanley
reputation
as
a

and
discoverer
on
the
high
pinnacle
it
be
not
an
unassailed
reputation
much
be
say
about
his
high
hand
method
and
many
good
people
in

those
good
people
who
sit
still
in
easy
chain
and
damn
the
geneial
world
for
stand
up
chose
to
regard
him
as
a
sort
of
filibuster
they
contrast
his
method
with
those
of
some
of
his
predecessor
and
contemporary
who
have
contrive
to
spend
year
in
africa
without
fight
and
bloodshed
but
they
do
not
allow
for
the
difference
in
the
condition
most
of
the
other
traveller
have
be
the
sport
of
circumstance
they
have
wander
from
place
to
place
turn
from
their
course
again
and
again
by
hostile
tribe
and
churlish
chief
they
found
out
a
great
deal
but
not
as
a
rule
that
which
they
come
to
find
their
discovery
be
largely
accidental
even
livingstone
be
constantly
deflect
from
his
route
and
be
unable
to
pursue
to
its
conclusion
the
plan
of
trace
the
central
watershed
which
he
have
set
before
himself
stanley
have
a
perfectiy
definite
purpose
which
he
determine
to
carry
out
and
he
succeed
his
scheme
involve
passing
through
an
immense
region
inhabit
by
a
comparatively
numerous
population
of
a
high
type
than
those
encounter
nearer
the
coast
more
energetic
and
more
warlike
as
a
rule
he
make
his
way
among
them
by
bargain
and
negotiation
but
sometimes
he
have
to
fight
or
to
turn
back
and
he
accepted
the
sterner
alternative
if
he
have
refuse
to
do
so
he
could
not
have
reach
his
goal
the
expedition
might
still
have
add
enormously
to
the
sum
of
scientific
knowledge
but
in
the
achievement
of
its
ultimate
and
clearly
conceive
object
it
would
have
be
a
failure
stanley
do
not
mean
that
it
should
fail
he
be
always
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
and
when
necessary
he
be
prepared
as
great
men
who
do
great
deed
must
be
to
sacrifice
others
but
there
be
never
the
small
justification
for
represent
him
as
a
ruthless
iron
hand
kind
of
privateer
on
land
who
use
the
scourge
and
the
bullet
with
callous
recklessness
there
be
nothing
reckless
about
stanley
except
at
time
his
speech
in
action
he
be
swift
and
bold
but
not
careless
to
inflict
superfluous
suffer
to
shoot
and
slay
without
think
of
the
consequence
this
be
utterly
alien
to
his
systematic
calculate
method
he
would
do
it
if
there
seem
no
other
mean
of
gain
the
end
as
a
general
would
order
a
colunm
to
destruction
to
save
his
army
and
win
a
victory
but
he
be
essentially
a
humane
man
masterful
and
domineer
and
yet
aufond
gentle
and
kindly
particularly
to
the
weak
and
suffer
opposition
sti
fened
the
obstinate
will
to
resistance
he
be
not
a
safe
person
to
thwart
even
in
small
matter
he
remember
a
benefit
and
he
do
not
forget
an
injury
it
be
say
that
he
be
unforgiving
and
perhaps
there
be
something
in
the
charge
in
his
intense
self
contain
nature
wound
rankle
long
and
he
have
little
of
that
talent
for
oblivion
which
be
so
easily
developed
among
comfortable
people
whose
emotion
and
experience
have
never
be
poignant
enough
to
disturb
their
peace
of
mind
one
who
knew
stanley
well
and
study
him
with
an
eye
at
once
penetrate
and
friendly
believe
that
through
life
he
bore
the
characteristic
trace
of
his
cymric
origin
he
have
the
welsh
peasant
quickness
of
temper
his
warmth
of
affection
his
resentfulness
when
wrong
his
pugnacity
and
his
code
of
ethic
ultimately
derive
from
john
calvin
welsh
protestantism
be
base
on
a
conscientious
study
of
the
biblical
text
stanley
carry
his
bible
with
him
through
life
and
he
read
it
constantly
but
i
should
imagine
that
he
be
less
affected
by
the
new
testament
than
by
the
prophetic
and
historical
book
of
the
hebraic
scripture
he
believe
profoundly
in
the
divine
order
of
the

but
he
be
equally

that
the

that
could
be

that

on

that
the

there
should
be

stanley

it
be
no

of
stanley
if
the
work
have

carry

if
the

not

have
not

stanley
be
in

no

there
be
no

no
sav

if
he
have
be
permit
to
remain
a
few
year
longer
the
advance
of
the
congo
state
might
have
be
more
rapid
particularly
if
he
could
have
be
second
by
subordinate
with
a
high
inherit
capacity
for
ruling
inferior
race
than
belgian
could
be
expect
to

it
be
a
cause
of
regret
to
him
i
believe
that
england
do
not
take
a
large
share
in
this
international
enterprise
but
england
for
long
ignore
or
belittle
the
work
that
stanley
do
it
be
not
till
public
opinion
throughout
the
anglo
saxon
and
latin
world
have
acclaim
him
a
hero
tiiat
the
govern
element
recognise
something
of
his
greatness
and
to
the
very
last
its
recognition
be
guard
and
grudge
one
might
have
suppose
that
his
service
would
have
be
enlist
for
the
empire
in
when
he
come
back
from
die
congo
he
be
in
die
prime
of
life
he
be
full
of
vigour
he
have
prove
his
capacity
as
a
leader
a
ruler
and
a
gon
emor
who
have
few
living
equal
one
think
that
employment
worthy
of
his
power
should
have
be
press
upon
hun
but
the
country
which
left
burton
to
eat
out
his
fiery
heart
in
a
second
rate
consulship
and
never
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
gordon
could
not
find
a
suitable
post
for
stanley
i
do
not
imagine
he
sought
anything
of
the
kind
but
it
seem
strange
that
it
be
not
offer
and
on
such
term
that
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
refuse
if
hehad
be
entrust
with
some
worthy
imperial
commission
he
might
have
beeai
save
from
the
fifth
and
least
fortunate
ot
his
journey
into
the
interior
of
africa
nothing
that
stanley
ever
do
spoke
more
loudly
for
his
courage
his
resourcefulness
and
his
heroic
endurance
than
the
expedition
for
the
relief
of
emin
pasha
none
but
a
man
of
his
iron
resolution
could
have
carry
through
those
awful
march
and
counter
march
in
the
tropical
forest
and
along
the
bank
of
the
aruwimi
but
the
suffer
and
privation
be
incur
for
an
inadequate
object
and
a
cause

no

they

that

may
hope
of

no

tender
and
perhaps
if
c
ered
it
could
not
have
be
accepted
but
stanley
found
plenty
of
occupation
he
write
he
lecture
and
he
assist
the
king
of
the
belgian
with
advice
on
the
affair
of
his

he
be
in

for
five

he
take
some

reaceful
those
who
knew
him
only
in

closing

him

with
something
of
the
former
nervous
sdf
assertive
vitality
replace
by
a
mellow

mature
wisdom
whether
there
be
much
more
than
an
external
contrast
between
the
stanley
of

earlier
and
him
of
the
later
period
i
be
unable
to
say
but
one
may
suggest
that
the
change
be
in
the
nature
of
a

do
any
man

which
one
note
in
stanley
in
his
last
decade
could
have
be
merely
the
fruit
erf
leisure
and
domestic
happiness
no
doubt
the
strand
be
always
in
his
nature
though
perhaps
not
easily
detect

the

it

nothing

to
fill
in
the
detail
this
be
a
magnificent
achievement
for
one
man
to
have

stanley
must
always
stand
out
as
have
do
more
than
any

to

stanley
not

add

to
it
by

the

no
more
slaughter
innocent

as
he
do
before
he
no
more
disowns
and
disinherits
in
a
moment
an
old

powerful

set
up
a

of

with
the

as
the

them
one
cannot

feel
thankful
to

for
the
mighty
change
after
the

writes
i
must
say
that
i
much
enjoy
mr
stanley
company
during
the
short
stay
here
he
be
a
man
of
an
iron
will

sound
judgement

besides
be
most
patient
with
the

he
never
allows
any
one
of
his
follower
to
oppress

even
insult
a

if
he
have
have
occasionally
to
use
force
in
order
to
effect
a
passage
i
be
certain
that
he
only
resort
to
arm
when
all
other
mean
fail
stanley
recognise
and
appreciate
in
mackay
a
spirit
akin
to
livingstone
he
judged
that
he
have
dangerously
overtaxed
his
strength
and
urge
him
to
go
away
with
him
and
secure
a
rest

mackay
would
not
leave
his
post

within
half
a
year
he
succumbed
to
disease
do
space
permit
a
chapter
might
well
be
give
to
stanley

for

on
the
development

that
at

he
thought
the

possible
for

one
other
trait
of
his
african
work
may
be
mention
in
a
pecuniary
sense
u
be
absolutdy
disinterested
he
would
never
take
the
slightest
personal
advantage
of
the
commercial
opportunity
incident
to
die
opening
of
the
new
country
on
the
congo
or
in
uganda
i
desire
to
emphasise
the
fact
that
such
property
as
he
have
come
almost
entirely
from
his
book
and
his
lecture
he
give
his
assistance
to
the
establishment
of
the
british
east
african
company
because
he
believe
in
its
influence
for
good
but
he
decline
any
pecuniary
interest
when
the
congo
railway
stock
be
pay
very
high
dividend
he
be
ask
why
he
do
not
take
some
of
it
and
he
answer
that
he
would
not
have
even
the
appearance
of
peraonal
profit
out
of
africa
when
prince
and
potentate
make
advantageous
offen
to
him
they

quietly
put
aside

an

have
aggrandise
england

ask
playfully
why
do
not
pr
m
take
some
of
the
comer
lot
in
africa
stanley
put
the
question
by
and
afterwards
say
that
way
may
be
very
well
for
him
but
for
myself
i
prefer
my
way
when
the
retention
of
uganda
be
under
discussion
lord
salifr
bury
say
publicly
it
be
natural
that
mr
stanley
should
favour
the
retention
for
we
all
know
that
he
have
interest
in
africa
stanley
take
the
early
occasion
to
say
publicly
it
be
true
but
not
in
the
sordid
sense
in
which
the
imputation
have
be
make
my
whole
interest
there
be
far
africa
herself
and

humamly
chapter

again
there
be
a
charm
attach
to
the
great
forest
that
be
only
reveal
to
me
after
it
have
drop
beyond
the
horizon
i
have
found
that
a
certain
amount
of
determination
be
necessary
to
enter
it
the
longer
i
hesitate
the
blacker
grow
its
tower
wall
and
its
aspect
more
sinister
my
imagination
begin
to
eat
into
my
will
and
consume
my
resolution
but
when
all
the
virtue
in
me
rise
in
hot
indignation
against
such
pusillanimity
i
left
the
pleasant
day
and
we
enter
as
into
a
tomb
i
found
it
difficult
to
accustom
myself
to
its
gloom
and
its
pallid
solitude
i
could
find
no
comfort
for
the
inner
man
or
solace
for
the
spirit
it
become
impressed
on
me
that
it
be
wholly
unfit
for
gregarious
man
who
love
to
see
something
that
appertains
to
humanity
in
his
surroundings
a
man
can
look
into
the
face
of
the
sun
and
call
him
father
the
moon
can
be
compare
to
a
mistress
the
star
to
soul
of
the
dear
depart
and
the
sky
to
our
heavenly
home
but
when
man
be
sunk
in
the
depth
of
a
cold
tomb
how
can
he
sing
or
feel
glad
after
i
have
get
well
out
of
it
however
and
have
be
warm
through
and
through
by
the
glow
sun
and
be
near
be
roast
by
it
so
that
the
skyey
dome
remind
me
of
a
burning
hot
oven
and
the
more
robustious
savage
of
the
open
country
pester
us
with
their
dart
and
henuned
us
round
about
day
and
night
then
it
dawn
upon
my
mind
that
in
my
haste
i
have
be
too
severe
in
my
condenoination
of
the
forest
i
begin
to
regret
its
cool
shade
its
abundant
stream
its
solitude
and
the
large
acquaintance
i
make
with
our
own
ever
friendly
self
with
whom
there
be
never
any
quarrel
and
not
a
trace
of
insincere
affection
i
be
remind
of
this
very
forcibly
when
i
descend
from
the
suez
train
and
enter
cairo
my
pamper
habit
of
solitary
muse
be
outrage
my
dream
temper
be
shock
my
air
castle
be
ruthlessly
demolish
and
my
illusion
be
rudely
dispel
the
fashionables
of
cairo
in
star
at
me
every
time
i
come
out
to
take
the
air
make
me
uncommonly
shy
they
make
me
feel
as
if
something
be
radically
wrong
about
me
and
i
be
too
disconcert
to
pair
with
any
of
them
all
at
once
they
have
be
sun
without
interruption
in
the
full
blaze
of
social
life
and
i
be
too
fresh
from
my
three
year
meditation
in
the
wild
if
any
of
the
hundred
i
met
chance
to
think
kindly
of
me
at
this
period
it
be
certainly
not
because
of
any
merit
of
my
own
but
because
of
their
innate
benevolence
and
ample
con
siderateness
i
be
inclined
to
think
however
that
i
make
more
enemy
than
friend
for
it
could
scarcely
be
otherwise
with
an
irreflective
world
to
have
escape
their
censure
i
ought
to
have
worn
a
parchment
band
on
my
forehead
bearing
the
inscription
lady
and
gentleman
i
have
be
in
darkest
africa
for
three
continuous
year
living
among
savage
and
i
fear
something
of
their
spirit
cling
to
me
so
i
pray
you
have
mercy
indeed
no
african
traveller
ought
to
be
judged
during
the
first
year
of
his
return
he
be
too
full
of
his
own
reflection
he
be
too
utterly
natural
he
must
speak
the
truth
if
he
dy
for
it
his
opinion
be
too
much
his
own
then
again
his
vitals
be
wholly
disorganise
he
may
appear
plump
enough
but
the
plumpness
be
simply
the
effect
of
unhealthy
digestion
his
stomach
after
three
year
famish
be
contract
and
the
successive
feast
to
which
he
be
invite
speedily
become
his
bane
his
nerve
be
not
uniformly
strung
and
his
mind
harks
back
to
the
strange
scene
he
have
just
left
and
cannot
be
on
the
instant
focus
upon
that
which
interest
society
to
expect
such
a
man
to
act
like
the
unconscious
man
of
the
world
be
as
foolish
as
to
expect
a
fashionable
londoner
to
win
the
confidence
of
naked
african
we
must
give
both
time
to
recover
themselves
or
we
shall
be
unjust
to
avoid
the
lounge
critic
that
sat
in
judgement
upon
me
at
shepheard
hotel
i
sought
a
retire
spot
the
villa
victoria
surround
by
a
garden
where
be
out
of
sight
i
might
be
out
of
mind
there
be
also
an
infectious
sickness
prevail
that
season
in
london
and
my
friend
thought
it
well
that
i
should
wait
warmer
weather
i
reach
cairo
in
the
middle
of
january
and
until
the
begin
of
feb
ruary
i
toyed
with
my
pen
i
could
not
immediately
dash
off
two
consecutive
sentence
that
be
readable
a
thousand
scene
float
promiscuously
through
my
head
but
when
one
come
to
my
pen
point
it
be
a
farrago
of
nonsense
incoherent
yet
confusedly
intense
then
the
slightest
message
from
the
outside
world
lead
me
astray
like
a
ramble
butterfly
what
to
say
first
and
how
to
say
it
be
as
disturb
as
a
pathless
forest
would
be
to
a
man
who
have
never
stir
from
whitechapel
my
thought
mass
themselves
into
a
huge
organ
like
that
at
the
crystal
palace
from
which
a
master
hand
could
evoke
handel
messiah
or
wagner
walkiire
but
which
to
me
would
only
give
deep
discord
the
day
go
by
and
i
fear
i
should
have
to
relegate
my
book
to
the
uncertain
future
at
last
i
start
on
the
forest
chapter
the
write
of
which
relieve
me
of
the
acuter
feel
then
i
begin
the
march
from
yambuya
and
presently
i
warm
to
the
work
flung
off
page
after
pag
e
and
never
halt
until
i
have
reach
the
albert
the
strong
emotion
be
thus
relieve
i
essayed
the
begin
and
found
by
the
after
reading
that
i
be
not
over
fantastic
and
have
get
into
the
swing
of
narrative
i
continued
write
from
ten
to
fifty
page
of
manuscript
during
a
day
from
six
in
the
morning
until
midnight
and
have
re
write
the
former
chapter
with
more
method
be
able
on
the
eighty
fifth
day
to
write
finis
to
the
record
of
the
journey
i
think
the
title
of
it
be
a
happy
one
in
darkest
africa
or
the
quest
rescue
and
return
of
emin
pasha
it
be
the
choice
out
of
more
than
fifty
take
title
on
the
same
subject
but
none
of
them
be
so
aptly
descriptive
of
the
theme
since
then
some
dozen
or
so
book
title
have
be
foimded
on
it
such
as
darkest
england
darkest
london
darkest
new
york
darkest
russia
etc
etc
it
be
the
custom
for
german
anglo
german
philo
german
etc
etc
for
some
three
or
four
year
later
to
print
the
word
rescue
with
quotation
mark
which
signify
of
course
so
call
but
if
the
word
be
not
absolutely
truthful
i
know
not
what
be
true
emin
be
rescue
from
be
either
sell
to
the
mahdist
or
kill
by
fadle
mullah
or
perish
through
some
stupid
act
of
his
own
and
so
long
as
he
be
in
the
british
camp
he
be
safe
the
very
day
he
be
kiss
by
his
countryman
he
be
doom
to
fail
and
he
nearly
crack
his
poor
head
when
they
place
power
in
his
hand
they
sent
him
to
his
death
though
not
secure
from
interruption
at
the
villa
victoria
i
could
at
least
make
my
selection
of
the
visitor
who
call
might
i
have
be
as
safe
from
the
telegraph
and
mail
i
should
have
be
fairly
comfortable
but
my
telegram
be
numerous
and
letter
arrive
sometimes
by
the
hundred
the
mere
reading
of
the
correspondence
entail
a
vast
loss
of
time
the
reply
to
them
still
more
and
occupy
the
best
effort
of
three
person
what
with
a
tedious
sit
for
my
portrait
visit
interview
din
out
tel
raphic
and
postal
correspondence
call
of
friend
instruction
to
the
artist
for
the
book
and
revision
of
my
m
it
appear
to
me
wonderful
that
i
be
able
to
endure
the
strain
of
write
half
a
million
of
word
and
all
else
but
thank
goodness
by
the
middle
of
april
the
book
be
out
of
my
hand
and
i
be
alive
and
free
from
cairo
i
proceed
to
cannes
to
consult
with
sir
william
mackinnon
about
east
africa
and
explain
about
german
aggressiveness
in
that
region
thence
i
move
to
paris
and
not
many
day
later
i
be
in
brussels
where
i
be
receive
with
a
tremendous
demonstration
of
military
and
civilian
honour
all
the
way
to
the
royal
palace
where
i
be
to
be
lodge
the
street
be
line
with
troop
and
behind
these
be
the
populace
shout
their
viva
it
appear
to
me
that
a
great
change
have
come
over
belgian
public
opinion
about
the
value
of
the
congo
before
i
depart
for
africa
the
belgian
journal
be
not
in
favour
of
africa
but
now
all
be
change
and
the
king
be
recognise
as
the
great
benefactor
of
the
nation
while
i
be
the
guest
of
his
majesty
state
municipal
and
geographical
reception
follow
fast
upon
one
another
and
at
each
of
the
assemblage
i
be
impressed
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
nation
for
the
grand
african
domain
secure
to
it
by
the
munificence
of
their
royal
statesman
and
sovereign
besides
gold
and
silver
medal
from
brussels
and
antwerp
the
king
graciously
confer
on
me
the
grand
cross
of
the
order
of
leopold
and
the
grand
cross
of
the
congo
every
morning
however
between
and
the
king
lead
me
into
his
private
room
to
discus
question
of
absorb
interest
to
both
of
us
since
i
have
repeatedly
endeavour
to
impress
on
his
majesty
the
necessity
of
the
railway
for
the
connection
of
the
low
with
the
upper
congo
witiiout
which
it
be
impossible
to
hope
that
the
splendid
sacrifice
he
propose
to
make
or
have
make
would
ever
bear
fruit
in
i
have
be
one
of
the
principal
agent
in
the
promotion
of
an
english
company
for
the
construction
of
the
royal
congo
railway
but
my
effort
be
in
vain
now
however
the
king
express
his
assurance
that
the
time
be
ripe
for
the
belgian
nation
to
construct
the
line
and
he
be
pleased
to
say
that
it
be
my
success
which
have
produce
this
feel
and
that
the
welcome
extend
to
me
be
a
proof
of
it
i
would
have
be
well
pleased
if
his
majesty
have
express
his
determination
to
economise
in
other
direction
and
devote
his
energy
to
the
railway
the
next
subject
be
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
in
the
congo
i
propose
that
troop
should
be
push
up
the
congo
and
that
post
should
be
establish
at
the
mouth
of
the
aruwinu
and
limmmi
and
that
the
garrison
should
be
increase
month
by
month
until
about
two
thousand
troop
have
be
collect
when
an
onward
movement
should
be
make
against
stanley
fall
and
the
arab
power
be
summarily
broken
as
this
would
be
a
signal
of
resolute
action
against
all
the
arab
above
the
fall
about
thirty
steel
boat
should
be
provide
to
enable
the
war
to
be
carry
up
the
lualaba
for
there
would
be
no
peace
for
the
state
until
every
slaver
in
the
congo
state
have
be
extirpate
or
disarm
i
explain
the
project
in
great
detail
and
urge
it
vehemently
as
after
the
treachery
of
tippu
tib
in
the
forest
region
it
be
useless
to
hope
that
any
other
method
would
prevail
his
majesty
promise
cordial
assent
to
the
plan
and
promise
that
the
order
should
be
issue
at
once
for
the
building
of
the
boat
the
next
subject
debate
be
the
well
delimitation
of
the
congo
state
to
the
east
i
propose
that
instead
of
the
vague
and
uncertain
line
of
east
longitude
the
boundary
between
british
territory
and
the
congo
state
should
be
the
centre
of
the
albert
edward
nyanza
and
the
course
of
the
semliki
by
which
the
part
of
tribe
would
be
avoid
the
n
henry
m
stanley
benefit
to
both
england
and
the
state
would
be
that
while
the
whole
of
the
snowy
range
of
ruwenzori
intact
would
belong
to
england
the
congo
state
would
be
extend
to
llie
albert
nyanza
in
size
the
exchange
territory
would
be
about
equal
in
area
his
majesty
appear
pleased
with
the
idea
and
express
his
willingness
to
negotiate
the
exchange
of
territory
with
the
e
st
african
company
the
king
introduce
the
third
subject
himself
by
express
his
desire
to
know
what
point
be
the
best
to
occupy
as
a
central
post
along
the
northern
frontier
between
france
and
the
congo
state
i
unhesitatingly
point
out
the
confluence
of
the
mbomu
with
the
welle
mubangi
but
that
to
supply
such
a
distant
station
would
require
a
large
number
of
steel
whale
boat
such
as
forrest
son
of
london
have
make
for
me
then
he
wish
to
know
how
the
north
eastern
frontier
could
be
defend
i
reply
that
a
clever
officer
would
find
no
difficulty
in
establish
himself
within
easy
reach
of
mak
raka
and
hold
out
inducement
to
the
former
makraka
soldier
of
emin
many
of
whom
would
be
glad
of
a
refuge
against
the
mahdist
at
these
private
reception
his
majesty
be
accustom
to
sit
with
his
back
to
the
window
on
one
side
of
a
large
marble
topped
table
while
his
visitor
sits
on
the
other
side
the
table
be
well
furnish
with
write
paper
ink
pen
and
pencil
three
year
and
a
quarter
have
pass
since
i
be
in
the
room
where
i
have
be
fifty
time
before
probably
nothing
have
change
except
ourselves
the
king
beautiful
brown
beard
have
in
the
interval
become
grey
from
ear
to
ear
while
my
hair
which
have
be
iron
grey
be
now
as
white
as
snowdon
in
winter
i
make
a
smile
reference
to
the
change
time
have
wrought
in
us
since
we
have
first
met
in
june
and
discuss
the
possibility
of
introduce
civilisation
on
the
congo
the
king
begin
by
say
that
my
visit
to
brussels
be
sure
to
be
follow
by
great
result
he
be
very
certain
of
be
able
to
get
the
congo
railway
start
now
for
the
belgian
people
be
thoroughly
rouse
up
and
be
even
enthusiastic
he
say
my
letter
from
africa
and
my
present
visit
have
cause
this
change
my
description
of
the
forest
have
fire
their
imagination
and
the
people
seem
to
be
about
as
eager
to
begin
the
railway
as
they
be
previously
backward
indifferent
even
hostile
the
railway
share
have
be
nearly
all
take
up
etc
etc
now
mr
stanley
say
he
you
have
put
me
under
still
far
obligation
by
point
out
how
slave
raid
can
be
stop
you
have
also
suggest
how
we
could
transform
slave
raider
into
policeman
which
be
a
splendid
idea
and
finally
you
have
indicate
how
we
be
to
protect
our
frontier
and
make
use
of
emin
troop
as
soldier
in
the
service
of
the
state
we
now
discuss
the
value
of
the
country
between
the
congo
and
lake
albert
he
listen
to
what
i
say
with
the
close
attention
of
one
who
be
receive
an
account
of
a
great
estate
that
have
just
fall
to
him
of
which
previously
he
have
but
a
vague
knowledge
i
say
that
from
the
mouth
of
the
aruwimi
to
within
fifty
mile
of
lake
albert
the
whole
country
from
s
to
about
n
be
one
dense
tropical
forest
and
that
its
area
be
about
equal
to
france
and
spain
put
together
do
the
forest
produce
anything
that
be
marketable
in
europe
well
sire
i
suppose
that
when
elephant
have
be
exterminate
in
all
odier
part
of
africa
ere
will
still
be
some
found
in
that
forest
so
that
the
state
will
always
be
able
to
coimt
upon
some
quantity
of
ivory
especially
if
the
state
have
kindly
set
aside
a
reservation
for
them
to
retreat
to
and
forbidden
the
indiscriminate
slaughter
of
these
animal
such
a
reservation
will
also
be
useful
for
the
pigmie
and
other
wild
creature
of
the
forest
but
the
principal
value
of
the
forest
consists
in
the
practically
inexhaustible
supply
of
valuable
and
useful
timber
which
it
will
yield
you
have
a
great
source
of
revenue
in
this
immense
store
of
giant
tree
when
the
congo
railway
enables
timber
merchant
to
build
their
saw
mill
on
the
bank
of
the
many
tributary
and
creek
which
pierce
it
the
cotton
wood
though
comparatively
soft
will
be
adapt
for
cargo
barge
because
it
be
as
unsinkable
as
cork
and
will
be
useful
for
transport
down
the
congo
the
mahogany
teak
greenheart
and
the
hard
red
and
yellow
wood
i
think
the
timber
yard
at
stanley
pool
will
be
a
sight
to
see
some
few
year
hence
then
for
local
purpose
the
forest
will
be
valuable
for
furnish
material
for
building
au
tbe
house
in
the
congo
valley
and
for
make
wooden
tram
line
across
the
portage
of
the
many
river
the
concessionaire
will
also
find
the
rubber
produce
of
the
forest
highly
profitable
almost
every
branchy
tree
have
a
rubber
parasite
cling
to
it
as
we
carve
our
way
through
the
forest
our
clothes
be
spoil
by
the
rain
of
juice
which
fell
on
us
as
there
be
so
many
river
and
creek
in
the
forest
accessible
by
boat
and
as
along
the
congo
itself
for
some
hundred
of
mile
the
wood
come
down
and
overhang
the
water
a
well
organise
company
will
be
able
to
collect
several
ton
annually
of
rubber
when
rubber
be
even
now
two
shilling
per
pound
you
can
estimate
what
the
value
of
this
product
alone
will
be
when
the
industry
have
be
properly
developed
with
every
advance
into

the

experience
will
teach
the
concessionaire
when
and
how
to
hunt
for
this
valuable
article
of
commerce
i
be
inclined
to
think
in
fact
that
the
great
forest
will
prove
as
lucrative
to
the
state
as
any
other
section
however
fertile
the
soil
and
rich
its
produce
no
one
can
travel
up
the
congo
without
be
struck
by
the
need
of
the
saw
mill
and
how
numerous
and
urgent
be
the
us
of
sawn
timber
for
the
various
station
which
be
be
erect
everywhere
if
you
have
saw
mill
establish
now
on
the
aruwimi
they
could
not
produce
plank
fast
enough
to
satisfy
all
demand
and
what
a
help
for
the
railway
hard
wood
sleeper
would
be
i
be
then
question
as
to
the
tribe
of
the
forest
and
have
to
explain
that
as
the
experience
of
these
unsophisticated
aborigine
with
stranger
have
be
most
cruel
it
would
not
do
to
be
too
sanguine
about
their
ability
to
supply
labour
at
first
demand
but
i
say
i
come
across
no
tribe
except
the
pigmy
which
after
two
year
acquaintance
with
the
white
man
could
not
be
brought
to
a
right
sense
of
the
value
of
their
muscle
if
a
station
be
built
in
any
part
of
the
forest
the
the
market
price
of
rubber
be
now
quly
quote
at
four
shflliags
and
sixpence

d
s

t
be
induced
by
patient
and
fair
treatment
to
become
serviceable
in
a
short
time
but
the
other
tribe
would
remain
as
aloof
as
ever
until
they
have
the
same
opportunity
of
intimatdy
know
the
white
stranger
as
the
forest
be
so
dense
and
so
many
mile
of
untrodden
wood
separate
the
tribe
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
all

fit
for

road
through
the

gentle
treatment
of
the

to
them
will
tend
to
hasten
the

for

rapidly
in
a
mysterious
way
good
as
well
as
evil

and
every
month
will
show
a
perceptible
increase
in
the
number
of
diose
native
desirous
of
associate
themselves
with
the
white
stranger
when
the
king
ask
me
about
the
people
of
the
grassland
near
the

he
be
much
interested
at
hearing
how
from
enemy
formidable
by
their
number
and
courage
they
have
become
my
ally
carrier
servant
and
most
faithful
messenger
his
majesty
be
much
impressed
by
this
and
i
told
him
how
i
have
be
affected
by
their
amiability
and
good
service
to
any
one
listen
to
the
warm
praise
i
give
the
mazamboni
and
kavallis
i
might
have
appear
to
exaggerate
their
good
quality
but
his
majesty
be
so
generous
mind
that
he
could
appreciate
the
frank
way
in
which
they
have
confess
their
error
in
treat
us
as
enemy
and
the
ready
way
in
which
they
have
atone
for
it
i
show
the
king
that
the
grass
land
be
not
so
distant
from
the
congo
as
my
painful
and
long
journey
through
the
forest
have
make
them
appear
without
any
great
cost
it
will
be
possible
for
the
state
to
send
expedition
to

within

before

the

in

opinion
the
advantage
of

on
the
side

there
be
now
a

while
my

secret
hope
of
the

of
the
ruwenzori
range
be
more
likely
to
be
gratify
by
its

sense
and

so
on
this
discussion

right
of
first
discovery
and
those
two
gentlem
i
be
the
patron
of
the
expedition
how
can
you
say
that
when
herodotus
spoke
of
them
twenty
six
hundred
year
ago
and
call
them
crophi
and
mophi
it
be
intolerable
that
classic
name
like
those
should
be
displace
by
modem
name
and
i
humbly
b
your
pardon
mr
gladstone
but
crophi
and
mophi
if
they
ever
exist
at
all
be
situate
over
a
thousand
mile
to
the
northward
herodotus
simply
write
from
hearsay
and
oh
i
ca
not
stand
that
well
mr
gladstone
say
i
will
you
assist
me
in
this
project
of
a
railway
to
uganda
for
the
suppression
of
the
slave
trade
if
i
can
arrange
that
crophi
and
mophi
shall
be
substitute
in
place
of
gordon
bennett
and
mackinnon
oh
that
will
not
do
that
be
flat
bribery
and
corruption
and
smile
he
rise
to
his
foot
buttoning
his
coat
l
his
virtue
might
yield
to
the
temptation
ala
say
i
to
myself
when
england
be
rule
by
old
men
and
child
my
slave
trade
discourse
must
be
defer
i
turn
now
to
the
extraordinary
charge
make
against
me
on
my
return
to
europe
that
i
deliberately
employ
slave
on
my
expedition
i
would
point
out
that
every
traveller
before
set
out
on
his
journey
take
all
precaution
to
avoid
do
this
each
of
my
follower
be
oblige
to
prove
that
he
be
free
by
personal
declaration
and
two
witness
before
he
could
be
enrol
four
month
advance
wage
be
paid
to
the
men
before
they
left
zanzibar
and
on
their
return
their
full
wage
be
deliver
into
their
own
hand
no
doubt
many
who
have
be
slave
have
manage
to
get
into
the
expedition
as
i
found
to
my
cost
when
well
away
in
the
interior
but
since
they
have
be
able
to
earn
their
own
living
their
slavery
have
be
merely
nominal
and
all
their
earnings
be
their
own
to
do
what
they
like
with
and
their
owner
never
saw
them
except
when
at
the
end
of
ramadan
they
call
to
pay
their
respect
to
all
intent
and
purpose
they
be
as
much
freeman
as
the
free
bom
inasmuch
as
they
be
relieve
from
all
obligation
to
their
master
to
proceed
on
the
line
that
because
they
be
not
free
bom
they
must
be
slave
one
would
have
to
clear
out
the
seedy
boy
stoker
from
the
british
fleet
in
the
indian
ocean
and
all
the
mail
passenger
and
freight
steamer
which
ship
them
at
aden
and
bombay
calcutta
singapore
and
yokohama
all
the
british
consulate
on
the
east
coast
zanzibar
madagascar
etc
would
have
to
be
charge
with
connive
at
the
slave
trade
as
also
all
the
british
merchant
in
those
place
because
they
employ
house
servant
door
and
horse
boy
who
be
nominally
slave
white
men
be
not
in
the
habit
of
proceed
to
an
arab
slave
owner
and
agree
with
him
as
to
the
employment
of
his
slave
i
employ
english
agent
at
zanzibar
to
engage
my
people
and
every
precaution
be
take
that
no
one
be
enlist
who
could
not
swear
he
be
an
ingwaria
or
freeman
i
be
only
four
day
in
zanzibar
but
before
these
men
be
accepted
they
have
to
re
swear
their
declaration
before
the
british
consul
general
that
they
be
free
the
accusation
make
against
me
that
i
employ
slav
be
therefore
most
disgraceful
history
will
be
compel
to
acknowledge
that
i
have
some
right
to
claim
credit
in
the
act
which
have
follow
one
upon
another
so
rapidly
of
late
and
which
have
tend
to
make
slave
raid
impossible
and
to
reduce
slave
trading
to
sly
and
secret
exchange
of
human
chattel
in
isolated
district
in
the
interior
the
book
in

my

it

it

italian
spanish
and

and
in

it
have
have
a

of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
the
month
of

be
mainly
pass
by
me
in
stir
up
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
the
geographical
society
to
unite
in
press
upon
the
british
government
the
necessity
of
more
vigorous
action
to
prevent
east
africa
be
wholly
absorbed
by
germany
and
on
come
southward
from
scotland
where
i
have
be
speak
the
news
reach
me
that
lord
salisbury
have
secure
for
great
britain
zanzibar
and
the
northern
half
of
east
africa
but
singularly
curtail
of
the
extensive
piece
of
pasture
land
west
of
kilimanjaro
this
odd
cut
off
be
due
to
a
permanent
official
in
the
foreign
office
whose
hand
can
be
trace
in
that
oblique
line
run
from
the
northern
base
of
the
devil
mountain
to
s
lat
lo
on
lake
victoria
have
that
gentleman
be
a
member
of
an
african
expedition
he
would
never
have
have
recourse
to
an
oblique
line
when
a
straight
line
would
have
do
well
however
while
it
remains
a
signal
instance
of
his
weakness
it
be
no
less
a
remarkable
proof
of
german
magnanimity
for
though
the
german
be
fully
aware
that
the
official
be
one
of
the
most
squeezable
creature
in
office
they
decline
to
extend
the
line
to
the
equator
kilimanjaro
therefore
be
hand
over
to
germany
because
the
german
emperor
vfos
so
interested
in
the
flora
and

that
now
i
shall
have
a
chance

we
go
to

quiet
happy
week
sir

of
scotland
in
her
dress
be
with
him
in
the
even
we
met
again
i
propose
he
should
write
his
reminiscence
he
say
he
could
not
do
so
because
he
should
have
to
write
of
so
many
people
be
charitable
to
them
and
write
only
of
their
best
qualitiest
i
say
i
do
not
care
a
fig
for
charity
if
i
write
at
all
i
must
write
truthfully
all
i
know
he
reply
he
be
now
engage
in
write
a
book
call
anthropology
of
men
and
woman
a
title
he
say
that
do
not
describe
its
content
but
will
suffice
to
induce
me
to
read
it
what
a
grand
man
one
of
the
real
great
one
of
england
he
might
have
be
if
he
have
not
be
curse
with
cynicism
i
have
no
idea
to
what
his
anthropology
refers
but
i
would
lay
great
odds
that
it
be
only
another
mean
of
relieve
himself
of
a
surchai
e
of
spleen
against
the
section
of
humanity
who
have
excite
his
envy
dislike
or
scorn
if
he
have
a
broad
mind
he
would
curb
these
tendency
and
thus
allow
men
to
see
more
dearly
his
grander
quality
from
maloja
we
go
to
the

for
many
year
and
be
the
cause
of

it
appear
that
casati
far
from
be
a
champion
of
emin
be
now
resentful
towards
him
because

stanley
in

writes
the
imtidiness
and
disorder
of
the
street
of
new
york
strike
me
as
be
terrible
for
so
rich
a
city
and
such
an
energetic
population
the
street
be
cut
up
by
rail
in
a
disgraceful
fashion

the

permit
themselves
to

thus
torture
have
certainly
curious
taste
if
they
be
of
my
mind
they
would
pull
these
structure
down
and
compel
the

to
build
it
in
such
a
manner
that
while
it
might
be
more
useful
and
safe
it
would
not
be
such
an
eyesore
nor
so
suggestive
of
insolence

tyranny

where
he
join

a
few
day
later
will
give
an
idea
of
his
feeling
i
spend
most
of
my
time
in
my
own
little
cabin
write
or
reading
endure
the
break
on
my
privacy
because
they
be
a
necessity
each
time
invoke
more
patience
and
beseeching
time
to
hurry
on
its
lag
movement
that
i
might
once
more
taste
of
absolute
freedom
meanwhile
what
pleasure
i
obtain
be
principally
in
reading
unless
i
come
to
a
little
town
and
can
slip
unobserved
out
of
door
for
a
walk
i
often
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
aspect
of
my
feeling
as
i
be
compel
to
become
shifty
and
cunning
to
evade
the
eager
citizen
advance
i
feel
like
cain
hurry
away
with
his
uneasy
conscience
after
despatch
abel
or
a
felonious
cashier

plunder
when
i
finally
succeed
in
get
off
without
attract
anyone
you
would
be
amuse
could
you
peep
in
underneath
my
waistcoat
and
observe
the
sudden
lift
of
the
feeling
just
like
the
sudden
light
of
a
waste
of
angry
sea
by
the
full
sun
warm
bland
and
full
of
promise
then
away
i
go
against
the
keen
cold
wind
but
the
feeling
be
rejoice
laugh
babbling
of
fun
and
enjoyment
and
the
undertone
of
the
great
harmony

i
be
free
block
after
block
be
pass
without
a
glance
until
i
get
to
the
quieter
part
and
then
i
straighten
out
take
a
long
breath
express
by
the
act
the
indescribable
relief
i
have
of
be
away
from
the
talk
man
with
his
wayward
mood
and
exceed
sensitiveness
i
sometimes
think
with
a
shiver
of
what
i
shall
have
to
endure
in
london
just
because
a
person
sends
a
polite
invitation
to
dinner
or
tea
or
reception
one
must
note
it
down
as
a
binding
engagement
for
that
even
or
afternoon
one
must
not
forget
it
one
must
think
of
it
and
cut
out
that
period
of
existence
from
his
short
life
to
eat
and
drink
at
the
express
hour
this
be
not
freedom
to
be
free
be
to
have
no
care
at
all
no
thought
of
the
next
hour
or
the
next
day
or
the
next

butterfly

the

the
bee
do
not
envy
the
butterfly
do
not
think
at
all
about
them
and
that
be
the
same
with
me
i
might
stand
it
for
a
week
perhaps
a
month
but
the
utter
waste
of
life
would
begin
to
present
itself
until
at
last
my
mind
would
conceive
an
accuse
phantom
compose
of
lose
day
and
week
with
their
host
of
lose
opportunity
ever

for
my
devotion

the
inane

profitless

under
bushy
gteen
of

and
leaf
i
saw
the
large
river
in

yesterday
it
appear
to
be
a
little
wider
than
what
i
could

over
with
a

best
day

dirty
rusty
colour

to
perspire
under
its
cover
of

verdure
i
always
love
the
english
country
and
my
secret
attachment
for
it
seem
to
me
well
confinned
to

as
i
thrill
with
admiration

can

his
next
letter
be
from
clifton
you
press
me
to
accept
the
invitation
to
preside
at
the
eisteddfod
i
feel
that
we
the
people
of
wale
generally
and
i
be
not
in
such
close
sympathy
as
to
enable
me
to
say
anything
sufficiently
please
to
their
ear
how
could
it
be
otherwise
the
eisteddfod
as
i
understand
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
excite
interest
in
the
welsh
nationality
and
language
my
travel
in
the
various
continent
have
ill
prepared
me
for
sympathise
with
such
a
cause
if
i
be
to
speak
truly
my
mind
i
should
recommend
welshman
to
turn
tiieir
attention
to
a
closer
study
of
the
english
language
literature
and
characteristic
for
it
be
only
by
that
training
that
they
can
hope
to
compete
with
their
english
brother
for
glory
honour
and
prosperity
there
be
no
harm
in
understand
the
welsh
language
but
they
should
be
told
by
sensible
men
that
every
hour
they
devote
to
it
occupies
time
that
might
be
well
employ
in
further
their
own
particular
interest
but
who
will
dare
tell
men
so
devote
to
their
own
people
and
country
as
the
welsh
the
real
truth
be
not
the
man
there
be
no
object
to
be
gain
save
the
good
of
the
welsh
people
themselves
who
unfortunately
fail
to
see
it
in
that
light
and
would
accordingly
resent
whatever
be
say
to
them
i
be

a
considerable
admiration
for

indeed
i
always
have
i
feel
what
all

mean
just
as
i
know
what

passing
in
the
african
heart
when
i
suddenly
make
him
rich
in
stead
of

him
there
be
a
look
as
of
a
lift
up
of
the
soul
into
the
eye
which
explains
as
fully
as

to
read
walter

i
like
it
immensely
the
life
of
houghton
be
dull
his
own
letter
be
the
best
in
it
but
there
be
no
observation
or
judgement
upon
thing
merely
a
series
of
letter
upon
town
talk
what
he
do
seldom
however
what
he
thought
where
you
see
his
thought
it
be
worth
reading
twice
it
be
a
great
relief
at
last
to
be
able
to
speak
my
mind
not
to
be
chill
and
have
to
shrink
back
between
mother
and
child

u
know
the
confidence
and
trust
that
exist

few
year
of
my
life
shall
be
give
to
know
this
thoroughly
towards
you
i
begin
trustfully
to
exhibit
my
thought
and
feeling
as
one
unaccustomed
to
the
security
of
a
bank
place

hard
earn
money
in
the
care
of
a
stranger

belief
in
its
security
yet
inwardly
doubt
so
i
shyly

this
and

imtil
now

my
emancipation
from

moral
weakness
to

see
the
time
when
i
could
have
write
gloriously
about
this
singular
old
town
i
love
it
no
less
now
than
i
do
year
ago
when
i
first
saw
it
but
i
be
much
busier
with
various
thing
now
than
then
the
old
fountain
hotel
be
a
typical
english
inn
i
heard
a
little
bit
of
vocal
music
from
the
cathedral
choir
and
very
much
admire
it
what
a
fine
old
cathedral
it
be
but
oh
how
the
religion
that
built
it
have
fade
the
worship
of
the
almighty
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
who
we
be
taught
in
our
youth
sat
in
the
heaven
of
heaven
have
be
so
supersede
by
that
degrade
worship
of
gold
and
society
apropos
of
this
i
picked
up
at
a
book
stall
yesterday
a
little
brochure
call
caesar
column
a
tale
of
the
twentieth
century
by
ignatius
donnelly
i
read
it
through
it
pretend
to
be
a
series
of
letter
from
a
man
name
gabriel
a
visitor
to
new
york
from
the
state
of
uganda
central
africa
they
be
direct
to
one
heinreich
a
resident
of
the
village
of
stanley
he
describes
the
marvellous
invention
of
the
age
especially
the
air
demon
which
be
air
warship
load
with

to
exterminate
the
devotee
of
society
and
the
cold
selfish
civilisation
or
rather
that
methodical
system
found
upon
spoliation
and
oppression
of
the
poor
which
the
wealthy
have
initiate
by
huge
trust
etc
wherein
there
be
no
thought
of
mercy
justice
or
sweet
charity
the
end
of
all
be
destruction
and
utter
extermination
of
the
wealthy
class
over
europe
and
america
and
the
quick
upheaval
of
everything

by
the
anarchist
clan
and
the
two

relapse
fast
enough
into
barbarism
in
consequence
it
be
a
powerful
story
impossible
of
course
but
some
of
its
reader
will
rise
from
reading
it

a
small
seedling
of
good
may

a
pitiful
wreck
just
ahead

letter
of
speke
i
doubt
whether
speke
will
ever
be
thoroughly
know
to
the
world
though
there
be
much
that
be
great
and
good
in
him
but
speke
unfortunately
could
not
express
himself
it
be
a
keen
pleasure
to
read
these
old
letter
which
breathe
of
work
loyalty
of
soul
hiunan
duty
imperial
object
and
moral
obligation
and
then
to
look
up
at
the
face
of
the
venerable
statesman
to
whom
they
be
address
and
trace
the
benevolence
breadth
of
mind
and
intelligence
which
elicit
the
spontaneous
free
expression
of
their
hope
from
these
traveller
and
pioneer
it
be
so
elevate
to
see
a
man
who
be
not
taint
with
meanness
and
pettiness
with
whom
one
can
talk
as
to
a
father
confessor
without
fear
of
be
misunderstood
and
without
risk
of
find
it
in
tiie
newspaper
of
the
next
day
sir
george
have
a
grand
quiet
face
and
a
pair
of
round
blue
eye
beam
with
kindness
and
the
light
of
wisdom
there
be
others
like
him
in
the
world
no
doubt
but
it
be
only
by
a
rare
chance
we
meet
them
should
i
be
ask
what
give
me
the
most
pleasure
in
life
i
would
answer
that
it
be
the
meeting
with
wise
and
good
elder
who
while
retain
a
vivid
interest
in
the
affair
of
life
could
from
their
height
of
knowledge
and
experience
approve
what
i
have
do
and
bid
me
strive
on
undaunted
undismayed
i
here
give
a
letter
from
sir
george
grey
write
a
month
later

igth
jan
my
dear
stanley
ttiis
be
the
nd
anniversary
of
new
zealand
a
public
holiday
i
be
left
in
perfect
tranquillity
with
full
time
for
calm
reflection
for
all
be
go
on
some
party
of
pleasure
i
have
occupy
my
morning
in
follow
your
suffering
and
trial
as
record
in
parke
experience
in
equatorial
africa
after
reading
with
the
great
pleasure
page
and
these
have
set
me
reflect
upon
what
you
have
do
for
the
empire
by
your
service
and
what
have
be
the
reward
give
publicly
to
you
by
the
audiorities
of
that
empire
well
neglect
i
be
inclined
to
think
it
be
best
that
the
matter
should
stand
thus
all
of
danger
sorrow
suffer
trial
of
every
kind
that
man
could
endure
you
have
undergone
from
all
of
these
you
have
emei
ed
unshaken
triumphant
every
difficulty
overcome
reverence
by
those
who
serve
under
you
africa
open
to
the
world
the
unknown
make
manifest
to
all
so
to
have
suffer
so
to
have
succeed
must
have
do
much
to
form
a
truly
great
character
the
remembrance
of
which
will
go
down
to
posterity
yet
one
thing
be
want
to
render
the
great
drama
in
which
you
have
be
the
great
actor
complete
could
the
man
who
have
do
all
this
and
support
such
various
trial
bear
that
perhaps
hardest
of
all
cold
neglect
and
the
absence
of
national
recognition
and
national
reward
for
what
he
have
accomplish
from
this
trial
as
from
all
the
others
you
have
undergone
you
have
come
out
a
c
miqueror
calm
unmoved
and
uncomplaining
your
own
character
have
be
improve
by
this
new
trial
which
will
add
an
interest
to
your
history
in
future
time
and
i
sit
here
not
lament
that
you
move
amongst
your
fellow
men
untitled
undecorated
but
with
a
feel
that
all
have
take
place
for
the
best
i
have
wish
to
write
to
you
on
several
pointa
i
be
much
struck
by
a
statement
in
parke
journal
that
at
one
point
it
only
take
fifteen
minute
to
walk
from
the
headwater
of
the
nile
to
those
of
the
congo
this
distance
could
hardly
be
show
upon
a
small
map
and
probably
cause
an
error
in
the
old
map
or
in
verbal
description
from
which
the
old
map
be
make
but
i
shall
weary
you
with
this
long
letter
i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
before
long
but
i
fear
some
time
may
elapse
before
i
can
start
for
england
i
feel
that
i
owe
duty
to
new
zealand
australia
and
the
cape
and
until
i
have
at
least
partially
fulfil
them
i
hesitate
to
indulge
my
longing
once
more
to
revisit
my
early
home
and
my
many
rdatives
will
you
give
my
regard
to
mr
stanley
and
tdl
her

curious
thing

be

to
rise
at
an
early
hour
on
account
of
habit
contract
during
more
than
twenty
year
of
african
travel
and
to
avail
myself
of
the
silent
hour
of
the
morning
to
procure
an
exercise
walk
for
the
sake
of
health
at
i
be
shave
and
somehow
my
thought
ran
persistently
on
what
colonel

a
grant
the
companion
of
speke
say
to
me
in
the
jerusalem

long
good
bye

do
not
suppose

about

reply
i
ca
not
see
how
my
marriage
will
affect
our
friendship
i
will
make
it
a
point
to
disprove
what
you
say
then
grant
and
i
be
separate
and
it
be
quite
true
i
reflect
we
have
not
met
since
somehow
but
i
will
make
it
a
point
to
visit
grant
the
first
even
after
i
reach
london
and
i
shook
my
razor
at
the
figure
in
the
mirror
to
confirm
the
mental
vow
a
short
time
afterwards
i
go
down
the
hotel
the
aruwimi
bnmch
of
the
congo
d
s
be
not
yet
open
as
i
put
my
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
to
open
it
the
morning
paper
be
thrust
underneath
the
door
by
the
newspaper
boy
outside
anxious
to
read
the
cablegram
from
london
i
seize
the
paper
and
the
first
news
to
catch
my
attention
be
death
of
colonel
j
a
grant
the
nile
explorer
what
an
odd
coincidence
this
be
the
second
time
in
my
experience
that
a
person
thousand
of
mile
away
from
me
have
be
suddenly
suggest
to
me
a
few
moment
precede
an
announcement
of
this
kind
from
the
day
i
part
with
grant
till
this
morning
his
word
have
not
once
recur
to
my
mind
on
the
other
occasion
the
message
come
as
an
apparition
i
be
in
the
centre
of
some
hundred
of
men
and
the
vision
of
a
woman
lie
on
her
bed
die
appear
to
me
suddenly
i
heard
her
voice
plainly
every
item
of
furniture
in
the
room
be
visible
to
me
in
fact
i
have
as
vivid
a
picture
of
the
room
and
all
within
it
as
though
i
stood
there
in
broad
daylight
the
vision
clear
as
it
be
pass
away
and
i
awoke
to
the
reality
of
thing
around
me
i
be
bewilder
to
find
that
no
one
have
witness
any
abstraction
on
my
part
though
one
be
so
close
that
he
touch
me
yet
in
spirit
i
have
be
six
thousand
mile
away
and
saw
my
own
figure
at
the
bedside
of
the
die
woman
month
after
when
i
have
actually
arrive
in
europe
i
be
told
that
she

politics
and
friend
soon
after
our
marriage
i
thought
of
parliament
for
stanley
it
seem
to
me
that
one
so
full
of
energy
with
such
administrative
power
and
political
foresight
would
find
in
the
house
of
conunoas
an
outlet
for
his
pent
up
energy
i
also
felt
he
need
men
society
we
have
no
country
home
then
and
to
be
shut
up
in
a
london
house
be
certainly
no
life
for
stanley
also
at
the
back
of
my
mind
be
the
haunt
fear
of
his
return
to
the
congo
i
thought
that
once
in
parliament
he
would
be
safely
anchor
at
first
he
would
not
hear
of
it
but
his
friend
mr
alexander
bruce
of
eklinburgh
join
me
in
persuade
stanley
to
become
liberal
unionist
candidate
for
north
lambeth
we
go
into
the
battle
just
ten
day
before
the
polling
day
we
be
quite
ignorant
of
electioneer
and
i
must
say
we
have
a
dreadful
ten
day
of
it
stanley
write
in
his
journal
monday
th
june
have
consent
to
contest
the
constituency
of
north
lambeth
against
alderman
coldwells
radical

accepted
because
d
be
so
eager
for
me
to
be
employ
l
i
fly
away
again
to
africa
on
the
th
stanley
held
a
great
meeting
at
hawkeston
hall
lambeth
but
he
be
howl
down
by
an
organise
rabble
import
for
the
purpose
the
leader
of
these
rowdy
station
in
the
gallery
from
time
to
time
wave
a
fold
newspaper
which
be
the
signal
for
fresh
interruption
and
an
incredible
din
the
platform
be
storm
and
we
have
to
withdraw
when
we
try
to
get
into
our
brougham
and
drive
away
the
rough
held
on
to
the
door
of
the
carriage
and
tore
it
off
stanley
be
greatly
di
usted
african
sav
e
he
thought
would
have
behave
well
he
be
not
sorry
to
be
beaten
though
the
majority
against
him
be
only
one
hundred
and
thirty
but
i
persuade
him
to
remain
the
liberal
unionist
candidate
he
thought
the
election
would
not
come
for
some
year
and
faintheartedly
consent
on
condition
that
he
would
never
be
expect
to
call
personally
on
voter
never
visit
from
house
to
house
he
consent
to
speak
at
work
men
club
and
meeting
but
never
will
i
degrade
myself
by
ask
a
man
for
his
vote
and
no
man
can
boast
that
stanley
ever
do
so
i
shall
remember
those
meeting
to
my
life
end
no
one
present
could
ever
forget
them
they
take
place
at
the
local
constitutional
club
in
the
york
road
lambeth
and
in
various
school
room
here
stanley
for
some
year
as
candidate
and
then
as
member
spoke
on
the
great
question
of
the
day
he
spoke
to
them
of
empire
of
commerce
of
what
the
uganda
railway
could
do
that
railway
which
the
liberal
have
so
hotly
object
to
construct
he
show
them
what
home
rule
in
ireland
really
meant
he
explain
to
them
the
egyptian
position
every
subject
he
make
clear
he
do
not
harangue
work
men
on
their
wrong
nor
on
their
right
but
he
spoke
to
them
of
their
duty
and
why
they
should
give
of
their
best
and
high
he
told
them
about
our
colony
how
they
be
make
not
by
loafer
but
by
men
eager
to
carve
out
their
own
fortune
and
he
told
them
what
manner
of
man
be
require
there
now
he
spoke
with
the
great
earnestness
and
simplicity
rise
at
time
into
a
fiery
eloquence
which
stir
the
heart
i
hardly
ever
fail
to
accompany
him
to
those
meeting
stanley
take
infinite
trouble
with
these
speech
as
with
every
thing
else
he
do
he
write
them
out
carefully
so
as
to
impress
the
subject
on
his
memory
but
he
do
not
read
nor
repeat
them
by
rote
these
lecture
and
address
taught
me
a
great
deal
and
far
reveal
to
me
the
splendid
power
of
stanley
i
use
to
wish
he
have
great
and
well
educate
audience
but
he
never
consider
any
such
effort
too
much
trouble
if
the
humblest
and
poorest
listen
intelligently
i
here
give
his
first
address
to
the
elector
of
north
lambeth
in
gentleman

venture
to
offer
myself
as
your
representative

work
out
the
great
destiny
which
any
race
have
ever
fulfil
but
we
must
go
on
or
we
shall
go
back
there
must
be
firm
and
steady
guidance
in
down

there
must
be
an
invincible
fleet

trade

still

reverence
in
every

from
which
of
the
two
great
english
party
i
ask
myself
and
i
ask
you
may
we
expect
the
finnest
liie
steadiest
guidance
the
most
unflinching
effort
to
maintain
our
naval
strength
the
whole
colonial
and
foreign
policy
of
england
under
the
last
two
administration
prompt
to
no
doubtful
reply
i
have
follow
that
policy
not
as
a
partisan
but
as
a
man
deeply
vitally
concerned
a
man
who
at
least
have
base
his
opinion
upon
practical
and
personal
conversance
with
great
and
difficult
affair
i
say
unhesitatingly
that
i
believe
that
the
continuance
of
lord
salisbury
firm
temperate
wise
foreign
policy
be
worth
to
england
million
of
money
and
again
far
more
important
than
money
though
harder
to
measure
in
national
power
national
usefulness
and
national
honour
first
of
all
the
merit
of
lord
salisbury
government
in
my
eye
come
the
enormous
strengthen
of
the
navy
gentleman
that
be
the
essential
thing
in
this
island
in
this
great
city
alone
be
a
treasure
of
life
and
wealth
such
as
no
nation
ever
have
to
guard
before
it
be
no
small
achievement
to
have
insured
that
wealth
those
life
by
seventy
new
ship
of
war
while
at
the
same
time
lighten
taxation
and
remit
especially
those
burden
which
the
poorest
felt
the
most
gentleman
i
be
as
you
know
a
man
of
the
people
whatever
i
have
achieve
in
life
have
be
achieve
by
my
own
hard
work
with
no
help
from
privilege
or
favour
of
any
kind
my
strong
sympathy
be
with
the
work
class
and
have
the
conflict
of
party
now
be
as
it
once
be
a
conflict
between
a
few
aristocrat
and
many
worker
between
privilege
and
popular
right
i
should
have
range
myself
assuredly
on
the
worker
side
but
i
now
see
no
such
conflict
i
see
both
side
follow
the
people
mandate
honestly
endeavour
to
well
the
condition
of
the
mass
and
i
see
the
unionist
party
actually
effect
those
reform
of
which
radical
be
too
often
content
to
talk
most
of
all
do
i
see
this
in
ireland
look
with
a
fresh
eye
and
with
no
party
prepossession
upon
the
irish
affair
i
cannot
but
perceive
that
while
others
may
have
declaim
eloquently
mr
balfour
have
govern
wisely
that
while
others
propose
to
throw
all
into
the
melt
pot
in
the
hope
of
some
magical
change
which
no
one
can
define
mr
balfour
and
his
colleague
be
successfully
employ
all
these
method
steady
and
gentle
rule
development
of
natural
resource
administrative
foresight
and
skill
which
have
in
time
past
weld
divide
country
into
unity
and
lift
distressed
and
troubled
community
into
prosperity
and
peace
i
sympathise
with
all
that
the
present
government
have
well
do
and
wisely
plan
for
the
bettering
of
the
lot
of
the
people
to
all
such
measure
i
will
give
the
best
thought
that
i
can
command
yet
i
cannot
but
feel
that
the
destiny
of
the
english
work
lass
depends
in
the
last
resort
on
measure
on
enterprise
of
a
large
scope
in
the
highland
of
africa
which
skilful
diplomacy
have
secure
for
england
those
land
to
which
the
mombasa
railway
will
be
the
first
practicable
road
there
be
room
and
to
spare
for
some
twenty
million
of
happy
and
prosperous
people
there
be
no
need
for
the
poorest
among
us
to
covet
his
neighbour
wealth
while
nature
still
offer
such
inunense
such
inexhaustible
boon
only
let
england
be
united
at
home
wise
abroad
and
no
man
can
assign
a
limit
to
the
stability
of
our
empire
or
to
the
prosperity
of
her
son
in
conclusion
the
preservation
of
peace
with
jealous
care
of
the
dignity
and
honour
of
the

the
wonderful
economy

during
the
past
six
year
the
readiness
to
reform
judiciously
where
reform
be
necessary
as
manifest
by
lord
salisbury
government
be
worthy
of
our
best
sympathy
and
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
return
me
to
parliament
i
promise
to
be
active
and
faithful
in

after
our
defeat
in
i
receive
the
follow
letter
from
sir
george
grey
who
be
still
in
auckland
new
zealand
october
my
dear
mr
stanley
i
be
only
just
recover
from
a
long
and
serious
illness
and
can
as
yet
hardly
hold
my
pen
but
i
be
so
ashamed
of
not
have
write
to
you
that
i
be
determine
to
make
an
effort
to
do
so
and
to
ask
for
your
forgiveness
i
be
seriously
sorry
at
stanley
lose
his
election
although
we
should
have
be
on
different
side
in
politics
but
his
profound
judgement
and
knowledge
of
african
affair
would
have
be
of
the
great
service
in
parliament
and
would
i
believe
have
prevent
the
government
from
commit
many
error
but
the
fact
be
that
stanley
service
to
the
empire
have
be
too
great
and
too
unusual
and
i
ought
to
have
know
he
would
have
to
undergo
many
trial
perhaps
he
be
lucky
in
have
escape
be
put
in
chain
as
columbus
be
men
of
this
kind
have
no
business
to
act
in
the
unusual
manner
they
generally
do
throw
their
contemporary
in
the
shade
this
be
never
forgiven
however
these
truly
great
men
can
bear
misfortune
in
whatever
guise
they
come
like
hero
and
thus
add
great
lustre
to
their
ultimate
renown
and
will
make
their
history
much
more
wonderful
reading
those
who
climb
to
height
must
expect
to
meet
with
toil
and
many
trial
give
my
regard
to
stanley
who
try
in
so
many
and
such
vast
toil
and
danger
whilst
work
for
his
fellow
men
will
not
falter
now
truly
yours
g
grey
in
january
stanley
write
to
me
at
cambridge
where
i
be
spending
a
week
have
announce
my
intention
of
stand
again
as
candidate
for
n
lambeth
i
propose
do
so
of
course
for
your
sake
but
after
my
experience
in
north
lambeth
you
must
not
expect
any
enthusiasm
any
of
that
perseverant
enei
which
i
may
have
shewn
elsewhere
and
which
i
could
still
show
in
an
honourable
sphere
but
this
political
work
involves
lie
back
biting
morally
damage
your
opponent
in
the
eye
of
the
voter
give
and
receive
wordy
abuse
which
reminds
me
of
english
village
squabble
and
i
cannot
find
the
course
either
to
open
my
lip
against
my
opponent
or
to
put
myself
in
a
position
to
receive
from
him
and
his
mindless
myrmidon
that
filthy
abuse
they
be
only
too
eager
to
give
that
so
many
member
of
parliament
can
do
so
smile
only
show
difference
of
training
as
well
as
difference
of
character
between
us
i
do
not
respect
them
less
for
the
capacity
of
be
indifferent
to
the
vileness
but
rather
feel
admiration
that
they
can
do
something
which
i
cannot
do
if
i
be
once
in
the
house
possibly
i
should
not
feel
so
thin
skin
and
at
the
next
fight
i
should
probably
be
able
to
face
it
well
but
not
beii
in
the
house
and
find
the
house
moated
around
by
the
ce
pool
of
slander
and
calumny
i
detest
the
prospect
of
wad
in
for
so
doubtful
a
satisfaction
you
remember
that
meeting
in
lambeth
well
i
have
be
through
some
stiff
scene
in
my
life
but
i
never
fell
so
low
in
my
own
estimation
as
i
fell
that
day
to
stand
there
be
slight
insult
by
venomous
tongue
every
second
and
yet
to
feel
how
hopeless
nay
impossible
retort
be
and
to
realise
that
i
have
voluntarily
put
myself
in
a
position
to
be
bespatter
with
as
much
foul
reproach
as
those
ignorant
fool
chose
to
fling
i
will
nevertheless
stand
again
but
my
forbearance
must
not
be
test
too
far
i
declare
my
strict
resolve
never
to
ask
for
a
vote
never
to
do
any
silly
personal
canvass
in
high
street
or
by
street
never
to
address
open
air
meeting
cart
or
wagon
work
or
to
put
myself
in
any
position
where
i
can
be
bait
like
a
bull
in
the
ring
the
honour
of
m
p
be
not
worth
it
if
it
be
not
possible
to
represent
north
lambeth
without
put
my
dignity
under
the
juggernaut
of
demo
let
demo
find
someone
else
i
will
visit
committee
and
would
be
pleased
to
receive
them
anywhere
i
will
speak
at
club
and
committee
room
or
any
hall
and
pay
the
expense
etc
but
that
be
all
but
this
shall
be
my
final
effort
if
i
be
beaten
i
hope
it
will
be
by
an
overwhelm
majority
which
will
for
ever
prove
my
incapacity
as
a
candidate
six
or
seven
year
ago
i
be
a
different
man
altogether
but
this
last
expedition
have
sap
my
delight
in
the
rude
enjoyment
of
life
though
never
at
any
time
could
i
have
look
upon
electioneer
as
enjoyable
the
whole
business
seem
to
me
degrade
i
refuse
to
promise
to
the
people
that
which
i
think
harmful
to
the
nation
i
object
to
the
abject
attitude
of
politician
towards
constituent
if
i
stand
it
be
as
their
leader
not
their
slave
i
shall
go
to
parliament
simply
to
work
for
some
good
end
and
not
for
personal
object
i
now
realise
that
since
usage
and
custom
demand
that
the
parliamentary
candidate
shall
call
on
the
voter
and
that
stanley
positively
and
i
think
rightly
refuse
to
do
so
we
be
in
danger
of
lose
the
constituency
i
realise
that
whichever
way
the
work
man
mean
to
vote
he
like
to
feel
he
have
something
you
want
something
he
can
give
he
like
even
to
refuse
you
and
oblige
you
to
listen
to
his
view
and
his
principle
so
if
you
do
not
dioose
to
go
and
kow
tow
before
him
he
put
you
down
as
no
good
or
at
any
rate
not
my
sort
after
our
drfeat
therefore
in
resolve
to
nurse
north
lambeth
since
that
be
the
accepted
term
and
to
do
so
in
my
own
way
it
be
hard
work
undoubtedly
but
very
interest
and
instructive
i
have
some
unforgettable
experience
and
on
the
whole
i
be
very
kindly
and
pleasantly
receive
february
st
general
beauregard
die
last
night
at
new
orleans
he
be
my
old
general
at
the
battle
of
shiloh
i
remember
even
now
how
enthusiastic
my
fellow
soldier
be
about
him
and
i
be
but
an
inconsiderate
boy
caught
the
fever
of
admiration
and
rave
thank
heaven
there
be
no
reporter
to
record
a
boy
ravii
this
be
not
to
say
that
he
be
not
worthy
of
the
soldier
respect
but
his
achievement
be
not
those
of
a
military
genius
and
genius
alone
deserves
such
unmeasured
praise
as
we
give
him
the
civil
war
only
developed
two
first
rank
men
and
those
be
grant
and
lee
but
in
the
second
rank
there
be
many
who
might
possibly
with
opportunity
have
rival
the
first
two
i
believe
if
it
be
put
to
the
vote
of
the
military
class
as
to
which
be
the
great
of
the
two
great
captain
of
the
war
the
vote
would
be
cast
for
robert
e
lee
nevertheless
there
be
something
in
grant
which
though
not
so
showy
as
the
strat
y
and
dash
of
lee
make
me
cast
my
vote
for
grant

june

thursday
my
dear
old
friend
sir
william
mackinnon
bart
die
this
morning
at
after
a
long
illness
contract
on
his
yacht
cornelia
as
the
result
of
a
cold
and
deep
depression
of
spirit
create
by
a
sense
that
his
labour
great
expenditure
and
exercise
of
influence
over
his
friend
on
behalf
of
british
east
africa
be
not
appreciate
as
they
deserve
by
lord
rosebery
and
his
colleague
in
the
government
a
lack
of
appreciation
be
indeed
a
mild
term
for
the
callous
indifference
show
by
the
rosebery
government
sir
william
have
for
year
since
be
feel
his
way
towards
this
great
achievement
by
dint
of
generosity
long
continued
he
finally
won
the
confidence
of
successive
sultan
of
zanzibar
especially
syyed
barghash
and
when
once
that
confidence
be
establish
he
gradually
developed
his
project
by
which
he
as
well
as
the
sultan
might
greatly
profit
be
already
rich
enough
for
gratify
his
very
simple
want
he
wish
to
lead
his
friend
the
sultan
into
the
path
of
profitable
enterprise
he
be
ably
second
by
sir
john
kirk
and
fred
holmwood
the
consul
general
and
though
it
be
tedious
work
he
finally
succeed
i
claim
to
have
assist
him
considerably
during
my
stay
in
and
it
be
accord
to
my
advice
that
barghash
finally
consent
to
sign
the
concession
and
mackinnon
hurry
on
the
negotiation
a
few
week
after
i
left
the
concession
be
sign
and
mackinnon
way
to
form
a
companyi
and
obtain
a
charter
from
the
british
government
be
clear
sir
william
subscribed
fifty
thousand
pound
to
die
capital
and
raise
the
remainder
from
among
his
own
friend
for
no
friend
of
mackinnon
could
possibly
resist
a
request
from
him
the
object
of
the
company
be
mainly
commercial
and
left
alone
by
politician
mackinnon
be
the
man
to
make
it
remunerative
but
after
the
advent
of
germany
into
the
african
field
with
bismarck
at
the
helm
and
the
principle
declare
at
the
berlin
conference
behind
them
it
become
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
collision
between
mackinnon
company
and
the
german
to
give
the
east
african
company
a
political
status
hence
with
the
utmost
good
will
and
promise
of
support
the
charter
be
give
to
it
by
the
british
government
and
the
company
thereby
incur
tremendous
responsibility

this

over
a
region
that

of

as
this

these

the

would
surely
have

be
thus
waste
on
purely
political
work
which
the
national
exchequer
should
have
paid
for
in
the
mackinnon
company
enter
uganda
and
on
account
of
the
territory
turn
over
to
it

me
the
government
of
the
company

patriotically
held
on
however
and
sustain
the
enormous
expense
of
maintain
the
communication
open
between
uganda
and
the
sea
but
it
soon
become
evident
to
mackinnon
who
be
always
so
hopeful
and
cheerful
that
the
responsibility
be
become
too
great
for
his
company
the
transport
of
good
to
uganda
to
sustain
the
force
require
to
occupy
it
be
very
costly
every
ton
cost
three
hundred
pound
to
carry
to
uganda
that
be
it
require
forty
men
to
carry
a
ton
and
as
the
distance
be
three
month
travel
from
the
coast
and
little
less
than
three
month
to
return
and
each
man
receive
one
pound
per
month
two
hundred
and
forty
pound
be
require
for
the
pay
of
these
forty
men
for
six
month
exclusive
of
their
ration
the
force
in
uganda
the
various
garrison
maintain
along
the
route
would
naturally
consume
several
hundred
ton
of
goocfe
each
year
and
every
additional
act
of
pressure
from
the
government
increase
this
consumption
and
expense
it
be
thus
easily
see
how
when
the
government
always
extravagant
when
they
manage
thing
themselves
dipped
their
hand
into
the
coffer
of
a
private
company
bankruptcy
could
not
be
far
off
though
mackinnon
through
patriotism
held
on
much
longer
than
his
friend
deem
prudent
he
at
last
inform
the
rosebery
government
that
the
company
intend
to
abandon
uganda
and
the
interior
and
confine
themselves
to
their
own
proper
business
namely
commerce
unless
they
be
assist
by
a
subsidy
i
happen
to
be
in
mackinnon
room
at
the
burlington
a
few
minute
after
he
have
sent
the
foreign
office
messenger
with
his
answer
to
lord
rosebery
question
what
be
the
least
sum
the
company
would
accept
per
annum
for
five
year
to
undertake
or
rather
to
continue
the
administration
of
uganda
and
i
be
told
that
mackinnon
answer
be
fifty
thousand
pound
i
remember
when
i
heard
the
amount
that
i
thought
the
matter
be
all
over
for
rosebery
with
harcourt
supervise
the
treasury
would
never
have
the
courage
to
allow
such
a
sum
why
have
he
not
ask
for
half
that
amount
twenty
five
thousand
pound
but
even
fifty
thousand
pound
be
insufficient
cry
mackinnon
certainly
after
the
style
in
which
you
have
be
administer
during
the
last
eighteen
month
but
it
be
clear
by
the
nature
of
rosebery
question
that
administer
uganda
mean
simply
its
occupation
and
keep
thing
quiet
in
order
to
prevent
its
be
abandon
to
germany
or
revert
to
the
barbarous
method
of
m
wanga
rosebery
want
to
stand
well
with
the
country
and
at
the
same
time
to
pacify
harcourt
and
twenty
five
thousand
pound
a
year
he
could
easily
persuade
harcourt
to
grant
we
be
still
engage
in
discuss
this
subject
when
the
f
o
messenger
return
with
another
letter
mackinnon
hand
tremble
as
he
open
it
and
when
he
have
fully
understood
the
letter
it
be
only
by
a
great
effort
he
be
able
to
suppress
his
emotion
the
letter
contain
but
a
few
line
to
the
effect
that
the
sum
demand
be
impossible
and
that
there
be
no
more
to
be
say
on
the
matter
from
that
day
my
dear
old
friend
become
less
cheerful
he
be
too
great
a
soul
to
lay
bare
his
feeling
but
those
who
knew
him
be
at
no
loss
to
find
that
the
kind
old
face
masked
a
good
deal
of
inward
suffer
have
one
question
me
about
him
i
should
have
say
i
believe
that
as
mackinnon
since
he
make
his
fortune
and
be
childless
devote
his
ripest
and
wise
year
and
the
great
part
of
his
fortune
to
tiiis
idea
which
like
the
king
of
the
belgian
he
have
of
make
an
african
state
valuable
to
his
government
and
people
he
be
struck
to
the
heart
by
rosebery
curt
refusal
to
consider
his
offer
and
his
determination
to
displace
the
company
by
the
government
have
rosebery
say
he
be
willing
to
allow
twenty
five
thousand
pound
mackinnon
would
have
accepted
it
rather
than
the
world
should
say
he
have
fail
east
africa
have
become
mackinnon
love
his
pride
and
the
one
important
object
of
life
mackinnon
soul
be
noble
his
mind
above
all
pettiness
his
life
be
now
bereft
of
its
object
and
the
mainspring
of
effort
have
be
remove
and
so
he
visibly
decline
and
death
come
in
kindness

good
business
with
the
ambitious
youth
who
wish
to
boast
of
have
sail
on
the
sea
when
they
return
from
their
holiday
the
seat
comfortably
fill
with
those
who
wish
to
fill
the
eye
with
the
sight
of
the
sea
and
the
ear
with
the
sound
of
artificial
music
blend
with
the
countless
whisper
of
the
wave
i
strode
down
this
parade
debate
many
thing
in
my
mind
i
go
past
a
military
or
naval
hospital
a
battery
of
old
fashion
muzzle
loader
which
i
fancy
be
not
of
much
use
except
as
mean
of
drilling
volunteer
then
i
come
to
a
tall
monument
to
nelson
at
a
point
of
land
give
up
to
rubbish
and
net
dry
when
i
found
that
i
have
be
travel
parallel
with
die
yare
and
be
now
at
its
mouth
i
cross
this
point
and
on
come
to
the
river
walk
up
along
the
interest
quay
i
be
well
reward
for
as
picturesque
a
sight
as
can
be
found
in
any
sea
side
town
in
any
country
met
me
the
river
be
narrow
not
quite
the
width
of
the
maritime
canal
of
suez
i
should
say
but
every
inch
of
it
seem
serviceable
to
commerce
the
useful
stream
be
crowd
with
coast
shipping
trawler
lugger
small
steamer
and
inland
barge
which
lie
mainly
in
a
long
line
alongside
this
quay
it
do
my
heart
good
to
see
the
deep
belly
strong
substantial
vessel
of
the
fisher
class
and
still
more
entertainment
i
obtain
in
view
the
tj
e
of
men
who
handle
the
fish
and
the
salt
the
seed
of
the
old
viking
and
anglian
invader
of
britain
be
all
round
me
as
fond
of
the
sea
as
their
brave
old
ancestor
i
saw
some
splendid
specimen
of
manhood
among
them
who
be
i
be
certain
as
proud
of
their
avocation
as
the
rothschild
can
be
of
banking
it
be
far
well
than
go
to
a
theatre
to
watch
the
healthy
fellow
swing
up
their
crate
of
salt
herring
the
gusto
of
hoist
hand
overhand
the
breezy
hearty
lightsomeness
of
action
the
face
as
truly
reflect
the
gladness
of
the
heart
as
the
summer
sea
obeys
the
summer
air
i
turn
away
deeply
gratify
by
the
sight
and
sure
that
these
fellow
thought
little
of
home
rule
and
other
disturb
question
on
reach
a
bridge
across
the
yare
i
found
myself
in
hall
quay
with
the
cromwell
house
star
crown
and
anchor
and
other
old
fashion
house
then
i
turn
into
one
of
the
row
as
the
narrow
alley
like
street
be
call
take
brief
glance
at
the
cheap
ware
for
sale
boot
shod
with
iron
the
nail
recall
memory
of
early
farm
life
muffler
of
past
day
two
penny
ha
penny
ware
in
general
suitable
for
the
slim
purse
of
poor
holiday
maker
then
after
a
long
tour
i
struck
into
a
street
run
towards
the
sea
where
the
quieter
people
love
to
brood
and
dream
away
their
summer
finally
i
come
to
the
queen
order
my
lunch
and
afterwards
take
train
to
norwich
as
i
be
not
yet
too
tire
for
sight
see
i
drove
to
the
cathedral
it
be
like
a
long
parish
church
within
the
gateway
be
grim
look
object
similar
to
many
i
have
see
elsewhere
but
quite
ancient
and
venerable
the
cloister
however
be
grand
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
foot
square
and
as
good
as
we
saw
in
italy
to
my
mind
the
close
have
a
remarkably
ecclesiastical
privacy
and
respectability
about
it
but
have
not
enough
greenery
green
sward
or
foliage
to
be
perfect
hence
i
wander
to
the
castle
about
which
i
have
read
so
much
in
a
lately
publish
romance
what
one
see
be
only
a
modem
representation
of
the
fine
old
keep
around
which
the
writer
have
woven
his
story
and
i
suppose
it
be
faithful
to
the
original
without
but
through
the
window
one
see
a
glass
roof
and
then
it
be
evident
that
the
building
be
only
a
shell
get
up
as
for
a
chicago
exhibition
the
mound
on
which
it
stand
and
the
deep
dry
ditch
around
be
sufficiently
ancient
as
i
walk
around
the
castle
old
norwich
look
enchant
i
cannot
tell
whether
the
town
be
worth
look
at
but
i
have
seldom
see
one
which
appear
to
promise
so
much
the
bad
of
these
old
town
be
that
their
hotel
be
always
so
depress
if
the
grand
hotel
of
cromer
be
at
yarmouth
it
would
totally
change
the
character
of
the
town
and
so
would
a
similar
one
for
norwich
on
the
continent
they
have
just
as
interest
old
town
to
show
the
visitor
but
they
have
also
good
hotel
yarteouth
beach
be
equal
to
that
of
cromer
but
the
hotel
be
deadly
dull
place
wdl
after
a
good
three
hour
walk
i
take
the
train
for
cromer
it
be
a
happy
thought
of
mine
come
here
i
love
to
look
at
the
sea
and
hear
the
window
rattle
and
the
sough
of
the
wave
and
between
me
and
these
delight
nothing
human
intervenes
for
the
sight
of
the
sea
be
well
than
the
sight
of
any
human
face
just
now
whenever
the
nerve
quiver
with
unrest
depend
upon
it
the
ocean
and
the
song
of
the
wind
be
more
soothe
than
anything
else
so
when
you
arrive
you
will
find
me
purify
and
renovate
somewhat
by
this
ogle
with
quiet
nature
cromer
october
how
i
do
begrudge
the
time
spent
on
trifle
interminable
waste
of
time
and
prodigal
waste
of
precious
life
as
though
our
hour
be
exhaustless
when
i
think
of
it
ah
but
no
more
that
way
madness
lie
oh
i
be
delighted
with
this
norfolk
air
and
this
hotel
this
rest
the
tranquillize
effect
the
deep
inhalation
the
pure
god
blest
air
the
wonderful
repose
of
the
sea
when
you
join
me
here
how
we
shall
enjoy
ourselves
yesterday
while
on
my
afternoon
walk
i
felt
such
a
gust
of
joy
such
a
rapturous
up
spring
of
joy
to
my
very
fingertip
that
i
be
all
amazement
at
its
suddenness
what
be
the
cause
only
three
mile
of
desert
sand
beach
a
wide
illimitable
sea
roll
from
the
east
roll
after
roll
of
white
topped
surge
sound
on
the
shore
deep
solemn
continuous
as
driven
by
a
breeze
which
penetrate
into
the
farthest
recess
of
die
lung
and
make
them
ache
with
fulness
and
whip
the
blood
into
a
glow
presently
i
respond
to
the
influence
i
condescend
to
stoop
and
whisk
the
round
pebble
on
the
glorious
floor
of
sand
smooth
as
asphalt
i
burst
out
into
song
fancy
i
year
and
year
ago
i
think
i
sang
the
spirit
be
in
an
ecstasy
for
the
music
of
the
wave
and
the
keen
salt
wind
laden
with
scent
of
the
sea
the
absolute
solitude
the
immensity
of
my
domain
cause
me
to
sing
for
joy
i
knew
there
be
something
of
my
real
old
self
the
lee
as
it
be
in
me
still
but
such
be
civilise
man
he
enters
a
groove
and
exit
there
be
none
until
solitariness
discovers
the
boy
lie
hidden
under
a
thick
husk
of
civilise
custom
this
solitude
be
so
glorious
we
must
try
and
secure
it
for
three
month
out
of
each
year
yes
this
be
g
orioas
no
africa
for
me
if
i
can
get
sudi
solitude
in
england
there
be
a
fox
terrier
here
the
duplicate
of
my
old
randy
in
africa
smooth
haired
the
white
like
cream
the
uac
oi
him
deep
sable
simply
beautiful
a
gentleman
all
over
understands
every
word
automatically
obsequious
ues
down
inrith
a
thump
rise
with
a
ring
make
face
like
an
actor
say
rat
he
want
to
tear
the
room
to
piece
he
be
sure
he
see
what
be
only
in
your
own
imagination
why
his
very
tail
be
eloquent
i
seem
to
understand
every
indination
or
perpendicular
of
it
this
dog
b
the
embodiment
of
alertness
and
intelligence
the
pity
of
it
be
he
be
not
for
sale
no
money
would
buy
him
i
would
give
twenty
pound
for
him
i
should
so
like
you
to
realise
what
a
perfect
dog
can
be
your
patience
may
make
something
of
our
dog
in
time
but
his
nature
be
not
gentle
to
begin
with
this
dog
as
i
say
be
a
gentleman
yet
while
gentle
to
friend
bold
as
a
lion
to
all
vermin
human
and
other
he
attract
my
attention
three
day
ago
as
he
be
outride
the
hotel
door
beseeching
to
come
in
he
saw
me
take
a
step
as
though
to
go
on
my
way
his
eye
become
more
limpid
he
whine
have
he
spoken
english
i
could
not
have
understood
him
well
i
november
th
i
left
manchester
yesterday
at
noon
and
arrive
in
london
at
p
m
and
found
a
mild
kind
of
november
fog
and
damp
cold
weather
here
after
an
anchorite
dinner
with
a
bottle
of
apouinaris
i
drove
off
to
the
smoking
concert
at
the
lambedi
the
programme
consists
of
comic
song
ballad
and
recitation
as
usual
just
when
the
smoke
be
amount
to
asphyxiation
i
be
ask
to
say
a
few
word
i
saw
that
my
audience
be
more
than
usually
mixed
very
boyish
young
fellow
young
girl
and
many
not
very
intellectual
look
men
and
woman
the
subject
chosen
by
me
be
the
matabele
war
and
the
present
coal
war
or
strike
in
order
to
make
the
matabele
war
comprehensible
to
the
majority
i
have
to
use
the
vernacular
freely
and
describe
the
state
of
thing
in
south
africa
just
as
i
would
to
a
camp
of
soldier
in
do
this
i
make
use
of
the
illustration
of
an
englishman
living
in
a
rent
house
be
interfere
with
in
his
domestic
government
by
a
burly
landlord
who
insist
on
come
into
his
house
at
all
hour
of
the
day
and
club
his
servant
and
who
on
the
pretence
of
search
for
his
lose
d
and
cat
in
his
tenant
house
march
away
with
the
englishman
dog
and
other
trifle
you
who
know
the
englishman
i
go
on
when
in
his
house
after
he
have
paid
his
rent
and
all
just
debt
you
can
best
tell
what
his
conduct
would
be
it
strike
me
i
say
that
the
average
man
would
undoubtedly
boot
the
landlord
and
land
him
in
the
street
pretty
quickly
well
just
what
the
englishman
in
lambeth
would
do
cecil
rhodes
do
in
south
africa
with
lobengula
he
paid
his
rent
regularly
one
thousand
two
hundred
pound
a
year
or
so
besides
many
hundred
of
rifle
and
ammunition
to
match
and
other
gift
for
the
right
to
manage
mashona
land
as
he
saw
fit
now
in
the
concession
to
rhodes
lobengula
have
reserve
no
right
to
meddle
in
the
territory
therefore
when
under
the
plea
that
his
cattle
have
be
steal
by
rhodes
servant
or
subject
the
mashonas
lobengula
march
into
rhodes
territory
and
slaughter
the
mashonas
and
take
the
white
man
cattle
besides
create
a
general
scare
among
the
outlying
farmer
and
the
isolated
miner
jameson
who
be
act
as
rhodes
steward
sent
the
sub
agent
lendy
upon
the
track
of
the
high
hand
matabele
hence
the
war
this
little
exposition
take
amazingly
and
there
be
not
one
dissentient
voice
about
the
coal
war
i
be
equally
frank
and
say
in
conclusion
that
if
i
have
any
money
to
spare
at
the
present
time
it
would
not
be
give
to
men
who
be
determine
to
be
sulky
and
who
to
spite
the
coal
owner
prefer
to
starve
but
to
those
poor
strive
people
who
though
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
dispute
between
miner
and
coal
owner
have
to
bear
the
same
misery
which
the
miner
be
suppose
to
suffer
from
and
who
be
oblige
to
pinch
and
economise
in
food
in
order
not
to
be
without
coal
this
drew
a
tremendous
burst
of
cheer
and
aye
aye
that
be
true
some
very
bad
cigar
and
black
coffee
be
thrust
upon
me
and
i
have
to
take
a
cigar
and
a
teaspoonful
of

me
any
good
yesterday
i
read
w
t

last

and
make
i
thiftk
it
be
very
good

aim
to
be
the

for
such
people
as
cannot
so
well
provide
for
themselves
he
be
full
of
idea
and
i
marvel
how
he
manages
to
find
time
to
write
as
he
do
he
have
mortgage
his
life
for
the
benefit
of
the
many
sheep
in
london
who
look
to
him
as
to
a
shepherd
the
daily
paper
of
which
i
have
a
specimen
may
be
make
very
useful
and
i
hope
he
will
succeed
with
it
but
it
do
not
touch
the
need
of
the
aristocratic
learn
and
the
upper
middle
class
some
day
i
hope
some
other
type
of

will
think
of
them
and
bring

in

it

to
be

on
good

and
decent
type
the
editorial
should
be
short
the
paper
should
not
be
large
than
the
spectator
and
the

should
be

i
quite
s

the
applause

to
my
astonishment

all
my
pain
to
prune
it
down
it
last
one
hour
and
fifty
minute
in
delivery
as
i
drew
near
the
catastrophe
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
and
i
really
felt
emotional
and
be
conscious
that
every
soul
sympathise
with
me
when
i
come
to
the
meeting
of
the
avenger
of
blood
and
his
victim
emin
strange
i
read
in
a
tel
ram
in
the
standard
which
come
to
the
house
before
i
left
that
say
bin
abed
the
avenger
have
be
caught
by
the
belgian
officer
at
kirundu
which
i
know
well
be
condemn
to
death
and
shot
thus
retribution
overtook
him
too
few
in
this
country
know
that
i
be
the
prime
cause
of
this
advance
of
the
belgian
against
the
arab
slave
raider
indeed
people
little
realise
how
i
have
practically
destroyed
this
terrible
slave
trade
by
cut
it
down
at
its
very
root
i
have
also
be
as
fatal
to
tippu

his
nephew
who
capture
stanley

as
abed
bin
salim
be
call
as
if
i
have
lead
the
avenger
myself
which
i
be
very
much
solicit
to
do
it
have
all
be
part
of
the
policy
i
chalked
out
for
myself
in
africa
and
urge
repeatedly
on
the
king
of
the
belgian
at
every
interview
i
have
have
with
him
with
one
paramount
object
in
view
the
destruction
of
the
slave
traffic
at
this
very
time
we
have
a
great
scheme
which
must
not
be
disclose
no
not
even
to
you
yet
but
which
you
may
rest
assure
be
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
that
dark
humanity
in
the
lualaba
r
on
of
course
military
men
especially
continentals
be
rather
more
severe
than
i
should
have
be
for
if
i
have
caught
say
bin
abed
i
should
have
sent
him
to
belgium
even
though
he
murder
emin
or
have
murder
a
friend
but
the
suppression
of
the
arab
have
to
be
and
my
prophecy
to
charles
allen
of
the
anti
slavery
cause
that
i
make
to
him
in
june
have
come
to
pas
i
say
that
in
the
next
five
year
i
should
have
do
more
for
the
anti
slavery
cause
than
all
the
anti
slavery
society
in
europe
could
have
do
and
it
be
do
in
the
complete
conquest
of
those
see
page
receiver
and
laidefs
who
have
be
so
oiten
mention
in
my
lecture
the
king
do
not
wish
to
proceed
to
esctremes
but
i
drove
home
every
argument
i
could
think
of
each
time
i
met
him
or
write
to
prove
that
it
be
essential
yet
i
say
at
the
first
sign
of
submission
remember
mercy
but
exercise
it
only
when
they
have
laid
down
their
arm
when
the
belgian
have
reach
tanganyika
lpake
and
either
drive
the
survive
arab
across
the
lake
or
into
unconditional
submission
the
work
may
be
consider
over
the
death
of
so
many
of
my
officer
and
men
will
then
have
be
amply
avenge
and
an
era
of
peace
for
the
poor
persecute
native
will
begin
mr
phillpots
the
headmaster
i
forgot
to
say
introduce
me
very
nicely
indeed
by
touch
on
the
six
journey
i
have
make
to
africa
leave
me
to
speak
upon
the
seventh
after
the
lecture
mr
phillpots
and
all
the
master
sup
at
mr
talbot
and
i
be
in
such
a
vein
that
i
kept
them
all
up
until
it
be
a
little
after
i
a
m
i
be
horrify
and
soon
after
the
departure
of
the
guest
i
jumped
into
bed
and
be
fast
asleep
within
a
few
minute
i
be
at
the
second
volume
of
lowell
and
time
fly
by
so
rapidly
that
i
will
not
be
able
to
read
lugard
book
for
a
few
day
yet
the
first
volume
of
lowell
letter
give
us
a
pretty
clear
idea
of
the
man
i
see
in
him
the
type
of
a
literary
character
whose
nature
i
have
often
be
make
acquaint
with
in
the
past
though
not
in
quite
so
culture
a
form
as
in
lowell
but
with
all
his
culture
learn
and
poetry
and
though
he
be
so
kind
hearted
love
sympathetic
ready
to
oblige
he
be
what
i
should
call
in
england
provincial
in
every
feel
though
i
never
saw
lowell
face
to
face
i
feel
as
if
i
could
make
a
presentment
of
every
characteristic
lineament
his
walk
gesture
bearing
the
smile
on
his
face
the
genial
bluish
grey
eye
even
to
his
inch
these
letter
however
only
reveal
the
generous
temper
humour
mood
and
his
fond
weakness
we
should
know
more
about
his
inward
thought
his
best
view
of
men
and
matter
political
literary
social
etc
etc
to
get
a
complete
knowledge
of
him
these
letter
only
refer
to
lowell
and
his
immediate
acquaintance
and
there
be
very
few
thing
in
them
that
a
reader
would
care
to
hear
twice
i
could
scarcely
point
to
a
dozen
sentence
all
told
that
compel
a
pause
how
different
this
be
from
what
one
could
show
in
ruskin
the
prose
poet
of
england
or
in
carlyle
or
in
boswell
johnson
or
in
de
quincey
even
yet
i
admit
it
be
unfair
to
judge
lowell
by
his
letter
only
and
that
we
should
examine
his
prose
and
poetry
before
decide
twice
only
be
i
thrill
just
a
little
and
then
from
sympathy
with
the
bereave
husband
and
father
have
lowell
kept
a
journal
like
sir
walter
scott
i
feel
the
world
would
have
have
something
worth
reading
sometimes
i
appear
to
look
as
through
a
window
into
the
heart
of
the
writer
and
his
correspondent
there
be
something
too
frequent
also
in
the
phrase
i
do
not
care
what
you
think
of
my
book
but
i
want
you
to
like
me
i
do
not
wish
to
pursue
this
theme
for
fear
you
will
get
the
impression
that
i
do
not
like
lowell
but
i
do
heartily
like
him
and
again
i
think
his
journal
would
have
be
infinitely
well
november
th
this
year
have
be
fatal
to
my
friend
mackinnon
parke
and
now
my
best
friend
alexan
der
low
bruce
he
be
one
of
the
staunchest
wise
trustiest
men
i
ever
knew
this
england
have
some
other
men
as
worthy
as
sensible
as
good
as
he
but
it
be
not
likely
it
will
be
my
good
fortune
to
meet
again
a
man
of
this
kind
to
whom
i
could
expose
all
that
be
in
my
breast
with
full
reliance
on
his
sympathy
and
his
honour
i
always
felt
that
bruce
be
like
a
dear
brother
to
me
november
th
this
be
the
severest
blow
i
have
yet
receive
bruce
be
more
of
my
own
age
than
either
mackinnon
or
parke
and
it
be
perhaps
owe
in
a
measure
to
that
fact
that
his
view
of
men
and
affair
be
more
congenial
or
more
in
harmony
with
my
own
mackinnon
belong
to
an
old
generation
and
be
the
centre
of
many
interest
in
which
i
have
no
concern
parke
again
be
of
a
young
generation
and
with
all
his
sweet
simple
nature
i
found
it
difficult
to
maintain
that
level
of
idea
which
belong
to
his
age
but
with
bruce
it
be
wholly
a
far
reference
to
lowell
be
give
in
the
letter
date
november
d
s
a
l

and
greatly

of
stanley
d
s
different
his
judgement
be

and
he
be
in
the
free
exercise
of
his
developed
faculty
he
be
originally
of
a
strong
fibre
than
either
mackinnon
or
parke
i
e
from
the
common
sense
point
of
view
he
might
not
have
the
bold
business
audacity
of
mackinnon
nor
his
keen
foresight
fc
investment
but
his
level
headedness
be
more
marked
one
felt
that
bruce
judgement
could
be
trust
not
only
in
business
matter
but
in
every
concern
include
in
practical
life
he
be
not
a
literary
man
but
truly
imperial
and
highly
intelligent

with
such
large
sympathy
that
nothing
appertain
to
british
interest
be
too
great
or
too
small
for
him
in
politics
he
be
simply
indefatigable
in

of
the
union
formerly
a
liberal
like
myself
gladstone
sudden

too
much
for
him
which
prof

to
principle
than
to
whim
the
amount
of
correspondence

him

the
influence
he

south

schnething
extraor

his
bill
for
postage
must
have
be
unusual
his
industry
be
incredible
his
labour
do
not
fray
that
kindly
temper
of
his
in
the
least
nor
diminish
the
hearty
friendly
glance
of
his
eye
i
know
no
man
living
among
my
acquaintance
who
take
life
with
such
a
delightful
sense
of
enjoyment
and
appear
so
uniformly
content
consider
his
remarkably
penetrative
discernment
of
character
this
be
the
more
to
be
wonder
at
i
really
envy
him
for
this
he
could
look
into
the
face
of
a
declare
opponent
and
though
i
watch
i
could
not
detect
the
slightest
waver
of
that
honest
clear
straight
look
of
kindness
which
be
a
recognise
characteristic
of
bruce
i
could
not
do
it
when
i
love
i
love
and
when
i
disagree
i
cannot
hide
it
i
should
say
though
i
do
not
pretend
to
that
intimate
knowledge
of
his
boyhood
that
a
relative
or
school
mate
might
have
his
life
must
have
be
a
happy
one
it
be
nearly
twenty
year
since
i
first
knew
him
and
during
that
time
there
have
be
a
steady
growth
of
affection
and
esteem
for
him
i
could
have
heea
content
on
a
desert
island
with
bruce
because
contact
with
him
make
one
feel
strong
and
nobler
well
my
dear
know
and
love
bruce
as
you
know
i
do
you
can
appreciate
my
present
u
these
repeat
blow
make
me
less
and
less
regardful
of
worldliness
in
every
form
indeed
i
have
do
with
the
world
though
there
be
a
number
of
little
thing
that
i
should
do
before
quite
surrender
myself
to
the
inevitable
i
wonder
indeed
that
i
be
still
here
i
who
during
thirty
five
year
have
be
subject
to
the
evil
of
almost
every
climate
rack
by
over
three
hundred
fever
dose
with
an
inconceivable
quantity
of
medicine
shaken
through
every
nerve
by
awful
experience
yet
here
i
be
and
bruce
and
parke
and
mackinnon
be
go
i
write
this
to
day
as
sound
apparently
as
when
i
start
on
my
wandering
but
then
a
week
hence
where
shall
i
be
november
th
my
dear
d
i
finish
volume
two
of
lowell
letter
yesterday
my
former
opinion
need
slight
modification
or
rather
expansion
it
be
incomplete
as
any
opinion
of
an
unfinished
career
must
be
but
now
that
the
career
be
end
and
the
life
be
close
i
be
at
liberty
to
amplify
what
i
would
willingly
have
say
at
once
of
any
promising
man
who
have
continued
in
consistent
goodness
that
the
expectation
form
have
be
fulfil
soon
after
begin
the
second
volume
the
attention
be
not
so
often
arrest
by
sign
of
youthful
vanity
he
have
no
sooner
pass
middle
age
than
one
love
for
the
writer
grows
more
and
more
complete
he
be
a
litterateur
above
all
thing
to
the
last
but
you
also
observe
his
growth
from
letter
to
letter
into
a
noble
hearted
affectionate
upright
old
man
he
be
not
free
to
the
closing
letter
of
the
lowellian
imperfection
but
these
do
not
detract
from
the
esteem
which
i
find
to
be
increase
for
him
like
the
weakness
of
some
of
one
personal
friend
i
rather
like
lowell
the
well
for
them
for
they
lighten
one
mood
of
severe
respect
towards
him
after
dip
into
one
or
two
specimen
of
poetry
which
the
book
contains
his
letter
do
not
reveal
him
wholly
in
my
opinion
there
be
one
to
thoebe
which
deeply
move
me
and
i
feel
convince
there
must
be
gem
of
thought
among
his
poetical
production
as
i
close
the
book
lowell
image
though
i
never
saw
him
come
vividly
before
me
as
he
sat
in
elmwood
library
listen
to
the
leafy
swirl
without
the
strange
sound
make
by
wind
in
his
ample
chimney
and
the
shrill
call
wee
wee
of
the
mouse
behind
the
white
wainscot
ing
may
his
cover
of
earth

and

soul

perfect
conununion

his

of
the

to
begin
the
work
of
make
know
the

heart
of

and
he
be
deservedly
the
most
famous
burton
as
a
restless
wanderer
in
foreign
land
and
a
remarkable
and
indefatigable
writer
speke
the
hunter
explorer
with
strong
geographical
instinct
be
second
to
livingstone
for
his
exploration
baker
as
a
hunter
carry
his
hunt
into
unknown
part
and
distinguish
himself
by
his
discovery
of
the
albert
nyanza
and
by
his
adventure
the
prince
of
wale
become
interested
in
him
and
through
the
influence
of
the
prince
he
be
appoint
egyptian
proconsul
of
the
upper
nile
region
at
a
munificent
salary
baker
be
not
an
explorer
in
the
sense
that
livingstone
and
speke
be
and
consequently
beyond
the
discovery
of
the
existence
of
the
albert
lake
he
do
little
to
make
the
upper
nile
region
know
the
record
of
his
five
year
rather
violent
administration
of
equatoria
be
give
in
his
book
call
ismailia
and
it
will
be
see
there
that
he
left
the
r
on
surround
ismailia
almost
as
unknown
after
his
term
of
service
be
over
as
when
he
reach
it
to
begin
his
duty
as
administrator
apart
from
this
however
he
be
a
fine
fellow
physically
strong
masterful
and
sensible
as
a
brave
hunter
he
be
unmatched
as
a
writer
of
travel
he
be
a
great
success
he
be
a
typical
conservative
englishman
he
knew
by
intuition
what
englishman
like
to
hear
of
their
countryman
doings
which
add
to
his
artistic
style
of
write
charm
his
reader
another
thing
to
his
credit
be
it
say
by
me
who
know
whereof
i
be
speak
he
be
too
great
in
mind
and
too
dignify
in
character
to
belong
to
any
geographical
clique
and
join
in
the
partisan
warfare
which
rag
in
savile
row
between
he
rather
take
the
opposite
way
and
do
not
disdain
to
speak
a
good
word
for
any
explorer
who
happen
to
be
an
object
of
attack
at
the
time
november
th
the
death
of
another
friend
be
to
day
announce
this
time
it
be
charles
ekiward
ingham
ex
guardsman
and
missionary
whom
i
employ
in
for
my

report
as
have
be
kill
by
an

it
be
not

in
these

the
death
of
his
good
and
beautiful
wife
this
devote
couple
be
wonderful
for
their
piety
and
their
devotion
to
the
negro
of

congo
early
in
stanley
caught
cold
and
have
a
succession
of
malarial
attack

and
he
go
to
the
isle
of
wight
where
i
join
him
a
few
day
later
i
here
give
extract
from
his
letter
shanklin
march
th
i
come
here
from
freshwater
because
that
place
do
not
agree
with
me
and
because
the
accommodation
provide
be
wretched
and
the
room
ill
ventilate
i
wonder
how
many
people
die
in
the
room
i
occupy
i
fancy
their
spirit
sail
about
from
corner
to
comer
try
to
get
out
into
the
air
and
at
night
settle
around
my
head
disturb
my
sleep
in
consequence
i
have
be
reading
vasari
machiavelli
and
i
be
thankful
to
say
he
have
remove
the
disagreeable
impression
i
have
conceive
of
his
principle
from
a
book
i
read
about
him
twenty
five
year
ago
or
perhaps
my
more
mature
age
have
enable
me
to
understand
him
well
vasari
give
one
chapter
of
comment
from
various
writer
on
him
but
the
one
that
come
near
the
right
judgonent
on
him
be
bacon
who
say
that
gratitude
be
due
to
him
and
to
those
like
him
who
study
that
which
men
do
instead
of
that
which
they
ought
to
do
in
fact
machiavelli
have
wriu
ten
about
contemporaneous
italy
just
as
we
speak
privately
but
dare
not
talk
openly
of
our
political
worid
when
we
described
gladstone
before
his
retirement
we
call
him
by
the
euphonious
term
of
the
old
parliamentary
hand
what
do
we
mean
by
that
we
who
be
his
opponent
we
meant
it
in
this
strictly
machiavellian
sense
this
would
once
have
shock
me
just
as
many
of
the
florentine
critic
especially
frederick
the
great
affected
to
be
yet

and
napoleon
and
almost
every
eminent
elnglish
politician

to
the

to
hear

again

be
struck
by
the
want
of
the
proper
spirit
which
make
the
orator
his
appearance
especially
his
head
large
brow
and
sonorous
voice

diction
all
befit
the
orator
but
the
kindle
animation
that
fire
which
warms
an
audience
be
absent
the
listener
must
need
follow
a
nage
like
the
marquis
with
interest
but
what
an
event
it
would
be
in
the
memory
of
those
who
haunt
political
gathering
of
this
kind
if
suddenly
he
drop
his
apparent
list
lessness
and
be
to
speak
like
a
man
of
genuine
feel
to
feel
men
it
would
be
a
sight
to
see
the
effect
on
the
warmhearted
audience
i
christmas
we
spent
on
the
riviera
and
here
stanley
write
part
of
his
autobiography
which
he
have
commenced
the
year
before
monte
carlo
have
write
a
few
page
of
my
autobiography
but
these
spasmodic
touch
be
naturally
detrimental
to
style
n
l
mlim
fff
y
and
with
a
steady
lookt
voy
characteristic
say
quietly
gentle
men
i
thank
you
and
now
good
night
in
a
few
minute
he
and
i
be
step
into
a
hansom
cab
in
a
back
street
during
the
drive
we
do
not
sp
ik
in
the
hall
of
our
home
i
thought
he
would
say
something
about
the
victory
but
he
only
smile
at
me
and
say
i
think
we
both
need
rest
and
now
for
a
pipe
we
both
as
stanley
say
need
rest
i
be
tire
out
and
left
london
for
the
engadine
whilst
stanley
remain
for
the
opening
of
parliament
he
promise
to
keep
a
journal
of
his
first
impression
of
the
house
of
common
and
sent
the
page
to
me
day
by
day
i
here
give
extract
from
that
journal
of
one
week
in
the
house
of
common
august
i
th
the
architect
of
the
house
must
have
be
very
deficient
in
sense
of
proportion
it
seem
to
me
i
think
of
all
the
parliament
house
i
ever
saw
i
be
oblige
to
confess
that
any
of
the
state
house
in
america
would
offer
superior
accommodation
to
the
member
where
be
the
desk
for
the
member
the
comfortable
independent
chair
the
convenience
for
make
note
and
keep
paper
in
contrast
to
what
my
mind
recall
of
other

but
nothing
have
be
spent
on

then
again
the
arrangement
the
two
party
oppose
in
feel
and
principle
have
here
to
confront
one
another
and
present
their
side
to
the
speaker
instead
of
their
face
surely
we
ought
to
find
something
more
congenial
to
look
at
than
sour
look
opponent
at
ten
minute
to
two
i
be
back
in
the

and
under
the
gallery
as
well
as
both
doorway
then
the
house
hush
and
in
come
an
officer
from
the
lord
in
old
fashion
costume
of
black
and
a
wig
gingerly
carry
a
gild
rod
he
walk
trippingly
along
the
floor
of
the
house
to
our
table
at
which
sat
three
old
fashion
and
be
gown
officer
and
deliver
a
mess
e
in
a
not
very
dear
voice
whereupon
the
centre
officer
stood
up
and
advanced
from
behind
the
table
towards
him
the
one
with
the
gild
rod
trip
mindngly
backward
when
they
be
both
near
the
door
g
j
goschen
and
a
few
other
leader
strode
after
him
then
from
either
side
of
the
house
member
pour
and
form
procession
until
there
be
probably
three
hundred
in
it
we
mardied
through
the
passage
in
two
and
three
pas
ing
two
great
hall
crowd
with
visitor
many
of
whom
be
lady
we
halt
at
the
bar
of
the
lord
then
i
knew
we
be
in
the
gild
chamber
which
have
be
so
often
spoken
about
lately
this
be
my
first
view
of
it
and
i
look
about
me
curiously
to
call
it
a
gild
chamber
be
a
simple
exaggeration
there
be
not
enough
gild
for
it
to
merit
that
term
it
be
nearly
empty
there
be
about
sixteen
peer
in
their
seat
four
scarlet
gown
cock
hat
gentleman
sat
in
front
of
the
throne
and
some
twenty
lady
occupy
the
settee
on
the
right
as
soon
as
our
common
officer
whom
we
have
follow
have
enter
the
clerk
of
the
lord
stand
between
him
and
the
scarlet
gown
four
commenced
reading
from
an
elaborately
engrave
parchment
he
be
well
into
his
subject
before
i
could
get
near
enough
to
the
bar
to
hear
his
voice
i
could
not
distinguish
any
word
he
say
but
when
he
conclude
the
lord
chancellor
i
suppose
it
be
he
read
in
a
much
clearer
voice
some
message
to
the
effect
that
we
could
proceed
to
elect
a
speaker
when
he
conclude
he
and
his
three
friend
take
off
their
hat
at
which
we
retire
betaking
ourselves
to
our
own
house
through
the
long
paa
mge
by
which
we
have
left
i
met
many
friend
but
i
have
not
be
able
to
exchange
twelve
sensible
word
with
any
of
them
except
mr
charles
darling
q
c
m
p
and
colonel
denny
m
p
all
the
rest
appear
to
be
in
a
perfect
fever
they
no
sooner
grasp
your
hand
and
pour
out
congratulation
than
they
turn
away
to
another
person
and
during
their
glib
greeting
keep
look
away
to
someone
else
i
search
the
face
on
the
radical
bench
to
see
if
i
recognise
john
bum
and
james
j
o
kelly
i
would
not
be
sure
of
o
kelly
because
he
be
so
different
from
the
slim
young
man
i
knew
in
madrid
in
twenty
three
year
ago
it
be
too
early
yet
to
say
whether
i
shall
like
the
house
or
not
if
there
be
much
behaviour
like
that
of
dr
tanner
in
it
i
shall
not
but
it
be
ominous
to
me
that
the
man
can
be
permit
to
behave
so
badly
william
allen
the
northumbrian
be
a
prominent
figure
among
the
radical
with
his
american
felt
hat
and
loud
grey
now
sir
chailes
darling
judge
in
the
king
bench
drnsion
suit
he
be
certainly
a
massive
fellow
and
i
be
halmnclined
to
think
that
he
be
rather
vain
under
all
that
radical
affectation
of
unkemptness
if
true
it
be
a
pity
for
he
must
have
a
good
heart
and
plenty
of
good
sense
i
have
write
this
out
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
while
all
be
fresh
in
my
mind
mayhap
i
will
send
you
more
of
the
hasty
diary
the
day
after
to
morrow
second
day
a
parliament
of
her
majesty
reign
august
th
r
walk
down
to
the
house
at
a
m
member
be
just
ban
to
arrive
secure
my
seat
this
time
on
an
upper
bench
behind
our
leader
that
i
might
be
away
from
the
neighbourhood
of
that
ill
mannered
dr
tanner
and
not
m
ii
m
to
the
scowl
radical
i
strode
through
the
passage
to
the
big
ante
hall
where
i
found
the
member
have
begin
to
gather
one
come
to
me
with
level
eye
and
be
about
to
indulge
in
an
ejaculation
when
i
say
i
almost
think
i
know
you
by
your
look
you
ca
not
be
o
kelly
he
soften
and
answer
yes
upon
which
of
course
i
express
my
surprise
that
this
stout
figure
could
be
the
slim
young
man
i
knew
in
madrid
twenty
three
year
ago
at
that
time
he
have
just
be
release
from
a
cuban
prison
and
have
be
sent
to

by
the
cuban
authority
sickle
the
american
minister
obtain
his
release
on
parole
now
here
he
stood
transform
into
an
elderly
legislator
i
gently
chaffed
him
that
know
i
have
be
in
london
so
many
year
he
have
never
sought
my
acquaintance
tell
me
honestly
i
say
be
it
not
because
you
have
become
such
an
important
public
man
it
confuse
him
a
little
but
o
kelly
and
i
be
always
pretty
direct
with
each
other
just
near
me
be
the
worthy
kimber
of
wandsworth
i
turn
to
him
and
say
now
come
have
some
tenderness
for
a
strainer
and
tell
me
something
of
someone
may
we
not
sit
together
for
this
one
time
and
let
me
hear
from
you
who
be
who
by
all
mean
come
he
say
gaily
and
as
it
be
draw
near
noon
we
enter
the
house
and
we
take
our
seat
near
old
sir

i
be
fairly

quite
two

parliamentary
life
the
th
inst
be
the
begin
of
work
i
be
at
prayer
for
the
first
time
canon
farrar
officiate
there
be
a
short
exhortation
when
we
turn
our
face
to
the
wall
and
repeat
the
lord
prayer
after
him
after
which
we
have
three
short
prayer
and
the
grace
and
it
be
over
i
notice
the
member
join
heartily
on
our
side
in
the
lord
prayer
it
be
at
such
time
that
englishman
appear
best
to
me
they
yield
themselves
unreservedly
to
the
custom
of
their
forefather
in
utter
defiance
of
the
blatant
atheism
of
the
age
the
ceremony
be
sweetly
simple
yet
it
move
me
and
in
my
heart
i
honour
every
member
the
more
for
it
i
thought
of
solomon
beautiful
prayer
for
understand
and
the
object
of
these
supplication
be
for
assistance
in
liie
right
do
of
the
legislative
work
before
the
house
the
speaker
have
grown
sensibly
in
my
estimation
since
the
first
day
when
he
sat
in
the
rank
on
the
radical
bench
then
he
appear
a
clever
legal
look
member
of
somewhat
high
colour
a
veritable
pleydell
scott
guy
mannering
though
i
have
see
him
in
his
process
of
transformation
into
the
first
commoner
i
be
not
quite
prepared
for
this
increase
respect
i
suppose
the
form
and
ceremony
attend
his
come
and
go
the
ready
obedience
and
respect
of
every
member
and
official
have
somewhat
to
do
with
my
conversion
i
feel
as
if
we
be
go
to
be
proud
of
him
the
seconder
of
the
address
be
our
friend
robertson
of
hackney
who
be
in
court
dress
he
spoke
well
but
wander
discursively
into
matter
that
seem
to
have
no
application
to
the
address
he
refer
slightly
by
innuendo
to
me
as
be
in
the
house
with
a
large
knowledge
of
africa
dr
tanner
contravene
the
usage
of
the
house
cry
out
that
be
stanley
after
robertson
up
rise
sir
william
harcourt
in
a
ponderous
way
extremely
old
fashion
and
histrionic
i
use
in
my
boyhood
to
fancy
this
style
be
very
grand
but
with
more
mature
intelligence
i
cannot
say
i
admire
it
it
be
so
markedly
stage
like
that
i
feel
a
resentful
contempt
for
it
all
the
time
i
thought
how
much
well
his
speech
would
sound
if
he
left
off
that
ponderous
manner
and
be
more
natural
he
no
doubt
have
the
gift
of
speech
but
the
style
be
superfluous
it
be
slow
and
heavy
remind
one
of
the
heavy
gentleman
of
a
past
age
on
the
board
play
the
justice
and
naturally
chaff
come
in
freely
for
it
all
seem
part
of
the
comedy
balfour
call
it
easy
badinage
but
that
be
his
polite
way
i
find
that
the
art
of
speak
have
not
be
cultivate
each
speaker
so
far
have
shewn
that
he
posse
matter
abundantly
word
flow
easily
which
make
readable
speech
but
while
i
do
not
expect
where
it
be
not
need
any
oratorical
vehemence
or
action
i
do
expect
what
i
might
call
the
oratorical
deportment
such
as
would
fit
the
subject
matter
the
speaker
have
word
and
intonation
that
ought
with
improve
manner
to
elevate
them
in
the
mind
of
the
listener
their
hand
fidget
about
book
and
paper
their
body
sway
in
contrary
attitude
to
the
sentiment
i
attribute
this
to
want
of
composure
bom
of
nervousness
yet
such
veteran
speaker
by
this
time
ought
to
be
above
be
flurry
by
a
sympathetic
house
balfour
come
next
with
a
long
speech
which
be
undoubtedly
a
relief
sir
charles
dilke
jumped
up
after
balfour
and
he
seem
to
me
to
come
nearer
to
what
i
have
be
expect
to
see
his
voice
be
showy
but
not
so
sweet
as
balfour
his
manner
be
cool
compose
and
more
appropriate
to
the
spirit
of
debate
as
i
conceive
it
there
be
an
absence
of
all
affectation
so
that
he
be
vastly
preferable
to
harcourt
it
be
a
cultivate
style
he
seem
to
be
sure
of
his
f
act
there
be
no
deprecation
neither
be
there
haughtiness
he
be
professionally
courteous
and
hold
himself
best
of
all
with
the
sweet
voice
of
balfour
his
own
composure
and
self
possession
i
think
dilke
would
have
be
superior
to
all
mr
seton
karr
be
also
excellent
matter
style
bearing
most
become
no
hesitancy
doubt
or
awkwardness
visible
good
temper
too
his
subject
be
not
such
as
to
call
for
exertion
of
power
but
he
be
decidedly
agreeable
up
rise
mr
haldane
and
give
us
a
lecture
extremely
bantering
in
tone
his
whole
pose
be
so
different
from
all
his
predecessor
the
solemn
ponderousness
and
affected
respect
for
the
house
of
harcourt
the
deprecate
manner
of
balfour
the
professional
gravity
of
dilke
be
so
opposite
to
the
gage
throw
style
of
haldane
he
be
a
combatant
and
only
bides
his
chance
john
redmond
follow
with
a
plain
matter
of
fact
but
good
speech
he
do
not
aim
at
make
impression
but
to
deliver
himself
of
a
duty
john
dillon
be
next
he
also
have
a
thin
voice
and
speaks
well
but
while
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
excite
excessive
admiration
he
win
our
respect
and
friendly
tolerance
there
be
no
arrogance
but
he
impress
one
as
well
meaning
though
blindly
devote
to
meaner
glory
for
his
country
and
wholly
unconscious
of
the
grander
glory
that
he
might
obtain
for
ireland
if
he
have
good
sense
after
dillon
follow
gerald
balfour
with
his
brother
arthur
voice
and
manner
he
win
pur
r
ard
for
him
personally
and
we
feel
sure
as
he
go
on
that
the
speaker
have
a
lofty
idea
of
his
duty
and
that
he
will
do
it
too
though
he
die
for
it
there
be
not
a
single
phrase
that
express
anything
of
the
kind
but
the
air
be
unmistakeable
neither
bludgeon
nor
knife
nor
pistol
held
to
his
head
would
make
him
budge
from
the
performance
of
duty
it
be
a
noble
pair
of
brother
arthur
and
he
we
be
all
proud
of
them
they
be
fine
personality
out
and
out
the
impossible
dr
tanner
however
found
that
he
could
make
objection
to
them
i
be
quite
thirty
five
foot
away
from
him
and
yet
i
heard
him
call
him
gerald
the
baby
babydoes
n
t
know
oh
they
be
only
snob
etc
etc
there
be
sixty
gentleman
on
our
side
who
heard
tanner
but
all
they
say
be
order
order
this
to
me
be
a
wonderful
instance
of
the
courtesy
to
be
found
in
the
house
sixty
big
strap
gentleman
can
sit
still
and
hear
their
chief
insult
and
call
snob
and
only
call
order
order
tay
pay
follow
which
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
brogue
would
have
be
equal
to
the
best
speech
of
the
house
he
might
have
be
curran
shiel
o
connell
and
burke
combine
but
the
brogue
would
have
reduce
his
oratory
to
third
rate
nevertheless
in
the
construction
copiousness
command
of
word
and
easy
compose
bearing
he
deserves
to
rank
with
dilke
but
the
sibilancy
of
his
word
distracts
the
ear
and
that
be
a
pity
he
can
be
animate
though
and
at
the
right
time
he
make
good
play
with
gerald
balfour
expression
of
an
unchanging
and
an
inflexible
opposition
to
home
rule
i
have
always
care
for
tay
pay
at
midnight
we
rise
and
left
the
house
before
i
have
finish
my
pipe
and
a
chapter
of

this
rapid
sketch
for
my
wife
august
th
yesterday
be
one
of
the
most
weary
day
i
have
experienced
since
leave
africa
to
secure
a
seat
at
all
one
have
to
visit
the
house
at
an
early
hour
to
write
his
name
and
then
one
have
to
be
on
hand
for
prayer
the
sit
begin
at
p
m
and
end
this
morning
at
eleven
hour
and
forty
minute
we
vote
seven
time
which
occupy
over
three
hour
we
listen
to
the
most
dreary
twaddle
which
it
have
ever
be
my
lot
to
hear
tim
healy
be
up
from
his
seat
of
tener
than
any
two
men
and
appear
to
be
maliciously
bent
on
tire
us
all
out
he
reminds
me
when
he
speaks
of
a
gentle
little
zebra
try
to
moo
his
round
glass
and
the
vast
concave
between
his
cheek
bone
and
eyebrow
give
him
this
peculiar
resemblance
when
he
turn
to
us
and
say
i
look
across
at
the
boast
majority
and
i
cannot
say
i
regard
it
with
awe
his
likeness
to
a
little
zebra
cow
be
impressed
on
me
by
the
way
he
brought
out
the
word
it
be
a
perfect
gentle
moo
in
tone
i
have
now
learn
to
know
all
the
most
prominent
among
the
irish
member
by
sight
there
be
a
marked
difference
in
type
between
them
and
our
member
the
celtic
or
iberian
type
affords
such
strike
contrast
to
the
blonde
higfa
cc
oured
anglo
saxon
there
be
the
melancholy
look
john
dillon
who
resembles
a
tall
italian
or
spaniard
there
be
the
sanguine
dalziell
like
one
of
the
carlists
of
my
youthful
day
there
be
the
quaint
face
pickersgill
with
the
raven
hair
tay
pay
with
hair
dark
as
n
ht
who
despite
his
london
training
be
still
only
a
black
haired
celt
and
many
more
singular
type
strongly
individualistic
while
on
our
side
sir
william
houldsworth
best
represent
the
florid
face
gentleman
who
form
the
sturdy
long
suffer
majority
the
obstructive
tactic
about
which
i
heard
so
much
in
the
past
have
be
pursue
for
three
day
now
most
skilfully
like
an
unsophisticated
new
member
i
have
sat
watchi
curiously
speaker
after
speaker
rise
to
his
foot
on
the
opposition
side
wonder
why
they
show
so
much
great
energy
than
our
people
and
export
to
be
reward
with
a
great
speech
but
so
far
i
have
wait
in
vain
it
dawn
upon
me
after
a
while
that
they
be
all
act
after
a
devise
plan
there
be
absolutely
nothing
worth
listen
to
in
anything
any
one
of
them
say
but
it
serve
admirably
to
waste
time
and
to
exasperate
or
rather
fatigue
one
towards
midnight
the
patience
of
the
government
seem
worn
out
and
from
that
hour
until
a
h
we
be
kept
march
to
the
lobby
and
be
count
each
count
occupies
from
twenty
minute
to
half
an
hour
we
go
through
the
performance
four
time
in
succession
and
our
majority
be
double
the
total
number
of
the
minority
i
be
so
tire
when
i
come
home
that
i
felt
as
if
i
have
undergone
a
long
march
the
close
air
of
the
house
i
feel
be
most
deleterious
to
health
for
the
atmosphere
of
the
small
chamber
after
the
confinement
of
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
member
for
eleven
hour
must
need
be
vitiate
we
be
herd
in
the
lobby
like
so
many
sheep
in
a
fold
and
among
my
wonder
have
be
that
such
a
number
of
eminent
men
could
consent
voluntarily
to
such
a
servitude
in
which
i
cannot
hdp
see
a
great
d
of
d
radation
the
criminal
waste
of
precious
time
devotion
to
antique
custom
the
silent
endurance
of
evil
which
by
a
word
could
be
swept
away
have
afford
me
much
matter
of
wonder
there
be
irish
m
p
s
whd
must
feel
amply
reward
in
know
that
through
sheer
excess
of
impudence
only
they
can
condemn
so
many
hundred
of
their
better
to
bend
servilely
to
their
behest
at
many
of
the

worthy
men
but
if
i
pity
this
dumb
helplessness
of
our
great
majority
and
marvel
at
its
meek
submissiveness
to
the
wholly
unneoes
sary
i
pity
still
more
that
solitary
figure
in
the
speaker
chair
who
have
be
sit
and
stand
from
p
m
to
a
m
one
say
to
me
what
wo
not
six
thousand
pound
a
year
do
well
i
swear
that
i
be
above
it
if
the
reward
be
double
because
i
should
not
survive
it
long
and
hence
woukl
derive
no
benefit
from
the
big
pay
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
and
i
hope
sincerely
that
his
constitution
be
strong
enough
to
bear
it
no
mortal
can
sit
eleven
hour
on
a
rich
diet
and
long
survive
august
rd
the
vote
in
connection
with
the
foreign
office
on
the
st
form
a
legitimate
excuse
for
my
rise
to
deliver
a
few
remark
in
answer
to
sir
charles
dilke
i
see
those
remark
be
call
my
maiden
speech
but
as
i
make
no
preparation
as
i
really
do
not
suspect
theiie
would
be
any
occasion
for
interpose
in
the
debate
i
do
not
think
they
deserve
to
be
call
a
speech
sir
charles
in
that
professional
manner
i
have
already
allude
to
begin
with
draw
attention
to
armenia
and
china
and
as
though
he
be
again
about
to
set
out
on
a
tour
through
great
britain
soon
enter
upon
the
question
of
the
evacuation
of
egypt
and
then
airily
wing
his
way
across
the
dark
continent
light
on
west
africa
and
its
affair
dipped
into
the
liquor
traffic
then
suddenly
flew
towards
uganda
and
after
a
short
rest
continued
his
flight
to
zanzibar
and
pemba
as
an
exhibition
of
the
personal
interest
he
take
in
matter
abroad
in
little
know
country
no
fault
could
be
found
with
his
discursive
flight
that
be
if
the
committee
be
sit
for
the
purpose
of
judging
his
proficiency
and
knowledge
but
as
the
house
take
no
interest
in
any
one
personal
qualification
his
speech
be
i
thought
superfluous
it
be
not
easy
however
to
reply
in
the
house
all
at
onoe
half
a
score
of
member
be
on
the
qui
vive
to
discharge
upon
the
submissive
body
their
opinion
i
perceive
as
each
would
be
speaker
rise
to
attract
the
chairman
attention
that
his
thought
be
abundant
but
when
he
be
permit
to
speak
the
thought
do
not
flow
so
smoothly
out
of
his
lip
as
they
may
have
course
through
his
mind
if
he
be
a
new
member
he
be
a
pitiable
object
at
such
a
time
even
the
old
member
be
not
always
happy
well
after
sir
charles
dilke
sat
down
our
friend
james
bryce
rise
who
i
must
admit
speaks
fluently
as
well
he
might
with
his
great
experience
as
a
lecturer
member
and
minister
i
do
not
think
he
be
at
all
nervous
at
least
i
should
not
judge
him
to
be
so
from
his
manner
after
him
rise
mr
mckenna
to
ask
about
siam
i
have
make
a
little
move
but
i
be
too
late
have
not
quite
conclude
in
my
own
mind
that
i
ought
to
speak
when
he
finish
commander
bethell
have
the
floor
these
old
member
shoot
to
their
foot
with
a
sudden
spring
like
jack
in
the
box
he
spoke
upon
egypt
and
the
new
country
of
central
africa
like
one
desirous
of
obtain
information
upon
matter
which
puzzle
him
parker
smith
sit
beside
me
be
on
his
foot
in
an
instant
but
what
he
say
seem
to
me
rather
an
indistinct
echo
of
what
his
brother
c
s
smith
formerly
consul
at
zanzibar
think
of
zanzibar
slavery
i
rise
a
trifle
after
he
finish
but
the
veteran
tommy
bowles
be
ahead
of
me
and
what
he
say
be
fatal
to
the
repose
and
concentration
of
mind
necessary
for
a
speech
he
speaks
excellently
and
delivers
good
solid
matter
my
surprise
at
his
power
and
my
interest
in
what
he
say
be
so
great
that
i
could
not
continue
the
silent
evolution
of
thought
in
which
i
should
have
engage
have
he
be
less
interest
and
inform
and
here
i
ought
to
say
that
i
do
not
join
with
some
in
their
dislike
of
him
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
despise
as
a
public
speaker
he
come
very
near
in
ability
to
chamberlain
who
be
without
doubt
the
best
debater
in
the
house
give
the
fitting
subject
suit
to
his
manner
mr
bowles
would
certainly
prove
that
my
opinion
of
him
as
a
parliamentary
debater
be
correct
he
be
quite
cool
us
good
language
and
handle
his
argiunents
with
skill
then
again
there
be
no
oddity
or
awkwardness
of
bearing
to
neutralize
the
effect
of
his
word
as
i
suppose
he
be
draw
to
a
close
i
resolutely
collect
my
stray
thought
and
exclude
what
he
be
say
out
of
my
mind
and
as
he
be
sit
down
i
stood
up
and
mr
lowther
call
out
mr
stanley
in
a
firm
clear
voice
it
be
not
a
pleasant
feel
to
look
down
from
the
third
row
upon
an
intelligent
and
critical
opposition
who
you
feel
be
go
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
manner
than
the
matter
of
your
speech
the
reporter
and
editorial
member
in
remark
upon
how
i
spoke
give
free
rein
to
their
fancy
tay
pay
as
you
must
have
see
in
the
pink
sun
i
sent
you
have
excel
all
the
rest
in
his
imaginative
description
of
my
deportment
you
will
wonder
perhaps
when
i
say
that
the
picture
of
me
which
he
give
be
far
from
represent
my
inwardness
all
my
fellow
member
have
a
remarkable
gift
of
easy
verbosity
there
be
a
small
kernel
of
fact
in
almost
every
sentence
they
deliver
but
it
be
often
indistinguishable
through
the
vast
verbiage
the
veriest
trifle
of
commonplace
fact
be
fold
round
and
round
with
tissue
after
tissue
of
superfluity
if
a
member
wish
to
say
that
he
have
see
a
rat
he
seem
to
be
unable
to
declare
the
fact
nakedly
but
must
hedge
it
about
with
so
many
deprecatory
word
that
you
be
apt
to
lose
sight
of
the
substance
he
say
i
venture
to
say
with
the
permission
of
the
house
that
unless
my
visual
organ
deceive
me
and
the
house
will
bear
me
out
when
i
say
that
my
power
of
ocular
perception
be
not
of
the
most
inferior
kind
that
to
nervous
people
this
verbiage
serf
as
a
shelter
until
they
can
catch
the
idea
they
be
grope
for
i
want
some
such
shelter
badly
for
it
require
a
strong
effort
to
marshal
out
your
idea
and
fact
so
that
there
shall
be
no
awkward
break
in
the
speech
gladstone
use
to
shelter
to
excess
he
circumvent
to
a
weary
length
and
often
require
more
than
one
sentence
before
he
could
muster
coiu
s
e
to
approach
the
fact
well
i
have
not
get
the
art
first
i
have
not
the
patience
and
then
again
i
disdain
the
use
of
the
art
on
principle
i
want
to
say
what
i
have
to
say
right
out
and
be
do
with
it
which
do
not
tend
to
elegance
consider
these
my
parliamentary
imperfection
my
fact
roll
out
without
be
over
detach
some
say
i
spoke
rapidly
they
be
wrong
i
spoke
at
the
ordinary
rate
of
public
speech
and
distinctly
by
the
kindness
of
die
house
i
be
make
to
feel
that
i
be
not
say
an
rthing
foolish
or
silly
that
be
the
main
point
and
inspire
me
with
just
enough
confidence
to
prevent
an
ignominious
breakdown
i
sat
down
with
the
feeling
of
one
who
have
make
a
deep
dive
and
come
up
just
in
time
to
relieve
die
strain

i
do
not
know
whether
i
be
do
well
or
ill
i
have
a
few
sentiment
to
utter
and
i
felt
relieve
that
they
be
not
botch
in
the
afternoon
parker
smith
get
up
and
remark
that
in
what
i
say
i
have

trading
on
my
reputation

a
young
fellow

next
to

get
up
and
say
such
a
thing
and
he
a
veteran
parliamentarian
i
chose
my
time
and
get
up
to
say
that
i
be
wholly
unaware
of
have
uttered
a
word
call
for
such
a
remark
and
i
beg
the
honourable
gentleman
not
to
make
any
more
such
yesterday
however
i
do
not
make
a
brilliant

question
in
r
ard
to
the
hang
of
stokes
an
english
trader
in
east
africa
i
not
wish
that
the
house
should
express
too
great
an
indignation
get
up
a
question
which
while
it
do
justice
to
poor

show
how
rash

be
in

with
kibonge
the
murderer
of
emin
pasha
and
supply
him
with

but
the
question
be
too
long
and
the
speaker
checked
me
when
i
be
near
the
end
of
it
i
have
not
be
clear
of
a
headache
all
this
week
the
atmosphere
in
the
house
during
this
great
heat
be
simply
poisonous
i
do
not
wonder
now
at
the
pasty
house

common
complexion
four
hundred
people
breathing
for
ten
or
eleven
hour
the
air
of

must
vitiate
it

torture

i
be

t
we
have
b
n
the
new
year
badly
the
hurricane
blast
i
predict
have
burst
out
in
the
form
of
a
denunciatory
message
from
pre
dent
cleveland
upon
the
subject
of
the
venezuela
claim
though
it
be
very
unstatesmanlike
of
cleveland
to
word
his
message
with
such
violence
we
have
give
some
provocation
time
after
time
have
various
secretary
of
state
write
urge
us
to
come
to
some
agreement
with
the
venezuelan
government
and
offer
their
friendly
arbitration
or
mediation
as
it
be
not
conducive
to
good
will
between
us
and
the
american
to
have
such
long
stand

as
an
irritant
between
the

and

letter
of
appeal
ought
to
have
move
us
to
instant
action
on
account
of
its
undoubtedly
friendly
sentiment
write
with
such
earnestness
and
kindly
feel
the
turn
of
a
deaf
ear
to
such
a
letter
as
this
no
doubt
make
the
american
believe
that
nothing
but
a
thunder
clap
such
as
cleveland
have
give
would
rouse
us
to
consider
the
matter
seriously
the
english
paper
have
be
quite
take
aback
by
it
and
here
and
there
some
fool
be
talk
of
resistance
one
man
who
hold
a
high
office
in
the
state
talk
to
me
last
night
of
the
manner
we
should
fight
the
american
poor
old
soul
he
do
not
expect
the
contempt
with
which
i
extinguish
his
martial
ardour
why
if
venezuela
and
guiana
be
both
wipe
out
of
the
map
america
and
england
would
suffer
from
it
far
less
than
from
recent
speculative
dishonesty
in
addition
to
this
shock
from
america
we
be
considerably
disturbed
by
the
armenian
atrocity
and
what
action
we
might
be
urge
to
take
in
behalf
of
the
oppress
armenian
the
radical
be
very
bellicose
and
would
applaud
lord
salisbury
if
he
sent
a
fleet
up
the
dardanelles
to
day
we
have
news
that
dr
jameson
have
invade
the
transvaal
with
a
small
force
between
four
hundred
and
six
hundred
strong
the
detail
be
meagre
but
the
impression
be
that
he
be
alone
in
this
wild
escapade
a
sun
interviewer
have
ask
me
my
opinion
in
the
matter
and
i
have
say
frankly
that
it
be
our
duty
to
drive
him
back
quicker
than
he
go
in
it
be
not
so
very
long
ago
that
i
entertain
both
jameson
and
rhodes
here
i
never
suspect
that
either
of
them
would
have
be
concerned
in
such
a
harum
scarum
act
as
this
july
th
tuesday
din
with
mr
and
mr
yates
thompson
the
jameson
raid
be
very
much
discuss
and
i
found
myself
in
this
instance
quite
in
accord
with
the
radical
whom
i
met
there
july
th
din
with
lord
james
of
hereford
i
be
surprised
at
his
say
that
there
be
extenuate
circumstance
for
jameson
act
but
it
be
evident
that
his
l
al
acumen
be
awry
under
no
circumstance
would
we
profit
by
this
raid
however
successful
it
might
have
be
stanley
greatly
rejoice
at
the
arrival
of
our
little
boy
denzil
and
bought
picture
book
for
him
and
toy
suit
to
a
child
of
four
in
during
a
long
and
serious
illness
what
best
pleased
stanley
be
to
have
the
baby
place
beside
him
on
the
bed
one
day
when
the
child
be
there
stanley
look
up
at
me
and
say
ah
it
be
worth
while
now
to
get
well
it
be
these
frequent
attack
of
gastralgia
or
gastritis
complicate
by
malaria
which
make
me
so
dread
his
return
to
africa
after
our
marriage
i
felt
no
security
he
himself
thought
he
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
congo
for
a
time
to
put
thing
right
but
i
knew
that
he
ought
never
to
return
there
stanley
be
constantly
be
attack
by
fever
and
these
internal
pain
which
come
without
any
warn
and
with
such
intensity
that
breathing
be
impede
the
first
attack
be
in
the
forest
of
central
africa
and
he
describes
his
illness
in
darkest
africa
an
illness
attributable
possibly
to
the
poor
diet
and
afterwards
to
starvation
two
day
before
our
marriage
he
be
take
ill
in
the
same
way
an
illness
that
last
many
week
during
stanley
malaria
attack
the
shiver
precede
the
hot
stage
be
so
violent
that
the
bed
he
lay
on
would
shake
and
the
glass
on
the
table
vibrate
and
ring
i
might
come
in
from
a
walk
and
not
see
stanley
in
his
library
run
upstairs
to
his
room
and
find
him
in
bed
cover
with
blanket
quilt
even
great
coat
with
chatter
teeth
and
hurry
speech
he
would
bid
me
get
hot
water
bottle
to
pack
round
him
then
when
the
cold
fit
have
pass
and
the
heat
have
reach
its
maximum
he
would
speak
to
me
re
assur
ingly
and
tell
me
not
to
fear
that
all
would
be
well
that
it
be
only
africa
in
me
and
i
must
get
the
quinine
ready
the
terrible
sweat
over
he
would
take
twenty
to
twenty
five
gr
s
of
quinine
and
wait
so
i
come
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
but
i
vowed
in
my
heart
that
he
should
never
return
to
the
country
which
have
take
so
much
of
his
splendid
vitality
for
stanley
have
have
three
attack
of
haematuric
fever
in
africa
and
more
severe
malaria
fever
than
he
could
number
in
june
we
arrange
to
visit
spain
as
he
want
to
show
me
madrid
toledo
etc
etc
but
in
the
train
four
hour
before
we
get
to
madrid
he
be
seize
witii
one
of
these
mysterious
gastric
attack
and
when
we
arrive
soon
after
midnight
he
be
hardly
conscious
from
extreme
pain
i
could
not
speak
spanish
and
knew
no
one
in
madrid
we
go
to
the
principal
hotel
on
the
puerta
del
sol
and
there
i
wait
till
morning
when
a
clever
austrian
doctor
come
to
my
assistance
but
tibere
seem
little
we
could
do
day
by
day
stanley
grow
weaker
and
at
last
in
desperation
i
decide
ill
as
he
be
to
get
him
back
to
england
by
the
time
we
reach
paris
stanley
be
rather
well
and
for
two
day
he
be
free
from
the
pain
and
intermittent
fever
but
it
be
only
a
short
lull
for
the
spasm
return
with
redouble
violence
and
it
be
with
the
great
difficulty
that
i
succeed
in
get
him
back
to
our
home
in
london
there
i
nurse
him
for
three
month
until
he
gradually
recover
thus
he
would
enjoy
space
of
perfect
health
with
interval
of
the
old
trouble
i
think
stanley
fear
nothing
in
the
world
as
he
fear
those
first
ominous
stab
of
pain
but
when
the
spasm
be
steadily
recurrent
and
no
doctor
could
give
him
any
relief
stanley
accepted
the
pain
and
weakness
silently
and
stoically
here
for
instance
be
an
entry

night
that
the
pain

st
brighton
warm
greeting
to
darling
little
denzil

too
much
of
him
if
i
be
not
busy
with
work

other
thing

should
undoubtedly

much
on

take
my
constitutional
i
really
be
scarce
conscious
that
i
be

complete
the
once
vague
figure
of
what
i
wish
and
now
the
secret
of
my
inward
thought
be
realise
a
pre

vision
embody
in
actual

rhodesia
stanley
take
a
short
tour
through
the
orange
free
state
the
transvaal
and
natal
i
can
only
give
brief
selection
from
his
letter
to
me
give
however
in
full
his
letter
describe
kriiger
which
for
discernment
of
character
and
political
foresight
be
certainly
most
remarkable
have
be
write
to
me
two
year
before
the
war
johannesburg
november
th
din
at
the
club
where
i
learnt
several
lesson
in
bulawayo
englishman
have
rather
an
exalt
feel
as
of
men
who
have
suddenly
be
make
rich
and
whose
prospect
be
delightful
in
johannesburg
the
ipeeling
be
different
i
find
them
subdue
querulous
and
recriminatory
they
blame
everybody
but
themselves
they
recapitulate
their
failure
to
obtain
justice
the
indifference
of
the
english
colonial
policy
they
tell
instance
of
boer
oppression
corruption
tyranny
and
hypocrisy
with
grind
teeth
and
do
not
forget
to
allude
to
the
mistake
of
jameson
the
tactlessness
folly
and
unhappy
consequence
of
the
raid
but
they
be
silent
as
r
ards
dieir
own
conduct
and
seem
to
think
they
be
as
hardly
dealt
with
by
the
british
government
as
by
kriiger
and
his
handful
of
oligarch
i
wish
i
could
repeat
word
for
word
what
i
have
be
told
in
very
eloquent
language
but
as
i
could
not
take
my
notebook
out
at
the
dinner
table
i
can
only
say
that
i
have
be
much
impressed
with
all
i
have
heard
and
feel
genuine
sympathy
for
them
which
make
me
reluctant
to
wound
them
but
the
truth
be
there
be
too
many
leader
and
each
leader
pull
a
contrary
way
to
his
fellow
consequently
they
have
no
concrete
well
consider
policy
i
quite
agree
with
them
that
our
government
be
to
blame
for
allow
the
convention
to
be
broken
so
repeatedly
and
that
their
action
be
not
what
that
of
the
german
would
have
be
for
instance
have
they
so
many
subject
maltreat
and
desire
their
treaty
right
but
though
i
would
speak
strongly
of
the
weakness
of
england
i
think
that
the
uitlanders
be
also
to
blame
in
not
act
in
concert
upon
a
well
arrange
plan
compelling
kriiger
to
come
out
of
his
shell
and
force
thing
quicker
to
an
issue
between
england
and
the
transvaal
i
be
assume
of
course
that
the
johannesburgers
feel
all
that
they
say
about
oppression
tyranny
their
feel
of
desperation
etc
etc
but
all
their
pitiful
tale
of
distress
endure
injury
inflict
on
person
of
property
audacious
breach
of
the
convention
and
so
on
will
not
induce
england
to
wake
up
to
her
duty
nor
move
the
government
to
action
a
government
even
that
like
the
salisbury
chamberlain
at
present
in
power
must
have
strong
excuse
to
sanction
an
undertaking
that
may
cost
million
of
money
and
thousand
of
life
it
will
certainly
be
no
child
play
to
use
compulsion
on
a
man
like
kriiger
they
would
rather
endure
much
than
go
to
war
and
yet
if
the
uitlanders
let
the
unionist
go
out
of
office
without
convincing
them
that
they
ought
no
longer
to
endure
this
state
of
thing
they
must
try
other
thing
than
mere
telegraphic
report
to
the
newspaper
at
the
dinner
table
i
told
them
all
very
frankly
my
opinion
on
the
matter
and
say
i
be
remind
of
the
word
it
be
expedient
that
one
man
should
die
for
many
that
be
to
say
i
explain
english
people
cannot
be
move
by
these
report
of
breach
of
the
convention
you
must
convince
them
that
the
sense
of
your
injury
be
so
great
you
be
willing
to
brave
death
rather
than
bear
with
what
you
consider
intolerable
but
how
can
we
do
anything
they
ask
we
be
not
allow
arm
not
even
a
pistol
be
allow
to
come
to
the
transvaal
you
do
not
want
arm
of
any
kind
i
say
i
have
see
enough
to
know
that
you
could
not
do
much
with
arm
you
do
not
even
want
a
pen
knife
as
a
weapon
of
offence
you
simply
want
to
prove
to
england
your
grievance
be
real
and
your
patience
exhaust
let
england
see
that
you
dare
to
resist
this
iniquitous
rule
under
which
you
suffer
and
that
you
be
defy
the
power
that
be
risk
liberty
and
property
and
her
opinion
will
be
swiftly
change
let
every
instance
wherein
you
think
you
be
wrong
which
you
can
prove
be
against
the
convention
be
marked
by
resistance
not
active
but
passive
you
call
the
convention
j
ust
now
the
charter
of
your
right
on
the
strength
of
these
right
let
your
resistance
be
base
the
boer
official
will
demand
why
such
conduct
you
will
calmly
say
they
will
pooh
pooh
and
threaten
you
you
will
refuse
compliance
they
will
use
compulsion
of
a
kind
they
will
imprison
or
expel
you
there
will
be
ten
twenty
forty
a
hundred
example
of
this
punishment
the
uitlanders
should
continue
the
same
resolute
attitude
of
resistance
yield
not
a
jot
the
boer
will
soon
perceive
that
this
be
serious
rather
than
expel
a
whole
population
they
must
either
come
to
term
or
try
what
violence
can
do
if
the
latter
some
of
you
must
become
martyr
to
your
sense
of
what
be
right
those
martyr
will
buy
the
freedom
of
the
others
for
england
will
be
call
to
arm
we
all
know
that
england
ought
to
have
act
as
become
her
on
the
first
breach
of
the
convention
but
she
resort
to
discussion
and
in
discussion
at
length
she
have
be
beaten
time
and
time
again
have
the
convention
be
broken
and
the
answer
england
give
to
all
of
them
be
a
pile
of
blue
book
the
boer
can
go
on
at
that
game
for
ever
the
boer
head
have
become
very
big
the
self
esteem
of
kriiger
have
grown
intolerably
large
to
reduce
which
will
require
something
more
than
reason
but
you
know
whether
with
an
individual
or
a
nation
how
hard
it
be
to
suddenly
change
from
courteous
argimient
to
the
deadly
arbitrament
of
force
something
be
want
to
rouse
the
passion
to
that
pitch
i
know
of
nothing
that
will
do
it
quicker
than
an
act
of
violence
by
the
boer
when
the
boer
resort
to
vio
lexice
it
will
be
all
up
with
them
if
i
know
anything
of
he
english
character
the
first
act
of

will
not

by
them

colonel

with
all
i
say
as
we
walk
to
the

hotel
it
be
the

that

november
rd
take
train
for

have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
mr

me
to
a

november
th
mr

take
me
to
president
kriiger
house
at
a
m
it
be
an
unusually
early
time
to
visit
but
the
old
man
be
an
early
riser
and
be
at
his
best
in
the
morning
he
be
sit
on
the
stoep
with
two
old
member
of
the
rand
take
his
coffee
before
leave
on
an
electioneer
journey
when
mark
told
him
of
my
desire
for
an
interview
he
motion
my
conductor
to
take
me
to
the
reception
saloon
irhich
open
out
on
the
stoep
a
grandson
of
kriiger
show
me
a
chair
it
happen
to
be
directly
in
front
of
a
full
length
portrait
of
the
president
so
i
be
force
to
look
with
wonder
at
the
bad
painting
and
libellous
likeness
of
the
man
i
have
come
to
see
presently
kriiger
come
in
and
seat
himself
under
his
portrait
now
as
he
be
the
man
who
held
the
destiny
of
south
africa
in
his
hand
i
regard
him
with
interest
in
order
to
divine
what
the
future
would
be
from
what
i
could
gather
of
his
character
by
study
his
feature
gesture
and
talk
in
the
past
i
have
often
make
fair
guess
at
the
real
man
as
reporter
special
correspondent
in
several
campaign
and
in
various
city
and
as
traveller
over
five
continent
i
have
have
opportimities
enough
i
found
when
in
the
presence
of
african
chief
of
whose
language
i
be
ignorant
that
long
before
the
interpreter
have
spoken
i
have
rightly
guess
what
the
chief
have
say
and
i
could
often
correct
the
interpreter
when
two
civilize
men
meet
both
be
stranger
absolutely
independent
unconcerned
uninterested
in
eadbi
other
far
than
mere
civility
require
the
little
point
that
betray
character
mood
or
temper
be
not
see
and
the
dispositioii
of
human
nature
in
general
be
to
put
the
most
dvfl
constructtao
possible
upon
one
s
fellow
creature
and
their
way
while
the
morning
greeting
be
be
interchange
and
my
eye
kept
glance
from
kriiger
face
to
that
of
the
portrait
the
real
man
appear
loveable
compare
with
the
portrait
his
feature
though
terribly
plain
and
worn
be
amiable
and
human
and
if
i
have
go
away
after
this
i
would
have
carry
with
me
the
ordinary
impression
which
i
have
see
countless
time
in
newspaper
that
kriiger
be
not
a
bad
kind
of
man
a
little
obstinate
perhaps
but
on
the
whole
well
meaning
and
so
on
but
in
order
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
possible
future
of
the
relation
between
him
and
the
uitland
er
i
begin
to
praise
johannesburg
its
growth
and
the
enterprise
of
the
people
and
i
ask
mr
kriiger
whether
or
not
thing
be
settle
down
more
peacefully
now
this
be
the
begin
of
an
interview
which
while
it
last
reveal
kriiger
the
man
sufficiently
to
me
so
that
if
he
be
an
african
chief
and
i
have
dealing
with
him
it
would
have
taught
me
exactly
what
to
do
and
how
to
provide
against
every
eventuality
in
short
i
soon
saw
that
he
be
a
choleric
and
passionate
old
man
uncommonly
obstinate
determine
within
himself
that
his
view
be
the
right
one
and
that
no
peaceful
issue
could
be
expect
unless
his
demand
be
comply
with
and
most
implicit
trust
give
to
his
word
now
if
the
welfare
of
my
expedition
be
at
stake
and
i
thought
my
force
be
equal
to
his
or
enough
to
enable
me
to
inflict
severe
punishment
upon
him
should
he
attempt
to
carry
out
his
passionate
word
i
should
not
have
part
from
him
without
some
well
guarantee
than
trust
in
his
mere
word
and
if
the
guarantee
would
not
be
give
i
should
have
go
away
with
the
feel
that
the
old
man
meant
mischief
and
that
it
be
incumbent
on
me
to
take
every
precaution
against
him
mr
kriiger
manner
change
immediately
i
have
mention
johannesburg
and
its
people
his
voice
and
its
vary
intonation
every
line
in
his
face
betrayed
the
strong
resentment
and
when
i
suggest
that
the
small
concession
to
their
demand
would
modify
that
attitude
of
hostility
to
him
which
angered
him
he
become
the
incarnation
of
fury
and
his
right
hand
go
up
and
down
like
a
sledge
hammer
and
from
his
eye
small
and
dull
as
they
be
flash
forth
the
most
implacable
resolve
that
surrender
must
be
on
their
side
not
his
when
an
old
man
like
this
he
be
seventy
four
who
for
the
last
sixteen
year
at
least
have
have
his
own
way
and
be
look
up
to
by
boer
and
uitlander
as
the
man
of
the
situation
when
he
have
make
up
his
mind
upon
have
something
it
be
not
likely
that
any
other
course
than
his
own
can
he
believe
to
be
the
right
one
when
we
think
of
what
have
happen
these
last
sixteen
year
his
visit
to
london
his
negotiation
in
pretoria
and
london
concern
the
convention
the
way
everyone
englishman
and
boer
have
yield
to
him
the
adulation
paid
to
him
for
his
success
one
cannot
wonder
that
he
believe
that
in
this
matter
of
the
uitlander
right
as
in
the
thing
that
go
before
his
method
his
style
and
his
way
be
the
best
and
safest
this
have
begotten
in
him
an
arrogance
so
large
that
before
he
can
be
make
sensible
that
he
be
wrong
his
fierce
pride
must
be
humble
his
head
have
grown
so
big
with
this
vain
belief
in
his
prowess
in
battle
his
victory
over
gladstone
lord
salisbury
and
others
of
the
same
calibre
the
implicit
trust
of
the
boer
in
him
and
in
his
unconquerability
have
be
such
that
i
be
convince
there
be
no
room
in
that
brain
for
one
grain
of
common
sense
to
be
inject
into
it
his
whole
behaviour
seem
to
say
very
clearly
to
the
observer
what
do
i
care
for
your
chamberlain
with
his
mil
ners
and
green
they
shall
yield
to
me
first
i
do
not
care
a
snap
of
the
finger
for
them
let
them
do
their
bad
well
men
than
they
have
try
and
fail
and
they
will
fail
too
the
unmitigated
contempt
for
people
who
tiy
conciliation
have
only
to
be
see
in
kriiger
for
one
to
know
that
the
old
man
be
an
impossible
creature
and
that
he
be
only
make
implacable
and
fierce
by
beseeching
and
conciliate
a
recollection
of
the
telegram
ask
how
be
mr
kriiger
almost
make
me
laugh
aloud
in
kriiger
presence
such
a
telegram
to
this
kind
of
man
why
if
a
strong
man
arm
and
cover
with
impenetrable
armour
be
to
suddenly
rise
in
kriiger
sight
and
boldly
advance
and
seize
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
shake
him
until
a
little
of
that
wind
of
vanity
that
have
so
inflate
him
escape
he
would
not
have
long
to
wait
before
kniger
would
be
amenable
to
reason
and
decent
conversation
but
the
fellow
must
find
himself
face
by
force
an
exchange
of
opinion
be
now
impossible
as
he
fly
directly
into
a
passion
at
the
mere
suggestion
that
a
different
kind
of
treatment
to
the
uitlanders
would
secure
to
liim
the
presidency
for
life
and
remove
all
fear
of
friction
for
it
be
something
connect
with
his
own
self
interest
probably
a
fear
that
the
vote
of
the
uitlanders
would
upset
him
from
the
chair
he
fill
drive
him
out
of
the
house
he
occupies
diminish
lu
importance
and
his
affluent
income
all
this
be
at
the
bottom
of
his
extreme
irascibility
and
stormy
impatience
when
the
uitlanders
be
mention
the
interview
do
not
last
twenty
five
minute
but
i
have
see
enough
and
heard
more
than
enough
to
convince
tne
that
this
be
an
extreme
case
which
only
force
could
remedy
you
ask
me
to
describe
kriiger
minutely
well
he
be
very
like
his
photograph
i
should
know
him
among
ten
thousand
in
the
street
but
to
see
and
talk
with
him
reveals
score
of
little
thing
no
photograph
can
give
you
have
see
lot
of
stout
body
old
parisian
concierge
and
i
dare
say
you
have
see
them
in
their
seedy
black
clothes
when
go
out
on
a
visit
put
a
little
top
hat
on
one
of
them
give
him
stoop
shoulder
with
a
heavy
lumber
biggish
body
and
you
will
know
kriiger
at
once
well
let
him
sit
vi
a
vi
to
you
put
much
obstinacy
into
a
face
that
be
unusually
large
with
an
inch
of
forehead
and
two
small
eye
let
the
figure
sink
in
his
chair
with
an
attitude
of
determination
in
every
line
and
give
him
a
big
briarwood
pipe
which
be
held
in
his
left
hand
and
there
you
have
him
age
statesman
be
liable
at
a
certain
age
to
develop
symptom
of
the
refractoriness
and
arbitrariness
of
disposition
which
eventually
make
them
unsuitable
for
the
requirement
of
the
country
and
impossible
to
their
colleague
in
the
cabinet
well
that
be
what
the
matter
with
kriiger
he
be
quite
past
reason
with
neither
mr
chamberlain
nor
sir
alfred
milner
nor
mr
greene
will
ever
succeed
with
him
and
i
do
not
know
any
three
men
who
so
deserve
to
succeed
as
they
they
be
all
capital
fellow
brilliant
able
and
deserve
mr
chamberlain
have
a
deal
of
perseverance
and
conviction
of
his
oiwn
but
ten
minute
talk
with
kriiger
would
give
him
the
knowledge
at
first
hand
that
one
should
have
to
be
able
to
deal
effectively
with
a
political
opponent
and
as
sir
alfred
milner
have
not
see
kriiger
either
these
two
able
men
be
really
deal
haphazard
with
the
president
what
amazes
me
be
the
extraordinary
hopefulness
of
the
men
i
meet
many
resident
here
have
see
and
know
kriiger
intimately
and
yet
no
sooner
have
one
project
for
get
their
right
be
baffle
than
they
have
some
new
scheme
afoot
they
have
try
everything
but
the
right
thing
and
will
continue
to
do
so
if
englishman
on
the
spot
hardly
realise
the
boer
cunning
and
determination
how
impossible
it
be
for
the
englishman
at
home
to
do
so
well
much
talk
with
all
kind
of
south
african
and
my
talk
with
kriiger
have
open
my
eye
to
the
perplexity
of
the
situation
i
heartily
pity
the
colonial
secretary
and
i
foresee
that
the
transvaal
will
continue
to
disturb
his
office
the
boer
of
the
cape
the
boer
of
the
orange
free
state
and
the
boer
of
the
transvaal
will
combine
if
any
inconsiderate
step
be
take
by
the
colonial
office
what
then
be
to
be
do
keep
still
and
be
patient
nothing
more
for
these
people
of
south
africa
english
and
all
be
exasperatingly
contentious
the
longer
we
be
quiet
the
more
irascible
they
will
get
with
each
other
our
cue
must
be
obtain
from
south
africa
and
if
the
johannesburgers
want
us
to
help
them
they
must
be
braver
more
united
and
more
convince
of
the
inutility
of
their
unaided
effort
nay
be
every
englishman
and
afrikander
in
south
africa
imited
they
could
not
alone
unaided
stand
against
tlie
boer
kriiger
will
plod
on
his
vindictive
way
and
he
must
in
time
wear
out
the
johannesburgers
patience
they
will
do
something
to
rouse
the
boer
temper
there
will
be
some
attack
by
the
boer
confiscation
of
property
of
territory
we
shall
be
ask
if
we
be
indifferent
to
our
countryman
distress
and
so
the
cup
will
be
full
and
the
time
will
have
come
that
be
the
only
way
i
see
whereby
the
transvaal
be
to
be
save
from
king
kriiger
mind
you
this
be
kriiger
fourth
term
of
office
that
he
be
seek
twenty
year
rule
for
so
long
a
time
make
for
despotism
and
in
an
old
man
of
his
unbend
nature
it
make
for
an
accumulation
of
mistake
cause
by
temper
arrogance
and
conceit
it
make
for
the
usual
political
calamity
which
precedes
the
salvation
of
a
country
or
nation
mark
and
i
left
the
house
and
while
kriiger
hasten
to
get
ready
for
his
electioneer
journey
i
be
be
shewn
the
way
to
the
pretoria
club
where
i
be
cordially
receive
and
induct
into
the
opinion
of
other
resident
of
the
boer
capital
i
have
met
no
one
who
can
give
me
what
i
should
call
an
intelligent
idea
of
the
outcome
of
this
tension
between
the
boer
and
british
they
all
confine
themselves
to
commonplace
thing
and
idea
kriiger
reitz
joubert
whom
i
have
see
to
day
be
concerned
only
with
what
they
want
and
must
have
leyds
kotze
mark
be
all
afraid
to
engage
in
a
discussion
of
any
kind
and
be
really
the
most
unlikely
people
to
do
so
the
club
people
not
know
who
may
be
listen
do
not
care
to
talk
and
drop
into
monosyllable
when
politics
be
broach
though
with
officious
zeal
they
allow
me
to
see
that
in
their
opinion
the
transvaal
be
ever
so
much
well
in
many
respect
than
england
mark
be
a
broker
who
look
after
certlaun
interest
of
the
president
the
population
dwell
in
the
hollow
below
the
dominate
height
around
which
be
bristling
with
cannon
i
presume
have
no
thought
worth
anything
and
be
fill
with
content
every
time
they
look
up
at
those
defiant
fort
above
their
city
i
go
to
see
conyngham
greene
the
english
political
resident
here
he
have
a
very
nice
house
situate
in
charm
surroundings
of
green
lawn
and
flower
shrubbery
and
he
be
himself
very
agreeable
and
pleasant
he
be
too
young
to
have
any
profound
view
into
the
meaning
of
thing
i
dare
say
he
do
his
duty
efficiently
which
be
to
report
day
after
day
upon
the
state
of
aifairs
as
he
believe
it
to
be
but
though
this
may
be
satisfactory
to
his
chief
the
high
commissioner
sir
alfred
milner
mr
greene
opinion
appear
to
be
far
from
be
decide
one
way
or
the
other
my
impression
be
that
he
think
the
present
tension
be
not
likely
to
last
long
that
it
be
a
mere
phase
consequent
upon
the
sore
feeling
cause
by
the
jameson
raid
and
in
short
that
though
kriiger
appear
somewhat
unappeasable
and
unrelenting
at
present
he
be
sure
to
come
round
by
and
by
it
be
so
like
what
i
have
heard
in
england
and
at
the
cape
yes
kriiger
be
terribly
obstinate
but
he
be
a
dear
old
fellow
you
know
all
the
same
and
he
will
be
all
right
give
him
time
but
that
be
not
my
opinion
kriiger
be
not
that
sort
of
man
at
all
he
must
meet
his
master
and
be
overcome
the
week
before
i
arrive
at
the
cape
that
be
to
say
only
a
few
week
ago
sir
alfred
milner
make
a
speech
in
cape
colony
wherein
he
be
report
to
have
say
that
it
be
all
humbug
and
nonsense
for
anyone
to
say
that
reconciliation
be
impossible
and
that
to
expect
good
feel
between
the
two
race
be
hopeless
it
may
be
suppose
that
he
be
only
re
echo
what
mr
conyngham
greene
have
write
in
his
report
mr
chamberlain
have
spoken
in
the
same
spirit
in
the
house
of
common
because
of
sir
alfred
milner
view
as
conveyed
to
him
in
despatch
i
feel
positive
that
if
sir
alfred
milner
and
mr
chamberlain
be
to
see
kriiger
face
to
face
they
would
drop
that
sanguine
optimistic
tone
and
quickly
and
resolutely
prepare
for
a
storm
despite
all
the
wish
that
chamberlain
milner
and
greene
may
be
right
the
good
will
i
feel
to
all
three
of
them
and
the
belief
in
their
ability
an
inner
voice
tell
me
that
they
be
all
three
wrong
that
the
johannesburgers
who
share
their
view
be
living
in
a
fool
paradise
kriiger
will
never
no
never
give
way
to
anything
that
be
no
harder
than
mere
word
the
man
must
be
make
to
bow
that
inflexible
spirit
to
a
temper
that
be
more
harden
a
spirit
that
be
more
unyielding
and
a
force
capable
of
carve
its
way
undeviatingly
to
its
object
whence
that
force
will
come
it
be
impossible
to
say
i
feel
very
much
afraid
that
it
will
not
come
from
england
england
be
lose
her
great
characteristic
she
be
become
too
effeminate
and
soft
from
long
inactivity
long
enfeeblement
of
purpose
brought
about
by
indolence
and
ease
distrust
of
her
own
power
and
shaken
nerve
it
be
at
such
time
that
nation
listen
to
false
prophet
crank
faddist
and
weak
sentimentalist
it
will
take
time
anyhow
to
convince
england
that
she
ought
to
do
anything
it
will
take
her
still
longer
to
provide
the
mean
for
do
her
duty
effectively
it
will
take
longer
still
to
understand
the
nature
and
bigness
of
the
task
which
it
be
her
bounden
duty
to
undertake
and
so
be
in
a
position
to
say
with
the
necessary
firmness
of
voice
to
kriiger
that
he
must
come
to
term
immediaidyt
people
in
england
for
some
reason
cannot
be
induced
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
johannesburg
grievance
they
profess
to
regard
thcsn
as
a
community
of
jewish
speculator
in
mine
and
even
lihe
failure
to
assist
jameson
in
the
raid
etc
etc
have
unfortunately
rather
deepen
disbelief
in
their
complaint
wliich
they
please
to
consider
as
nothing
more
than
the
usual
method
resort
to
by
stock
exchange
speculator
to
advertise
their
ware
and
alarm
investor
so
that
for
their
own
end
they
may
make
a
grand
coup
i
but
both
jew
and
christian
now
be
of
the
same
mind
as
to
the
hopelessness
of
their
condition
unless
kriiger
can
be
make
to
conform
to
the
term
of
the
convention
of
of
course
it
be
possible
that
england
may
be
rouse
to
action
sooner
than
expect
by
some
act
of
the
uitianders
i
believe
that
if
the
english
people
be
to
hear
that
the
uit
lander
in
their
desperate
state
have
resolve
upon
braving
kriiger
and
his
boer
to
the
death
and
would
show
the
necessary
courage
to
bear
martyrdom
conviction
would
come
quicker
to
english
mind
than
from
year
of
futile
despatch
write
if
the
uitianders
thus
brave
him
i
feel
sure
that
kriiger
would
deal
with
them
in
the
harshest
and
most
summary
way
and
in
do
so
he
would
be
simply
set
every
instrument
at
work
require
to
open
the
eye
and
ear
of
englishman
to
his
obdurate
implacable
and
cruel
nature
and
once
they
be
convince
of
this
kriiger
downfall
would
not
be
far
off
now
of
course
after
the
insight
i
have
gain
into
the
heart
of
the
question
i
confess
i
be
not
free
from
feel
a
large
contempt
for
my
countryman
for
be
so
slow
witted
and
deaf
to
the
cry
of
the
uitianders
and
yet
as
i
write
this
i
cannot
see
why
i
should
feel
such
contempt
for
them
for
certainly
my
own
sympathy
be
but
sluggish
when
first
i
accepted
this
opportunity
of
come
to
south
africa
to
speak
the
truth
they
be
not
so
keen
as
to
wish
england
might
go
to
war
with
the
transvaal
but
now
i
see
thing
in
a
different
light
and
i
shall
carry
away
with
me
from
the
transvaal
a
firm
conviction
that
the
english
people
have
be
systematically
mislead
about
kriiger
and
his
boer
gladstonianism
and
that
gush
teary
tone
adopt
by
the
sentimental
peace
at
any
price
section
of
our
nation
be
solely
responsible
for
the
persecution
and
insult
to
which
our
people
have
be
subject
since
in
the
transvaal
if
it
should
come
to
fight
there
will
be
much
kill
do
and
this
will
be
entirely
due
to
sentimentalist
at
home
the
self
interest
of
men
who
would
be
self
seeker
even
under
the
heel
of
the
tyrant
have
also
largely
contribute
to
mislead
the
people
cowardice
actuates
those
who
would
coax
kruger
out
of
his
sulk
and
prefer
to
fawn
on
him
instead
of
resent
his
cruel
treatment
of
his
fellow
countryman
they
profess
to
believe
in
the
piety
of
the
boer
and
their
love
of
peace
they
dwell
on
kriiger
attachment
to
the
bible
and
believe
him
to
be
a
dear
good
old
fellow
likely
at
any
time
to
amaze
the
world
by
generous
and
just
conduct
within
a
few
hour
i
believe
i
could
carve
a
fair
likeness
of

out
of
a
piece
of
tough
wood
because
no
michael
angelo
be
need
to
do
justice
to
his
rugged
feature
and
ungainly
form
and
i
would
be
willing
to
guarantee
that
justice
to
the
english
would
be
sooner
give
by
that
wooden
image
than
it
will
be
by
mr
kruger
on
that
i
pin
my
faith
in
my
perception
of
what
be
kriiger
true
character
be
either
russia
or
germany
in
our
position
towards
south
africa
thing
could
not
have
come
to
this
pas
certainly
the
american
government
would
not
have
remain
so
long
blind
not
only
to
duty
but
to
the
ordinary
dictate
of
common
sense
as
we
have
be
a
respectable
third
of
the
nation
i
fancy
feel
very
much
as
i
do
upon
the
south
african
question
another
third
may
be
say
to
prefer
let
kruger
do
just
what
he
plea
on
the
ground
that
no
south
african
question
can
be
of
sufficient
importance
to
risk
the
danger
of
give
offence
to
the
stubborn
old
fellow
and
if
the
question
be
put
to
them
point
blank
as
to
whether
we
should
try
and
compel
kruger
to
abide
by
the
term
of
the
convention
or
fight
him
i
feel
sure
they
would
say
let
south
africa
go
rather
than
fight
the
remain
third
comprises
the
nobody
the
people
of
the
street
the
mob
people
who
have
no
opinion
on
any
subject
except
their
own
immediate
and
individual
interest
who
follow
the
peace
party
to
day
because
the
other
party
the
party
for
compulsion
have
not
condescend
to
explain
to
them
why
they
should
do
otherwise
now
should
it
happen
that
the
people
of
johannesburg
either
after
my
advice
or
after
their
own
method
take
a
resolute
front
and
dare
to
defy
the
tyrant
the
party
for
compulsion
would
then
have
a
text
to
preach
upon
the
ever
vary
third
might
be
influence
to
side
with
it
and
the
government
might
then
find
it
the
proper
thing
to
declare
war
i
believe
therefore
it
may
come
to
war
but
as
war
be
a
serious
thing
even
with
such
a
small
state
as
the
transvaal
and
who
know
whether
the
orange
free
state
may
not
join
them
i
would
not
precipitately
engage
in
it
i
would
prefer
to
give
kriiger
a
good
excuse
to
descend
from
that
lofty
and
unalterable
decision
not
to
give
way
to
anybody
or
anything
i
would
send
a
peace
commission
of
half
a
dozen
of
the
noble
wise
and
most
moderate
men
we
have
get
who
could
discus
all
matter
between
the
dutch
and
ourselves
who
would
know
when
to
yield
on
question
that
do
not
aflfect
the
supremacy
of
england
or
touch
on
her
vital
interest
men
who
could
be
firm
with
courtesy
this
method
of
course
be
only
to
set
ourselves
right
with
the
world
which
be
rather
bitter
against
england
just
now
and
give
ourselves
time
to
prepare
in
case
of
the
failure
of
the
peace
commission
a
few
million
spent
on
equip
a
complete
army
corp
ready
to
set
out
at
an
instant
notice
and
another
ready
to
support
it
might
morally
effect
a
change
in
kriiger
disposition
he
be
i
believe
ready
on
his
side
for
any
contingency
or
think
he
be
otherwise
why
those
arm
fort
at
pretoria
and
at
johannesburg
those
ninety
thousand
mauser
rifle
and
those
battery
of
artillery
why
in
fact
this
attitude
of
irreconcileability
on
his
part
be
it
not
that
he
have
be
prepare
for
war
my
dear
i
could
go
on
for
hour
on
this
subject
i
could
tell
you
how
i
almost
foresee
war
in
this
peaceful
look
country
the
wise
politician
at
home
would
no
doubt
say
ah
stanley
be
all
very
well
as
an
explorer
but
in
politics
statesmanship
etc
he
be
altogether
out
of
his
element
but
i
can
read
men
and
the
sign
of
what
shall
come
be
write
on
kriiger
face
my
business
through
life
have
be
to
foresee
and
if
possible
avert
calamity
but
enough
be
enough
time
fly
and
the
day
of
departure
from
this
land
will
soon
arrive
and
every
day
that
pass
brings
me
nearer
to
you
and
that
dear
bless
little
child
of
ours
whom
the
god
sent
to
cheer
our
hungry
heart
my
whole
soul
be
in
my
pen
as
i
write
god
bless
you
and
keep
you
both

november

in
my
hurry
to
go
to
bed
last
night
i
omit
to

anything
about
my
impression
of
ladysmith
the
aldershot
of
africa
it
be
but
a
short
view
i
have
of
ladysmith
but
it
be
sulfhcient
to
make
me
exclaim
to
my
fellow
passenger
that
the
officer
who
select
that
spot
for
a
military
camp
ought
to
be
shot
anyone
who
look
at
the
map
of
natal
may
see
that
it
would
scarcely
do
to
make
a
permanent
military
station
too
far
in
that
point
of
land
that
penetrates
between
the
transvaal
and
the
orange
free
state
unless
it
be
resolve
that
the
defence
should
be
elaborate
and
the
provision
ample
enough
for
a
year
at
least
dread
what
might
some
day
be
a
trap
for
a
british
force
the
military
authority
have
chosen
a
basin
like
hollow
south
of
and
near
a
river
call
the
tugela
when
we
come
round
a
bend
from
newcastle
the
white
tent
of
the
english
soldier
be
see
away
down
in
the
hollow
some
hundred
of
foot
below
us
with
majuba
ever
on
one
mind
with
kriiger
and
his
boer
so
defiant
and
bold
in
their
stubbornness
i
cannot
imagine
what
posse
the
commander
to
undertake
the
responsibility
of
pretend
to
defend
a
camp
utterly
indefensible
accord
to
my
notion
of
course
an
officer
in
time
of
peace
may
camp
anywhere
in
a
loyal
colony
like
natal
on
the
condition
that
it
be
only
temporary
but
the
danger
of
such
a
camp
as
this
be
that
store
of
all
kind
soon
become
enormously
valuable
as
they
gather
day
after
day
and
their
removal
be
very
serious
work
even
if
a
camp
be
but
temporary
i
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
should
be
the
best
site
in
the
vicinity
and
the
easy
defen
ble
be
it
only
to
keep
alive
that
alertness
and
discipline
which
be
necessary
in
war
but
this
ladysmith
lie
at
the
mercy
of
a
band
of
raider
and
if
a
body
of
englishman
can
be
found
in
time
of
peace
raid
into
a
country
at
peace
with
us
it
be
not
beyond
possibility
that
a
body
of
boer
may
try
some
day
to
imitate
us
when
we
least
expect
it

farewell
to
parliament
london
thursday
may
th
preside
at
sir
alfred
lyall
lecture
on
charter
company
and
colonization
before
the
society
of
art
i
have
always
a
feel
when
observe
an
audience
in
england
that
the
people
who
appear
to
be
listen
be
engage
upon
their
own
particular
thought
i
have
sometimes
say
to
myself
life
with
such
people
be
not
an
earnest
affair
they
have
come
out
of
sheer
amiability
or
to
tide
over
an
idle
hour
they
mechanically
smile
and
do
not
mind
languidly
applaud
when
someone
warns
them
it
be
time
to
do
so
in
my
remark
at
the
close
of
sir
alfred
lyall
lecture
i
take
the
opportunity
of
compare
the
french
doings
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
those
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
predict
that
when
the
french
appear
on
the
white
nile
england
would
have
to
speak
in
no
uncertain
voice
to
france
or
all
our
toil
and
expense
since
in
egypt
and
the
soudan
would
have
to
be
consider
waste
my
earnest
word
rouse
our
friend
a
little
then
lord
brassey
a
typical
gladstonite
think
i
might
lead
them
over
to
france
instanter
pour
cold
water
upon
the
heat
and
say
you
know
it
be
only
mr
stanley
way
he
be
always
combative
poor
dear
old
england
how
she
be
bother
with
sentimentalist
and
crank
south
africa
be
almost
lose
because
no
englishman
in
office
dare
to
say
stop
that
be
england
yet
if
krllger
eventually
succeed
our
sea
route
to
india
australia
and
the
isle
of
the
indian
ocean
will
soon
be
close
if
the
french
establish
themselves
on
the
white
nile
they
will
ally
themselves
with
the
abyssinian
and
soon
find
a
way
of
re
arm
the
mahdist
and
it
would
not
be
long
then
before
we
should
be
driven
out
of
egypt
and
clean
away
from
the
suez
canal
well
and
then
but
what
be
the
use
a
cold
water
speech
from
lord
brassey
quenches
or
appear
to
any
little
patriotic
ardour
that
our
society
englishman
confess
to
have
felt
if
these
people
be
to
be
consult
they
would
vote
for
make
england
as
small
as

in
the
south
of

august
th
the
long
week
in
bed
have
give
me
abundant
time
for
thought
and
i
have
decide
that
the
time
have
come
for
me
to
seek
my
long
desire
rest
it
have
become
clearer
to
me
each
day
that
i
be
too
old
to
change
my
open
air
habit
for
the
asphyxiate
atmosphere
of
the
house
of
common
consequent
upon
this
parliamentary
life
be
the
various
petty
business
of
the
constituency
i
represent
and
a
weary
correspondence
with
hundred
of
people
i
be
unacquainted
with
but
who
insist
on
receive
reply
this
correspondence
alone
entail
a
good
three
hour
work
each
day
the
demand
of
the
constituent
consume
on
an
average
another
two
hour
the
house
open
at
p
m
and
business
continue
to
any
hour
between
midnight
and
a
m
it
be
therefore
impossible
to
obtain
air
or
exercise
long
ago
the
house
of
common
have
lose
its
charm
for
me
it
do
not
approach
my
conception
of
it
its
business
be
conduct
in
a
shilly
shally
manner
which
make
one
groan
at
the
waste
of
life
it
be
say
to
begin
at
p
m
prayer
be
over
at
but
for
the
follow
twenty
minute
we
twiddle
our
finger
and
then
commence
question
which
last
over
an
hour
these
question
be
mainly
from
the
irish
party
and
of
no
earthly
interest
to
anyone
except
themselves
but
even
if
they
be
the
answer
might
be
print
just
as
the
question
be
that
would
save
an
hour
for
the
business
of
debate
a
member
soon
learns
how
weary
be
debate
out
of
six
hundred
and
seventy
member
some
twenty
of
them
have
take
it
upon
themselves
with
the
encouragement
and
permission
of
the
speaker
to
debate
on
every
matter
connect
with
the
empire
and
after
we
have
heard
their
voice
some
fifty
time
however
interest
their
subject
may
be
it
naturally
becomes
very
monotonous
chamberlain
however
be
always
interest
because
there
be
a
method
with
him
to
get
to
his
subject
at
once
and
to
deal
with
it
in
a
ludd
straightforward
manner
and
have
do
with
it
this
be
what
we
all
feel
and
therefore
he
be
never
tedious
also
every
speech
chamberlain
delivers
be
different
and
his
manner
varies
sometimes
it
be
quite
excite
a
mere
steady
look
suggestive
of
we
know
not
what
give
the
cue
sometimes
it
be
only
a
false
alarm
but
often
we
have
intense
moment
when
every
word
penetrates
and
rous
general
enlivenment
others
on
the
front
bench
be
not
very
interest
in
speech
or
matter
except
occasionally
on
army
or
naval
question
i
could
name
a
dozen
others
who
be
too
often
allow
to
afflict
us
on
the
unionist
side
but
the
speaker
on
the
opposition
side
be
permit
even
great
loquacity
and
they
really
be
terrible
bore
outside
the
house
they
be
mostly
all
good
fellow
but
in
the
house
they
have
no
sense
of
proportion
and
one
and
all
take
themselves
too
seriously
some
of
them
i
wish
could
be
sent
to
the
clock
tower
where
they
could
wrangle
with
big
ben
to
their
heart
content
others
would
be
more
esteem
if
they
be
fetter
to
their
seat
and
have
their
own
lip
lock
while
a
few
be
so
bad
that
they
should
be
seal
tight
during
the
session
at
any
rate
it
be
dearly
no
place
for
me
the
house
be
very
full
four
hundred
and
thirteen
member
vote
and
of
course
the
war
with
the
transvaal
be
in
every
mind
and
on
every
lip
all
be
agree
that
kriiger
ultimatum
have
be
specially
fortunate
for
the
govemhient
for
it
have
be
easy
to
discover
that
but
for
this
hot
head
outburst
of
the
transvaal
government
the
general
distaste
for
violent
and
strong
measure
would
have
severely
strain
the
loyalty
of
the
government
supporter
so
much
so
i
think
that
i
doubt
whether
the
majority
would
have
be
so
great
as
to
encourage
the
government
to
formulate
the
demand
which
the
necessity
of
the
case
require
while
listen
to
the
remark
i
heard
on
all
side
of
me
in
the
smoking
room
it
appear
to
me
that
the
say
that
tiiose
whom
the
god
wish
to
destroy
they
first
make
mad
be
never
so
true
as
in
this
curious
lapse
of
a
government
that
suddenly
and
for
a
trifle
throw
all
restraint
aside
and
becomes
possess
of
the
most
reckless
fury
in
his
secret
heart
no
member
but
think
after
his
own
fashion
that
it
have
be
due
to
an
interposition
of
providence
fate
destiny
call
it
what
name
you
like
i
gather
so
much
from
the
many
wa
r
the
member
express
their
astonishment
at
kriiger
throw
down
the
gauntlet
end
the
discussion
and
plunge
into
war
it
have
be
a
long
duel
between
the
colonial
office
and
kriigerism
successive
secretary
of
state
since
have
try
their
best
to
get
the
vantage
over
the
old
dutchman
and
have
either
fail
miserably
or
have
just
be
able
to
save
their
face
but
chamberlain
after
four
year
of
ups
and
down
at
one
time
almost
in
disgrace
be
most
unfairly
suspect
of
abet
the
raid
and
always
verge
on
failure
come
out
of
the
duel
with
fly
colour
through
the
intractable
old
dutchman
tire
of
the
long
wordy
contest
the
irish
have
not
be
so
violent
as
we
expect
they
intend
to
be
we
heard
of
a
wish
to
be

but
on
the
whole
they
have
be
tame

chamberlain
campbell
bannerman
spoke
with
two
voice
in
the
first
half
of
his
speech
he
talk
like
an
english
patriot
in
the
latter
half
he
seem
to
have
remind
himself
that
he
be
the
leader
of
the
opposition
and
show
ill
nature
harcourt
spoke
this
afternoon
long
but
without
much
force
in
fact
the
string
of
the
opposition
have
be
render
inutile
by
kruger
ultimatum
to
england
and
the
boer
invasion
the
fact
that
we
be
at

check
everybody
and
disarms
them
july
th
to
day
have
be
my
last
sit
in
parliament
for
i
have
pair
for
the
remainder
of
the
session
and
dissolution
be
very
probable
in
september
or
october
i
would
not
stand
again
for
much
i
have
never
be
quite
free
after
i
understood
the
parliamentary
machine
from
a
feel
that
it
degrade
me
somewhat
to
be
in
parliament
i
have
as
a
member
less
influence
than
the
man
in
the
street
on
question
concern
africa
dilke
or
some
other
wholly
unacquainted
with
africa
would
be
call
upon
to
speak
before
me
i
have
far
less
influence
than
any
writer
in
a
daily
newspaper
for
he
can
make
his
living
presence
in
the
world
felt
and
possibly
have
some
influence
for
good
whereas
i
in
common
with
other
respectable
fellow
be
like
dumb
dog
yet
i
have
nay
we
all
have
have
to
pay
heavily
for
the
hustle
we
get
in
the
house
the
mention
of
our
name
in
the
press
draw
upon
us
score
of
beg
letter
and
impertinent
door
to
door
beggar
who
sometimes
by
aheer
impudence
effect
an
entrance
into
our
house
the
correspondence
postage
alone
be
a
heavy
tax
and
would
make
a
handsome
provision
for
a
large
family
during
the
year
the
expense
incident
to
parliamentary
candidature
and
parliamentary
life
be
very
heavy
and
in
my
opinion
it
be
disgrace
ful
that
a
member
should
be
call
upon
to
subscribe
to
every
church
chapel
sport
bazaar
sale
etc
in
his
constituency
but
while
i
do
not
grieve
so
much
for
the
stupid
expense
i
do
begrudge
the
item
which
remind
me
of
the
annoy
beg
and
the
insolent
importunity
that
impressed
me
with
the
worthlessness
of
the
honour
of
be
a
parliamentary
representative
then
when
i
think
of
the
uselessness
of
the
expense
the
labour
of
reply
to
the
daily
correspondence
the
time
waste
in
it
all
the
late
hour
the
deadly
air
the
gradual
deterioration
of
health
i
wonder
that
anyone
in
his
sober
sens
should
consent
to
bother
himself
about
a
parliamentary
machine
control
as
be
this
of
ours
any
illusion
that
i
may
have
have
illusion
that
i
could
serve
the
empire
advance
africa
interest
benefit
this
country
be
quickly
dispel
the
speaker
eye
could
not
be
caught
he
would
call
on
some
glib
talker
who
really
knew
very
little
of
his
subject
and
in
this
respect
also
i
felt
there
be
some
degradation
for
me
sit
there
to
listen
to
such
futility
individually
i
repeat
the
member
be
the
best
of
good
fellow
in
the
smoking
room
but
parliamentary
procedure
need
revise
and
less
opportunity
should
be
give
to
those
who
talk
only
for
talk
sake
anyhow
i
be
glad
at
the
prospect
of
retire
and
be
quit
of
it
all

t
f

when
we
sat
round

to
stanley
till
the
dusk
fell
softly
those
wonderful
evening
by
the
library
fire
when
he
told
us
story
of

with
such
vivid
force
that
i
never
heard
him
without
a
race

and
quicken
breath
no
one
who
ever
heard

told
us
the
story
of
gordon
stanley
however
be
not
always
to
be
drawn
sometimes
therefore
i
resort
to
subterfuge
that
i
might
lure
him
on
i
would
begin
his
story
all
wrong
make
many
mistake
on
purpose
know
his
love
of
accuracy
till
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
brushing
my
halt
word
aside
he
would
plunge
in
and
swing
along
with
the
splendid
narrative
to
the
end
we
be
very
happy
now

we
could
unpack
together

at
the
prospect

with
thrill

and
story
of
adventure
stanley
carefully

for
work
in
one
shape
or
another
be
insatiablev
and
the
trouble
he
take
be
always
a
surprise
even
to
me
nothing
he
undertook
be
do
in
a
half
and
half
way
i
have
now
the
sheet
upon
sheet
of
plan
he
drew
of
the
little
farm
at
furze
hill

measurement

make
to
scale
and
the
cost
of
each
item

on
the
margin
and
so
he
be
happy
for
his
joy
lay
in
the
do
in
this
year

create
g
c
b
how
little
any
but
his
few
intimate
friend
knew
of
stanley
others
might
guess
but
they
could
not
realise
what
of
tenderness
gentleness
and
emotion
lay
behind
that
seemingly
impenetrable
reserve
as
an
instance
of
the
curious
ignorance
exist
regard
the
real
stanley
i
will
tell
an
anecdote
both
laughable
and
pathetic
a
short
time
after
my
marriage
i
go
to
tea
with
a
dear
old
friend
after
talk
of
many
thing
my
friend
suddenly
put
her
hand
impressively
on
mine
and
say
would
you
mind
my
ask
you
a
question
for
somehow
i
cannot
help
feel
well
just
a
little
troubled
it
may
in
some
mysterious
way
have
be
deem
expedient
but
why
oh
why
do
your
husband
order
a
little
black
baby
to
be
flung
into
the
congo
the
dear
good
lady
have
tear
in
her
eye
as
she
adjure
me
to
explain
indignation
at
first
make
me
draw
away
from
her
but
then
the
ridiculous
absurdity
of
her
story
struck
me
so
forcibly
i
begin
to
laugh
and
the
more
i
laugh

be
silent
and

charge
and
then
he
told
me
the
story
of

in
central
africa
as
the

the
native
of
our
approach
the
villager
of
course
be
not
very
far
off
and
as
soon
as
the
expedition
have
pass
they
stole
back
to
their
hut
and
plantation
on
one
occasion
so
great
have
be
their
haste
a
black
baby
of
a
few
month
old
be
left
on
the
ground
forgotten
they
brought
the
little
thing
to
me
it
be
just
a
gobbet
of
fat
with
large
innocent
eye
hold
the
baby
i
turn
to
my
officer
and
say
in
chaff
well

shall
we
do
with
it
oh
sir
one
wag
cry
with
a
merry
twinkle
in

whereupon
they
all
take
up
the
chorus
throw
it
throw
it
throw
it
into
the
congo
we
be
all
in
high
boyish
spirit
that
day
i
should
rather
have
like
to
take
the
baby
on
with
me
and
would
have
do
so
have
i
thought
it
be
abandon
but
i
felt
sure
the
mother
be
not
far
off
and
might
even
then
be
watch
us
with
beating
heart
from
behind
a
tree
so
i
order
a
fire
to
be
kindle
as
the
infant
be
small
and
chilly
and
i
have
a
sort
of
cradle
nest
scoop
out
of
the
earth
beside
the
fire
so
that
the
little
creature
could
be
warm
shelter
and
in
no
danger
of
roll
in
i
line
the
concavity
with
cotton
cloth
as
a
gift
to
the
mother
and
when
we
left
that
encampment
the
baby
be
sleep
as
snugly
as
if
with
its
mother
beside
it
and
i
left
them
a
good
notion
for
cradle
many
child
be
born
during
the
march
of
the
emin
reuef
expedition
at
one
time
there
be
over
forty
baby
in
camp
the
african
mother
well
knew
that
their
little
one
safety
lay
widi
bwana
kuba
the
great
master
when
the
expedition
emerge
from
the
great
forest
a
report
get
about
that
the
expedition
be
shortly
to
encoimter
a
tribe
of
cannibal
that
night
stanley
retire
to
rest
early
and
soon
fdl
asleep
for
he
be
very
exhaust
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
be
waken
by
a
vague
plaint
the
cry
as
he
thought
of
some
wild
animal
the
wail
be
take
up
by
others
and
soon
the
air
be
fill
by
cat
like
miaouls
greatly
puzzle
stanley
sat
up
and
then
he
heard
slappings
and
bowling
thereupon
he
arose
and
strode
out
to
find
forty
or
so
infant
carefully
roll
up
and
laid
round
his
tent
by
the
anxious
mother
bula
matari
they
say
to
themselves
would
never
allow
the
dreadful
cannibal
to
eat
their
little
one
so
they
agree
together
that
the
night
nursery
must
be
as
close
as
possible
to
the
great
master
tent
this
however
be
forbidden
in
future
as
it
make
rest
impossible
here
be
another
baby
story
stanley
told
me
one
of
his
men
be
an
egyptian
rather
a
sullen
fellow

pleasant
young
woman
die
during
the

yellow
face
baby
the
father
now
have
to
carry
the

well
as

stanley
afterwards
heard
that
this
cause
the
man
great
dissatisfaction

even
go
his

round
amongst

and
there
on
a
mat
at

solemnly
at

after

be
put
up
the
child
be
brought
to
the
tent
door
and
stanley

company
he
told
me
that
as
the
baby

at
him
with
its
grave
eye
he
would
open
his
own
very
wide
and
make
grimace
whereupon
the
little
fellow
would
faintly
smile
and
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
and
stanley
do
the
same

room
those
fifteen

be
wonderfully
happy
and
the
light
shin
in
stanley
eye
give
me
deep
inward
peace
but
it
be
ort
live
for
on
april
the
th
the
giddiness
return
and
in
the
night
of
the
th
the
blow
fell
and
sie
joy
that
have
be
could
never
come
again
stanley
awaken
me
by
a
cry
and
i
found
he
be
without
speech
his
face
drawn
and
his
body
paralyse
on
the
left
side
no
sooner
have
the
doctor
withdrawn
lliat
first
terrible
morning
than
he
make
me
understand
that
he
wish
to
be
propped
up
in
bed
now
absolute
quiet
have
be
strictly
enjoin
as
stanley
be
only
partially
conscious
but
he
always
expect
to
be
obeyed
and
to
have
thwart
him
at
such
a
time
would
i
fear
only
have
agitate
him
i
therefore
raise
and
support
him
and
then
he
make
me
understand
that
he
must
shave
i
i
fetch
his
razor
brush
soap
and
water
i
prepared
the
lather
which
he
apply
himself
witih
tremble
hand
the
only
hand
he
could
use
and
then
with
eye
blood
shot
his
noble
face
drawn
his
mind
daze
but
his
will
still
indomitable
stanley
commenced
shave
i
held
his
cheek
and
chin
for
him
he
try
to
see
himself
in
the
mirror
i
held
but
his
eye
could
not
focus
nevertheless
he
succeed
in
shave
c
ean
some
day
after
when
he
have
recover
complete
consciousness
and
speech
i
found
he
have
no
recollection
of
have
shave
i
give
this
account
as
a
typical
instance
of
stanley
self
control
and
resolution
he
have
often
told
me
that
on
his
various
expedition
he
have
make
it
a
rule
always
to
shave
carefully
in
the
great
forest
in
starvation
camp
on
the
morning
of
battle
he
have
never
n
lected
this
custom
however
great
the
difficulty
he
told
me
he
have
often
shave
with
cold
water
or
with
blunt
razor
but
i
always
present
as
decent
an
appearance
as
possible
both
for
self
discipline
and
for
self
respect
and
it
be
also
necessary
as
chief
to
do
so
month
pass
spring
summer
autumn
stanley
lay
there
steadfast
calm
uncomplaining
never
by
word
or
sigh
do
he
express
grief
or
r
jet
he
submit
grandly
and
never
seem
to
me
great
or
more
courageous
than
throughout
that
last
year
of
utter
helplessness
and
deprivation
stanley
the
very
embodiment
of
proud
independence
be
as
weak
and
helpless
as
a
little
child
but
i
have
him
still
i
felt
that
nothing
in
the
whole
world
signify
since
i
have
him
still
and
as
i
look
at
his
grand
head
lie
on
the
pillow
i
felt
i
could
be
happy
in
a
new
and
more
supreme
way
if
only
i
need
not
give
him
up
soon
i
learnt
to
lift
him
with
someone
just
to
support
his
foot
but
it
be
i
and
i
alone
who
held
him
at
time
i
have
a
sort
of
illusion
that
i
be
hold
him
back
from
death

sort
of
sensation
as

none
could
die

i
intensely
love
and
so
although

deep
dream

consciously

as
four
o
clock

from
big
ben
stanley
open
his
eye
and
say
what
be
that
i
told
him
it

four
o
clock
strike
four
o
clock
he
repeat
slowly
how
strange
so
that
be
time
strange
a
little
later
see
that
he
be
sinking
i
brought
stimulant
to
his
lip
but
he
put
up
his
hand
gently
and
repel
the
cup
say
enough
then
as
six
o
clock
rang
out
stanley
left
me
and
be
admit
into
the
nearer
presence
of
god
on
tuesday
may
th
stanley
body
be
carry
to
westminster
abbey
the
coffin
lay
before
the
altar
where
we
be
married
and
the
funeral
service
be
read
after
which
henry
morton
stanley
that
man
of
men
be
bury
in
the
village
churchyard
of
pirbright
surrey
but
history
will
remember
that
it
be
the
rev
joseph
armitage
robinson
dean
of
westminster
who
refuse
to
allow
stanley
to
be
bury
in
westminster
abbey
now
however
i
be
able
to
quote
sir
george
grey
word
and
say
i
be
inclined
to
think
it
be
best
that
the
matter
should
stand
thus
yet
one
thing
be
want
to
render
the
great
drama
complete
would
the
man
who
have
do
all
this
and
support
such
various
trial
be
subject
to
cold
neglect
for
what
he
have
accomplish
and
i
sit
here
not
lament
but
with
a
feel
that
all
have
take
place
for
the
best
and
that
tibis
absence
of
national
recognition
will
only
add
an
interest
to
stanley
history
in
future
year
he
go
who
aeem
would
so
great
go
but
nothing
can
bereave
him
of
the
force
he
make
his
own
be
here
and
we
believe
him
something
far
advanced
in
state
and
that
he
wear
a
truer
crown
than
any
wreath
that
man
can
weave
him
i
wish
to
find
some
great
monolith
to
mark
stanley
grave
a
block
of
granite
fashion
by
the

history
we
know
so
little
whatever
their
past
history
may

vast
continent

up
and
whose
name
will
live
not
by
this
memorial
but
as
one
of
the
great
pioneer
of
christianity

and
hope

the

tell
me
through
its

of
certain
instruction
and
certain
law
that
those
who
desire
to
please
him
should
follow
and
obey
many
of
these
law
and
instruction
appeal
to
my
own
sense
as
be
his
due
and
therefore
i
shall
conform
to
them
as
closely
as
my
nature
will
permit
when
i
perceive
that
they
be
too
hard
for
nature
i
will
pray
for
his
divine
help
to
withstand
the
temptation
of
nature
for
more
power
of
restraint
for

for
more
understand
to
comprehend
what
be

to
him
for
more
gentleness
for
moral
strength
to
combat
that
which
my
sense
assures
me
be
evil
and
unworthy
of
one
endow
with
such
attribute
as
belong
to
me
i
will
keep
ever
strive
to
perform
act
please
to
him
while
i
have
the
power
leave
it
to
him
to
judge
whether
my
endeavour
to
abstain
from
evil
and
perform
that
which
be
right
have
be
accord
to
the
intelligence
and
moral
power
he
entrust
me
with
meantime
i
must
keep
myself
open
to
conviction
so
that
whenever
it
shall
be
my
good
fortune
to
light
upon
that
which
will
clearly
inform
me
as
to
the
exact
way
to
serve
and
please
god
it
will
be
possible
for
me
to
conform

i
must
by
no
mean
offend
him
by
n
li
gence
in
do
that
which
i
know
ought
to
be
do
on
the
influence
of
religion
to
relate
a
little
of
the
instance
in
my
life
wherein
i
have
be
grateful
for
the
delicate
monition
of
an
inner
voice
recall
me
as
it
be
to
my
true
self
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
do
their
importance
justice
i
for
one
must
not
dare
not
say
that
prayer
be
inefficacious
where
i
have
be
earnest
i
have
be
answer
what
have
these
earnest
prayer
consist
of
mainly
i
have
repeat
the
lord
prayer
a
countless
number
of
time
but
i
must
confess
my
thought
have
often
wander
from
the
purport
of
the
word
but
when
i
have
prayed
for
light
to
guide
my
follower
wisely
through
peril
which
beset
them
a
ray
of
light
have
come
upon
the
perplexed
mind
and
a
clear
road
to
deliverance
have
be
point
out
in
the
conduct
of
the
various
expedition
into
africa
prayer
for
patience
which
bespoke
more
than
an
ordinary
desire
for
patience
have
enable
me
to
view
my
savage
opponent
in
a
humorous
light
sometimes
with
infinite
compassion
for
their
madness
sometimes
with
a
belief
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
punish
too
severely
and
sometimes
with
that
contempt
which
i
would
bestow
upon
a
pariah

patience
have
be
grant
to
me
and
i
have
left
them
storm
madly
without
the
prayer
for
it
i
doubt
that
i
could
have
endure
the
flourish
of
the
spear
when
they
be
but
half
a
dozen
pace
off
when
my
own
people
have
wilfully
misbehave
after
repeat
warning
i
have
prayed
for
that
patience
which
would
enable
me
to
r
ard
their
crime
with
mercy
and
that
my
memory
of
their
gross
wickedness
should
be
dull
and
after
the
prayer
it
have
appear
to
me
that
their
crime
have
lose
the
atrocity
that
i
have
previously
detect
in
them
when
oft
repeat
instance
of
the
efficacy
of
prayer
be
remember
i
have
marvel
at
the
mysterious
subtleness
with
which
the
answer
have
be
deliver
lord
god
give
me
my
people
and
let
me
lead
them
in
safety
to
their
home
then
do
thou
with
me
as
thou
wilt
be
my
prayer
the
night
precede
the
day
the
remnant
of
the
rear
column

found
true
they
be
there
they
have
not
move
since
july
th
but
i
do
not
know
it
give
my
people
back
to
me
o
lord
remember
that
we
be
thy
creature
though
our
err
nature
cause
us
to
forget
thee
visit
not
our
offence
upon
our
head
gracious

and
thus
that
night
be
pass
in
prayer
until
the
tire
body
could
pray
no
more
but
the
next
dawn
a
few
minute
after
the

have
begin
my

restore
to
me
with
food
sufficient
to
save
the

at
the

on
all
my
expedition
prayer
make
me
strong
morally
and
mentally
than
any
of
my
non

companion
it
do
not
blind
my
eye
or
dull
my
mind
or
close
my
ear
but
on
the
contrary
it
give
me
confidence
it
do
more
it
give
me
joy
and
pride
in
my
work
and
lift
me
hopefully
over
the
one
thousand
five
hundred
mile
of
forest
trade
eager
to
face
the
day
peril
and
fatigue
you
may
know
when
prayer
be
answer
by
that
glow
of
content
which
fill
one
who
have
flung
his
cause
before
god
as
he
rise
to
his
foot
it
be
the
first
reward
of
the
righteous
act
the
act
that
ought
to
have
be
do
when
my
anticipation
be
not
realise
to
their
fulness
what
remain
be
well
than
nought
and
what
be
man
that
he
should
quarrel
with
the
inevitable
on
prayer
i
have
evidence
satisfactory
to
myself
that
prayer
be
grant
by
prayer
the
road
sought
for
have
become
visible
and
the
danger
immediately
lessen
not
once
or
twice
or
thrice
but
repeatedly
until
the
cold
unbelieving
heart
be
impressed
this
much
i
have
derive
from
many
a
personal
experience
i
have
forgotten
my
prayer
my
sensibility
have
be
so
deaden
by
the
sordid
scene
around
me
that
my
soul
be
not
arouse
to
feel
that
there
be
a
refuge
for
distress
worldly
thought
absorbed
my
attention
i
become
a
veritable
pagan
ever
ready
on
occasion
to
sneer
and
express
utter
disbelief
finally
i
have
drawn
near
a
danger
and
in
its
immediate
presence
i
have
understood
its
character
well
every
faculty
be
then
brought
to
bear
upon
and
around
it
and
a
sense
of
utter
hopelessness
take
possession
of
my
mind
there
be
no
cowardice
no
thought
of
retreat
rescue
or
no
rescue
i
must
face
it
at
first
i
believe
that
it
will
be
possible
to
confront
it
go
through
with
it
emerge
from
it
safely
what
be
want
but
light
next
i
be
remind
that
such
a
scene
occur
before
and
that
prayer
relieve
me
ah
but
i
have
so
long
refrain
from
prayer
can
i
believe
that
now
prayer
would
be
answer
i
have
forfeit
the
right
to
be
heard
have
i
not
join
the
scoffer
and
smile
in
contempt
at
such
puerile
idea
and
say
prayer
be
well
enough
when
we
be
child
but
not
now
when
i
have
live
so
long
without
the
sign
of
a
miracle
and
yet
prayer
have
save

when

from

its
capacity
in
this

measurable
i
feel
that
up
to
extract
from
the

date
february
x
a
certain
point
it
could
expand

beyond
that

madness
it
can
descend
to
a

point
below

below
that
would

be
measurable
it
be
just
suit
to
my
limited

it
be
marvellously
expansible
it
can
also
descend
to
that
pin
point

faint
glimmer
of
reason
at

which
guide
the

cannot
comprehend
this
but
to
me
have
be
give
just
enough
mind
to
be
impressed
by
the
vast
and
solemn
fact
of
this
immeasurable
knowledge
as
my
mind
governs
me
and
all
that
belongs
to
me
in
the

i
conceive
that
every
movement
of
the

and
its
myriad
of
constituent
be
subject
to
some
divine
mind
this
divine
mind
be
the
power
of
a
personal
spirit
which
be
god
who
have
endow
humanity
with
the
necessary

limited
portion
of
his
own
subde

all
powerful

all
my
instinct
warn
me
that
this
be
so
but
that
so
long
as
it
be
imprison
by
this
earthly
matter
it
cannot
give
itself
that
freedom
when
freed
from
it
my
spirit
will
bound
to
its
source
a

fancy
it
grope
with
its
tentacle
stretch
almost
to
snap
far
into
yet
far
space
then
suddenly
contract
into
apparent
mindlessness
at
the
buzz
of
a
fly
the
bite
of
an
insect
the
pang
of
small
nerve
with
aspiration
after
a
seat
in
the
heaven
of
heaven
yet
more
often
content
to
wallow
in
the
mud
thereby
prove
its
relationship
to
the
noble
and
the
mean
without
that
portion
of
divinity
it
could
not
imagine
its
obligation
to
the
creator
nor
be
conscious
of
its
affinity
with
the
brute
on
the
fear
of
death
the
weakness
of
our
number
against
the

force
of

forbade
resistance
against
such
a
multitude
what
hope
have
we
the
imminence
of
death
brought
with
it
a
strange
composure
i
do
not
fear
it
as
i
imagine
i
should
a
fortitude
to
bear
anything
come
to
me

i
could

contemptuously
at
the

craven
fear
of
its
pain
and
the
sudden
rupture
of
life
on
illusion
though
many
illusion
be
of
a
character
we
should
gladly
cherish
yet
the
sooner
we
lose
some
of
them
the
sooner
we
gain
the

of
see
clearly
into

the
one
who
posse
least
have
the
best
chance
of
become
wise
the
man
who
travel
and
reflect
loses
illusion
faster
than
he
who
stay
at
home
there
be
nevertheless
some
illusion
which
when
lose
he
bitterly
regret
to
day
i
can
feel
comfortably
at
home
in
almost
any
country

can
fully
appreciate
the
truth
of

a

that
the

sympathise
still
with
that

no

wondrous
land
met
no
other
men
and
woman
with
whom
i
could
sympathise
it
be
probable
that
i
should
have
retain
the
belief
that
wale
be
the
fine
country
in
the
world
and
the
welsh
people
the
best
i
use
to
believe

i
have

when

a

consider

as
well

an

education
for
the
this
be
not
yet
the
policy
of
england
thus
we
find
mr
runciman
president
of
the
board
of
education
say
february
lo
that
he
believe
that
the
teachei
improvement
of
youth
but
since
the
banishment
of
the
bible
from
the
school
it
have
be
deem
wise
to
pay
attention
to
the
training
of
the
intellect
alone
while
the
natural
disposition
of
youth
have
cause
attention
to
be
paid
to
athletics
with
a
few
choice
nature
this
might
be
sufficient
but
i
observe
that
the
generality
of
young
men
have
not
that
respect
for
moral
obligation
it
would
be
desirable
to
foster

it
have
a
stimulate

tendency
on
provincialism
and
militates
against
stodginess
if
we
could
only
be
sure
that
no

vitiate
the
moral
fibre
of
the
nation
also
ran
along
the
artery
of
the
land
from
its
heart
we
should
have
cause
for
congratulation
but
if
the
extremity
of
the
land
absorb
the
impurity
of
the
metropolis
the
strong
moral
fibre
of
the

will
soon
be
destroyed
there
be

other
thing
which
be
or
be
characteristic
of
the
country

now
the
hot
impulse
of
the
city
mob
have
an
appreciable
effect
on
those
in
the
province
erstwhile
sturdier
and
more
deliberate
if
we
be
always
sure
that
the
impulse
be
good
and
beneficial
there
would
be
nothing
to
regret
the
frivolity
of
an
aggregate
of
humanity
such
as
london
present
be
inseparable
from
the
many
million
of
people
gather
within
its

but
they
be
out
of
place
under
the
blue

in
the
peaceful
green
field
of
the

the
smoke
of
the
city
and
the
roar
of
the
traffic
obscure
the
heaven
and
affect
the
nerve
until
we
almost
forget
the
god
who
rule
and
our
religious
duty
outside
of
london
the
smile
field
and
skywards
the

and

aware
that

in

we
see
that

despicable
than
in

they

in

the

for
it
i
have
never
be
able
to
discover
even
to
this
day
we
also
detest
the

because
they
be
rag
dirty
and
quarrelsome
foul
of

we
saw
a

french
at

we
be
told
they

they

much

should
tiherefore

to

i
stoop

say
that
the

be
the

people
under

and
thstt
wale
be
the
most
beautiful
country
in
the
world
but
i
be
quite
willing
to
admit
that
the
welsh
be
as
goofd
as
any
and
that
they
might
surpass
the
majority
of
people
if
they
try
and
that
wale
contains
within
its
limited
area
as
beautiful
scene
as
any
the
result
of
my
observation
be
that
in
nature
the
large
part
of
humanity
be
on
a
pretty
evep
plane
but
that
some
respectable
portion
of
it
thank
goodness
have
risen
to
a
high
altitude
owe
to
the
advantage
of

but
there
be
a
high
altitude
still
which
can
only
be
reach
by
those
nation
who
leave
off
brooding
among

grasp
firmly

gratefully
the

the

and
i
do
not

they
form
principally
the
dream

in
which
livingstone
pass
almost
all

endure
pleasure

that
which

daily
it
form
part

while
on
the

climbed
in
the
hope
of
view
new
prospect
each

with
a
strong
idea
prevail
that
at
the
other
end
some
grand
feature
of

may

reveal
the
morrow
journey
be
long
for
in
the
hope
that
something
new
may
be
discover
then
there
be
the
strange
and
amuse
scene
of
camp
life
in
a
savage
land
the
visit
of
the
native
whose
peculiar
custom
or
dress
and
whose
remark
on
stranger
seldom
fail
to
be
entertain
and
best
of
all
there
be
the
strong
internal
satisfaction
one
feel
at
the
end
of
each
day
labour
and
the
proud
thought
that
something
new
have
be
obtain
for
general
informa
tion
and
that
good
will
come
of
it
lastly
there
be
the
plea
sure
of
hunt
the
large
noble
game
of
africa
that
truest
ctf
sport
where
you
hunt
for
food
and
of
necessity
to
track
the
elephant
rhinoceros
buffalo
the
eland
and
other
magnificent
animal
of
the
antelope
specie
it
be
a
keen
delightful
feel
which
animates
the
mind
of
the
african
hunter
as
he
leaf
his
camp
full
of
people
and
plunge
into
the
unexplored
solitude
accompany
by
only
one
or
two
men
in
search
of
game
ignorant
of
the
adventure
which
lie
before
him
but
with
swift
pulse
brace
nerve
and
elate
heart
he
be
ready
to
try
his
luck
against
even
the
most
formidable
the
success
of
the
hunt
enhances
his
pleasuie
and
on
his
return
to
camp
he
meet
his
people
who
be
ail
agape
with
admiration
of
his
prowess
and
h
ofuse
in
thanlrfi
for
the
gift
of
animal
food
if
the
traveller
mind
be
so
happily
cchistituted
that
in
the
pursuit
of
duty
he
can
also
command
enjoyment
in
its
pursuit
each
day
brings
its
round
of
single
happy
pleasure

the
drawback
of

detains
their

and
the
rough

rock
grow
pregnant
with
delight
if
he
be
a
true

tedious
that
the

cover
her

i
have
often
wonder
at
gordon
in
his
place
i
should
have
act
differently
it
be
optional
with
gordon
to
live
or
die
he
prefer
to
die
i
should
have
live
if
only
to
get
the
well
of
the
mahdi
with
joy
of
strive
and
fierce
delight
of
thwart
i
should
have
dog
and
harass
the
mahdi
like
nemesis
until
i
have
him
down
i
maintain
that
to
live
be
harder
and
nobler
than
to
die
to
bear
life
burden
suffer
its
sorrow
endure
its
agony
be
the
great
heroism
the
relief
of
khartoum
that
be
to
say
remove
the
garrison
and
those
anxious
to
leave
be
at
first
comparatively
speak
an
easy
task
i
should
have
commenced
by
render
my
position
impregnable
by
building
triple
fortification
inside
khartoum
abut
on
the
nile
with
boat
and
steamer
ever
ready
no
mahdist
should
have
get
at
me
or
my
garrison
i
should
then
have
command
all
those
civilian
desirous
of
submit
to
the
mahdi
to
leave
khartoum
people
do
not
realise
how
ready
nay
eager
they
be
to
do
so
gordon
say
to
an
interviewer
before
start
the
moment
it
be
know
we
have
give
up
the
game
every
man
will
be
only
too
eager
to
go
over
to
the
mahdi
all
men
worship
the
rise
sun
but
i
should
never
have
stuck
to
khartoum
i
would
have
depart
with
my
garrison
to
safer
land
by
the
upper
white
nile
it
would
not
have
be
difficult
to
get
to
berber
if
gordon
have
start
without
delay
in
fact
as
soon
as
he
have
fortify
himself
at
khartoum
my
withdrawal
would
have
be
to
attack
the
well
leave
go
of
the
leg
to
fly
at
the
throat
but
if
for
some
reason
i
have
decide
to
stay
my
fortify
citadel
would
have
held
the
mahdist
at
bay
till
help
come
there
would
have
be
no
danger
of
starvation
as
i
should
have
turn
all
undesirable
out
then
as
a
last
resource
there
be
the
nile
my
one
idea
would
have
be
to
carry
out
what
i
have
undertaken
to
do
without
any
outside
help
if
i
have
go
to
khartoum
to
rescue
the
garrison
the
garrison
would
have
be
rescue
when
gordon
start
this
be
what
he
undertook
to
do
there
be
no
thought
or
question
of
send
a
rescue
expedition
it
be
failure
all
round
ckudou
fail
first
then
gladstone
and
the
government
but
i
have
refrain
from
all
pubhc
expression
of
opinion
because
it
be
not
permit
in
england
to
criticise
gordon
and
besides
he
be
a
true
hero
and
he
die
nobly
that
silence
one
nevertheleas
i
hold
tb
t
gonjon
p
ed
not
have
die
