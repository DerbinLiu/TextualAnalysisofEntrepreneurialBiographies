small
rural
hospital

ordinarily
a
hospital
dedication
would
not
attract
much
attention
let
alone
be
described
as
miraculous
but
this
be
not
an
ordinary
hospital
as
if
to
provide
testimony
to
its
extraordinariness
not
one
not
two
but
different
religious

not
the
first
miracle
i
have
be
privileged
to

in
my
lifetime
almost
year
earlier
i
watch
a
small
electrical
device
cobble
together
with
spare
part
accord
to
a
diagram
for
an
electronic
metronome

from
a
popular
magazine

after

preside
over
during
decade
of
struggle
and
crisis

lead
manufacturer
of
implantable
medical
technology
that
the
company
medtronic
have
survive
its
first
year
be
a
miracle
in
its
own
right
sometimes
indeed
i
have
to
pinch
myself
to
make
sure
the
entire
miraculous
journey
from
a
snowy
neighborhood
in
northeast
minneapolis
to
this
verdant
slice
of
paradise
in
northwest
hawaii
have
not
be
a
dream
in
a
sense
of
course
it
have
but
then
i
consider
myself
a
visionary
and
a
futurist
i
believe
in
dream
and
vision
dream
and
vision
have
a
way
i
have
learn
of
predict
and
precede
reality
the
north
hawaii
community
hospital
be
not
my
dream
at
least
not
until
recently
it
be
however
the
dream
of
many
resident
of
the
big
island
northwest
corner
go
back
to
the
s
my
wife
doris
and
i
discover
upon
our
settle
here
more
than
seven
year
ago
that
in
fact
a
handful
of
concerned
citizen
have
be
actively
work
toward
such
a
facility
year
earlier
it
have
be
a
valiant
but
unsuccessful
struggle
hospital
be
big
complex
and
expensive
project
and
without
a
lot
of
money
and
clout
they
often
do
not
get
built
regardless
of
the
community
need
and
the
hard
work
of
their
advocate
the
big
island
be
the
poorest
of
the
hawaiian
island
the
population
of
mostly
rural
sparsely
settle
north
hawaii
be
in
poor
health
even
by
big
island
standard
the
resident
lack
an
up
to
date
and
appropriately
equip
medical
facility
and
information
but
while
there
be
demonstrable
need
there
be
neither
the
fund
nor
the
political
muscle
to
make
that
particular
dream
come
true
then
slowly
incrementally
the
process
begin
to
redevelop
in
dr
sharon
vitousek
a
physician
practice
in
the
town
of
waimea
lose
a
young
patient
to
injury
suffer
in
an
auto
accident
because
there
be
not
a
medical
center
close
enough
to
permit
timely
treatment
most
north
hawaiian
travel
either
to
kona
or
hilo
for
their
medical
care
drive
in
some
case
an
hour
and
a
half
one
way
for
help
there
and
then
she
decide
she
be
go
to
get
such
a
center
built
in
the
northwest
corner
with
the
help
of
an
emergency
medical
technician
name
susan
pueschel
who
be
then
work
at
the
lucy
henriques
clinic
nearby
dr
vitousek
begin
rally
the
community
and
search
for
way
to
pay
for
the
venture
i
be
intrigue
when
i
learn
about
the
group
effort
not
long
after
doris
and
i
have
settle
down
on
nearby
kiholo
bay
dr
vitousek
husband
randy
a
lawyer
happen
to
be
do
some
legal
work
for
me
at
the
time
when
he
told
his
wife
that
i
be
on
a
hospital
board
back
in
minneapolis
she
waste
no
time
in
contact
me
but
i
be
retire
with
a
flock
of
diverse
interest
to
pursue
in
my
newly
claimed
leisure
i
be
after
year
of
building
and
run
a
company
pleased
to
spend
some
time
simply
walk
the
beach
and
relax
in
my
hammock
so
when
they
ask
me
to
serve
on
their
board
i
say
no
i
say
i
would
be
willing
to
attend
a
meeting
a
couple
of
time
a
year
but
that
would
be
the
extent
of
it
famous
last
word
sharon
be
very
persistent
and
i
finally
agree
to
serve
in
an
advisory
role
within
a
short
time
i
be
hooked
the
well
acquaint
i
become
with
these
wonderful
people
and
the
more
i
understood
the
community
need
for
a
hospital
the
more
i
felt
compel
to
pitch
in
and
help
before
i
knew
it
i
be
deeply
absorbed
in
the
project
i
would
eventually
in
fact
be
elect
president
of
the
new
hospital
board
truth
be
told
it
be
not
only
the
community
need
and
the
dedication
of
my
new
neighbor
that
drew
me
in
it
be
the
opportunity
to
explore
some
of
the
idea
involve
holistic
medicine
i
have
acquire
over
the
past
several
year
it
be
the
once
in
a
lifetime
chance
to
help
build
from
the
ground
up
a
state
of
the
art
health
care
facility
design
around
and
for
the
patient
not
the
health
care
professional
and
that
incorporate
for
the
patient
sake
the
best
of
all
kind
of
medicine
allopathic
and
alternative
alike
here
i
come
to
realize
i
could
once
more
be
involve
in
something
new
and
important
and
large
enough
to
revolutionize
the
treatment
of
suffer
human
being
our
primary
concern
would
be
the
health
and
well
be
of
the
people
of
north
hawaii
but
what
we
accomplish
here
could
change
the
way
health
care
be
perceive
and
provide
the
world
over
eventually
i
write
a
paper
entitle
not
just
another
hospital
in
which
prior
to
the
actual
groundbreaking
i
laid
out
my
personal
vision
for
the
new
north
hawaii
community
hospital
i
point
out
that
while
my
life
work
have
be
in
the
field
of
medical
technology
and
that
while
i
strongly
believe
in
and
support
the
use
of
the
late
technology
in
medical
treatment
there
be
a
human
side
to
heal
that
must
be
but
too
often
be
not
consider
i
express
moreover
my
concern
about
what
seem
to
me
to
be
a
decline
level
of
health
care
quality
even
as
the
cost
of
that
care
seem
to
be
perpetually
rise
give
that
background
and
have
such
concern
what
i
ask
should
the
new
hospital
i
be
help
to
build
be
all
about
there
be
in
fact
a
number
of
way
the
nhch
could
and
should
be
different
first
of
all
the
new
hospital
would
be
patient
center
it
would
not
be
a
machine
shop
where
human
body
like
mechanical
equipment
be
take
to
be
repair
as
a
businessman
i
have
learn
from
experience
the
vital
importance
of
put
the
customer
front
and
center
in
a
hospital
set
that
customer
be
of
course
the
patient
the
patient
might
like
to
have
for
example
a
scenic
view
out
his
or
her
window
a
pleasantly
furnish
room
with
a
door
opening
directly
on
the
ground
savory
as
well
as
nutritious
meal
liberal
visit
hour
ready
access
to
his
or
her
medical
record
and
a
congenial
open
and
understand
relationship
with
the
entire
staff
from
the
doctor
to
the
housekeeper
above
all
this
hospital
would
be
a
heal
instrument
provide
a
total
heal
environment
i
also
hop
i
say
that
the
new
hospital
would
practice
what
many
of
us
call
integrate
or
complementary
medicine
both
of
which
term
i
prefer
to
alternative
in
other
word
the
facility
medical
staff
would
be
open
to
a
variety
of
healer
and
heal
technique
that
might
not
have
be
part
of
the
conventional
western
medical
school
curriculum
and
that
whatever
method
and
technique
be
employ
would
serve
to
turn
on
the
natural
healer
within
the
patient
there
be
after
all
only
one
effective
heal
mechanism
in
the
world
and
that
be
the
heal
capability
we
have
built
into
our
body
it
be
a
marvelous
capability
but
it
have
to
be
turn
on
and
not
suppress
what
we
call
integrate
or
complementary
medicine
refers
to
treatment
method
that
may
not
be
amenable
to
double
blind
study
and
conventional
statistical
measurement
but
do
produce
positive
long
term
outcome
from
the
patient
point
of
view
we
have
do
great
harm
i
be
afraid
by
require
medical
care
to
conform
to
such
statistical
standard
what
count
or
should
count
be
the
long
term
level
of
quality
of
life
the
treatment
provide
complementary
medicine
have
a
positive
long
term
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
patient
life
often
refer
to
in
medical
circle
as
the
health
related
quality
of
life
or
hrql
i
believe
far
that
the
new
hospital
should
play
a
major
role
in
teach
harmony
in
people
life
part
of
that
harmony
derives
from
the
state
of
health
of
the
physical
body
that
largely
mechanical
chemical
electrical
entity
in
which
we
live
but
the
other
equally
essential
component
be
the
mind
and
the
spirit
the
stimulus
that
affect
mind
and
spirit
be
they
pleasant
sensory
input
care
human
relationship
religious
faith
or
whatever
affect
the
body
as
well
thus
i
felt
a
major
function
of
the
hospital
should
be
educate
the
community
on
the
importance
of
harmony
to
the
health
of
mind
spirit
and
body
about
the
same
time
as
i
write
that
paper
the
board
of
director
of
a
group
call
the
archaeus
project
described
their
thought
on
the
cyberphysiologic
hospital
a
new
kind
of
heal
center
that
would
acknowledge
and
incorporate
an
understand
of
the
relationship
between
the
patient
mind
body
and
spirit
in
the
heal
process
that
group
which
i
have
start
back
in
minneapolis
be
now
base
in
hawaii
and
include
medical
professional
care
provider
and
other
interested
people
recommend
dozen
of
component
for
a
new
kind
of
hospital
many
of
those
component
base
on
the
experience
of
the
planetree
model
hospital
project
at
pacific
presbyterian
hospital
in
san
francisco
and
other
innovative
care
experiment
around
the
world
the
group
recommendation
for
the
new
hospital
environment
include
for
example
window
offering
a
salubrious
outside
view
with
the
patient
bed
position
so
he
or
she
can
easily
take
advantage
of
the
vista
the
window
for
that
matter
can
be
open
though
also
lock
and
control
if
necessary
slide
door
in
every
room
can
give
the
patient
direct
access

the

may

a
night

room
a
well
equip

the

feasible
their

for
the

and
themselves
record
music
as
well
as

the
patient

their

to
create
a
soothe

the

have
to
match
that
amount
however
and
by
the
late

have
raise
only
million
we
be
told
then
we
would
never
come
up
with
the

of
the
money
we
be
also
inform
that
even
if
we
do

we
would
never

critical

of

we
would
need
to

finally
we

it
would
be
difficult
to

from

that

we
be

as
well
have
be
incredible
i
ca
not
explain
it
except
to
say
it
be
be
a
miracle
it
be
be
divinely
decreed
despite
the
extraordinary
natural
beauty
of
the
big
island
we
be
a
rural
area
after
all
relatively
poor
and
offering
none
of
the
man
make
attraction
of
the
big
metropolitan
area
where
most
u
s
hospital
be
situate
but
despite
warning
to
the
contrary
we
begin
hearing
from
allopathic
internist
and
family
practitioner
early
on
in
the
process
we
be
then
told
that
we
would
not
get
the
specialist
we
would
need
but
lo
and
behold
the
specialist
have
come
too
an
excellent
cardiologist
for
example
an
outstanding
gynecologist
and
wonderful
surgeon
among
several
others
a
particularly
memorable
episode
involve
a
neurosurgeon
from
michigan
whom
i
have
know
from
my
day
at
medtronic
one
day
not
long
ago
the
surgeon
and
his
wife
happen
to
be
vacation
on
the
big
island
because
of
our
earlier
relationship
they
come
to
visit
doris
and
me
at
waimea
naturally
enough
i
take
him
on
a
tour
of
the
new
hospital
which
have
just
open
its
door
a
month
later
he
call
me
from
michigan
and
say
he
be
head
back
our
way
when
somewhat
surprised
i
ask
him
why
he
be
return
so
soon
he
say
he
would
sell
his
home
and
be
planning
to
work
at
the
nhch
our
outstanding
executive
team
leader
we
do
not
use
the
old
fashion
hierarchical
title
common
to
most
hospital
a
very
talented
administrator
name
patrick
linton
come
to
us
from
wisconsin
but
about
percent
of
the
nhch
staff
exclude
our
physician
be
local
many
of
our
nurse
work
in
state
run
hospital
but
many
just
seem
again
almost
miraculously
to
come
out
of
nowhere
there
be
so
many
wonderful
care
people
here
who
seem
to
have
be
wait
for
this
opportunity
i
ca
not
help
but
think
there
be
be
a
great
power
bring
us
all
together
one
of
the
recent
innovation
we
employ
here
make
the
most
we
believe
of
our
excellent
staff
it
be
call
a
care
team
which
literally
brings
our
primary
nurse
aide
and
housekeeper
together
in
group
of
five
each
team
be
capable
of
take
care
of
eight
patient
a
small
enough
number
to
allow
the
kind
of
close
personal
contact
among
staff
and
between
staff
and
patient
that
we
believe
be
desirable
this
system
require
of
course
that
nurse
learn
to
perform
multiple
task
from
say
administer
an
electrocardiogram
to
perform
various
type
of
blood
work
but
it
result
in
a
closer
relationship
with
patient
who
in
a
more
conventional
hospital
have
to
deal
with
several
different
nurse
during
a
shift
increase
the
apparent
impersonal
nature
of
their
hospital
stay
skeptic
understandably
point
to
such
innovation
and
insist
that
add
complementary
therapy
to
allopathic
medicine
will
inevitably
increase
the
cost
of
care
and
be
not
one
of
our
state
objective
to
contain
rise
hospital
cost
my
response
be
that
our
way
wo
not
increase
the
cost
of
care
that
in
fact
when
all
system
be
operating
at
their
optimal
level
the
nhch
will
be
a
model
of
efficient
and
cost
effective
diagnosis
and
treatment
in
the
conventional
hospital
for
example
about
percent
of
salary
go
to
people
who
be
not
actually
perform
their
assign
function
at
any
give
time
because
of
over
specialization
those
employee
may
be
very
active
for
two
or
three
hour
but
the
rest
of
their
shift
comprises
a
great
deal
of
downtime
our
cross
train
multi
functional
staff
member
be
kept
busy
and
on
task
throughout
their
shift
there
be
also
the
issue
of
hospital
design
the
flow
of
patient
from
one
function
to
another
though
extremely
important
be
not
a
high
priority
in
the
design
of
most
conventional
hospital
built
decade
ago
visitor
from
other
institution
say
they
ca
not
get
over
the
efficiency
of
our
layout
as
patient
be
transport
swiftly
from
for
instance
the
emergency
room
to
our
radiology
station
to
intensive
care
with
minimal
traffic
jam
and
delay
when
completely
in
place
our
computerize
record
keep
create
from
scratch
without
labor
intensive
and
time
consume
conversion
from
paper
file
should
also
result
in
sizable
saving
and
complementary
procedure
and
provision
can
be
significantly
less
costly
themselves
when
we
be
initially
stock
our
pharmacy
for
instance
we
spent
on
allopathic
drug
while
put
out
only
for
a
similar
quantity
of
herbal
medication
still
to
some
people
much
of
what
we
be
do
here
on
the
big
island
be
just
plain
crazy
maybe
they
be
right
which
do
not
mean
we
should
not
be
do
it
do
patient
really
care
about
the
picture
hang
in
their
hospital
room
if
they
be
sick
enough
they
probably
do
not
but
if
they
be
not
if
they
be
like
the
majority
of
patient
to
whom
an
overnight
stay
in
a
hospital
room
be
frighten
and
uncomfortable
a
choice
of
a
particular
watercolor
landscape
may
be
important
indeed
our
very
first
patient
be
a
woman
who
be
have
elective
surgery
two
day
before
the
schedule
procedure
she
come
in
and
from
the
hospital
collection
all
of
it
create
by
the
way
by
local
artist
picked
out
the
painting
she
want
in
her
room
select
the
artwork
that
brighten
her
personal
space
may
have
be
a
small
item
in
the
overall
scheme
of
thing
but
it
be
one
of
several
way
of
give
the
patient
a
sense
of
comfort
participation
and
control
over
her
hospital
stay
the
bottom
line
will
be
the
long
term
cyberphysiological
outcome
from
the
patient
point
of
view
not
from
ours
this
be
what
will
ultimately
decide
how
effective
we
be
in
provide
a
new
kind
of
medicine
as
a
new
kind
of
heal
center
this
be
what
health
care
professional
all
over
the
world
will
be
watch
toward
that
end
we
have
be
develop
method
for
measure
those
outcome
as
i
indicate
earlier
it
wo
not
be
the
patient
physiological
measurement
that
matter
most
but
how
they
believe
their
overall
quality
of
life
or
hrql
have
be
affected
by
the
heal
process
develop
such
measurement
be
a
time
consume
costly
process
in
its
own
right
quality
of
life
index
have
to
be
adjust
for
different
culture
and
different
disease
among
other
variable
but
that
index
be
essential
for
us
to
prove
to
the
world
that
integrate
heal
be
the
right
tack
for
the
st
century
hospital
as
i
write
this
we
be
staffed
for
complete
operation
of
patient
room
that
translates
into
more
than
good
job
for
the
local
community
when
in
another
year
all
of
our
room
be
full
employment
should
reach
at
least
we
know
that
bring
good
job
to
the
big
island
contributes
to
good
health
and
a
vibrant
community
thus
if
we
do
what
we
say
we
be
go
to
do
the
nhch
will
mean
a
great
deal
not
only
to
the
physical
mental
and
spiritual
well
be
of
the
community
but
to
the
community
social
and
economic
health
as
well

as
excite

where
more
than
year
ago
hippocrates
the
father
of
western
medicine
establish
a
medical

us
as
dramatic
both
for

moreover
at
a
time
of
epochal
upheaval
in

follow
shortly
thereafter
by
the

of
the
christian
message
of
spiritual
rebirth
and
renewal
a
time
of
change
and
promise
we
believe
not
unlike
our
own
we
believe
far
that
our
corner
of
the
big

have
an
opportunity
to
provide
the
world
of
the
st
century
a
strike
new

our
goal
be
to
develop
nothing
less
than
a
whole

for

while

quality
of

to
provide
such
a
model
to
establish
such
a
paradigm
we
believe
we
must
re
focus
health

resource
from

professional
to
the
public
itself
on
the
responsibility
of
each
person
for
his
or
her
health
and
wellness
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
crucial
element
of
the
nhch
mission
statement
be
empower
patient
and
family
to
become
actively
involve
in

the
archaeus
project
word
on
the
subject
can
well
serve
as
a
call
to
arm
at
least
as
far
as
our
heal
island
concept
be
concerned
the
propose
heal
island
model
rest
on
a
return
to
self
responsibility
and
its
success
depends
on
the
involvement
of
family
and
community
on
education
and
on
develop
incentive
and
understanding
that
will
inspire
healthy
behavior
in
this
region
this
approach
promise
strike
improvement
in
health
statistic
and
cost
containment
what
be
now
need
be
an
insurance
product
base
on
this
model
that
will
support
and
promote
this
vision
to
a
system
base
on
mechanistic
philosophy
and
the
well
define
technological
hardware
and
technique
of
modern
western
medicine
the
benefit
of
change
in
behavior
of
family

community
condition
of
good
mental
attitude
and
the
good
word
of
a
kindly
health
professional
must
seem
vague
and
intangible
clearly
it
be
time
to
address
preventive
measure
in
health
and
medicine
the
time
have
also
come
to
develop
an
integrate
medicine
that
combine
the
best
of
allopathic
therapy
with
the
method
and
skill
discover
by
complementary
medicine
new
approach
to

of

be
be
developed
and
old
approach
rediscover
people
be
already
implement
these
approach
to
patient

it
be
past
time
these
new
approach
be
recognize
within
the
insurance
and
governmental
bureaucracy
hawaii
have
do
much
to
provide
guidance
toward
the
future
of
health
care
it
be
completely
possible
that
we
can
develop
a
model
that
will
impact
the
rest
of
the
nation
and
the
world
so
the
miraculous
little
hospital
that
open
for
business
in
the
spring
of
be
only
part
of
the
dream
of
the
vision
that
we
north
hawaiian
have
conjure
for
the
big
island
to
develop
a
heal
island
on
the
foundation
of
that
hospital
be
obviously
a
huge
challenge
but
surely
not
impossible
if
you
believe
as
i
have
come
to
believe
in
spirituality
and
destiny
t
w
o
high
tech
high
touch
to
all
appearance
it
be
be
an
unusual
journey
by
an
apparent
anomaly
a
reserve
and
reticent
electrical
engineer
a
man
of
science

technology
a
conservative
lutheran
of
norwegian
and
dutch
ancestry
hail
from
a
snow
belt
state
becomes
deeply

acupuncture
and
other
non

in
the
troubled
paradise
of
rural
hawaii
and
be
now
bound
and
determine
to
help
create
in
his
adopt
home
a
heal
island
that
can
benefit
the
entire
world
begin
with
the
people
who
live
on
it
you
would
not
think
a
person
could
get
here
from
there
but
i
do
and
if
no
one
be
more
surprised
by
the
route
i
have
take
no
one
be
more
pleased
either
i
believe
it
be
be
a
life
well
spent
if
not
particularly
well
plan
and
although
the
path
from
my
minnesota
root
to
my
current
preoccupation
and
activity
in
hawaii
have
be
circuitous
it
have
follow
to
my
eye
a
clear
and
irrefutable
logic
i
have
be
driven
i
believe
by
a
heartfelt
desire
to
use
my
knowledge
and
energy
to
help
humankind
that
desire
be
pass
down
to
me
by
my
parent
and
grandparent
who
be
great
believer
in
goal
and
hard
work
and
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
while
actively
serve
their
church
eventually
my
church
it
be

by
my
many
wonderful
teacher
and
then
articulate
by
my
pastor
the
spark
be
provide
as
i
will
make
clear
a
little
later
by
a
saturday
afternoon
movie
when
i
be
still
a
boy
in
knee
pant
my
mature
effort
be
join
by
my
thousand
of
colleague
and
collaborator
at
medtronic
and
reward
in
many
way
by
the
countless
medical
professional
and
patient
who
chose
and
have
benefit
from
the
technology
medtronic
provide
since
our
marriage
in
my
wife
doris
have
be
my
personal
guide
encourage
my
exploration
of
complementary
medicine
and
awaken
me
to
the
mental
spiritual
and
physical
benefit
of
massage
acupuncture
and
other
healthful
modality
whatever
the
original
source
or
source
of
that
desire
it
have
brought
me
here
where
now
in
my
middle
s
i
be
at
peace
with
myself
and
my
environment
to
some
folk
i
may
seem
at
least
from
a
distance
a
round
peg
in
a
square
hole
the
creator
of
the
world
first
battery
operate
wearable
cardiac
pacemaker
and
one
of
the
pioneer
of
the
electronic
implantable
medical
device
industry
wholeheartedly
embrace
spiritual
heal
and
other
decidedly
low
tech
response
to
what
ail
us
as
human
being
may
seem
peculiar
indeed
some
of
my
old
neighborhood
friend
and
co
worker
from
the
early
day
of
medtronic
who
will
recall
my
natural
discomfort
among
stranger
have
no
doubt
wonder
if
this
be
the
same
earl
bakken
who
speaks
to
large
professional
audience
on
the
benefit
of
holistic
health
care
and
who
routinely
begin
business
meeting
in
hawaii
with
hand
hold
prayer
and
a
public
unburden
of
personal
concern
i
have
be
described
in
my
later
year
as
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
from
my
point
of
view
however
that
be
a
quibble
i
be
a
technical
man
in
a
spiritual
land
yes
but
like
all
human
being
i
be
a
spiritual
creature
too
and
even
a
spiritual
land
can
benefit
from
technology
the
truth
be
the
hawaiian
energy
that
animates
me
today
do
not
represent
a
rejection
of
or
a
shift
away
from
anything
i
have
do
or
believe
back
in
minnesota
the
aloha
spirit
and
my
concomitant
belief
in
a
holistic
approach
to
heal
and
health
be
simply
an
addition
to
and
integration
with
my
long
held
idea
ideal
and
philosophy
i
trust
that
the
why
s
of
my
story
the
reason
for
the
twist
and
turn
of
my
journey
will
become
clear
or
at
least
more
understandable
as
this
narrative
progress
for
now
though
let
me
explain
what
i
have
be
up
to
since
settle
down
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
in
the
late
s
what
i
believe
about
heal
and
health
care
and
why
i
be
so
passionately
involve
in
the
cause
of
the
heal
island

not
long
after
doris
and
i
move
into
our
adopt
home
on
the
big
island
i
set
down
my
observation
thought
and
belief
on
the
integration
of
the
heal
art
and
the
heal
science
for
a
colloquium
organize
by
the
north
hawaii
community
hospital
board
and
the
archaeus
project
which
i
described
briefly
in
the
previous
chapter
and
will
discus
far
in
chapter
my
feeling
about
the
subject
have
only
be
strengthen
by
recent
event
while
be
continually
reinforce
by
the
idea
and
observation
of
several
colleague
and
love
one
doris
foremost
among
them
we
have
in
hawaii
i
write
the
opportunity
to
achieve
something
very
special
by
building
a
heal
center
from
the
ground
up
to
be
able
to
design
a
new
hospital
as
the
heal
community
first
major
component
and
build
it
in
such
a
way
that
will
be
appropriate
to
the
medical
demand
of
the
new
millennium
be
an
excite
prospect
indeed
not
only
would
this
hospital
and
eventually
our
multifaceted
heal
complex
provide
high
quality
care
and
good
job
for
our
community
it
could
serve
as
a
demonstration
project
for
the
entire
united
state
and
the
world
for
health
care
this
be
to
borrow
from
charles
dickens
both
the
best
of
time
and
the
bad
of
time
in
many
way
it
be
the
bad
of
time
to
be
opening
a
new
hospital
especially
a
small
one
because
small
community
hospital
be
closing
all
over
the
united
state
these
hospital
be
have
trouble
fill
their
bed
and
recruiting
personnel
but
it
also
the
best
of
time
because
important
even
revolutionary
change
be
take
place
in
medicine
and
health
care
delivery
a
new
hospital
and
heal
center
if
design
built
and
operate
with
a
new
philosophy
and
new
technique
could
make
the
most
of
those
advance
everybody
seem
to
agree
that
we
be
in
the
middle
of
a
healthcare
crisis
cost
continue
to
spiral
upward
despite
effort
on
the
part
of
both
the
private
and

some
progress

be
make
in
some
part
of
the
country
include
the
twin
city
back
in
minnesota
to
at
least
slow
the
ascent
of
health
care
expenditure
but
the
pressure
to
do
more
with
less
weighs
heavily
on
everybody
and
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
quality
of
care
several
approach
have
receive
widespread
attention
as
mean
by
which
to
contend
with
the
crisis
these
include
manage
care
health
maintenance
organization
prefer
provider
organization
and
other
much
discuss
system
outcome
study
to
determine
treatment
appropriate
to
different
patient
population
and
regional
initiative
in
which
service
be
divide
up
and
assign
to
different
hospital
within
a
give
geographic
area
our
approach
at
the
north
hawaii
community
hospital
would
be
we
decide
something
entirely
different
we
call
it
the
concept
the
basic
idea
simply
state
be
to
look
ahead
and
forget
about
the
health
care
system
that
prevails
today
the
question
for
those
of
us
planning
that
heal
island
become
what
would
the
ideal
health
care
system
look
like
in
the
year
suppose
we
have
a
magic
wand
and
could
whisk
away
the
litigious
environment
and
bureaucracy
that
be
smother
so
many
of
our
best
effort
today
suppose
we
could
determine
much
more
than
we
know
today
about
the
nature
of
the
mind
in
matter
of
health
and
disease
as
well
as
about
the
critical
heal
factor
borne
by
the
patient
attitude
what
sort
of
optimum
health
care
system
could
we
then
develop
if
we
could
use
our
imagination
and
intuition
if
we
could
conjure
a
vision
of
what
this
new
world
might
be
we
would
have
a
goal
and
direction
toward
which
to
travel
i
chose
the
year
because
it
be
then
when
i
write
that
manifesto
more
than
long
year
away
assume
that
few
of
us
feel
really
threaten
by
prospect
in
a
year
so
distant
in
the
future
when
we
look
out
into
the
distant
future
we
be
freer
to
imagine
to
let
our
vision
wander
without
fear
of
the
possible
consequence
the
endless
recommendation
come
out
of
private
and
public
study
task
force
and
commission
all
seem
to
agree
that
a
fundamental
restructuring
of
the
system
be
necessary
but
no
one
seem
to
know
quite
how
to
go
about
it
ration
variation
on
a
national
health
care
system
the
weak
promise
of
outcome
study
all
of
these
seem
to
be
the
result
of
too
short
a
vision
too
many
limitation
impose
by
the
way
we
look
at
the
situation
immediately
at
hand
we
need
i
believe
then
to
take
a
longer
view
and
let
our
mind
wander
i
believe
we
need
to
do
that
today

consider
for
starter
the
dichotomy
of
mind
and
body
suppose
that
on
my
left
be
the
phenomenon
that
involve
the
mind
and
to
my
right
the
phenomenon
that
involve
the
body
note
that
when
we
use
the
term
mind
we
do
not
identify
mind
with
brain
the
mind
be
not
entirely
separate
from
the
brain
but
it
be
not
a
physical
entity
as
the
brain
be
different
people
use
different
term
for
the
mind
consciousness
or
psyche
for
instance
it
be
clear
at
any
rate
that
each
of
our
individual
mind
creates
a
more
or
less
individual
reality
this
be
not
to
say
that
reality
be
entirely
a
product
of
individual
consciousness
but
that
each
of
our
mind
perceives
interprets
and
reacts
to
whatever
reality
in
itself
might
be
through
the
medium
of
a
vast
and
largely
unconscious
reservoir
of
personal
experience
combine
with
a
particular
social
and
cultural
background
such
variation
in
the
interpretation
of
reality
cannot
be
reduce
to
issue
of
chemical
and
physical
reaction
and
they
have
the
great
implication
for
individual
response
to
health
and
disease
to
my
right
we
have
place
our
notion
about
the
body
we
usually
think
of
the
body
as
a
machine
of
which
the
mind
be
a
non
causal
ineffectual
epiphenomenon
we
believe
that
every
function
of
this
flesh
and
blood
machine
eventually
can
be
study
and
elucidate
this
be
the
reductionist
viewpoint
if
you
look
at
finer
and
finer
point
down
to
cell
and
molecule
down
to
the
atomic
level
you
be
go
to
find
that
anything
that
be
wrong
with
the
body
can
be
define
by
some
change
in
the
physical
structure
of
that
body
and
once
have
ascertain
the
causal
chain
lead
to
the
disorder
you
can
develop
and
apply
appropriate
response
to
the
problem
such
a
belief
however
be
really
as
much
a
matter
of
faith
as
anything
else
though
it
be
what
be
generally
call
scientific
medicine
today
yet
if
the
body
be
perceive
as
a
machine
then
use
scientific
medicine
and
medical
technology
would
seem
to
be
the
only
rational
way
to
deliver
medical
care
all
this
of
course
have
little
to
do
with
the
mind
we
aggressively
treat
the
human
body
with
surgery
drug
and
device
and
the
mind
be
routinely
left
out
of
the
equation
however
it
be
very
interest
to
note
that
technology
usually
work
much
well
if
the
mind
of
the
patient
be
make
a
part
of
the
process
i
know
from
my
own
work
at
medtronic
that
we
have
much
well
result
with
certain
device
when
patient
understand
the
device
believe
in
its
effectiveness
and
appreciate
the
implication
of
living
with
it
inside
them
come
from
the
side
of
the
mind
as
be
more
often
do
in
so
call
humanistic
or
holistic
medicine
we
see
something
that
incorporates
a
variety
of
medical
practice
that
fall
outside
what
be
generally
taught
in
medical
school
therapeutic
approach
with
a
long
and
successful
history
such
as
nutrition
other
test
result
technology
be
thought
to
solve
all
problem
when
the
result
do
not
turn
out
as
expect
we
use
more
technology
to
attempt
to
bridge
the
gap
recently
though
i
have
be
see
change
in
the
attitude
of
medical
professional
toward
high
touch
care
doctor
be
recognize
that
the
patient
be
more
than
a
machine
of
course
there
have
always
be
doctor
who
understand
that
and
practice
medicine
as
an
art
unfortunately
they
do
not
get
paid
for
it
it
be
difficult
to
practice
high
touch
medicine
extensively
when
there
be
no
compensation
for
it
in
spite
of
that
problem
the
use
of
high
touch
be
now
grow
rapidly
eventually
we
will
be
able
to
combine
the
intelligent
use
of
technology
with
high
touch
technique
incorporate
the
patient
mind
into
the
heal
process
we
will
learn
to
reach
the
healer
within
to
turn
on
and
support
natural
heal
process
understand
that
the
mechanism
for
activate
the
inner
healer
will
not
be
the
same
for
everyone
the
movement
toward
high
touch
medicine
will
have
an
effect
on
both
the
physical
and
administrative
aspect
of
future
hospital
and
other
healthcare
center
at
the
archaeus
project
we
coin
the
term
cyberphysiology
cyber
derives
from
the
greek
term
kybernetes
refer
to
the
helmsman
of
a
ship
and
point
to
the
mind
as
the
director
or
helmsman
of
the
body
the
term
be
use
more
and
more
acknowledge
the
grow
attention
that
be
be
paid
to
the
interaction
between
mind
and
body
one
more
good
way
to
address
the
health
care
crisis
and
build
a
new
kind
of
heal
for
the
st
century
a
cyberphysiologic
way
involves
generate
great
patient
satisfaction
the
proper
application
of
cyberphysiologic
principle
will
mean
that
patient
leave
the
hospital
sooner
they
will
be
satisfied
with
their
care
so
that
the
risk
of
litigation
will
be
reduce
even
if
the
result
be
not
everything
they
expect
staff
satisfaction
be
also
an
important
factor
especially
when
it
come
to
recruiting
and
retain
first
rate
personnel
as
i
travel
around
the
united
state
tell
people
about
our
new
hospital
in
north
hawaii
i
find
nurse
and
doctor
everywhere
say
i
want
to
come
i
want
to
join
you
they
perceive
our
new
facility
as
an
opportunity
to
return
to
the
kind
of
practice
that
so
many
of
them
go
into
their
profession
to
find
but
have
not
be
encourage
to
practice
one
of
the
big
problem
for
a
small
hospital
be
to
maintain
the
high
occupancy
rate
that
be
require
to
remain
solvent
if
we
have
high
patient
satisfaction
doctor
be
go
to
refer
patient
to
our
hospital
and
we
can
keep
the
bed
fill
we
have
to
change
moreover
the
way
caregiver
be
reimburse
for
their
service
we
need
to
see
that
high
touch
approach
to
medicine
be
compensate
until
then
this
kind
of
balance
high
tech
high
touch
medicine
be
premature
physician
be
already
move
toward
this
way
of
practice
medicine
but
we
have
to
prepare
the
ground
for
it
we
need
to
learn
from
others
who
be
do
innovative
thing
from
the
planetree
organization
in
san
francisco
for
example
so
the
best
of
the
new
approach
to
patient
center
care
holistic
therapy
and
hospital
design
can
be
share
and
incorporate
into
new
project
we
need
to
know
exactly
what
kind
of
medicine
we
be
talk
about
and
the
impact
of
that
practice
on
both
the
patient
and
the
care
giver
this
knowledge
will
be
essential
to
building
a
whole
new
approach
to
heal
long
before

our
plan
through
the
archaeus
project
be
to
devise
a
system
that
would
provide
optimum
health
care
for
our
north
hawaii
community
by
the
year
we
felt
if
we
could
implement
all
we
knew
about
health
and
sickness
care
the
result
would
look
very
different
from
the
care
we
commonly
see
deliver
today
it
would
reflect
our
knowledge
of
such
phenomenon
as
the
difference
between
relief
of
symptom
and
true
cure
the
interdependence
of
mind
and
body
as
well
as
mind
and
environment
the
innate
ability
of
the
body
to
heal
itself
and
the
curative
effect
of
a
positive
relationship
between
the
patient
and
the
health
care
professional
once
we
define
our
vision
for
an
optimum
health
care
system
by
we
need
to
determine
the
mean
necessary
to
make
it
a
reality
we
need
to
seek
we
believe
an
effective
balance
between
high
tech
therapy
and
the
heal
that
take
place
within
the
complex
relationship
of
mind
and
body
we
need
to
learn
how
to
activate
this
dormant
potential
for
heal
neither
technology
nor
high
touch
alone
be
sufficient
properly
apply
however
technology
can
give
direction
to
the
body
heal
process
in
such
a
supportive
role
technology
will
continue
to
hold
an
important
place
in
the
medical
armamentarium
despite
its
high
cost
and
its
sometimes
inappropriate
application
unfortunately
in
the
past
several
decade
we
have
proceed
as
if
our
technological
intervention
and
medication
operate
independently
of
the
mind
of
either
the
patient
or
the
doctor
though
the
mind
as
we
have
come
to
recognize
can
modulate
the
effect
of
a
device
or
drug
in
a
very
positive
way
likewise
the
device
or
drug
may
elicit
heal
power
from
the
patient
we
decide
we
must
cultivate
a
new
class
of
health
care
professional
who
have
the
ability
to
diagnose
by
sight
smell
and
feel
as
well
as
by
high
tech
devices
and
to
heal
by
touch
as
well
as
by
device
and
drug
in
the
wonderful
bedside
manner
tradition
of
the
old
fashion
family
doctor
our
high
tech
capability
can
complement
such
skill
and
will
function
all
the
more
effectively
because
they
be
administer
not
with
the
cold
uncaring
approach
of
an
indifferent
technologist
but
with
the
warmth
and
concern
of
a
familiar
care
giver
our
machine
and
device
will
work
best
when
the
patient
willingly
and
optimistically
participates
in
the
treatment
when
all
of
these
condition
be
right
the
effectiveness
of
medicine
in
the
st
century
may
well
exceed
anything
we
currently
imagine
project
have
also
be
look
for
way
to
reduce
the
cost
of
litigation
so
precious
resource
would
not
be
waste
in
the
practice
of
defensive
medicine
malpractice
continue
to
be
a
real
problem
of
course
and
patient
must
be
compensate
for
damage
result
from
medical
incompetence
but
the
award
have
to
be
kept
in
scale
we
continue
to
seek
way
to
trim
regulatory
and
bureaucratic
overhead
as
we
reform
our
reimbursement
policy
at
the
heart
of
our
reform
effort

a
deceptively
simple
plan

diagnosis

traditionally
be

from
the

of
the

the

sits
across
a

from
the

of
the

the

therapeutic
power
in
its
own

and
like
much
of
eastern
medicine
tends
to
encourage
treatment
of
the
patient
problem
physical
mental
or
spiritual
instead
of
individual
symptom
in
the
united

by
contrast
it
sometimes
seem
as
though
we
would
prefer
the
patient
be
tend
to
by
a
computer
at
the
archaeus
project
we
have
be
advocate
the
concept
of
cyberphysiological
heal
this
comprises
a
wide
range
of
technique
and
phenomenon
that
appear
to
be
able
to
affect
a
variety
of
autonomous
physiological
function
in
profound
and
specific
way
it
include
the
discipline
of
psychoneuroimmunology
and
autogenics
the
phenomenon
of
biofeedback
and
hypnotherapy
the
symptomatology
of
multiple
personality
disorder
and
the
practice
of
meditation
yoga
and
similar
technique
that
can
influence
a
person
consciousness
there
be
also
the
very
important
concept
of
chronobiology
which
refers
to
the
relationship
of
our
mind
and
body
to
time
to
the
cycle
and
rhythm
that
relate
to
our
physical
and
mental
activity
and
to
the
parameter
of
our
physical
activity
chronobiology
concern
itself
with
how
change
in
time
of
day
day
of
the
week
and
week
of
the
month
affect
our
mind
and
body
perhaps
we
be
born
chronobiologically
tune
and
then
be
wrongly
taught
to
believe
that
there
be
a
division
between
mind
and
body
that
lead
to
abstraction
of
experience
maybe
small
child
need
to
be
encourage
to
preserve
their
natural
adaptation
an
acute
awareness
of
these
pattern
and
fluctuation
can
greatly
improve
our
understand
of
physical
ailment
the
measurement
of
blood
pressure
be
a
prime
example
of
the
need
for
a
chronobiological
approach
to
health
care
it
be
be
estimate
that
fully
half
of
the
treatment
for
high
blood
pressure
in
the
united
state
be
unnecessary
many
of
those
treat
for
the
disease
be
simply
measure
at
the
wrong
time
of
day
conversely
many
others
who
do
have
high
blood
pressure
may
go
untreated
because
measurement
be
not
take
at
a
time
of
day
when
their
blood
pressure
be
elevate
i
myself
have
be
a
chronobiologist
for
more
than
year
and
have
learn
a
great
deal
about
these
essential
time
body
dynamic
in
work
with
professor
franz
halberg
at
the
university
of
minnesota
i
believe
the
eventual
integration
of
cyberphysiology
and
chronobiology
into
conventional
western
or
allopathic
medicine
will
by
itself
help
improve
health
care
dramatically
indeed
physician
will
someday
look
back
on
the
way
medicine
be
currently
practice
and
wonder
why
such
fundamental
aspect
of
human
function
be
not
routinely
take
into
account
the
cost
of
implement
the
technique
associate
with
cyberphysiology
and
chronobiology
be
negligible
because
once
learn
they
can
be
practice
independently
without
medical
supervision
more
important
the
consistent
use
of
such
technique
can
significantly
augment
the
quality
of
patient
life
i
want
to
emphasize
our
belief
that
the
technique
of
cyberphysiology
and
chronobiology
be
not
intend
to
replace
conventional
medicine
we
be
not
strictly
speak
look
for
alternative
to
current
care
we
be
advocate
significant
adjunctive
and
complementary
approach
to
the
medicine
we
know
now
a
powerful
combination
of
the
best
of
both
high
tech
and
high
touch
therapy

my
journey
have
be
and
continue
to
be
not
a
narrow
of
perspective
like
a
railroad
track
recede
in
the
distance
but
a
widen
of
scope
and
possibility
like
the
rise
of
the
sun
above
vast
mauna
kea
if
i
have
learn
one
thing
over
the
course
of
my
journey
in
fact
i
have
learn
far
more
than
i
will
ever
be
able
to
convey
in
the
page
of
this

it
be
that
everything

every

interdependently
with
our
environment
and
the
success
of
our
endeavor
great
and
small
alike
rest
not
only
on
our
own
individual
effort

on
the
strength
and
condition
of
those
around
us
the
idea
of
the
human
body

a
trick
of
the

it
be
fruitless

what
i
will
call
here
the
tutu
phenomenon
in

hawaiian
culture
tutu
be
your
grandmother
who
by
virtue
of
her
age
and
experience
be
a
keeper
of
much
knowledge
good
sense
and
love
when
you
be
troubled
or
ill
you
go
to
tutu
s
house
for
counsel
and
comfort
before
we
would
open
our
new
hospital
in
waimea
we
make
sure
we
have
establish
our
own
tutu
house
where
the
entire
community
could
come
for
education
and
outreach
at
tutu
house
we
offer
not
only
the
highly
effective
touch
of
the
wise
elder
on

a
great
deal

look
back
now
on
my
own
beginning
to
my
boyhood
home
in
snowy
minneapolis
i
sometimes
think
i
have
come
a
long
way
yet
when
i
think
again
i
be
not
so
sure
we
be
always
connect
to
our
past
no
matter
how
many
zig
and
zag
our
path
have
take
and
so
in
way
not
always
apparent
our
past
presage
what
lie
ahead
i
do
not
have
a
tutu
house
way
back
there
in
minnesota
but
i
do
have
a
warm
love
home
and
wise
care
mentor
and
though
i
do
not
think
in
such
term
at
the

i

then

e
electricity
and
life
i
have
always
be
fascinate
by
electricity
my
interest
in
the
phenomenon
go
back
farther
in
fact
than
i
can
remember
my
mother
told
me
that
when
i
be
a
toddler
i
be
attract
to
electrical
cord
plug
and
connector
back
then
during
the
s
a
home
electrical
wiring
often
ran
along
the
outside
of
the
interior
wall
and
accord
to
my
mother
i
be
especially
interested
as
a
very
small
boy
in
the
porcelain
insulator
that
protrude
from
the
wall
who
know
why
maybe
because
they
be
so
white
and
shiny
maybe
because
they
seem
mysterious
with
no
obvious
reason
for
be
there
at
any
rate
one
of
my
uncle
who
happen
to
be
an
electrician
thought
my
interest
in
electricity
be
dangerous
he
told
my
mother
in
no
uncertain
term
that
she
should
stop
me
from
play
with
those
cord
and
equipment
that
boy
go
to
electrocute
himself
someday
he
warn
her
sternly
needle
to
say
my
mother
do
not
stop
me
rather
than
attempt
to
stifle
or
redirect
my
curiosity
she
encourage
it
as
a
result
i
have
her
more
than
anyone
else
to
thank
for
this
story

my
mother
born
florence
hendricks
be
of
dutch
and
english
extraction
my
father
osval
bakken
be
pure
norwegian
both
of
his
parent
have
come
here
from
norway
when
i
be
grow
up
in
columbia
height
in
the
northeast
corner
of
minneapolis
minnesota
our
norwegian
heritage
seem
to
play
the
most
important
role
in
part
because
my
father
family
live
in
the
neighborhood
and
in
part
because
we
belong
to
the
nearby
first
lutheran
church
of
columbia
height
where
my
father
have
be
the
first
confirmand
we
be
all
very
active
in
that
church
i
be
still
enrol
there
as
a
member
with
its
emphasis
on
fundamental
norwegian
lutheran
teaching
it
have
in
fact
an
enormous
influence
on
my
life
it
be
also
the
place
where
i
learn
to
eat
lutefisk
a
winter
time
dish
of
lye
soak
cod
that
be
consider
a
delicacy
among
scandinavian
grandfather
lars
bakken
have
be
i
believe
a
military
equipment
designer
back
in
norway
during
the
brief
time
i
knew
him
he
always
seem
to
be
sketch
plan
for
one
sort
of
mechanical
device
or
another
i
do
not
know
if
anything
ever
come
of
those
drawing
i
be
told
he
like
create
variation
of
two
wheel
vehicle
but
he
sure
seem
preoccupy
by
what
he
be
do
i
remember
go
over
to
his
house
with
my
parent
he
would
always
come
down
from
his
study
and
say
hello
but
then
he
would
go
right
back
upstairs
to
work
i
be
also
told
he
be
a
first
rate
mathematician
who
write
a
book
in
english
on
algebra
unfortunately
both
he
and
grandmother
bakken
pass
away
when
i
be
very
young
so
what
little
i
know
about
them
relies
on
dim
memory
and
hearsay
on
my
mother
side
of
the
family
my
grandfather
john
hendricks
also
pass
away
when
i
be
very
young
grandmother
eva
hendricks
however
live
right
next
door
to
us
on
th
avenue
northeast
despite
her
advanced
age
i
remember
think
how
modern
and
up
to
date
she
be
because
she
own
a
telephone
at
a
time
when
most
household
do
not
i
be
born
in
i
be
not
quite
an
only
child
but
almost
my
sister
marjorie
be
born
when
i
be
and
on
my
way
into
the
service
so
the
two
of
us
though
sibling
grow
up
separately
almost
a
generation
apart
thus
to
all
intent
and
purpose
i
have
the
run
of
the
house
when
i
be
a
kid
my
father
be
quiet
and
gentle
an
avid
reader
who
be
addict
to
crossword
puzzle
he
would
attend
augsburg
college
in
minneapolis
for
a
couple
of
year
and
during
most
of
my
childhood
he
work
as
a
clerk
for
a
farm
implement
supply
company
my
mother
who
attend
business
school
after
high
school
be
proficient
in
math
and
serve
as
our
church
secretary
she
also
taught
sunday
school
and
played
the
church
organ
at
one
time
it
be
my
mother
who
be
always
encourage
my
scientific
interest
and
who
pretty
much
give
me
the
green
light
to
do
what
i
want
in
and
outside
the
house
in
retrospect
and
as
a
parent
myself
i
have
to
believe
the
freedom
she
allow
me
be
remarkable
maybe
she
enjoy
my
enthusiasm
as
much
as
i
do
those
firecracker
on
the
fourth
of
july
for
instance
i
use
to
wire
them
up
and
set
them
off
electrically
from
a
perch
in
an
attic
window
i
also
built
a
telephone
system
that
stretch
across
the
street
to
a
friend
house
we
would
scavenge
the
wire
we
need
from
a
blasting
operation
at
a
nearby
sand
pit
and
borrow
the
earphone
from
grandma
eva
mother
be
skeptical
about
that
last
project
at
least
at
first
she
do
not
believe
our
private
phone
system
work
until
the
day
she
try
it
herself
and
be
surprised
to
be
able
to
chat
with
my
friend
mom
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
nothing
seem
to
alarm
my
mother
though
it
be
possible
i
suppose
that
she
may
not
have
know
about
everything
i
do
my
pal
and
i
like
to
play
with
blasting
cap
for
instance
detonate
the
dud
we
would
found
at
the
sand
pit
by
put
them
on
the
streetcar
track
those
cap
would
go
off
with
a
tremendous
bang
and
actually
lift
the
passing
streetcar
off
the
track
a
little
bit
we
like
to
hang
out
in
a
clubhouse
we
would
built
under
a
nearby
railroad
bridge
and
would
hop
the
train
go
slowly
uphill
near
columbia
park
and
ride
them
out
to
lake
johanna
where
we
would
go
swim
on
summer
afternoon
we
industriously
dug
tunnel
too
some
of
them
very
elaborate
with
several
room
we
would
crawl
into
those
tunnel
in
the
even
cook
potato
tell
each
other
ghost
story
and
have
a
high
old
time
until
our
parent
decide
that
such
subterranean
adventure
be
too
perilous
even
for
us
though
i
do
not
have
a
sibling
at
the
time
i
have
a
wonderful
group
of
close
friend
in
the
neighborhood
include
harry
zook
who
eventually
married
my
cousin
norma
haversack
and
who
still
life
in
columbia
height
and
my
erstwhile
telephone
correspondent
across
the
street
joe
colianni
look
back
to
those
sweet
day
with
my
pal
i
sometimes
wonder
if
today
kid
with
their
cable
television
and
electronic
game
have
even
half
as
much
fun
as
we
do
frankly
i
doubt
it
i
do
not
recall
either
one
of
my
parent
ever
nudge
me
toward
one
particular
career
path
or
another
they
be
always
emphatic
however
about
the
value
of
a
good
education
for
me
and
later
on
my
sister
and
while
they
would
never
have
the
money
to
buy
their
kid
college
education
they
always
kept
us
supply
with
the
kind
of
toy
and
material
that
be
helpful
to
our
development
the
so
call
educational
toy
i
remember
best
include
an
electric
eye
kit
a
chemistry
set
a
microscope
several
erector
set
electric
train
and
lincoln
log
to
me
those
plaything
be
pure
excitement
and
fun
i
do
not
realize
until
later
how
important
they
be
in
provide
me
with
a
hand
on
appreciation
of
electronics
chemistry
biology
physic
and
engineering
to
supplement
the
store
bought
toy
mother
use
to
scour
the
neighborhood
for
the
raw
material
i
need
for
my
electrical
and
radio
building
hobby
she
do
not
have
much
money
to
spend
so
she
would
go
into
hardware
store
and
radio
shop
seek
use
and
cast
off
part
that
meant
copper
wire
vacuum
tube
switch
dial
knob
you
name
it
she
be
always
bring
that
stuff
home
i
do
not
believe
she
have
any
long
term
objective
in
mind
for
me
i
think
that
most
of
all
she
just
want
me
to
have
what
she
knew
would
make
me
happy
whatever
else
i
fiddle
around
with
in
those
day
my
abide
interest
be
electricity
in
my
beloved
basement
workshop
i
fuss
with
electrical
connection
for
all
kind
of
device
experiment
with
battery
and
early
on
entertain
myself
by
assemble
simple
device
like
electrically
activate
bell
and
buzzer
eventually
i
move
on
to
more
complicate
product
the
most
notorious
of
those
be
a
couple
of
robot
built
with
erector
set
part
and
stray
piece
of
plywood
one
of
those
robot
be
a
fairly
elaborate
five
foot
tall
construction
that
blink
its
eye
talk
via
a
remote
control
speaker
and
puffed
on
hand
roll
cigarette
for
its
lung
i
use
a
hot
water
bottle
which
the
tobacco
smoke
rot
out
from
the
inside
and
thereby
furnish
me
another
important
lesson
for
life
stay
away
from
cigarette
as
a
gag
one
halloween
i
have
that
robot
brandish
a
knife
well
a
blinking
talk
cigarette
puff
robot
be
one
thing
a
knife
wield
monster
be
another
the
latter
scar
the
wit
out
of
a
neighbor
boy
who
claimed
he
be
attack
by
the
thing
and
i
be
order
by
my
parent
to
destroy
it
there
be
after
all
a
limit
to
what
even
the
bakkens
would
put
up
with
in
junior
high
and
high
school
i
be
forever
draw
plan
for
radio
and
rocket
ship
and
futuristic
house
with
all
the
electrical
wiring
in
place
echo
of
grandfather
bakken
sketch
for
the
device
and
construction
he
played
with
in
his
mind
i
have
a
lot
of
good
nurture
instructor
and
be
especially
encourage
by
a
pair
of
science
teacher
at
columbia
height
high
school
the
brother
rodney
and
russell
sahlstrom
rodney
sahlstrom
assure
me
that
it
be
perfectly
all
right
to
be
what
kid
today
call
a
nerd
and
that
a
fellow
do
not
have
to
hang
out
in
pool
hall
to
have
a
good
time
that
be
good
news
because
i
be
the
nerd
who
take
care
of
the
public
address
system
movie
projector
and
other
electrical
equipment
at
school
my
one
athletic
interest
be
run
track
for
which
i
earn
a
varsity
letter
when
i
be
not
run
i
travel
with
our
football
and
basketball
team
to
help
operate
the
electric
scoreboard
and
loudspeaker
equipment
i
be
always
near
but
not
quite
at
the
top
of
my
high
school
class
my
strength
not
surprisingly
lay
in
math
and
science
not
in
english
and
history
science
be
of
course
my
passion
and
i
enjoy
a
little
celebrity
status
as
the
kid
who
would
sometimes
get
the
teacher
out
of
a
jam
when
a
teacher
be
have
trouble
with
this
or
that
device
or
experiment
my
classmate
would
chant
let
earl
do
it
let
earl
do
it
and
red
face
but
secretly
tickle
by
the
attention
i
would
get
up
and
do
my
best
to
straighten
out
the
situation
i
be
not
try
to
show
off
but
i
do
love
solve
problem
that
have
stump
the
expert
in
the
meantime
i
just
about
memorize
every
book
the
school
library
carry
on
subject
relate
to
physic
biology
and
chemistry
on
one
particularly
memorable
occasion
monday
december
th
i
modify
a
radio
and
connect
it
to
the
pa
system
so
the
principal
could
broadcast
to
the
entire
school
president
roosevelt
request
for
a
congressional
declaration
of
war
against
japan
i
always
like
to
read
when
i
be
little
i
devour
all
the
big
little
book
and
comic
i
could
get
my
hand
on
a
little
later
i
pore
over
my
popular
mechanic
and
popular
science
magazine
but
as
voraciously
as
i
read
and
as
excellent
as
my
formal
instruction
prove
to
be
i
believe
that
many
of
the
most
important
lesson
i
learn
be
self
taught
that
go
back
of
course
to
the
hand
on
education
i
would
receive
play
with
those
photo
electric
kit
and
erector
set
and
fabricate
those
homemade
telephone
system
and
robot
at
some
point
i
ca
not
tell
you
exactly
when
i
realize
i
have
an
inventive
capability
though
i
would
not
have
thought
to
call
it
that
at
the
time
i
remember
for
example
mess
around
with
a
lawnmower
that
employ
a
rotate
blade
long
before
there
be
rotary
mower
on
the
market
i
also
developed
a
rudimentary
version
of
what
today
we
call
a
stun
gun
i
be
fascinate
by
the
way
mechanical
and
electrical
device
work
i
like
nothing
well
than
tear
apart
a
tool
or
device
or
piece
of
equipment
to
see
what
make
it
tick
then
reassemble
it
perhaps
with
a
little
addition
modification
or
improvement
one
of
the
happiest
memory
of
my
happy
childhood
be
come
home
alone
after
sunday
school
sneak
into
the
house
via
the
coal
cellar
while
my
parent
be
still
at
church
take
apart
our
new
floor
model
radio
and
then
painstakingly
put
it
back
together
before
my
folk
arrive
home
for
dinner
one
summer
while
i
be
in
high
school
i
be
hire
to
help
out
in
the
office
of
a
small
manufacturing
company
in
downtown
minneapolis
my
job
be
to
run
the
ditto
machine
but
what
really
intrigue
me
be
mechanical
calculator
call
a
comptometer
during
my
lunch
hour
i
taught
myself
how
to
operate
the
machine
and
by
the
end
of
the
summer
i
be
use
it
routinely
as
one
of
the
firm
billing
clerk
to
this
day
i
find
a
deep
almost
inexpressible
joy
in
the
sight
sound
feel
and
even
smell
of
those
old
radio
machine
and
electrical
equipment
there
be
a
magic
about
those
device
that
a
person
can
appreciate
only
when
he
know
them
inside
and
out
and
when
he
love
them
not
only
for
what
they
do
but
how
they
do
it
unfortunately
that
kind
of
hand
on
education
and
appreciation
do
not
seem
to
be
so
easy
to
come
by
anymore
and
i
fear
that
many
of
our
engineer
and
technician
be
bad
off
for
lack
it
so
much
work
today
be
perform
with
breathtaking
speed
and
precision
on
a
computer
yet
the
result
be
often
incomplete
and
unsatisfactory
because
our
engineer
never
get
the
sense
of
the
actual
object
they
be
design
on
a
screen
they
make
faulty
assumption
because
they
have
never
take
the
real
thing
apart
and
put
it
back
together
again
they
have
never
jiggled
it
in
their
hand
never
gotten
a
feel
for
its
density
and
heft
never
lift
it
to
their
nose
and
smell
it
what
a
pity
for
them
and
maybe
for
the
rest
of
us
as
well

if
as
i
look
back
on
my
childhood
so
many
year
later
there
be
a
single
define
moment
that
might
have
predict
the
career
that
follow
the
moment
occur
one
saturday
afternoon
in
the
early
s
i
be
eight
or
nine
year
old
and
a
regular
at
the
saturday
matinee
at
the
height
theater
on
central
avenue
in
columbia
height
where
my
pal
and
i
watch
all
the
terrific
movie
and
serial
of
the
time
my
favorite
be
those

the
imagination
of
several
generation
of
moviegoer
yet
what
intrigue
me
the
most
as
i
sat
through
the
movie
again
and
again
be
not
the
monster
rampage
but
the
creative
spark
of

the
power
of
his
wildly
flash
laboratory
apparatus
the
doctor
restore
life
to
the
unlive
at
those
saturday
movie
of
my
youth
i
also
saw
in
dramatic
operation
the
shipboard
radio
telegraphy
and
other
electrical
technology
i
have
until
then
only
read
about
in
book
and
magazine
but
it
be
the
restorative
energy
of
electricity
that
excite
and
eventually
inspire
me
many
year
would
pas
of
course
before
i
become
aware
of
the
use
of
electricity
electrical
device
and
even
electrically
charge
sea
creature
for
medical
purpose
and
that
the
understand
of
the
relationship
between
electricity
and
human
life
date
back
far
beyond
mary
shelley
th
century
tale
of
the
doctor
and
his
monster
at
least
to
roman
physician
of
antiquity
for
the
time
be
i
be
simply
awestruck
by
the
fact
that
electricity
properly
apply
could
do
a
great
deal
more
than
light
up
a
room
or
ring
a
doorbell
i
realize
that
electricity
defines
life
when
electricity
flow
we
be
alive
when
it
do
not
we
be
dead
several
year
later
when
i
be
confirm
our
pastor
dr
christofer
hagen
take
me
aside
for
a
one
on
one
conversation
like
most
of
the
people
who
knew
us
in
the
neighborhood
pastor
hagen
be
well
aware
of
my
passion
for
science
and
technology
on
that
occasion
by
way
of
prepare
me
for
life
as
a
confirm
member
of
the
church
he
explain
that
science
be
neither
good
nor
bad
in
itself
what
important
he
say
be
how
science
be
use
he
say
it
would
be
my
responsibility
if
i
pursue
a
scientific
career
to
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
humankind
and
not
for
destructive
purpose
as
much
as
i
have
concentrate
on
scientific
and
technological
matter
i
have
not
thought
about
science
in
moral
term
but
i
be
still
only
a
kid
in
my
early
teen
so
the
pastor
talk
while
make
me
think
do
not
impress
me
as
much
as
it
would
later
then
like
that
frankenstein
movie
of
my
childhood
his
word
would
go
a
long
way
toward
explain
the
direction
in
which
i
would
channel
my
effort
and
what
i
would
ultimately
want
to
do
with
my
life
f
o
u
r
medtronic
when
i
graduate
from
high
school
in
december
i
harbor
no
grand
plan
for
a
career
i
knew
i
want
to
work
with
electricity
and
ever
since
that
frankenstein
movie
i
be
particularly
intrigue
by
the
idea
of
somehow
combine
electricity
and
medicine
i
would
also
kept
in
mind
the
admonition
of
my
pastor
and
be
vaguely
intent
on
do
something
with
my
life
that
would
be
beneficial
to
others
i
be
not
what
you
would
call
an
outgo
guy
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
be
deeply
introvert
among
my
neighborhood
buddy
i
be
often
the
leader
of
our
apple
swipe
foray
and
tunnel
dig
adventure
but
in
the
wider
world
beyond
the
familiar
boundary
of
columbia
height
i
thought
i
would
be
perfectly
happy
lose
myself
in
a
laboratory
in
fact
my
dream
job
at
that
time
be
an
anonymous
research
position
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
minneapolis

which
be
then
as
it
be
today
one
of
the
premier
electrical

manufacturer
in

at
that
time

a
medical
division

have
broken
out
in
both
europe
and
the
pacific
by
that
time
however
and
i
decide
that
whatever
i
chose
to
do
about
a
career
would
have
to
be
put
temporarily
on
hold
because
of
my
interest
in
radio
communication
i
enlist
in
the
army

and
be
enrol
at
uncle

in
a
day
electrical
engineering
course
at

then
sent
to
basic

florida
from
there
i
be
ship
off
to
camp
murphy
near
west
palm
beach
and
eventually
wound
up
at
the
air
base
in
nearby
boca
raton
where
i
become
a
radar
instructor
all
told
i
spent
three
year
in
boca
raton
taught
airborne
radar
maintenance
rise
to
the
rank
of
staff
sergeant
and
discover
that
i
really
like
to
teach
at
the
end
of
the
war
i
return
to
minneapolis
and
with
the
help
of
the
g

bill
begin
work
toward
my
bachelor
of
science
degree
in

at
the
university

toward
a
master

a
bustling
excite
place
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
program
and
activity
to
engage
the
imagination
of
a
curious
young
person
it
still
be
during
my
spare
time
i
use
to
wander
across
washington
avenue
to
the
university
hospital
where
i
become
acquaint
with
some
of
the
people
in
their
extensive
lab
and
begin
provide
at
their
request
an
ad
hoc
on
the
spot
repair
service
for
malfunction
equipment
while
i
be
in
grad
school
i
married
a
bright
young
woman
name
connie
olson
who
have
be
in
my
class
back
at
columbia
height
high
connie
have
study
medical
technology
while
i
be
in
the
service
and
by
the
time
i
get
home
she
be
already
work
as
a
medical
technologist
at
northwestern
hospital
in
south
minneapolis
often
i
would
run
over
to
the
hospital
and
wait
for
her
to
finish
her
shift
while
i
wait
i
get
to
know
several
of
the
doctor
and
technical
personnel
there
know
that
i
be
study
electrical
engineering
they
would
sometimes
ask
me
if
i
would
take
a
look
at
this
or
that
piece
of
equipment
that
be
give
them
trouble
if
i
could
fix
the
equipment
i
would
it
be
a
win
win
situation
they
be
grateful
and
i
would
learn
something
about
the
machine
i
do
not
realize
it
at
the
time
but
i
have
stumble
onto
a
career
actually
i
would
already
have
a
couple
of
iron
in
the
fire
by
that
time
shortly
after
return
home
from
the
service
for
example
i
get
to
know
a
group
of
young
engineer
who
be
all
look
for
a
way
to
make
a
living
a
few
of
us
with
more
enthusiasm
than
either
capital
or
connection
start
a
phonograph
record
company
out
of
a
fellow
garage
on
selby
avenue
in
st
paul
call
our
fledgling
company
twinco
we
briefly
dare
dream
of
become
a
big
time
production
company
we
built
our
own
record
equipment
cut
some
master
and
press
a
few
record
we
even
have
our
own
artist
a
fellow
know
as
slim
jim
the
vagabond
kid
who
sang
norwegian
folk
song
on
local
radio
unfortunately
neither
twinco
nor
the
vagabond
kid
set
the
world
on
fire
before
long
twinco
have
abandon
record
production
and
be
instal
and
repair
car
radio
at
the
last
board
meeting
i
attend
the
group
have
decide
they
would
get
out
of
the
car
radio
business
and
get
into
the
manufacture
of
squirrel
trap
that
be
when
i
bail
out
and
that
be
about
the
last
i
heard
of
twinco
thankfully
there
be
other
less
press
and
more
reward
diversion
too
not
long
after
we
return
home
one
of
my
engineer
pal
ben
winich
introduce
me
to
some
friend
of
his
father
the
piccards
a
family
of
well
know
hot
air
balloonist
who
live
in
a
big
handsome
house
on
the
river
road
in
minneapolis
on
sunday
afternoon
the
piccards
open
their
home
to
a
fascinate
mix
of
academic
professional
and
other
thoughtful
people
for
fellowship
and
conversation
what
a
pleasure
those
sunday
afternoon
be
what
a
marvelous
opportunity
to
hear
intelligent
people
talk
brainstorm
and
go
off
in
all
different
philosophical
direction
for
a
young
man
brimming
with
idea
and
enthusiasm
of
his
own
the
new
peacetime
world
be
wide
open
and
nearly
everything
seem
possible

hospital
and
doctor
office
in
the
late
s
be
not
the
temple
of
technology
they
be
today
even
excellent
big
city
institution
like
the
university
and
northwestern
hospital
have
by
today
standard
limited
and
fairly
rudimentary
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
equipment
a
few
of
the
more
advanced
electrical
machine
employ
some
of
the
nascent
electronic
technology
developed
during
the
war
but
most
of
the
device
be
big
bulky
unwieldy
thing
that
still
rely
on
the
vacuum
tube
for
their
function
nevertheless
the
various
flame
photometer
colorimeter
electrocardiograph
machine
and
other
electrical
equipment
played
an
important
role
in
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
patient
and
thus
need
careful
attention
the
trouble
be
few
if
any
hospital
maintain
a
technical
staff
to
keep
their
electrical
equipment
hum
so
when
a
machine
broke
down
it
would
generally
be
haul
out
to
a
local
radio
shop
or
ship
back
to
its
manufacturer
for
service
there
be
to
my
knowledge
no
establish
business
in
the
twin
city
dedicate
to
medical
equipment
repair
one
night
in
my
brother
in
law
palmer
hermundslie
and
i
be
chat
at
a
family
birthday
party
palmer
be
a
kind
smart
engage
fellow
with
an
interest
background
and
an
eye
peel
for
business
opportunity
married
to
my
wife
sister
he
be
year
old
five
year
my
senior
like
me
he
would
grown
up
in
columbia
height
before
and
during
the
war
he
would
flown
training
mission
for
the
air
corp
and
he
still
love
to
fly
after
the
war
he
have
work
briefly
at
honeywell
and
be
now
help
run
a
lumberyard
at
the
party
that
night
our
conversation
get
around
to
my
occasional
repair
work
at
the
hospital
it
be
pretty
basic
electrical
stuff
i
told
palmer
but
there
do
not
seem
to
be
anyone
else
who
could
fix
those
machine
on
the
spot
sure
there
be
the
radio
shop
in
town
but
their
business
be
not
medical
equipment
and
shipping
a
machine
back
to
its
manufacturer
be
time
consume
and
expensive
and
the
machine
would
be
unavailable
for
week
if
not
longer
palmer
with
his
nose
for
business
be
intrigue
by
the
scent
of
a
fresh
opportunity
the
longer
i
talk
so
for
that
matter
be
i
pretty
soon
we
would
both
reach
the
same
conclusion
since
there
be
not
any
company
dedicate
to
medical
equipment
repair
maybe
there
be
an
opening
for
a
couple
of
bright
young
fellow
like
us
on
april
a
few
day
after
that
discussion
palmer
and
i
form
a
partnership
to
service
electrical
medical
equipment
we
call
the
company
medtronic
a
contraction
of
medical
and
electronic
that
seem
a
straightforward
representation
of
our
business
and
set
up
shop
in
a
garage
at
th
avenue
northeast
in
minneapolis
the
division
of
labor
seem
equally
logical
and
uncomplicated
palmer
be
the
businessman
he
would
run
the
office
and
manage
the
finance
i
be
the
technician
so
i
would
hold
down
the
shop
and
repair
the
equipment
in
retrospect
i
do
not
think
either
one
of
us
view
the
business
as
a
long
term
proposition
much
less
a
full
fledge
career
whatever
palmer
have
in
mind
regard
the
future
i
figure
i
would
be
complete
my
master
work
at
the
u
of
m
maybe
go
on
to
get
my
doctorate
then
either
teach
or
settle
down
at
that
quiet
research
bench
at
honeywell
i
would
already
have
plenty
of
job
offer
so
even
with
a
wife
and
plan
for
a
family
i
thought
i
could
take
a
chance
on
run
a
little
company
every
entrepreneur
i
be
sure
retains
at
least
a
few
vivid
memory
of
the
early
day
of
the
business
i
can
still
see
that
garage
where
we
initially
open
our
door
and
spent
our
first
year
the
original
structure
be
a
railroad
boxcar
that
have
be
modify
and
add
onto
by
palmer
family
who
have
use
it
for
rebuild
car
i
do
not
know
when
that
structure
be
built
before
i
would
come
around
anyway
when
we
take
it
over
it
be
about
the
size
of
a
three
stall
garage
the
one
stall
that
have
still
be
use
as
a
garage
we
designate
our
shipping
and
receive
area
though
it
have
be
insulate
the
little
building
be
very
cold
in
the
winter
on
the
coldest
day
we
would
huddle
around
an
oil
burning
stove
rub
our
hand
together
and
try
to
keep
warm
our
first
secretary
goldie
benson
have
to
keep
an
electric
heating
pad
between
her
foot
and
the
icy
cement
floor
in
the
summer
the
heat
be
suffocate
we
use
a
garden
hose
to
spray
water
on
the
roof
in
a
not
especially
successful
attempt
to
cool
the
place
down
a
few
degree
at
least
once
during
those
early
day
the
garage
be
infest
with
fly
ant
even
by
start
up
standard
the
place
be
pretty
crude
outside
it
look
like
what
it
be
a
jerrybuilt
boxcar
turn
garage
turn
repair
shop
inside
there
be
only
a
couple
of
homemade
desk
and
work
bench
and
a
jumble
of
the
kind
of
tool
wire
tube
dial
knob
and
so
forth
that
you
would
find
in
the
back
room
of
a
radio
shop
or
in
a
tinkerer
basement
on
the
positive
side
the
price
be
right
the
hermundslies
do
not
charge
the
company
rent
despite
the
low
overhead
medtronic
beginning
be
not
auspicious
our
first
month
in
business
we
gross
a
grand
total
of
eight
dollar
for
the
repair
of
a
centrifuge
we
have
no
sense
that
we
be
plant
the
seed
of
something
big
either
we
have
no
sense
for
that
matter
that
we
be
do
anything
remotely
significant
for
humankind
all
we
be
try
to
do
at
the
outset
be
scrape
up
enough
business
to
make
end
meet
to
earn
a
modest
living
it
be
a
desperate
struggle
from
the
start
thankfully
palmer
have
some
of
his
own
fund
to
work
with
and
connie
be
make
enough
money
at
her
medical
technician
job
to
keep
us
fed
and
clothed
most
of
medtronic
early
business
be
repair
work
for
local
hospital
and
doctor
office
though
we
be
not
so
highly
specialized
that
we
would
not
gladly
work
on
a
television
set
that
need
fix
almost
from
the
begin
we
be
do
some
custom
equipment
building
as
well
but
we
be
naive
not
sure
about
our
market
and
make
our
way
by
trial
and
error
palmer
have
some
business
experience
true
enough
but
medical
electronics
even
as
rudimentary
as
it
be
in
those
day
be
new
to
him
i
knew
most
of
the
equipment
and
many
of
the
people
who
use
it
but
i
do
not
know
anything
about
building
and
operating
a
business
everything
we
do
at
the
begin
and
indeed
for
the
next
several
year
we
lose
money
on
we
never
figure
out
how
to
charge
enough
to
make
a
profit
on
the
service
work
and
what
we
built
for
customer
would
always
end
up
cost
us
more
than
what
we
felt
we
could
fairly
charge
them
still
not
know
any
well
we
persist
we
even
begin
assemble
a
tiny
staff
when
the
volume
of
business
allow
palmer
do
most
of
the
hire
our
first
employee
be
a
young
electronics
technician
by
the
name
of
john
bravis
dale
blosburg
and
his
father
john
both
of
whom
we
would
know
at
church
be
other
early
hire
when
we
need
a
few
extra
hand
palmer
would
sometimes
round
up
a
couple
of
soul
from
the
local
ymca
although
those
fellow
usually
do
not
work
out
as
well
as
the
folk
we
knew
or
found
by
word
of
mouth
in
any
case
there
be
little
sense
of
team
building
in
those
day
from
their
point
of
view
i
doubt
if
any
of
those
original
employee
believe
they
be
signing
on
for
anything
more
than
a
very
short
term
job
in
to
supplement
our
exceedingly
modest
repair
and
equipment
building
activity
we
begin
sell
equipment
for
other
company
we
become

the
first

my
shyness
i
discover
i
like
sell
more
than
i
thought
i
would
i
especially
enjoy
connect
with
people
who
need
what
i
be
sell
to
help
do
their
job
and
felt
a
tremendous
sense
of
accomplishment
when
i
could
use
my
engineering
skill
to
tailor
a
piece
of
equipment
to
a
customer
particular
need
during
this
period

not
only
help
keep
us
in
business
albeit
only
by
a
whisker
it
also
give
us
an
entree
into
the
lab

office
of
the
doctor
nurse

whose
need
knowledge
and
encouragement
would
be
the
basis
for
medtronic
eventual
growth
and
success

although
we
do
not
fully
appreciate
its
significance
at
the
time
the
late
s
and
early
s
would
prove
to
be
the
dawn
of
a
pivotal
period
in
medical
history
with
the
advent
of
the
transistor
developed
in
the
middle
s
a
variety
of
plastic
and
other
new
synthetic
material
medical
technology
be
on
the
threshold
of
several
major
breakthrough
that
would
dramatically
transform
the
diagnosis
and
care
of
patient
around
the
world
most
of
the
new
electronic
equipment
come
into
the
field
during
the
early
s

monitoring
device
and
other
diagnostic
tool
ekg
blood
flow
machine
blood
gas
shaker
cell
counter
etc
there
be
still
very
little
electronic
technology
design
and
use
for
therapy
at
that
time
we
be
sell
a
lot
of
other
company
record
device
for
clinical
animal
lab
in
our
territory
but
eventually
little
by
little
we
be
also
get
into
hospital
surgical
suite
cardiologist
at
the
university
of
minnesota
and
other
local
heart
center
for
example
be
begin
to
do
some
heart
catheterization
in
the
course
of
their
pioneer
work
in
open
heart
surgery
after
we
would
sell
them
say
a
multi
channel
record
device
for
the
cath
lab
we
would
set
up
the
equipment
help
train
the
personnel
in
its
use
and
then
be
on
hand
to
troubleshoot
and
repair
it
when
necessary
we
be
without
really
give
it
a
great
deal
of
thought
at
the
time
forge
work
relationship
with
physician
and
their
staff
that
would
soon
have
historic
implication
it
would
be
fun
to
say
that
palmer
and
i
be
visionary
who
saw
the
brave
new
world
of
sophisticated
medical
technology
spread
out
in
front
of
us
in
truth
however
we
do
not
see
ourselves
on
the
cut
edge
of
anything
we
do
not
realize
how
excite
the
time
be
until
we
look
back
on
them
later
even
my
near
electrocution
while
assist
with
equipment
during
a
u
of
m
operation
do
not
seem
quite
so
harrow
until
view
retrospectively
still
in
our
corporate
toddlerhood
we
be
simply
struggle
to
remain
on
our
foot
and
grab
at
nearly
any
opportunity
that
come
along
at
our
makeshift
headquarters
in
northeast
minneapolis
we
be
add
a
technician
or
secretary
to
the
staff
when
we
could
afford
to
and
gradually
increase
our
work
space
we
expand
our
operation
into
a
second
two
stall
garage
on
the
hermundslie
property
and
then
connect
the
two
garage
add
a
much
need
furnace
and
toilet
to
the
structure
we
also
built
an
addition
to
the
first
garage
so
the
enlarge
facility
comprise
a
business
area
shop
and
even
a
little
draft
room
we
would
become
in
the
meantime
a
small
tightly
knit
family
of
six
or
seven
men
and
woman
who
like
our
work
even
if
we
be
not
overly
confident
about
its
future
and
who
like
each
other
personally
as
well
one
of
the
simple
pleasure
of
that
time
be
gathering
the
group
of
us
in
earl
hatten
draft
room
and
eat
our
brown
bag
lunch
while
listen
to
an
up
and
come
commentator
name
paul
harvey
on
the
radio
some
day
we
would
walk
over
to
the
elmwood
cafe
on
central
avenue
where
there
be
no
print
menu
and
nothing
fancy
in
the
way
of
either
decor
or
food
only
marvelous
home
style
cooking
that
feature
great
bread
and
pie
after
five
or
so
year
in
operation
medtronic
still
be
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
business
enterprise
but
it
be
something
and
when
we
be
not
fret
about
our
survival
we
realize
we
be
have
a
wonderful
time
f
i
v
e
the
birth
of
an
industry
i
suppose
you
could
characterize
the
s
at
medtronic
as
year
of
discovery
we
be
though
i
do
not
think
we
really
appreciate
or
could
have
articulate
it
at
the
time
a
company
in
search
of
a
mission
while
our
sale
activity
on
behalf
of
sanborn
and
other
original
equipment
manufacturer
pretty
much
kept
us
afloat
we
be
constantly
building
custom
device
at
the
request
of
our
grow
number
of
friend
and
acquaintance
within
the
upper
midwest
medical
profession
if
we
be
not
building
new
device
from
scratch
we
be
modify
exist
equipment
or
adapt
it
for
new
application
this
be
not
i
can
assure
you
part
of
a
formal
business
plan
of
any
kind
we
be
simply
look
for
new
business
new
way
to
bend
our
grow
technological
knowledge
and
professional
relationship
into
profitable
form
in
fact
it
be
an
admittedly
hit
and
miss
proposition
a
doctor
or
laboratory
technician
would
come
to
us
and
ask
us
to
build
say
an
esophageal
monitor
or
maybe
a
respirator
for
the
animal
lab
we
would
say
ok
and
we
would
build
it
sometimes
we
would
think
it
be
pretty
hot
stuff
and
hope
that
maybe
another
doctor
or
technician
might
want
one
like
it
unfortunately
in
most
case
only
the
original
customer
would
share
our
enthusiasm
for
the
product
there
would
be
no
other
buyer
as
a
result
we
never
make
more
than
a
half
dozen
or
so
copy
of
most
of
those
device
we
never
make
any
serious
money
on
that
early
custom
building
activity
either
rarely
even
recoup
the
cost
of
the
prototype
it
be
our
extreme
good
fortune
to
be
do
a
lot
of
our
repair
and
customize
work
for
the
medical
and
research
staff
at
the
university
of
minnesota
in
minneapolis
these
include
dr
c
walton
lillehei
and
his
team
of
young
surgeon
who
be
during
the
early
and
middle
s
make
significant
stride
in
the
promising
new
area
of
open
heart
surgery
lillehei
group
might
need
for
instance
a
customize
record
device
for
an
open
heart
procedure
we
would
provide
the
device
set
it
up
in
their
surgical
suite
train
the
doctor
in
its
use
then
troubleshoot
and
repair
it
if
and
when
a
repair
might
be
necessary
of
course
we
would
be
there
with
them
in
surgery
when
they
be
use
it
my
relationship
with
the
medical
and
research
personnel
at
the
university
go
back
as
i
explain
earlier
to
my
day
in
graduate
school
when
i
would
cross
the
street
and
visit
my
friend
at
the
hospital
during
medtronic
formative
year
i
become
a
more
or
less
regular
fixture
over
there
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
spent
so
much
time
in
the
office
surgery
suite
and
animal
lab
at
the
u
of
m
that
i
be
give
my
own
locker
i
get
to
know
people
both
personally
and
professionally
and
learn
as
much
as
i
could
about
their
work
the
anesthesiologist
bought
the
early
record
and
monitoring
equipment
and
they
introduce
me
to
the
surgeon
i
be
an
outsider
a
non
physician
in
their
highly
specialized
and
incredibly
demand
world
but
i
think
my
independence
be
a
quality
they
appreciate
if
they
have
a
problem
with
one
of
their
electrical
device
i
could
often
fix
it
immediately
free
them
from
the
hassle
and
delay
of
filing
a
request
and
push
it
through
the
institution
bureaucracy
furthermore
i
be
about
the
same
age
as
most
of
the
intern
and
resident
i
would
met
there
so
we
share
a
lot
of
life
experience
and
attitude
common
to
member
of
the
same
generation
later
on
as
it
happen
many
of
those
young
doctor
become
prominent
physician
and
head
of
surgery
at
hospital
around
the
world
thus
give
medtronic
far
flung
and
influential
contact
when
we
be
in
the
pacemaker
business
but
the
global
pace
business
be
still
in
the
unseeable
future
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
at
the

these
be
just
a
great
bunch
of
talented
men
and
woman
fun
love
friend
and
loyal
customer
who
would
call
on
medtronic
whenever
necessary
to
perform
a
little
surgery
on
their
equipment

in
any
case
it
certainly
never
hurt
an
entrepreneur
to
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
for
medtronic
the

the

during

today
we

as

they
be

in

only
since
they
could
only
go
as

as

lillehei
ask
me
to
see
if
medtronic
could
come
up
with
something
well

with

it
be
easy
to
look
back
on
that
assignment
and
label
it
the
crucial
turn
point
in
medtronic
short
history
at
the
time
though
it
be
simply
another
request
from
a
value
customer
it
be
more
urgent
than
most
sure
but
no
more
promising
from
a
business
point
of
view
than
the
myriad
device
we
would
be
building
or
modify
for
our
medical
customer
during
the
previous
eight
year
i
do
not
think
i
be
do
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
those
lofty
idealistic
notion
of
restore
life
through
electricity
spark
by
the
frankenstein
movie
of
my
childhood
do
not
enter
my
head
i
be
quite
certain
as
i
set
about
try
to
solve
dr
lillehei
problem
our
first
attempt
to
craft
a
more
reliable
and
portable
external
pacemaker
have
us
add
an
automobile
battery
with
an
inverter
to
convert
the
six
volt
to
to
run
the
ac
pacemaker
on
its
wheel
stand
that
however
seem
like
an
awfully
inefficient
way
to
do
the
job
since
we
need
only
a
volt
direct
current
pulse
to
stimulate
the
heart
transistor
which
be
then
begin
to
find
wide
application
in
electronics
seem
to
offer
a
well
solution
back
at
the
garage
i
dug
out
a
back
issue
of
popular
electronics
magazine
in
which
i
recall
see
a
circuit
for
an
electronic
transistorize
metronome
the
circuit
transmit
click
through
a
loudspeaker
the
rate
of
the
click
could
be
adjust
to
fit
the
music
i
simply
modify
that
circuit
and
place
it
without
the
loudspeaker
in
a
four
inch
square
inch
and
a
half
thick
metal
box
with
terminal
and
switch
on
the
outside
and
that
as
they
say
be
that
what
we
have
be
a
small
self
contain
transistorize
battery
power
pacemaker
that
could
be
taped
to
the
patient
chest
or
bed
free
of
any
cord
and
ac
connection
the
wire
that
carry
the
pulse
to
the
heart
could
be
pass
through
the
patient
chest
wall
when
pace
be
no
longer
need
the
wire
could
be
carefully
withdrawn
without
have
to
re
open
the
chest
without
any
grandiose
expectation
for
the
device
i
be
moderately
optimistic
about
what
it
might
eventually
do
for
lillehei
patient
i
drove
the
device
over
to
the
university
animal
lab
where
it
could
be
test
on
a
dog
of
course
it
work
the
next
day
i
return
to
the
hospital
to
work
on
another
project
when
i
happen
to
walk
past
a
recovery
room
and
spot
one
of
lillehei
patient
i
must
have
do
a
double
take
when
i
glance
through
the
door
the
little
girl
be
wear
the
prototype
i
have
deliver
only
the
day
before
i
be
stun
i
quickly
tracked
down
lillehei
and
ask
him
what
be
go
on
in
his
typically
calm
measure
no
nonsense
fashion
he
explain
that
he
would
be
told
by
the
lab
the
pacemaker
work
and
he
do
not
want
to
waste
another
minute
without
it
he
say
he
would
not
allow
a
child
to
die
because
we
have
not
use
the
best
technology
available
so
it
be
that
after
only
four
week
of
experimentation
and
work
the
world
first
wearable
battery
power
transistorize
cardiac
pacemaker
saw
its
first
clinical
application
and
begin
save
life
nowadays
when
it
take
an
average
of
seven
year
for
a
new
medical
device
to
find
its
way
through
the
regulatory
labyrinth
in
the
united
state
four
week
seem
unbelievable
just
as
improbable
by
today
standard
be
the
idea
that
a
manufacturer
could
take
a
new
product
from
inception
to
operation
in
so
short
a
period
of
time
but
in
medical
device
have
not
yet
be
place
under
mandatory
review
by
the
u
s
food
and
drug
administration
so
there
be
no
regulatory
hoop
to
jump
through
at
that
point
in
our
development
moreover
medtronic
be
still
a
tiny
shop
with
scarcely
a
dozen
employee
and
no
bureaucracy
we
constantly
share
information
and
encouragement
but
waste
little
time
debate
whether
we
should
build
this
or
that
product
or
enter
such
and
such
a
business
line
we
be
struggle
to
survive
when
a
customer
ask
for
something
we
provide
it
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
only
then
hop
it
might
somehow
earn
us
a
few
buck
we
be
operating
not
by
design
but
by
necessity
accord
to
a
principle
that
have
since
be
popularize
by
the
statement
ready
fire
aim
we
get
the
order
built
the
product
and
only
after
rush
it
to
the
customer
debate
its
long
term
possibility
for
the
company
as
it
turn
out
of
course
that
battery
power
pacemaker
put
us
in
the
cardiac
pace
business
in
a
way
that
all
of
our
earlier
custom
product
have
not
put
us
in
other
business
that
be
in
large
part
due
to
the
response
we
receive
from
walt
lillehei
extensive
and
widely
read
writing
about
the
device
soon
the
general
press
picked
up
the
story
of
the
little
metal
box
that
kept
child
heart
beating
and
people
be
call
it
a
miracle
within
a
relatively
short
time
of
its
introduction
we
be
receive
order
from
all
over
the
country
from
other
country
as
well
that
do
not
mean
however
that
medtronic
be
all
at
once
a
dedicate
pacemaker
manufacturer
there
be
not
that
many
order
about
by
the
end
of
and
besides
because
this
be
truly
a
novel
product
design
for
use
in
an
area
of
medicine
only
then
begin
to
emerge
we
have
no
idea
of
the
size
of
the
market
pacemaker
for
the
time
be
at
least
would
be
merely
another
item
in
our
slowly
grow
yet
increasingly
diverse
product
line
by
the
late
s
that
line
include
ac
defibrillator
insulate
forceps
animal
respirator
cardiac
rate
monitor
blood
gas
shaker
physiologic
stimulators
a
bull
semen
impedance
meter
and
now
a
cardiac
pacemaker
we
be
as
an
organization
still
try
to
discover
who
we
might
be
when
we
grow
up
we
do
not
even
incorporate
the
company
until
the
year
we
built
that
first
pacemaker

we
do
not
for
that
matter
have
time
to
brood
on
our
eventual
identity
the
confluence
of
transistor
battery
material
and
cardiac
treatment
technology
that
help
make
our
first
pacemaker
a
reality
have
create
a
fast
move
stream
of
new
therapeutic
possibility
in
early
for
example
dr
samuel
hunter
of
st
joseph
hospital
in
st
paul
thought
that
our
battery

in
long
term
heart
block
hunter
and
a
medtronic
engineer
name
norman
roth
proceed
to
develop
a
new
type
of
bipolar
electrode
that
could
be
suture
to
the
patient
heart
and
more
effectively
concentrate
the

where
it
be

the

require
about
percent
less

the
hunter

in
a

in
the
spring
of
the
patient
live
another
seven
year
with
the
help
of
the
device
yet
as
promising
as
the
new
era
of
pace
therapy
seem
at
the
time
there
be
some
obvious
and
substantive
drawback
battery
life
of
the
external
pacemaker
be
only
about
a
month
so
the
power
source
have
to
be
replace
frequently
and
despite
its
relatively
small
size
the
unit
be
still
awkward
and
inconvenient
to
wear
and
make
such
everyday
task
as
dress
and
bathing
difficult
in
with
these
drawback
in
mind
we
begin
work
on
implantable
pace
device
we
be
not
the
only
one
indeed
the
interest
in
new
pace
technology
have
spread
around
the
world
and
doctor
and
engineer
in
several
country
be
all
work
on
prototype
historian
usually
credit
a
swedish
team
ake
senning
a
surgeon
and
rune
elmqvist
an
electrical
engineer
with
implant
the
world
first
internal
pacemaker
in
that
device
however
power
by
a
nickel
cadmium
rechargeable
battery
operate
for
only
three
hour
a
second
device
implant
in
the
same
patient
last
for
a
few
week
interestingly
enough
the
patient
arne
larsson
be
still
alive
today
have
have
more
than
different
pacemaker
during
the
past
year
meanwhile
in
buffalo
new
york
dr
william
chardack
and
wilson
greatbatch
an
engineer
begin
perform
animal
study
on
the
first
implantable
pacemaker
power
by
a
primary
battery
developed
in
the
united
state
in
early
chardack
his
associate
dr
andrew
gage
and
greatbatch
implant
their
device
in
a
human
patient
for
the
first
time
with
encourage
result
we
get
to
know
chardack
and
greatbatch
after
they
express
interest
in
the
hunter
roth
electrode
that
we
be
make
by
that
time
we
clearly
have
both
scientific
and
commercial
interest
in
common
so
we
decide
to
do
business
together
in
october
palmer
hermundslie
flew
to
buffalo
and
sign
a
license
agreement
to
use
their
name
and
patent
give
medtronic
the
exclusive
right
to
manufacture
and
market
the
chardack
greatbatch
implantable
pacemaker
in
exchange
for
percent
royalty
on
sale
by
the
end
of
the
year
as
we
begin
production
back
in
minneapolis
medtronic
have
order
for
the
new
device
at
apiece
our
formal
relationship
with
chardack
and
greatbatch
last
for
more
than
a
decade
my
fondness
and
admiration
for
the
two
men
bold
and
brilliant
biomedical
innovator
both
continue
to
this
day
my
special
affinity
for
wilson
greatbatch
owes
a
lot
no
doubt
to
the
fact
that
we
be
both
young
electrical
engineer
with
a
deep
and
abide
interest
in
medical
technology
during
those
seminal
time
both
of
us
have
immerse
ourselves
in
scientific
journal
since
we
be
kid
yet
we
both
be
less
interested
in
the
theoretical
aspect
of
electricity
than
its
practical
application
particularly
in
area
that
could
help
keep
people
alive
the
professional
and
eventually
personal
tie
between
us
like
the
tie
that
bound
walt
lillehei
and
his
staff
to
medtronic
would
typify
the
relationship
we
have
foster
over
the
year
i
truly
believe
that
those
personal
connection
have
be
at
least
as
important
to
our
success
as
our
product
to
my
eye
high
tech
have
always
depend
on
high
touch
to
be
effective
but
i
be
get
ahead
of
the
story
by
the
end
of
medtronic
have
become
by
virtue
of
those
budding
relationship
a
pioneer
on
the
new
frontier
of
implantable
medical
therapy
the
fortuitous
combination
of
technological
progress
clinical
experience
and
social
acceptance
that
be
unavailable
to
earlier
trailblazer
like
lidwell
and
hyman
have
create
an
unprecedented
opportunity
for
our
struggle
little
company
after
nearly
a
dozen
year
and
god
know
how
many
start
and
stop
we
be
finally
on
the
brink
of
discover
our
purpose
in
the
brave
new
world
of
medical
technology
my
parent
florence
and
osval
bakken
they
establish
the
value
set
the
example
and
provide
me
with
the
encouragement
to
explore
the
world
around
me
s
i
x
the
wide
world
of

by
the
end
of
the
end
of
our
first
full
decade
in

medtronic
have
become
a

the

developed
for

it

to
us

at
the
time
that
sense
of
development
and
contribution
be
reward
indeed
even
more
reward
when
we
pause
for
a
moment
to
reflect
on
the
matter

the

actually
help
physician
sustain
and
improve
people
life
which
be
my
vision
for
electricity
base

go
back
to
that
original
frankenstein
film
of
my
childhood
as
someone
say
of
that
point
in
our
development
medtronic
garage
era
be
over
that
be
literally
as
well
as
figuratively
true
in
we
would
make
plan
to
build
a
square
foot
office
lab
and
manufacturing
facility
at
old
highway
in
st
anthony
village
a
suburb
on
the
north
edge
of
minneapolis
not
far
from
our
original
site
and
the
small
apartment
we
would
rent
to
give
us
a
little
more
room
the
new
building
be
finance
through
the
sale
of
of
convertible
debenture
which
be
shortly
thereafter
convert
to
common
stock
and
be
ready
for
our
use
in
the
spring
of
at
its
grand
opening
in
may
the
contrast
between
our
humble
beginning
back
there
off
central
avenue
and
the
new
operation
seem
almost
comical
the
new
place
even
include
a
cafeteria
library
and
auditorium
a
far
cry
to
be
sure
from
the
cramped
work
space
and
homemade
desk
of
the
garage
at
the
same
time
it
seem
inconceivable
that
we
would
have
to
build
two
addition
comprise
square
foot
before
the
end
of
the
new
decade
though
that
be
exactly
what
we
end
up
do
to
develop
our
overseas
activity
during
that
period
we
contract

a
respect

for
about
the

would

those
long
full

be
wonderful
to
recall
though
like
many
event
in
our
life
they
probably
do
not
seem
so
wonderful
at
the
time
palmer
hermundslie
and
i
be
on
the

almost
constantly
or
so
it
seem
call
on
customer
and
work
the
trade
show
in
palmer
case
i
should
say
in
the
air
almost
constantly
palmer
you
will
recall
be
a
dedicate
and
fearless
pilot
fly
his
snappy
little
beechcraft

in

out

he

he
be
not

something
so
trifle

despite

maybe
because
of
my
service
with
the
army
air
corp
i
do
not
like
to
fly
prefer
to
drive
when
it
be
practical
or
to
take
the
train
when
it
do
not
make
sense
to
drive
in
those
day
of
course
medtronic
be
a
newcomer
on
the
national

international
medical

industry
trade
show
for
that
matter
be
not
the
elaborate
high
tech
multimedia
event
they
be
now
basically
they
be
three
or
four
day
marathon
during
which
you
spent
long
weary
hour
stand
in
a
cramped
wooden
booth
you
set
up
yourself
in
a
stuffy
corner
of
an
auditorium
press
the
flesh
memorize
name
and
specialty
and
explain
to
whomever
happen
by
who
you
be
and
what
your
product
could
do
for
their
patient
and
institution
palmer
or
i
would
usually
be
the
only
medtronic
representative
at
the
show
and
when
the
show
be
over
it
be
up
to
us
to
take
down
the
booth
and
pack
up
for
the
next
stop
my
early
aversion
to
air
travel
would
turn
out
to
be
not
the
least
of
the
irony
of
this
story
i
recently
calculate
that
i
have
spent
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
of
my
life
in
airplane
i
figure
i
have
pass
another
four
year
work
the
trade
show
circuit
what
make
that
activity
bearable
even
wonderful
in
hindsight
be
the
opportunity
travel
afford
us
to
meet
our
customer
face
to
face
and
learn
directly
from
them
what
they
need
and
want
from
medtronic
i
will
talk
more
in
chapter
eight
about
the
paramount
importance
of
the
customer
at
this
point
speak
about
this
stage
in
our
company
development
suffice
it
to
say
that
nothing
we
be
do
back
home
in
our
lab
and
manufacturing
space
be
more
important
than
the
relationship
we
be
establish
on
the
road
we
be
learn
that
the
key
to
success
by
whatever
mean
you
wish
to
measure
it
be
not
to
build
something
and
then
hope
someone
will

we
do
not
use
the
now
fashionable
expression
at
the
time
what
we
be
undergo
be
a
dramatic
transformation
of
our
corporate
culture
we
would
be
from
the
begin
a
tightly
knit
group
of
engineer
and
technician
plus
one
outstanding
salesman
who
operate
pretty
much
by
the
seat
of
the

innovation
and

have
be
more
important
than

oversight
and

bill
dietrich
and
the
other
newcomer
be
hard
nose
businessmen
they
do
not
understand
as
much
as
we
do
about
electrical
circuitry
or
the
physiology
of
the
heart
but
they
knew
what
make
a
business
tick
among
other
step
to
protect
their
investment
they
quickly
institute
control
to
keep
track
of
every
penny
come
in
and
go
out
of
the
company
and
even
instal
their
own
tough
mind
comptroller
to
monitor
the
day
to
day
spending
more
important
they
insist
that
we
finally
decide
just
what
kind
of
company
we
want
to
be
despite
our
pacemaker
breakthrough
we
be
still
all
too
willing
to
spend
precious
resource
on
other
often
unrelated
project
now
they
say
we
need
to
take
a
good
hard
look
not
only
at
the
worldwide
market
for
medical
technology
but
at
ourselves
when
we
do
the
latter
we
saw
a
company
of
about
hard
work
employee
half
of
those
employee
be
engineer
who
most
of
them
anyway
could
have
make
more
money
work
for
other
large
well
establish
company
in
the
twin
city
most
of
those
engineer
be
work
for
medtronic
because
they
believe
they
be
do
something
important
with
their
life
the
pacemaker
they
be
develop
and
building
be
help
make
sick
patient
well
it
do
not
take
us
long
then
to
decide
what
we
want
to
concentrate
on
as
a
company
we
would
dedicate
ourselves
to
the
development
manufacture
and
sale
of
device
that
restore
people
to
meaningful
life
we
would
focus
on
implantable
therapeutic
technology
as
oppose
to
diagnostic
or
other
laboratory
product
and
build
the
company
around
those
technology
our
write
mission
statement
which
dietrich
et
al
also
insist
on
would
reflect
that
decision
though
it
take
a
great
deal
of
time
and
discussion
to
agree
on
the
right
word
i
believe
that
the
statement
very
effectively
sum
up
what
medtronic
be
at
the
time
be
today
and
will
be
i
hope
and
trust
well
into
the
future
the
first
and
foremost
tenet
of
the
statement
the
complete
text
of
which
you
will
find
on

read
to
contribute
to
human
welfare

alleviate

health

abbreviate
version
of
that
statement
toward
man
full
life
be
adopt
a
few
year
later
and
inscribed
on
the
medallion
that
we

present
to
all

worldwide
since
our

us

never

to
build
cyborg

six
million

our
desire
from
the

codify
during

compel

have
to
do
during
the
middle

nothing
as

can
eliminate
the
pain
that
come
with
the
loss
of

he
be
in

in
the
past
few
year
he
would

gradually
lose
his
sight
in

with
the
accounting

function
of
the

he
also
played
an
essential
role
in
our
various
building
project
look
back
it
would
be
impossible
to
overestimate
palmer
contribution
to
the
medtronic
story
more
than
anyone
he
kept
the
operation
on
its
foot
in
those
early
year
when
we
be
living
hand
to
mouth
out

he
taught
us
all
the
importance
of
the
sale
that
a
business
could
not
only
build
product
it
have
to
sell
them
if
it
want
to
succeed
he
also
insist
that
we
build

operate
the
firm
in

with
the
high
ethical
standard
which
we
do
behind
the
scene
he
would
come
up
with
the
additional
cash
we
would
need
to
get
by
during
the
lean
time
though
he
frequently
put
his
own
money
into
the
business
he
be
particularly
effective
in
get
friend
and
acquaintance
to
invest
in
the
company
even
when
it
do
not
seem

a
very
sound
investment

it
turn
out

his
power
of
persuasion
transform
a
good
many
reluctant
investor
into
enthusiastic
millionaire
and
those
few
individual
he
do
not
manage
to
convince
would
later
wish
they
would
follow
his
advice
one
fellow

a

and
i

richer
in
every
sense
of
the

his

an
enormous

for

his

we

first
at
our
st

and
then
at

in
fridley
a
reminder
of
his
thoughtful
approach
to
both
business
and
life
i
personally
miss
his
companionship
and
counsel
to
this
day
as
for
my
private
life
at
the
time
i
can
only
reaffirm
what
many
other
business
people
have
make
achingly
clear
that
building
a
business
and
building
a
family
be
not
readily
compatible
activity
like
most
entrepreneur
and
chief
executive
of
grow
company
i
would
leave
for
the
office
early
in
the
morning
and
return
home
late
at
night
often
lug
a
briefcase
full
of
work
home
with
me
i
be
frequently
on
the
road
for
day
at
a
time
and
even
weekend
be
consume
by
company
matter
it
be
hard
on
my
family
our
two
daughter
and
two
son
from
old
to
young
wendy
jeff
brad
and
pam
have
grown
up
to
be
fine
upstanding
accomplish
individual
for
which
i
give
their
mother
connie
most
of
the
credit
but
my
focus
on
the
business
cost
us
irreplaceable
time
together
and
lead
to
connie
and
my
divorce
still
i
be
not
sure
i
could
have
do
it
any
other
way
unfortunately
i
do
not
think
there
be
any
alternative
when
start
and
building
a
business
than
to
give
it
everything
you
have
regardless
of
the
personal
sacrifice
and
disruption
to
the
family
if
you
be
not
prepared
for
sacrifice
and
disruption
then
you
would
be
well
advise
not
to
start
a
business
in
good
time
and
bad
i
should
add
i
be
sustain
by
my
faith
in
god
and
my
association
with
the
church
i
grow
up
in
back
in
my
old
columbia
height
neighborhood
despite
the
other
demand
on
my
time
i
always
try
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
first
lutheran
church
teach
sunday
school
and
serve
for
a
while
as
president
of
the
congregation
even
there
though
it
be
sometimes
a
challenge
to
stay
the
course
a
pastor
once
wonder
aloud
if
implant
electronic
device
in
human
body
in
god
temple
be
morally
defensible
i
reply
that
god
have
give
us
the
ability
to
develop
such
device
for
the
good
of
humankind
and
that
our
technology
be
help
restore
patient
life
surely
a
worthy
activity
in
anybody
even
god
eye
and
while
i
be
not
sure
i
convince
the
pastor
entirely
he
be
certainly
happy
with
the
financial
support
we
be
able
to
provide
the
church
because
of
medtronic
success
at
the
office
meanwhile
i
discover
that
i
miss
the
hand
on
activity
the
day
to
day
technical
work
the
engineering
that
brought
me
to
the
business
in
the
first
place
even
more
than
i
imagine
i
be
a
kid
you
will
remember
who
grow
up
monkey
with
radio
and
building
electrical
robot
now
as
ceo
of
a
global
corporation
i
have
by
necessity
abandon
the
lab
for
the
front
office
it
be
a
difficult
transition
and
it
do
not
happen
overnight
thankfully
i
be
able
to
make
it
more
or
less
in
fact
and
more
quickly
than
i
might
have
expect
i
learn
to
find
great
satisfaction
in
what
others
be
do
at
their
workbench
and
to
understand
that
what
many
of
them
have
accomplish
be
far
great
than
anything
i
could
have
do
myself
my
role
i
decide
be
to
encourage
our
engineer
in
their
activity
remind
them
of
our
corporate
mission
help
them
see
the
big
picture
and
make
sure
they
do
not
limit
their
imagination
or
stifle
their
creative
urge
in
later
year
i
begin
use
the
phrase
ready
fire
aim
to
help
them
break
the
bond
of
excessive
caution
and
cripple
self
restraint
when
attempt
to
develop
new
technology
to
go
with
their
hunch
no
matter
how
far
fetch
or
short
of
both
planning
and
proof
those
hunch
might
be
when
i
look
back
at
all
the
wonderful
product
that
have
come
out
of
our
lab
i
can
only
conclude
that
what
medtronic
be
able
to
encourage
from
its
engineer
and
technician
have
far
exceed
anything
i
could
have
achieve
on
my
own
and
all
thing
consider
that
have
give
me
great
satisfaction
than
i
ever
could
have
imagine

the
s
while
personally
challenge
be
corporately
the
year
when
medtronic
come
of
age
between
fiscal
and
sale
rise
from
to
almost
million
net
income
leap
from
nonexistent
to
a
million
dollar
during
the
same
period
our
little
family
meanwhile
grow
almost
tenfold
from
few
than
employee
to
nearly
the
growth
require
two
sizable
addition
to
the
st
anthony
facility
the
addition
include
a
state
of
the
art
clean
room
for
the
assembly
of
our
implantable
product
and
more
than
double
our
operating
space
to
well
serve
our
overseas
market
which
now
account
for
about
a
third
of
our
total
activity
we
open
our
first
international
facility
a
service
center
at
schiphol
airport
in
amsterdam
under
the
direction
of
an
able
young
man
by
the
name
of
ron
hagenson
in
we
have
plan
to
establish
our
first
international
office
in
tokyo
where
we
would
study
the
pacific
market
and
introduce
ourselves
and
our
product
to
japanese
doctor
then
we
decide
that
europe
be
likely
to
be
more
important
to
us
at
least
in
the
near
term
than
the
far
east
so
we
sent
ron
to
holland
instead
ron
dedication
and
versatility
i
might
add
have
stood
him
and
the
company
in
good
stead
as
he
eventually
become
my
right
hand
man
and
remains
today
though
in
semi
retirement
a
close
friend
and
advisor
on
a
variety
of
important
matter
to
keep
us
competitive
with
european
base
manufacturer
we
soon
built
our
first
overseas
manufacturing
plant
at
kerkrade
also
in
the
netherlands
production
at
the
new
dutch

begin
in
early
our
dutch
venture
also
brought
to
the
fore
a
very
capable
young
woman

tinie
haagsma
who
be
our
first
european
employee
like
ron
tinie
played
a
long
and
highly
value
role
with
the
company
eventually
come
to
the
united
state
and
serve
for
year
as
my
personal
secretary
the
follow
year
we
broke
ground
for
what
would
soon
be
our
administrative
research

manufacturing
center
in
the
northern
twin

fridley
though
we
be
still
manufacturing
and
sell
a
few
other
noncardiac
related
product
our
growth
be
really
fuel
by
the
expand
acceptance
of
the
implantable
pacemaker
several
improvement
have
be
make
in

since
we
begin
manufacturing
the
chardack

in
the
most
important
of
those
at

so

by
a

of

the
new

to
implant
a

without
a
thoracotomy
or
general
anesthesia
the
body
of
the

the

medtronic
introduce
its
chardack
endocardial
lead
system
to
an
enthusiastic
market
in
the
next
major
breakthrough
be
an

that
provide

when
natural

once
more
on
the
research
and
innovation
of
many
far
flung
physician
and
scientist
medtronic
release
its
first
demand
pacemaker
in
during
the
same
period
we
bought
all
patent
and
patent
application
relate
to
implantable
pacemaker
from
william
chardack
and
wilson
greatbatch
our
friend
and
collaborator
since
a
step
we
believe
put
us
in
charge
of
our
own
destiny
to
a
great
extent
than
ever
before
as
i
have
say
earlier
we
owe
a
great
debt
to
chardack
and
greatbatch
and
not
only
for
their
technical
achievement
in
pace
in
the
early
day
of
effective
pace
the
public
and
the
press
saw
us
as
white
knight
dramatic
story
about
the
very
visible
result
of
pace
on
patient
range
from
blue
baby
to
elderly
heart
block
sufferer
be
common
in
newspaper
and
magazine
during
the
late
s
and
early
s
sure
there
be
resistance
in
some
religious
quarter
where
it
be
felt
that
implant
a
manmade
device
in
another
human
be
come
too
close
to
play
god
but
such
opposition
be
become
rare
the
tough
nut
to
crack
ironically
be
the
medical
profession
itself
it
be
darn
tough
sell
the
implantable
pacemaker
to
doctor
early
on
doctor
in
fact
would
often
avoid
palmer
and
me
at
trade
show
and
other
gathering
what
we
do
not
grasp
right
away
be
that
it
take
a
doctor
to
sell
doctor
on
the
idea
of
implantable
pace
just
as
it
have
take
a
doctor
walt
lillehei
to
spread
the
good
news
about
the
wearable
external
pacemaker
a
few
year
earlier
so
our
best
sale
tool
when
we
first
begin
produce
the
implantable
device
be
the
talk
and
paper
dr
chardack
present
at
surgical
conference
around
the
world
slowly
but
surely
he
convince
his
fellow
physician
that
pace
be
an
effective
and
worthwhile
therapy
that
taught
us
that
the
best
way
to
promote
a
new
device
be
not
only
face
to
face
but
colleague
to
colleague
especially
when
the
outcome
be
so
dramatic
chardack
lead
the
way
even
then
however
pacemaker
sale
while
grow
steadily
be
a
long
way
from
the
level
we
enjoy
today
in
the
middle
s
a
pacemaker
typically
cost
between

which
be
a
lot
of
money
to
most
patient
in
those
day
many
individual
in
other
word
who
could
have
benefit
from
pace
simply
could
not
afford
it
indeed
it
be
not
uncommon
for
community
and
civic
organization
to
put
on
picnic
and
stage
other
fundraiser
to
help
buy
a
pacemaker
for
a
local
patient
the
real
breakthrough
as
far
as
u
s
pacemaker

be
concerned
follow
congressional
passage
of
medicare

the
federal

would
cover
the

because

along
with

ours

our

the
development
of

and
more
effective
attachment
to
the
heart
these
and
other
advance
during
the
previous
few
year
permit
us
to
offer
a
line
of
pace
system
that
be
significantly
longer
live
more
reliable
more
simply
and
effectively
implant
and
less
expensive
than
their
predecessor
of
only
a
few
year
earlier
and
though
our
pace
business
account
for
about
percent
of
our
total
sale
at
the
time
we
be
aggressively
research
and
develop
product
for
the
neurological
and
rehabilitative
market
as
well
these
include
a
dorsal
column
stimulator
transcutaneous
nerve
stimulator
and
a
handful
of
other
device
intend
to
help
relieve
pain
and
restore
normal
life
we
be
not
a
company
to
rest
on
our
laurel
not
only
be
the
market
constantly
change
grow
and
offering
fresh
opportunity
competition
both
in
the
united
state
and
abroad
be
fierce
our
customer
be
become
more
sophisticated
and
demand
and
government
regulation
be
become
a
significant
factor
even
more
to
the
point
however
be
the
desire
of
our
own
people
to
keep
extend
the
technological
boundary
within
which
we
work
one
of
our
lead
engineer
bob
wingrove
for
example
be
talk
and
write
about
a
year
pacemaker
long
before
there
be
such
a
thing
at
the
time
during
the
s
pacemaker
be
typically
two
or
three
year
but
bob
knew
we
could
do
well
through
the
use
of
microelectronics
to
reduce
the
current
drain
of
the
circuit
improve
electrode
that
would
require
less
current
to
stimulate
the
heart
and
the
potential
of
a
new
power
source
he
believe
a
year
pacemaker
be
not
only
possible
but
imminent
bob
be
right
and
he
not
only
lead
us
toward
that
longer
live
device
he
be
also
a
leader
in
the
dramatic
miniaturization
of
pacemaker
and
eventually
into
digital
pace
system
many
of
us
could
see
other
later
development
too
programmable
and
rate
responsive
pacemaker
for
instance
that
after
year
of
trial
and
error
research
and
experimentation
also
become
a
reality
when
i
think
about
those
year
so
full
of
both
problem
and
promise
i
recall
a
dinner
party
back
in
about
we
be
at
long
last
begin
to
make
a
little
money
and
could
see
some
hope
of
viability
in
the
pace
business
during
that
dinner
one
of
our
officer
ask
bill
chardack
what
product
he
thought
we
should
invest
in
next
that
be
what
product
would
be
in
effect
the
next
pacemaker
chardack
ponder
the
question
for
a
moment
then
say
there
will
never
be
another
pacemaker
invest
in
real
estate
that
prove
to
be
good
advice
at
least
for
the
gentleman
who
ask
the
question
he
do
invest
in
real
estate
profit
handsomely
and
retire
to
the
mountain
at
the
age
of
chardack
be
right
about
the
pacemaker
too
there
have
never
be
anything
quite
like
it
in
our
industry
nothing
that
be
achieve
the
clear
and
simple
black
and
white
mass
success
in
the
marketplace
that
the
pacemaker
have
enjoy
over
the
past
year
that
pace
system
be
still
at
the
heart
of
our
diversified
business
three
decade
later
that
our
state
of
the
art
pacemaker
be
restore
million
of
patient
around
the
world
to
normal
life
tell
me
that
those
of
us
who
stayed
the
course
at
medtronic
have
invest
wisely
too
s
e
v
e
n
state
of
the
art
in
the
spring
of
on
the
occasion
of
the
company
th
anniversary
i
be
ask
to
compare
today
medtronic
with
the
early
medtronic
what
do
the
two
of
them
have
in
common
on
the
face
of
it
i
could
have
say
the
two
medtronics
share
very
little
enter
our
fifth
decade
in
business
medtronic
be
reporting
sale
of
nearly
three
quarter
of
a
billion
dollar
employ
more
than
men
and
woman
around
the
world
and
market
its
product
in
country
besides
maintain
our
role
as
the
world
lead
producer
of
pace
technology
we
be
a
major
manufacturer
of
prosthetic
heart
valve
membrane
oxygenators
therapeutic
catheter
nerve
and
muscle
stimulation
device
drug
delivery
system
and
other
technology
that
drew
on
the
company
expertise
in
implantable
and
electrophysiologic
therapy
since
our
stock
have
be
trade
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
since
we
would
be
list
among
the
fortune
large
publicly
held
corporation
in
america
quite
a
leap
i
could
have
say
from
the
garage
era
when
palmer
hermundslie
and
i
and
a
handful
of
other
hearty
soul
be
sell
other
company
product
and
fix
broken
television
set
to
make
end
meet
what
i
say
however
be
that
i
do
not
think
the
old
and
new
medtronics
be
fundamentally
different
at
all
though
we
do
not
have
a
formal
mission
statement
in
the
early
day
we
do
try
to
operate
accord
to
certain
principle
we
want
to
do
right
by
our
customer
we
believe
in
the
importance
of
provide
the
high
quality
product
and
service
we
also
view
ourselves
as
a
team
a
family
i
recall
be
told
that
when
we
reach
employee
that
sense
of
family
would
vanish
it
do
not
happen
then
i
be
warn
that
when
we
grow
to
be
we
would
lose
the
family
feel
that
do
not
happen
either
now
in
with
over
full
time
employee
i
say
we
be
still
operating
as
a
team
and
that
the
sense
of
family
be
very
much
alive
and
well
among
medtronic
employee
around
the
world
happily
as
we
celebrate
our
th
anniversary
in
i
can
respond
to
that
question
in
pretty
much
the
same
term
even
with
the
subsequent
explosion
of
the
number
though
now
a
billion
corporation
with
more
than
employee
in
four
diversified
business
specialize
in
implantable
and
interventional
therapy
we
be
a
team
a
family
commit
to
our
historic
mission
to
do
right
by
our
customer
to
provide
unsurpassed
product
and
service
that
restore
patient
life
like
most
family
we
have
have
our
trouble
as
well
as
our
triumph
it
be
extraordinary
enough
for
a
technology
company
for
any
company
to
remain
independent
and
in
business
for
nearly
half
a
century
to
not
have
setback
and
disappointment
would
be
unthinkable
but
through
both
our
ups
and
our
down
i
be
convince
that
medtronic
have
prevail
because
we
have
believe
in
ourselves
work
together
for
the
great
good
that
be
express
in
our
mission
statement
i
be
pleased
i
can
say
the
same
thing
today
and
look
ahead
into
the
future

look
back
i
wonder
as
do
most
folk
at
a
certain
point
in
their
life
where
the
decade
go
how
they
could
fly
by
so
swiftly
i
see
old
familiar
face
walt
lillehei
gerry
simonson
sam
hunter
and
tom
holloran
among
them
and
marvel
that
so
many
important
event
feature
so
many
wonderful
people
could
so
quickly
fill
a
lifetime
if
the
s
be
our
garage
era
and
the
s
marked
our
passage
from
fledgling
local
enterprise
to
strive
global
corporation
the
s
saw
our
emergence
as
a
widespread
medical
technology
company
operating
in
a
brave
new
world
of
both
promise
and
peril
medicare
reimbursement
in
the
united
state
a
grow
acceptance
of
implantable
therapy
throughout
the
world
and
continue
breakthrough
in
science
and
technology
have
combine
to
create
unprecedented
opportunity
for
lead
edge
manufacturer
like
medtronic
and
indeed
a
brief
review
of
some
of
the
milestone
during
the
year
surround
our
th
anniversary
in
suggest
what
a
rich
period
it
be
the
milestone
include
the
establishment
of
our
micro
rel
subsidiary
to
produce
hybrid
electronic
circuit
for
our
implantable
device
the
opening
of
manufacturing
plant
in
puerto
rico
and
ontario
canada
and
a
research
center
in
massachusetts
the
begin
of
direct
operation
in
japan
the
production
of
long
last
lithium
battery
by
our
promeon
subsidiary
the
introduction
of
our
tin
pacemaker
lead
the
implantation
of
our
first
pisces
spinal
cord
stimulation
device
for
treat
chronic
pain
and
of
the
first
medtronic
hall
mechanical
heart
valve
the
incorporation
of
the
medtronic
foundation
to
promote
the
company
grow
philanthropic
activity
but
the
s
be
trouble
time
too
in
while
manufacturer
be
compete
to
develop
a
longer
last
pacemaker
four
member
of
the
medtronic
team
left
us
to
form
their
own
company
cardiac
pacemaker
inc
cpi
in
st
paul
and
begin
produce
pace
system
use
the
new
longer
live
lithium
battery
cpi
be
not
the
first
and
would
certainly
not
be
the
last
company
to
be
form
by
erstwhile
medtronic
personnel
a
recent
review
of
our
family
tree
identify
more
than
separate
company
found
by
former
medtronic
employee
and
there
may
well
be
more
but
come
when
it
do
and
involve
critical
battery
technology
cpi
creation
be
especially
significant
in
competitive
term
as
the
newer
company
quickly
grabbed
percent
of
the
market
it
be
also
in
a
more
personal
sense
a
considerable
shock
to
our
concept
of
family
more
traumatic
yet
be
the
problem
we
have
with
our
xytron
pacemaker
begin
in
body
fluid
have
infiltrate
the
pulse
generator
in
a
small
number
of
the
unit
cause
the
device
to
short
out
despite
the
small
sample
the
problem
be
extensive
because
we
could
not
be
sure
which
unit
would
exhibit
the
problem
thus
every
one
of
our
physician
customer
and
every
one
of
our
xytron
patient
have
to
be
inform
there
be
no
evidence
that
anyone
die
as
the
result
of
the
problem
still
the
episode
be
extremely
painful
both
to
the
company
and
to
us
as
individual
confidence
in
our
product
and
in
our
capability
as
a
manufacturer
be
shaken
our
share
of
the
worldwide
pace
market
which
have
be
up
to
about
percent
during
the
early
s
drop
like
a
rock
to
less
than
percent
by
as
for
me
i
find
it
difficult
to
this
day
to
express
my
disappointment
xytron
be
our
first
system
to
employ
integrate
miniature
circuit
we
would
test
it
extensively
though
obviously
not
long
enough
follow
the
failure
i
be
give
the
cold
shoulder
by
many
of
our
good
customer
i
be
kick
out
of
some
doctor
office
give
the
extreme
importance
i
would
always
place
on
close
personal
relationship
between
medtronic
and
the
medical
community
that
anger
and
disappointment
really
hurt
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
not
take
it
personally
but
you
learn
from
your
setback
and
failure
more
from
them
in
fact
than
from
your
success
we
brought
on
a
large
number
of
additional
material
scientist
to
make
sure
the
xytron
problem
do
not
happen
again
and
in
spite
of
the
loss
of
confidence
and
customer
we
forge
ahead
with
new
product
in
fact
the
xytron
issue
unfortunately
overshadow
some
of
the
important
advance
our
scientist
and
engineer
be
push
through
during
the
period
among
these
be
the
xyrel
system
our
first
rate
programmable
lithium
power
implantable
pacemaker
introduce
in
the
spectrax
sx
a
multiprogrammable
pacemaker
that
give
physician
the
ability
to
adjust
its
function
in
response
to
a
patient
change
requirement
without
additional
surgery
implant
for
the
first
time
the
follow
year
and
the
byrel
system
the
first
a
v
sequential
pacemaker
introduce
in
each
of
these
product
with
their
high
degree
of
effectiveness
and
reliability
would
contribute
to
the
restoration
of
our
status
in
the
industry
as
well
as
to
our
temporarily
flag
sale
not
surprisingly
the
s
and
early
s
require
a
series
of
self
examination
and
adjustment
at
all
level
of
the
company
besides
the
competitive
loss
and
product
problem
our
effort
be
hamper
it
have
eventually
become
clear
by
our
old
tendency
to
try
to
do
too
much
with
our
available
resource
some
people
say
we
be
stray
too
far
from
what
we
do
best
and
that
our
movement
back
into
diagnostic
technology
for
example
have
distract
us
from
our
focus
on
therapy
hurt
our
product
development
effort
as
well
as
our
bottom
line
the
time
as
well
as
the
situation
seem
to
demand
change
at
the
top
tom
holloran
who
succeed
me
as
president
in
turn
the
job
over
to
dale
olseth
another

of
the

be
in

succeed
by
winston
wallin
yet
another
board
member
in
chairman
of
the

for
much
of
that
time
i
be
also
responsible
for
the

research
activity
and
various
administrative
function
i
could
see
that
even
with
our
mission
statement
in
place
we
simply
be
not

with
as
tight
a

as
we
should
have

inclined
to
jump
at
new
opportunity
so
long
as
they
seem
to
offer
some
chance
of

hence
the

disastrous

the
outstanding

achievement
of
the
second
half
of
the
th
century

i
have
be
continue
my
personal
transition
during
the
period
there
be
time
to
be
sure
when
i
would
have
welcome
that
tranquil
corner
of
the
isolated
lab
where
i
could
have
labor
over
my
schematic
and
circuit
board
untroubled
by
the
furor
outside
but
have
suddenly
or
so
it
seem
reach
my
middle
year
and
have
invest
more
than
half
of
those
year
with
my
one
and
only
business
i
be
reasonably
comfortable
in
my
leadership
role
that
comfort
have
not
come
easily
i
be
as
i
have
say
before
a
shy
fellow
by
nature
i
have
always
enjoy
lead
my
friend
in
play
and
later
my
colleague
on
the
job
but
paradoxically
i
suppose
i
do
not
like
to
call
attention
to
myself
or
be
at
the
center
of
a
large
crowd
but
serve
as
the
chief
executive
of
a
major
corporation
simply
require
that
i
overcome
my
inhibition
and
assume
my
position
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
the
help
of
my
family
and
my
staff
i
take
pain
to
look
and
sound
more
presidential
accompany
by
my
wife
connie
i
make
several
trip
to
liemandts
a
fashionable
men
wear
shop
in
downtown
minneapolis
and
exchange
my
flannel
shirt
for
three
piece
suit
i
also
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
work
on
my
public
speak
skill
i
have
be
out
deal
with
our
customer
on
a
one
to
one
basis
since
now
with
the
grow
interest
in
implantable
therapy
it
be
necessary
for
me
to
address
large
conference
room
full
of
doctor
nurse
and
administrator
in
other
word
there
be
more
than
my
personal
comfort
at
stake
the
success
of
our
business
depend
at
least
to
some
degree
on
my
ability
to
communicate
our
message
to
my
considerable
surprise
i
discover
that
i
enjoy
speak
in
public
i
found
myself
energize
by
the
opportunity
to
connect
with
big
group
of
influential
people
to
share
my
thought
and
idea
with
them
and
to
receive
their
feedback
work
by
myself
in
that
isolated
corner
of
the
lab
i
would
likely
have
to
wait
year
for
meaningful
response
to
my
idea
which
at
an
earlier
stage
of
my
life
would
have
be
all
right
with
me
as
a
young
engineer
the
thought
of
get
up
and
give
a
talk
or
try
to
motivate
others
be
the
farthest
thing
from
my
mind
now
after
several
year
of
do
just
that
i
find
it
a
tremendous
thrill
as
well
as
a
challenge
to
my
leadership
and
communication
skill
not
long
ago
i
be
ask
to
give
the
commencement
address
to
graduate
engineering
student
at
my
alma
mater
the
university
of
minnesota
what
in
the
world
i
wonder
be
i
go
to
tell
these
young
people
until
fairly
close
to
commencement
day
i
still
do
not
know
but
that
uncertainty
follow
by
the
development
of
a
series
of
speak
point
base
on
the
ready
fire
aim
theme
follow
by
the
speech
itself
be
excite
for
me
as
be
the
spirit
response
i
receive
from
so
many
of
those
bright
young
engineer
i
have
always
enjoy
travel
call
on
customer
and
show
the
corporate
flag
at
trade
show
my
prefer
conveyance
however
be
my
car
or
a
train
now
i
be
learn
to
enjoy
air
travel
of
course
i
have
little
choice
we
be
a
global
company
with
important
market
literally
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
so
flight
be
the
only
practical
mean
by
which
to
meet
and
get
to
know
our
distant
customer
and
employee
perhaps
the
most
unexpected
pleasure
of
my
personal
evolution
though
originate
with
an
idea
for
the
company
holiday
party
after
many
year
of
picnic
and
dinner
for
company
get
togethers
our
activity
committee
during
the
mid
s
suggest
a
holiday
dinner
and
dance
because
i
do
not
dance
i
do
not
think
much
of
the
idea
but
it
be
the
committee
decision
so
i
go
along
with
it
in
fact
in
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
connie
and
i
will
be
the
first
one
out
on
the
floor
it
be
one
of
those
half
bake
thing
you
say
sometimes
but
my
wife
if
no
one
else
take
it
seriously
she
sign
us
up
for
dance
instruction
and
over
the
next
several
week
i
learn
how
to
dance
i
should
say
for
accuracy
sake
i
learn
how
to
dance
well
enough
to
not
make
a
fool
of
myself
at
that
holiday
party
but
oddly
enough
by
then
i
be
hooked
on
ballroom
dance
connie
and
i
continued
to
take
lesson
and
really
become
serious
about
the
activity
my
commitment
to
corporate
morale
aside
i
personally
found
dance
appeal
because
it
be
a
very
complicate
endeavor
require
a
great
deal
of
study
and
practice
in
order
to
excel
there
be
a
certain
mechanical
component
in
learn
the
individual
step
as
well
as
a
definite
emotional
release
in
yield
to
the
feel
and
flow
of
the
music
it
be
a
wonderful
experience
i
have
never
have
any
association
with
music
at
all
now
i
be
learn
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
rhythm
of
the
waltz
the
rhumba
and
the
cha
cha
and
again
to
my
surprise
i
actually
become
fairly
proficient
at
ballroom
dance
after
about
a
year
of
lesson
and
steady
practice
connie
and
i
pass
our
bronze
level
test
then
progress
to
the
silver
and
gold
level
finally
even
teach
at
the
bronze
level
as
an
after
hour
activity
i
still
love
to
dance
i
have
never
be
a
fisherman
golfer
or
tennis
player
instead
i
dance
for
exercise
and
pleasure
but
while
it
be
simply
fun
now
it
be
for
many
year
a
very
welcome
diversion
from
the
intensity
and
pressure
of
the
job

those
pressure
do
not
ease
appreciably
either
as
we
work
our
way
into
the
s
we
have
fall
off
the
ambitious
pace
we
set
for
ourselves
a
decade
or
so
earlier
when
we
be
grow
at
a
steady
percent
annual
rate
when
we
be
at
about
a
couple
of
hundred
million
dollar
in
annual
sale
we
believe
we
would
crack
the
billion
dollar
mark
by
after
the
xytron
failure
and
the
flatten
growth
trajectory
that
follow
it
be
all
too
clear
that
we
would
need
a
few
more
year
to
reach
that
level
than
we
would
originally
thought
what
some
people
described
as
the
stagnation
of
our
business
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
result
meanwhile
in
a
loss
of
confidence
of
heart
among
member
of
the
medtronic
family
morale
in
some
part
of
the
company
be
uncharacteristically
low
those
be
try
time
it
be
true
but
i
be
always
positive
and
optimistic
i
believe
as
much
then
as
ever
in
our
historic
mission
i
knew
what
our
scientist
and
technician
and
salesperson
could
do
i
be
convince
that
if
our
company
could
build
product
that
really
help
people
that
could
extend
and
improve
the
quality
of
people
life
it
would
simply
be
a
matter
of
operating
the
business
side
right
that
would
allow
us
to
succeed
when
win
wallin
become
our
president
and
ceo
in
our
share
of
the
worldwide
pace
market
be
slip
again
many
of
our
product
be
not
perceive
to
be
markedly
superior
to
our
competition
and
our
attempt
to
expand
into
other
therapy
have
not
be
sufficient
to
make
us
more
than
a
basically
one

pacemaker
operation
win
have
not
come
out
of

his

in

grain

business
most
recently
as
chief
operating
officer
at

win

be
on
our
board
for
seven

when
he
take

be
a

learner

both
the

waste
no

knew
for

that
for
medtronic
to
regain
its
historic
leadership
of
the
pace
business
we
have
to
have
demonstrably
superior
product
it
be
no
longer
enough
to
say
medtronic
on
the
package
our
first
generation
of
activitrax
rate
responsive
pace
system
introduce
commercially
outside
the
united
state
in
and
launch
commercially
in
the
u
s
a
year
later
would
give
us
a
huge
boost
in
the
right
direction
but
a
continual
succession
of
small
more
efficient
pacemaker
would
have
to
follow
thus
medtronic
in
double
its
annual
investment
in
research
and
development
bring
it
up
to
nine
and
then
percent
of
net

the
idea
be
to
develop
new
technology
while
ensure
a
steady
stream
of
enhancement
within
exist
product
line
the
renew
emphasis
on
product
development
and
improvement
be
readily
apparent
by
the
time
our
th
anniversary

around
in
in
our
pace

the

neatly
represent
the
incremental
enhancement
of
an
exist

the
steroid
it

kept
the
threshold
level
low
enough
to
maintain

require
less
power

from
the

generator
and
thus
extend
the
work

of
the
entire

held
more
than
percent
of
the
unit
share
of
the
global
pace
market
which
be
then
estimate
to
comprise
about
unit
and
billion
in
revenue
through
the
introduction
of
new

like

we
believe
we
could
grow
at
a
faster

than
the
three

four
percent

of
the

equally
noteworthy

more

that
it

deeply
imbed
and

hope
permanent
part
of

nothing
i
can
say
about
medtronic
today
make
me
happier
or
more
optimistic
about
the
future
for
these
be
not
easy
time
in
which
to
do
business
and
they
be
not
go
to
get
easy
the
fast
rise
cost
of
health
care
and
the
phenomenal
growth
of
manage
care
plan
have
make
it
essential
for
medical
product
to
be
provably
cost
effective
we
operate
moreover
in
an
environment
of
seemingly
insatiable
litigiousness
and
regulatory
control
unimagined
when
palmer
and
i
start
the
company
unimagined
for
that
matter
even
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
in
we
move
that
first
battery
power
external
pacemaker
from

to
patient
in
four
week
today
owe
primarily
to
the
regulatory
hurdle
a
manufacturer
must
now
negotiate
in
the
united
state
more
than
seven
year
be
require
on
average
for
a
new
medical
technology
product
to
reach
the
market
small
wonder
that
u
s
company
include
medtronic
be
do
more
and
more
research
and
development
abroad
what
concern
me
from
a
technological
point
of
view
be
the
possibility
that
medtronic
will
become
too
cautious
and
move
too
slowly
to
get
therapy
to
the
people
who
need
them
i
worry
that
we
could
spend
so
much
time
and
effort
get
ready
and
then
aim
that
we
never
get
around
to
actually
fire
or
that
when
we
do
finally
fire
the
target
have
be
struck
by
somebody
else
or
have
move
out
of
our
range
if
we
be
to
stand
by
our
commitment
and
maintain
our
competitive
edge
in
this
fast
pace
world
we
must
ready
ourselves
and
fire
as
quickly
as
we
can
and
then
make
the
necessary
adjustment
i
be
utterly
convince
that
this
be
the
surest
recipe
for
meaningful
innovation
i
be
equally
convince
that
our
scientist
and
engineer
be
up
to
the
task
the
best
and
the
brightest
of
our
creative
innovative
people
be
annually
honor
in
their
own
right
by
nomination
and
admission
to
the
bakken
society
which
since
its
creation
in
have
cite
almost
men
and
woman
who
have
make
especially
important
contribution
to
the
company
scientific
and
technological
progress
there
be
be
a
lot
of
talk
in
recent
year
about
reinvent
corporation
to
meet
the
demand
of
the
change
global
marketplace
medtronic
for
its
part
can
certainly
grow
dramatically
even
double
its
size
within
the
next
few
year
by
do
what
it
be
do
so
well
right
now
capture
more
market
share
find
new
us
for
its
exist
technology
and
develop
or
acquire
new
product
within
its
business
meanwhile
reinvent
the
company
mean
take
a
good
look
at
how
we
have
evolve
over
the
past
year
and
determine
which
of
the
positive
component
of
that
growth
will
be
applicable
to
our
world
tomorrow
we
must
continue
to
stimulate
and
nurture
the
creative
power
of
our
plus
dedicate
employee
we
need
to
keep
streamline
our
infrastructure
to
allow
our
creativity
to
manifest
itself
in
new
process
product
and
service
we
have
to
move
fast
and
efficiently
and
not
let
cost
control
regulatory
agency
or
the
fear
of
lawsuit
slow
us
down
no
it
wo
not
be
easy
but
then
if
history
have
taught
us
anything
it
never
be
e
i
g
h
t
aspect
of
leadership
to
live
be
to
learn
someone
once
say
a
corollary
to
that
truism
might
be
to
found
and
run
a
business
be
to
learn
the
hard
way
over
the
past
half
century
i
have
learn
a
great
deal
about
both
business
and
life
through
my
close
and
abide
relationship
with
medtronic
and
the
medical
technology
industry
much
of
what
i
have
learn
have
come
the
hard
way
through
trial
and
error
via
setback
and
disappointment
at
least
as
much
as
from
success
but
that
be
the
way
the
hard
way
i
believe
we
learn
best
the
lesson
that
emerge
from
struggle
even
abject
failure
be
the
one
in
my
experience
that
tend
to
stick
upon
my
retirement
as
an
officer
of
medtronic
in
i
thought
long
and
hard
about
some
of
the
most
important
lesson
i
have
learn
through
the
good
time
and
bad
that
marked
the
company
first
year
the
conclusion
that
result
be
gather
in
a
small
collection
of
essay
we
call
reflection
on
leadership
somewhat
to
my
surprise
those
reflection
be
widely
read
pass
around
and
comment
on
both
within
the
medtronic
organization
and
in
wider
business
medical
and
academic
circle
outside
i
be
both
flatter
by
the
attention
and
hearten
that
my
experience
be
presumably
helpful
to
others
i
be
especially
pleased
that
many
young
people
some
of
them
fledgling
engineer
with
an
eye
on
start
their
own
technology
company
someday
seem
to
find
value
in
the
lesson
that
i
would
learn
what
i
write
then
spoke
of
and
to
the
medtronic
experience
in
particular
but
the
response
i
have
receive
suggest
that
the
lesson
might
be
universal
thus
with
the
hope
that
what
i
learn
will
be
as
useful
to
others
and
their
business
as
to
the
medtronic
family
for
which
they
be
originally
intend
i
offer
in
somewhat
abbreviate
form
a
few
of
those
reflection
right
here

nothing
be
more
important
to
any
company
than
its
customer
he
or
she
be
more
important
than
management
meeting
planning
session
or
anything
else
we
do
in
the
name
of
the
firm
our
customer
must
always
come
first
for
the
company
representative
in
the
field
customer
first
be
more
than
a
strategy
or
slogan
it
be
the
first
commandment
the
basic
law
by
which
they
conduct
their
professional
life
they
see
or
talk
with
the
customer
every
day
of
the
week
they
often
go
to
extraordinary
length
to
make
sure
the
customer
be
satisfied
medtronic
representative
have
be
know
to
drive
hundred
of
mile
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
deliver
a
pacemaker
to
a
physician
they
have
go
so
far
as
to
arrange
the
delivery
of
a
competitor
device
to
a
doctor
who
need
it
when
one
of
our
own
be
not
available
medtronic
field
representative
i
be
very
proud
to
say
have
demonstrate
time
and
again
that
they
will
meet
the
customer
need
regardless
of
the
cost
or
the
effort
the
same
might
be
say
of
the
company
engineer
its
support
staff
receptionist
and
other
employee
in
the
design
and
manufacture
of
medtronic
product
in
its
marketing
and
advertising
in
every
one
of
its
employee
diverse
activity
the
prevail
commandment
be
or
should
be
customer
first
every
customer
of
every
company
be
important
i
believe
however
that
the
customer
of
a
medical
technology
company
must
be
treat
with
special
care
they
tend
to
be
men
and
woman
of
great
intellect
and
education
their
technical
expertise
and
experience
be
often
stagger
as
be
their
responsibility
to
their
patient
whose
life
may
rest
quite
literally
in
their
capable
hand
their
time
be
precious
their
patience
sometimes
short
independent
and
proud
they
do
not
appreciate
be
abandon
slight
or
put
on
hold
i
believe
therefore
that
the
leader
of
a
medical
technology
company
must
always
be
responsive
to
those
customer
question
and
desire
we
must
always
take
the
time
to
meet
with
them
one
on
one
and
listen
to
their
thought
about
our
common
concern
medtronic
be
found
on
responsiveness
to
its
medical
customer
it
have
grown
and
prosper
because
it
have
respond
not
only
to
what
those
customer
need
but
also
to
what
they
want
medtronic
will
continue
to
grow
and
prosper
i
be
convince
as
long
as
it
listens
and
responds
i
have
always
be
intrigue
and
enlighten
by
what
i
hear
when
i
visit
one
of
our
customer
in
his
or
her
office
lab
or
operating
room
a
physician
may
be
quite
pleased
with
both
our
product
and
our
local
sale
representative
yet
harbor
some
negative
feeling
about
the
company
when
question
far
he
or
she
may
say
that
someone
back
in
the
twin
city
have
be
short
or
abrasive
on
a
billing
matter
or
have
not
respond
promptly
to
a
product
related
query
maybe
the
doctor
have
call
our
corporate
headquarters
wish
to
speak
to
a
particular
officer
but
be
told
that
officer
could
not
be
disturbed
such
be
not
the
kind
of
news
we
like
to
hear
from
customer
but
it
be
news
we
must
hear
nonetheless
in
those
setting
on
the
customer
turf
we
can
also
learn
what
interest
the
physician
both
as
a
professional
and
as
a
human
be
we
can
learn
what
the
physician
want
in
the
way
of
feature
in
addition
to
what
he
or
she
need
those
want
may
have
little
to
do
with
the
way
a
product
actually
function
but
they
may
make
the
doctor
effort
more
efficient
or
less
stressful
in
any
case
we
may
discover
that
if
we
do
not
furnish
what
that
physician
want
another
company
will
and
we
will
have
lose
a
customer
for
many
year
i
have
carry
a
pack
of
three
by
five
card
on
which
i
have
record
the
want
and
need
of
our
customer
i
have
also
use
the
card
to
record
more
personal
information
about
customer
family
hobby
special
interest
and
concern
the
information
from
those
card
be
eventually
file
in
my
computer
so
the
next
time
i
meet
with
a
customer
i
can
speak
on
a
personal
as
well
as
professional
level
the
file
also
provide
an
up
to
date
list
to
which
i
can
mail
both
professional
information
and
personal
greeting
a
couple
of
time
a
year
the
large
a
company
becomes
of
course
the
great
the
chance
that
its
customer
will
perceive
it
as
an
unresponsive
monolith
whose
leader
be
far
remove
from
their
clinical
concern
not
to
mention
their
more
personal
interest
that
perception
be
reinforce
when
the
customer
call
and
can
get
only
as
far
as
an
officer
voice
mail
the
customer
may
well
be
aware
of
the
company
high
tech
capability
yet
at
that
moment
wish
for
a
more
high
touch
response
a
company
leadership
every
bit
as
much
as
its
most
distant
field
representative
must
allow
themselves
to
touch
and
be
touch
by
their
customer
those
leader
must
personally
get
out
of
the
office
attend
convention
and
conference
make
call
with
their
sale
people
and
visit
their
customer
they
must
systematically
and
aggressively
seek
out
listen
to
and
respond
to
their
customer
feeling
about
product
personnel
and
procedure
when
a
company
leader
make
themselves
available
to
their
customer
they
set
a
powerful
example
for
everyone
who
work
there
they
be
say
with
their
action
as
well
as
their
word
that
at
their
company
the
customer
do
indeed
come
first

the
job
and
responsibility
that
make
up
a
large
corporation
be
many
and
diverse
each
of
us
be
a
specialist
with
specific
function
and
assignment
that
may
sometimes
seem
to
have
little
direct
connection
to
the
function
and
assignment
of
our
colleague
yet
in
even
the
large
organization
each
of
us
have
one
imperative
in
common
our
most
important
task
be
to
help
make
the
sale
the
sale
as
one
of
my
colleague
like
to
put
it
that
be
the
event
everything
else
we
do
be
either
preliminary
or
after
the
fact
nothing
really
happens
until
the
sale
be
make
the
company
have
nothing
to
show
for
the
brilliance
of
its
product
until
the
product
pass
into
the
customer
hand
only
then
do
the
company
earn
its
appropriate
reward
in
the
way
of
revenue
growth
and
the
satisfaction
of
mission
accomplish
only
then
do
it
receive
the
mean
by
which
to
continue
to
develop
and
market
new
product
when
a
company
be
start
out
there
be
no
doubt
about
the
importance
of
the
sale
everybody
know
the
product
the
demand
of
the
market
and
the
customer
everybody
know
that
livelihood
depend
on
bring
all
the
element
together
to
consummate
the
sale
everybody
eats
sleep
and
breathes
the
sale
they
have
to
when
they
be
small
or
they
simply
wo
not
survive
when
a
company
grows
large
and
more
compartmentalize
that
basic
rule
of
survival
be
easy
to
be
misplace
or
overlook
the
director
of
sale
be
not
about
to
forget
it
nor
be
any
of
the
sale
personnel
out
in
the
field
but
what
about
the
company
officer
with
their
various
managerial
responsibility
what
about
the
engineer
in
the
company
laboratory
or
the
communication
staff
secretary
security
personnel
and
receptionist
with
their
precise
job
description
what
do
they
have
to
do
with
make
the
sale
the
answer
of
course
be
everything
everyone
be
in
a
position
to
help
make
the
sale
by
virtue
of
a
pleasant
courteous
and
sensitive
manner
each
of
us
our
official
function
notwithstanding
can
leave
a
customer
with
a
positive
impression
of
the
company
and
help
ensure
a
continue
relationship
the
tone
of
our
correspondence
the
way
our
telephone
call
be
answer
the
friendliness
of
our
co
worker
the
appearance
of
our
facility
all
of
those
factor
and
more
contribute
to
the
intangible
yet
vital
impression
that
ultimately
result
in
a
sale
all
of
us
must
continually
ask
ourselves
how
can
i
do
my
job
so
that
it
help
achieve
the
sale
a
top
to
bottom
company
wide
sale
sensibility
must
be
part
of
an
organization
culture
just
as
it
be
when
the
organization
be
start
up
it
must
be
an
integral
part
of
a
company
mentality
like
an
ongoing
commitment
to
quality
new
employee
must
be
instill
with
this
sensibility
veteran
employee
regularly
remind
of
it
a
determination
to
contribute
to
the
sale
must
be
in
the
air
the
company
breathes
this
be
another
way
of
say
that
the
customer
come
first
no
matter
how
large
or
diverse
and
successful
our
company
becomes
we
must
keep
in
mind
the
company
absolute
dependence
on
the
person
who
purchase
our
product
no
matter
how
ingeniously
we
plan
regardless
of
how
energetically
we
develop
our
strategy
if
we
lose
that
customer
we
do
not
make
the
sale
and
if
we
do
not
make
the
sale
we
lose
our
hard
earn
place
in
the
sun

one
of
the
knottiest
problem
the
leadership
of
any
organization
can
face
be
the
noisy
disruptive
presence
of
a
brilliant
maverick
aloof
or
contentious
he
or
she
be
the
misfit
the
troublemaker
the
person
with
whom
nobody
it
seem
can
get
along
much
less
work
productively
if
that
person
be
only
cantankerous
or
uncooperative
leadership
could
simply
show
him
or
her
the
door
the
problem
arises
when
that
maverick
also
happens
to
be
a
significant
creative
force
maybe
even
a
genius
most
good
size
company
have
one
or
more
such
employee
dazzle
inventor
gift
scientist
or
scholar
who
can
see
farther
than
their
colleague
farther
for
that
matter
than
their
leader
these
gift
individual
be
impatient
with
their
slow
shorter
sight
co
worker
frustrate
with
their
work
procedure
and
enrage
by
the
limitation
impose
on
them
by
organizational
structure
and
budget
prone
to
criticize
and
demean
other
employee
and
often
eager
to
defy
their
boss
they
break
the
rule
with
madden
frequency
how
should
leader
deal
with
such
individual
the
obvious
solution
be
to
fire
them
or
to
freeze
them
out
when
they
open
their
mouth
do
not
listen
when
they
submit
idea
file
their
memo
in
a
drawer
deal
with
these
maverick
the
way
you
might
deal
with
unruly
child
when
they
throw
a
tantrum
smile
and
walk
away
pray
that
one
day
they
will
grow
up
and
either
become
congenial
member
of
the
corporate
family
or
move
out
i
do
not
think
though
that
this
be
the
proper
response
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
would
view
the
isolation
or
departure
of
talented
troublemaker
not
as
the
failure
of
the
troublemaker
themselves
but
as
a
failure
of
leadership
the
reason
be
simple
that
maverick
may
be
the
one
person
who
can
put
the
enterprise
ahead
of
the
competition
ahead
perhaps
by
light
year
abrasive
and
obnoxious
as
maverick
can
be
they
may
also
be
a
decade
or
more
ahead
of
their
time
they
may
be
think
in
revolutionary
term
they
may
have
their
eye
on
a
glow
light
in
the
murky
distance
that
for
the
time
be
only
they
can
see
much
of
medtronic
success
have
be
the
result
of
brilliant
maverick
we
can
look
back
for
instance
to
william
chardack
and
wilson
greatbatch
who
help
us
make
the
implantable
pacemaker
a
worldwide
success
bill
chardack
be
especially
difficult
for
our
engineer
to
work
with
disparage
nearly
all
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
as
incompetent
greatbatch
be
a
little
smoother
but
he
be
very
technologically
advanced
and
hard
to
get
close
to
on
a
personal
basis
both
be
very
determine
very
demand
very
goal
orient
individual
both
be
also
brilliant
and
difficult
as
it
often
be
we
do
our
best
to
follow
their
suggestion
and
advice
and
thanks
to
their
lead
we
effect
those
early
implantable
pace
breakthrough
there
have
be
many
maverick
at
medtronic
some
of
them
have
be
impossible
for
us
to
accommodate
and
sad
to
say
be
encourage
or
allow
to
go
their
separate
way
others
have
be
effectively
integrate
into
the
medtronic
family
where
they
have
be
highly
creative
albeit
prickly
contributor
in
demonstrate
both
patience
and
creativity
when
deal
with
the
latter
their
manager
have
also
demonstrate
considerable
leadership
skill
those
manager
first
of
all
have
establish
and
maintain
an
atmosphere
in
which
new
idea
can
be
easily
heard
and
properly
examine
some
have
employ
brainstorming
session
to
encourage
a
free
exchange
of
new
idea
some
have
set
up
special
award
system
in
which
fresh
concept
be
acknowledge
and
reward
our
well
manager
have
found
way
to
pay
attention
to
what
their
idea
people
be
say
in
a
word
they
listen
they
listen
even
when
the
listen
be
not
particularly
easy
or
pleasant
they
understand
as
they
listen
that
their
gift
maverick
do
not
always
communicate
in
a
direct
or
linear
manner
the
conversation
jump
and
dart
and
careen
about
the
subject
without
the
help
of
such
nicety
as
background
and
transition
in
some
case
the
communication
be
both
brilliant
and
unintelligible
and
it
be
the
job
of
the
manager
to
provide
for
the
essential
interpretation
or
translation
maverick
sometimes
demand
their
own
company
or
department
where
they
can
be
their
own
bos
and
do
their
own
thing
unfortunately
at
least
in
my
experience
they
be
rarely
effective
manager
they
have
a
tough
time
delegate
authority
and
ironically
enough
they
be
often
not
open
to
other
people
idea
besides
they
be
usually
not
orient
to
the
bottom
line
their
eye
be
scan
the
far
horizon
they
be
simply
too
farsighted
to
see
very
clearly
the
problem
immediately
at
hand
effective
leadership
neither
buries
brilliant
maverick
nor
let
them
venture
too
far
off
on
their
own
with
an
enormous
amount
of
imagination
and
patience
the
most
effective
leader
accommodate
their
ornery
thinker
and
give
them
the
attentive
ear
their
idea
deserve
the
challenge
to
leadership
be
great
but
so
too
be
the
potential
reward
indeed
as
we
at
medtronic
have
learn
very
well
the
reward
can
make
a
successful
company

it
seem
appropriate
when
talk
about
creativity
and
innovation
to
interrupt
myself
and
include
at
this
point
some
thought
i
jot
down
way
back
in
october
what
i
have
determine
to
do
on
medtronic
behalf
be
isolate
and
identify
what
i
label
the
characteristic
of
a
technological
winner
specifically
a
successful
medical
device
my
note
comprise
five
category
and
several
characteristic
as
well
as
a
series
of
question
to
ask
about
a
new
device
i
believe
those
note
and
question
be
as
pertinent
today
as
they
be
when
i
write

of

you
may
well
have
a
technological
winner
before
we
built
our
own
house
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
doris
and
i
love
to
stay
nearby
at
the
kona
village
resort
among
the
resort
many
glorious
attraction
in
my
eye
be
its
policy
and
procedure
or
rather
the
lack
of
same
in
fact
if
kona
village
have
an
official
policy
manual
at
all
i
suspect
it
be
an
awfully
slim
volume
the
few
policy
the
resort
do
maintain
seem
to
run
along
the
line
of
their
official
dress
code
for
dinner
no
coat
or
tie
my
feeling
toward
official
policy
have
hardly
be
a
secret
at
medtronic
there
be
of
course
significant
difference
between
an
island
resort
and
a
large
technology
company
yet
i
believe
that
on
the
issue
of
official
or
institutional
policy
and
procedure
the
large
company
can
learn
something
from
the
resort
example
which
can
be
sum
up
by
the
axiom
the
few
the
well
we
severely
limit
ourselves
both
as
a
company
and
as
individual
within
that
company
with
the
dead
weight
of
excessive
policy
red
tape
and
bureaucracy
by
any
name
those
policy
that
inhibit
our
flexibility
and
freedom
of
movement
also
tend
to
limit
our
personal
and
corporate
growth
they
stifle
our
creativity
in
research
and
development
interfere
with
our
quest
for
quality
and
innovation
in
production
and
work
against
our
most
imaginative
effort
in
marketing
and
sale
certainly
organization
of
all
kind
and
size
must
have
some
policy
and
operational
procedure
l
they
wander
off
into
anarchy
and
chaos
at
their
best
institutional
rule
provide
the
guideline
by
which
a
company
conduct
its
business
both
within
and
without
its
wall
procedurally
they
help
define
the
form
and
the
function
of
a
company
division
and
spare
worker
the
need
to
re
invent
the
wheel
for
every
new

however

and

that

they
adopt
new
policy
without
winnow
out
the
old
policy
gridlock
and
procedural
overkill
can
be
especially
prevalent
it
seem
to
me
in
large
long
establish
company
as
they
have
grown
and
diversified
over
the
decade
the
number
of
rule
and

have
increase
exponentially
until
their

manual

with
miscellany

no

small
wonder
that
young
small

be
often
able

they
be
generally

to

how

i
believe
that
the
customer
of
a
medical
technology
company
like
medtronic
require
special
consideration
in
this
regard
physician
have
so
many
frustration
in

that
they
be
just
not
willing
to
go
through
an
awful
lot
of
effort
to
deal
with
a
company
that
add
to
those
frustration
if
a
device
manufacturer
because
of
official
policy
or
procedure
give
physician
a
bad
time
on
a
credit
matter
or
provide
poor
service
with
a
product
they
be
simply
go
to
buy
from
someone
else
the
manufacturer
not
only

to
offer
them
the
most
innovative

on

the
company
also
have
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
to
do
business
the
company
can
do
that
by
cut
out
unnecessary

at
the

time
manufacturer
need
to
streamline

so
the

one
of
the

a

can
hear
be
the

at

never

we
have
right

force

however
we
tend
to
label

think
this

like

it
limit
the

therefore
perform

sense

be
talk
about

to
my
mind
be
an
out
of

narrow
term
one
that
connotes
excessive
control
and
bad
manipulation

on
the
other
hand
seem
a
fresher
more
contemporary
designation

imagination
openness

i
believe
we
ought
to
think
of
ourselves
as
leader
and
make
no
bone
about
the
label
we
need
to
think
in
leadership
term
always
ask
ourselves
not
merely
how
can
we
manage
well
but
how
can
we
be
a
more
effective

our
future
may
depend
on

after

so
year
in

not

a

can
be
as
difficult
a
proposition
as

folk
have
compare
retirement
to

death
in

the

that
robs
the
individual
of

sense

i
ca
not

i
have
not

a
twinge

the

though
as
we
all

the

be
not
necessarily
so
good
at
the
time
and
the

as
somebody
once
say
always
look
well
in

i
ca
not

either
that
i
have
not
miss
the

activity
and
camaraderie
of
a
grow
evolve
business
thankfully
however
i
have
be
able
to
maintain
close
touch
with
many
of
my
medtronic
colleague
and
collaborator
as
i
say
earlier
my
successor
at
company
headquarters
have
always
make
me
feel
welcome
and
have
encourage
my
ongoing
contact
with
employee
customer
apd
scientific
partner
around
the
world
i
be
extremely
grateful
for
that
opportunity
and
i
would
like
to
think
that
connection
have
be
almost
as
good
for
the
company
as
it
have
be
for
me
i
believe
though
that
the
real
key
to
happiness
and
contentment
after
retirement
be
have
developed
compelling
outside
interest
while
we
be
still
on
the
job
i
be
speak
now
of
more
than
hobby
more
than
golf
or
tennis
or
gardening
as
engage
and
satisfy
as
those
activity
might
be
i
be
speak
now
of
more
even
than
my
beloved
ballroom
dance
which
to
this
day
invigorates
and
relaxes
me
like
few
other
physical
challenge
in
my
experience
when
i
say
compelling
outside
interest
i
mean
subject
and
activity
that
challenge
the
intellect
encourage
us
to
broaden
our
perception
of
the
universe
and
provide
us
with
the
mean
to
act
on
our
knowledge
and
experience
for
the
benefit
of
humankind
i
be
fortunate
i
never
have
to
search
for
such
interest
i
believe
in
fact
i
be
born
surround
by
them
electricity
and
life
together
offer
seemingly
infinite
path
for
me
to
explore
i
have
be
explore
those
path
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
begin
with
the
porcelain
insulator
and
electrical
outlet
my
uncle
worried
about
grow
with
my
basement
lab
project
use
the
spare
part
my
mother
salvage
from
hardware
store
junk
bin
and
continue
through
my
career
help
develop
lead
edge
medical
technology
at
medtronic
true
all
of
those
path
eventually
conjoin
in
my
career
but
other
not
quite
so
visible
or
well
travel
path
have
lead
off
of
the
main
one
those
other
path
appear
at
various
stage
in
my
life
have
carry
me
to
my
other
albeit
usually
related
interest
and
those
interest
have
in
turn
absorbed
most
of
my
attention
and
energy
since
leave
medtronic

sometimes
what
have
interested
me
in
retirement
have
be
a
very
logical
extension
of
what
i
would
be
involve
in
at
medtronic
and
indeed
have
be
an
ongoing
company
wide
concern
minnesota

amalgam
of
medical
technology
company
and
related
organization
dubbed
medical
alley

for
instance
grow
out
of
the
interest
of
medtronic
and
a
handful
of
other
manufacturer
to
develop
and
promote
the
area
as
a
hotbed
of
medical
innovation
i
be
especially
interested
in
the
idea
and
become
one
of
its
early
champion
because
i
believe
that
technological
progress
depend
on
a
collegial
atmosphere
and
share
breakthrough
medtronic
support
medical
alley
to
this

but
because
most
of
the
major
issue
now
face
the
company
be
national
and
global
not
regional
in

the

not

quite
as
much
in

as
they
once
do
in
other

a
retirement
interest
have
be
the
somewhat
unanticipated
culmination
of
a
project
that
be
begin
while
i
be
at
medtronic
the
bakken
library
museum
be
an
obvious
example
like
many
if
not
most
of
the
good
thing
in
my
life
the
library
originate
without
a
plan
sometime
during
the
middle
s
local
kiwanis
club
and
other
organization
begin
ask
me
to
speak
on
the
topic
of
cardiac
pace
the
subject
be
new
and
unusual
at
that
time
and
because
it
held
great
promise
for
million
of
sufferer
of
what
be
then
a
largely
un
or
under
treat
condition
the
therapy
be
generate
a
lot
of
publicity
around
the
country
but
i
be
an
engineer
and
entrepreneur
not
a
theoretician
or
historian
and
realize
i
knew
little
about
the
history
of
heart
stimulation
and
treatment
thus
i
ask
an
energetic
young
man
name
dennis
stillings
for
help
dennis
whose
duty
include
the
tend
of
our
small
but
grow
company
archive
begin
research
the
pace
phenomenon
as
it
exist
before
medtronic
get
into
it
during
the
s
he
quickly
discover
the
pioneer
work
of
mark
lidwell
and
albert
hyman
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
and
from
as
far
back
as
the
th
century
remarkable
bit
and
piece
of
medical
lore
such
as
the
resuscitation
of
an
apparently
decease
patient
through
the
use
of
what
might
have
be
the
world
first
direct
current
defibrillator
i
be
fascinate
by
this
information
as
be
dennis
and
the
audience
with
whom
i
be
share
it
so
we
decide
to
expand
the
research
we
would
no
longer
be
confine
to
matter
of
the
heart
we
decide
but
would
seek
out
data
about
the
use
of
electricity
throughout
the
long
and
varied
history
of
medicine
again
we
be
surprised
and
delighted
by
what
be
out
there
search
through
library
and
use
book
store
prowl
around
estate
sale
and
flea
market
stillings
be
soon
come
back
with
dusty
book
forgotten
manuscript
and
all
kind
of
strange
artifact
evidence
most
of
it
of
a
preoccupation
with
electricity
and
health
electricity
and
life
that
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
ancient
roman
perhaps
even
far
after
several
month
of
such
discovery
dennis
bos
at
the
medtronic
library
come
to
me
and
say
she
be
go
to
have
to
let
the
young
man
go
because
all
he
seem
to
be
interested
in
be
historical
research
the
woman
have
a
point
of
course
so
i
take
dennis
into
my
cost
center
and
begin
pay
for
some
of
the
archaic
material
myself
freed
to
concentrate
on
his
historical
pursuit
dennis
quickly
fill
a
room
at
the
company
st
anthony
plant
with
old
book
and
instrument
then
occupy
a
full
floor
of
an
office
complex
in
nearby
brooklyn

by
that

his

have
once

in
the

that

turn
up
in
the
basement
of
an

in

specialized
in
the
unusual
combination
of

and
medical

among
our
important

we
learn
that
if
you
ask
an
antique
dealer
for
instance
about
medical
equipment
you
would
usually
draw
a

however
you
inquire
about

you
often
hit

it

either
before

none

certainly
not
on

a
scale
if
we
have
we
might
not
have
proceed
the
way
we
do
we
might
very
logically
and
responsibly
have
told
ourselves
careful
too
much
cost
too
much
distraction
and
who
will
ever
use
it
and
what
a
loss
that
would
have
be
to
us
all
in
still
other
instance
the
absorb
interest
have
be
more
personal
one
day
in
a
small
note
in
a
radio
collector
magazine
to
which
i
subscribed
happen
to
catch
my
attention
the
note
described
the
extensive
collection
of
an
amateur
ham
radio
operator
by
the
name
of
joe
pavek
who
would
be
pick
up
and
restore
radio
date
back
to
the
s
a
travel
salesman
by
trade
pavek
have
discover
the
vintage
set
in
various
state
of
repair
in
small
town
on
farm
in
sheriff
office
and
so
forth
go
back
several
decade
when
i
first
heard
about
it
pavek
collection
be
store
in
the
basement
of
a
minneapolis
hardware
store
where
accord
to
the
note
in
that
magazine
it
be
soon
to
be
sell
off
or
thrown
out
motivate
by
my
own
long
run
love
affair
with
radio
i
contact
the
minnesota
broadcaster
association
and
suggest
that
we
jointly
save
joe
pavek
treasure
the
association
like
the
idea
and
together
we
rescue
the
collection
promising
joe
that
we
would
maintain
it
pavek
have
since
pass
away
but
i
be
happy
to
say
that
his
radio
continue
to
sing
snap
pop
and
hum
indeed
the
pavek
museum
of
broadcasting
house
in
its
own
small
building
in
st
louis
park
another
minneapolis
suburb
now
comprises
more
than
a
thousand
different
radio
include
early
amateur
and
aircraft
equipment
built
before
the
museum
which
also
house
a
work
amateur
station
be
open
to
the
public
provide
educational
opportunity
for
young
people
and
school
in
conjunction
with
the
bakken
museum
and
be
the
meeting
place
of
several
antique
and
amateur
radio
club
though
i
be
no
longer
the
museum
chairman
i
be
still
honor
to
be
a
member
of
its
board
and
make
a
point
to
visit
whenever
i
be
in
town
then
there
be
the
odd
opportunity
afford
by
a
long
career
in
a
particular
field
of
endeavor
when
experience
expertise
and
curiosity
come
together
to
create
a
unique
and
unforgettable
adventure
such
be
my
participation
in
an
expedition
to
the
pacific
coast
of
baja
california
with
an
international
group
of
researcher
whose
mission
be
to
record
the
electrocardiogram
of
a
california
gray
whale
the
objective
be
to
learn
more
about
the
relationship
between
the
size
of
a
mammalian
heart
in
a
whale
that
heart
can
be
the
size
of
a
volkswagen
and
the
velocity
at
which
electrical
impulse
activate
certain
sector
of
the
heart
such
information
would
not
only
apply
to
whale
but
tell
us
more
about
the
heart
function
of
human
as
well
and
how
do
you
administer
an
ekg
to
a
creature
measure
between
and
foot
and
weigh
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
ton
very
carefully
to
borrow
the
punch
line
from
an
old
joke
actually
the
gray
whale
we
sought
be
both
friendly
and
curious
the
difficulty
for
our
group
prove
to
be
attach
to
the
creature
rough
parasite
infest
hide
the
transmitter
bearing
suction
cup
that
would
allow
us
to
track
electrical
impulse
from
the
heart
when
the
suction
cup
plan
fail
the
group
use
a
harmless
harpoon
like
device
manage
to
insert
the
electrode
with
a
stout
needle
which
give
us
at
least
an
abbreviate
ekg
reading
that
first
expedition
to
st
ignacio
bay
off
the
baja
coast
where
gray
whale
be
once
slaughter
wholesale
by
commercial
whaler
be
lead
by
professor
frits
meijler
of
the
netherlands
the
expedition
include
a
number
of
distinguish
scientist
researcher
and
dignitary
from
holland
mexico
and
the
united
state
include
prince
bernhard
of
the
netherlands
i
be
proud
to
say
that
the
medtronic
bakken
research
center
be
one
of
its
sponsor
and
though
the
data
result
be
small
we
be
more
successful
get
an
ekg
on
a
humpback
whale
on
a
similar
expedition
off
the
coast
of
newfoundland
two
year
later
i
could
not
help
but
marvel
at
both
the
breathtaking
reach
of
modern
science
and
the
extraordinary
capability
provide
by
contemporary
technology
i
be
also
hearten
by
the
reminder
that
all
living
thing
great
and
small
be
connect
to
one
another
and
that
the
lesson
learn
from
one
among
us
can
be
readily
apply
to
another

my
fascination
with
the
role
of
the
mind
in
the
heal
process
a
fascination
spark
several
year
ago
by
an
incipient
awareness
that
there
be
more
to
the
relationship
between
electricity
and
life
than
merely
flip
a
switch
lead
to
my
passionate
involvement
with
the
archaeus
project
see
chapter
and
the
society
which
i
help
form
and
in
which
i
remain
an
active
member
to
this
day
be
concerned
simply
put
with
the
correlation
between
what
we
think
and
how
we
feel
the
idea
of
a
correlation
between
mind
and
body
be
ancient
of
course
in
our
lifetime
the
concept
be
hugely
popularize
by
the
like
of
norman
vincent
peale
the
new
york
base
protestant
minister
whose
message
of
the
power
of
positive
think
reach
million
of
people
through
book
magazine
article
and
radio
and
television
broadcast
during
the
s
and
s
i
have
not
give
the
idea
any
more
than
passing
attention
until
i
notice
during
the
height
of
my
medtronic
activity
that
many
high
tech
product
seem
to
be
significantly
more
effective
when
prescribed
and
administer
by
certain
doctor
and
nurse
in
particular
those
professional
for
whom
device
and
medication
seem
to
work
best
would
create
in
their
patient
the
conviction
that
the
technology
be
indeed
go
to
make
them
feel
well
now
cardiac
pacemaker
generally
produce
very
definite
result
their
effectiveness
in
the
patient
be
easily
and
immediately
measurable
most
everything
else
from
drug
to
device
to
procedure
usually
require
more
subjective
evaluation
and
to
my
mind
seem
to
depend
more
heavily
on
physician
first
believe
in
them
and
then
be
able
to
transfer
that
belief
to
the
patient
to
me
the
reality
of
the
phenomenon
become
clearer
and
clearer
that
so
much
of
what
we
do
in
conventional
western
or
allopathic
medicine
depend
on
belief
or
more
specifically
on
turn
on
the
healer
within
us
this
be
not
to
be
sure
the
conventional
wisdom
within
our
western
scientific
and
medical
community
or
so
year
ago
the
efficacy
of
a
device
or
a
drug
depend
on
its
own
therapeutic
power
meaning
the
power
invest
in
it
by
its
developer
and
manufacturer
not
on
the
mind
and
or
spirit
of
its
administrator
and
recipient
the
effectiveness
of
that
device
or
drug
moreover
could
be
prove
only
by
double
blind
study
and
statistical
significance
anything
not
prove
effective
by
such
mean
must
be
a
placebo
among
the
scientist
and
doctor
with
whom
i
work
the
notion
of
a
linkage
between
mind
body
and
spirit
be
a
virtual
conversation
killer
i
would
bring
up
the
topic
over
dinner
with
a
half
dozen
physician
for
example
and
five
of
them
would
get
uneasy
look
on
their
face
and
try
to
find
a
way
to
change
the
subject
many
year
ago
i
give
a
speech
to
a
group
of
about
physician
at
a
professional
gathering
in
cleveland
they
assume
of
course
that
i
be
go
to
speak
to
them
about
pacemaker
instead
i
shock
them
by
talk
about
how
double
blind
study
and
statistical
significance
cause
great
harm
in
medicine
and
how
many
sound
approach
to
heal
those
technique
actually
destroyed
about
half
the
audience
walk
out
before
i
be
finish
but
i
be
not
alone
in
that
opinion
even
then
there
be
respectable
member
of
the
scientific
and
medical
community
who
be
share
such
thought
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
that
otherwise
disappoint
cleveland
speech
several
of
the
doctor
come
down
to
the
podium
and
say
they
agree
with
what
i
be
suggest
and
more
often
than
not
the
one
physician
who
do
not
try
to
scuttle
the
discussion
at
that
typical
dinner
party
i
just
mention
would
chime
in
with
something
like
oh
yes
and
let
me
tell
you
about
my
experience
with
aura
and
die
patient
back
home
in
the
twin
city
i
begin
to
get
together
with
a
group
of
other
deeply
concerned
individual
who
be
think
along
the
same
line
these
folk
include
otto
schmitt
head
of
the
biophysics
department
at
the

dr
karen
olness
who

at
the

and
a
handful
of
member
of
the
medtronic
family
who
be
intrigue
by
the
idea
of
a
holistic
approach
to
health
and
heal
we
begin
meeting
informally
at
my
home
in
fridley
dennis
stillings
eventually
join
us
and
begin
assemble
a
library
of
material
deal
with
the
role
of
the
mind
and
spirit
in
both
disease
and
health
just
as
we
discover
when
we
begin
probe
the
history
of
cardiac
pace
there
be
a
great
deal
more
than
we
ever
expect
several
like
mind
friend
and
i
found
the
archaeus
project
in
to
gather
and
publish
information
and
to
promote
public
discussion
on

there
be

on
the
patient
not
the
theory
hardware
or
procedure
as
the
year
have
pass
it
have
be
my
good
fortune
to
find
a
place
where
such
idea
be
not
only
compatible
with
local
tradition
but
where
the
idea
could
be
translate
into
actual
practice
archaeus
not
only
move
its
headquarters
to
hawaii
it
have
in
the
most
meaningful
way
set
up
shop
here
and
be
an
active
part
of
the
five
mountain
project

interest
be
not
quite
strong
enough
to
describe
my
attraction
and
attachment
to
the
state
of
hawaii
passion
be
a
more
appropriate
term
in
my
case
though
born
and
breed
in
minnesota
i
be
never
a
big
fan
of
its
long
harsh
winter
though
we
do
not
travel
much
as
a
family
i
could
imagine
what
an
easy
carefree
life
might
be
live
on
a
south
sea
island
where
the
sun
shone
warm
and
bright
all
year
round
and
where
the
water
be
well
always
water
station
in
florida
during
my
wartime
military
service
i
learn
first
hand
what
bright
sky
and
tepid
ocean
be
all
about
i
discover
that
i
do
not
miss
the
change
season
that
many
minnesotan
love
about
the
northland
that
indeed
i
much
prefer
a
year
round
summer
i
knew
way
back
then
even
as
i
return
to
the
twin
city
to
establish
a
home
and
start
my
career
that
eventually
i
want
to
settle
in
the
tropic
my
second
wife
doris
whom
i
married
in
be
similarly
inclined
doris
grow
up
in
hauge
north
dakota
where
her
father
have
be
the
postmaster
as
a
girl
hang
around
the
post
office
she
would
see
the
glossy
travel
magazine
with
invite
color
photo
of
exotic
tropical
location
surround
by
cold
and
snow
she
too
dream
of
living
in
such
a
balmy
spot
one
day
when
we
vacation
long
before
my
retirement
doris
and
i
be
lucky
enough
to
have
the
chance
to
visit
some
of
those
tropical
land
we
have
dream
about
on
those
trip
but
we
not
only
enjoy
ourselves
as
traveler
on
a
two
week
holiday
we
also
look
over
the
site
with
an
eye
on
possibly
living
there
over
the
year
we
visit
such
far
flung
locale
as
bora
bora
tahiti
bali
and
many
of
the
island
in
both
the
caribbean
and
mediterranean
sea
finally
we
take
a
good
look
at
hawaii
i
have
decide
year
earlier
that
our
dream
destination
would
be
situate
within
degree
of
the
equator
the
hawaiian
island
as
it
happen
lay
about
degree
off
the
earth
mid
line
but
that
turn
out
to
be
a
quibble
what
we
eventually
discover
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
be
the
paradise
for
which
we
would
be
search
i
spoke
briefly
in
chapter
eight
about
kona
village
where
we
settle
in
to
learn
more
about
the
land
and
its
people
the
resort
make
up
of
more
than
a
hundred
thatch
roof
hut
overlook
the
bay
on
the
northwest
coast
of
the
big
island
be
a
little
piece
of
heaven
the
resort
itself
be
a
model
of
informal
charm
and
almost
inimitable
tranquility
not
only
as
i
say
earlier
be
there
no
rigid
do
and
do
nots
there
be
much
to
our
delight
no
telephone
television
or
lock
on
the
door
the
location
itself
be
everything
we
have
dream
about
even
more
we
be
quickly
captivate
by
the
spectacular
natural
beauty
of
the
place
and
the
genuine
warmth
and
goodness
of
the
people
the
weather
need
i
say
be
perfect
one
day
doris
and
i
drove
up
the
coast
a
few
mile
stop
for
lunch
at
the
beautiful
mauna
lani
hotel
and
notice
a
new
condominium
project
go
up
next
door
we
walk
around
the
ground
and
talk
to
the
sale
staff
and
before
the
afternoon
be
over
we
would
decide
to
buy
one
of
the
condo
this
be
not
something
we
have
plan
it
be
rather
still
another
example
of
ready
fire
aim
in
we
begin
building
our
own
home
about
mile
south
of
the
mauna
lani
hawaii
become
our
official
residence
in
like
most
newcomer
in
a
very
different
land
we
struggle
through
a
period
of
adjustment
happily
that
period
be
brief
but
the
big
island
be
not
like
oahu
or
maui
or
some
of
the
other
part
of
the
hawaiian
island
more
familiar
and
accommodate
to
visitor
from
the
mainland
the
big
island
be
very
remote
far
remove
from
the
busier
more
populate
area
of
honolulu
and
oahu
in
cultural
social
and
economic
term
it
be
for
one
thing
sparsely
populate
its
square
mile
a
somewhat
large
land
mass
than
puerto
rico
be
home
to
only
about
people
among
those
people
there
be
no
majority
everybody
include
the
one
quarter
of
the
population
that
be
indigenous
belongs
to
a
minority
group
chinese
japanese
filipino
korean
and
portuguese
many
of
whom
have
be
here
for
several
generation
as
well
as
aboriginal
hawaiian
and
countless
combination
thereof
surprisingly
at
least
to
mainlanders
there
be
little
animosity
among
the
various
ethnic
group
hawaiian
tend
not
to
see
themselves
as
individualistically
as
other
american
as
separate
either
from
one
another
or
from
their
environment
hawaiian
be
generally
more
spiritual
than
other
citizen
indeed
their
designation
of
caucasian
outsider
haoles
mean
literally
to
be
without
spirit
thankfully
even
haoles
can
attain
the
hawaiian
spirit
we
no
doubt
have
take
a
few
misstep
but
overall
i
believe
that
doris
and
i
have
do
our
best
to
fit
into
our
big
island
community
when
we
decide
to
build
our
home
for
instance
we
ask
hawaiian
blessing
on
the
land
we
also
host
a
couple
of
luau
for
the
builder
their
crew
and
family
make
it
clear
that
the
creation
of
our
new
home
be
a
community
project
when
i
later
become
president
of
the
north
hawaii
community
hospital
board
i
make
it
clear
that
i
would
not
be
operating
on
my
own
or
with
only
other
white
men
and
woman
but
that
hawaiian
would
necessarily
be
member
of
that
decision
make
group
i
met
with
one
of
the
respect
hawaiian
elder
one
of
the
tutu
or
grandmother
you
go
to
for
knowledge
and
comfort
and
told
her
how
our
hospital
would
be
different
from
other
hospital
how
it
would
incorporate
many
philosophy
and
technique
include
native
hawaiian
the
tutu
look
at
me
and
beam
you
must
be
hawaiian
she
exclaim
what
you
be
talk
about
be
hawaiian
perhaps
at
that
moment
more
than
any
other
i
personally
felt
accepted
in
the
community
as
someone
with
spirit
as
a
hawaiian
i
remember
think
this
be
for
real
i
be
finally
living
what
i
have
be
work
toward
through
the
archaeus
project
and
other
activity
i
be
finally
feel
the
combine
power
of
the
mind
spirit
and
body
i
be
home

though
i
have
officially
retire
to
hawaii
i
paid
tax
in
hawaii
and
held
a
hawaiian
driver
license
among
other
tangible
proof
of
my
new
status
i
have
no
desire
or
intention
to
simply
lie
around
in
a
hammock
and
enjoy
the
gentle
trade
wind
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
do
that
if
i
would
want
to
i
discover
early
on
that
i
be
energize
by
a
new
kind
of
electricity
one
that
be
somewhat
more
difficult
to
explain
but
be
no
less
real
and
powerful
where
we
be
locate
in
the
northwest
quadrant
of
the
big
island
we
be
at
the
center
of
a
rough
pentagon
make
up
of
five
large
volcanic
mountain
four
on
the
big
island
itself
and
one
only
mile
across
the
bay
on
the
island
of
maui
in
the
morning
when
i
drive
from
our
home
to
the
hospital
in
waimea
the
sun
be
just
come
up
over
mauna
kea
the
large
volcanic
mountain
in
total
mass
in
the
world
no
matter
how
many
time
you
see
it
the
sight
be
breathtaking
the
experience
profound
you
feel
a
presence
what
the
hawaiian
call
mauna
meaning
power
or
energy
that
energy
be
in
fact
so
powerful
that
some
morning
i
have
to
pull
over
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
just
let
it
fill
me
up
what
i
be
feel
what
be
fill
me
up
be
the
immortal
heartbeat
of
the
land
not
long
after
our
arrival
in
hawaii
i
become
involve
in
a
statewide
organization
call
friend
of

sight
individual
from

to
a
range
of
statewide
problem
i
become
chairman
of
the
health
and
wellness
division
look
specifically
at
the
people
who
live
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
big
island
who
happen
to
bc
statistically
speak
in
the
bad
health
in
the
entire
state
for
a
variety
of
reason
include
a
fatty
diet
relatively
depressed
socio
economic
condition
and
lack
of
easily

our
hawaiian
neighbor
suffer
from
a
disproportionate
amount
of

the
north
hawaii
community
hospital
which
open
in
the
spring
of
be
one
much
need
response
but
the
hospital
as
significant
as
it
be
could
be
view
as
only
a
part
of
the
response
to
the
big
island
problem
the
friend
of
the

head
by
kenny
brown
one
of
the
state
most
prominent
citizen
and
other
interested
group
have
recognize
that
other
health
resource
be
necessary
our
people
need
to
know
the
component
of
good
nutrition
and
a
healthy
lifestyle
they
have
to
have
a

tangible
incentive
for
stay
healthy
an
insurance
system
for
example
that
encourages

they

opportunity
that
encourage

while

they
have

work
in
an

free
of
pollution
and
degradation
our
goal
as
i
described
it
in
some
detail
in
chapter
two
be
to
one
day
be
home
to
a
multifaceted
health
and
wellness
center
that
would
draw
patient
from
all
over
the
world
a
heal
island
in
the
beautiful
pacific
clearly
there
be
no
shortage
of
challenge
and
opportunity
for
a
retire
fellow
in
hawaii
much
of
my
time
during

not
many
while
we
have
our
own

i
be
on
the

as
i
have
always
be

the
height
of
my
business
career

to
hawaii
t
e
n
full
circle
all
this
excite
entrepreneurial
activity
in
hawaii
have
give
me
among
other
thing
a
wonderful
sense
of
start
life
anew
in
my
middle
s
i
feel
reborn
alive
with
the
spirit
some
day
i
feel
the
same
thrill
of
adventure
and
discovery
i
felt
when
palmer
hermundslie
and
i
begin
to
realize
the
potential
of
medtronic
without
the
onerous
financial
worry
inherent
in
those
long
ago
venture
thankfully
with
doris
help
i
have
manage
to
stay
reasonably
healthy
part
of
my
current
well
be
be
due
of
course
to
the
moderate
lifestyle
inculcate
in
me
by
my
conservative
parent
a
lifelong
aversion
to
tobacco
spawn
by
those
youthful
basement
experiment
with
cigarette
smoking
robot
and
a
positive
self
empower
attitude
encourage
and
enhance
by
my
hawaiian
experience
since
establish
a
home
here
i
have
take
up
several
new
habit
that
have
contribute
significantly
to
the
health
of
my
mind
body
and
spirit
i
give
doris
most
of
the
credit
because
it
be
she
more
than
anyone
who
encourage
me
to
investigate
the
benefit
of
so
many
of
the
wonderful
attribute
of
a
healthy
hawaiian
life
style
every
week
for
example
i
enjoy
three
three
and
a
half
hour
session
comprise
vigorous
exercise
cranial
sacral
acupuncture
and
massage
that
leave
me
feel
wonderfully
restore
absolutely
improve
in
every
way
doris
herself
have
found
relief
from
persistent
low
back
problem
at
a
local
chiropractor
after
year
of
ineffective
treatment
by
some
of
the
best
allopathic
practitioner
on
the
mainland
we
both
exercise
regularly
and
benefit
from
the
administration
of
various
complementary
therapy
from
body
wash
and
acupuncture
to
vitamin
and
herb
as
antidote
to
the
wear
and
care
of
everyday
life
the
essential
concept
be
the
integration
of
mental
physical
and
spiritual
health
which
modality
best
promotes
that
concept
be
up
to
the
individual
doris
and
i
do
not
claim
that
our
particular
regimen
be
right
for
everybody
but
it
sure
have
work
wonder
for
us
a
couple
of
year
ago
i
reach
the
point
at
which
i
have
to
seek
treatment
for
a
serious
cataract
condition
the
cataract
have
gotten
so
bad
in
fact
my
right
eye
be
almost
useless
when
my
hawaiian
friend
learn
of
the
situation
they
assume
i
would
fly
back
to
minnesota
to
have
the
cataract
remove
perhaps
to
the
mayo
clinic
or
some
other
eminent
institution
but
i
go
instead
to
a
local
ophthalmologist
in
a
small
rural
hospital
here
in
hawaii
my
neighbor
take
that
they
told
me
to
be
a
sign
of
my
commitment
to
the
area
and
its
people
and
of
course
it
be
i
firmly
believe
that
i
have
to
walk
the
talk
if
my
word
be
go
to
mean
something
in
my
adopt
home
but
truth
be
told
it
be
not
a
sacrifice
on
my
part
the
ophthalmologist
offer
state
of
the
art
technology
and
he
and
his
nurse
give
me
the
kind
of
heal
touch
care
that
i
desire
and
all
thing
consider
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
receive
well
treatment
anywhere
i
be
also
obviously
i
suppose
a
believer
in
the
active
life
few
retiree
have
sadder
life
than
those
who
have
or
choose
to
have
nothing
to
do
nowhere
to
go
nothing
more
to
learn
or
accomplish
i
think
good
health
depends
in
large
part
on
a
busy
regimen
that
keep
us
focus
on
the
road
ahead
on
our
fellow
men
and
woman
and
on
the
community
to
which
we
all
belong
in
this
lifetime
some
people
be
surprised
by
my
bulge
agenda
why
do
you
stay
so
active
they
ask
me
you
be
retire
you
have
earn
a
rest
why
not
take
it
easy
well
the
short
answer
be
i
just
ca
not
seem
to
do
otherwise
i
be
brought
up
believe
that
idle
hand
be
the
devil
workshop
more
to
the
point
i
be
taught
to
believe
that
we
have
a
responsibility
to
our
fellow
human
being
and
i
eventually
developed
a
company
whose
mission
be
and
be
to
help
people
live
richer
fuller
healthier
life
besides
i
be
have
fun
i
feel
good
about
what
i
be
do
especially
when
i
see
that
what
i
be
do
be
make
a
difference
in
people
life
thus
alive
and
able
i
remain
on
the
go
energize
by
my
hawaiian
experience
but
also
highly
charge
by
the
opportunity
to
both
get
and
give
wherever
i
go
include
back
in
my
original
home
town

a
few
year
ago
during
one
of
my
frequent
visit
to
the
twin
city
i
be
privileged
to
deliver
the
commencement
address
to
my
alma
mater
the
institute
of
technology
at
the
university
of
minnesota
speak
to
group
of
student
have
become
something
i
be
do
fairly
often
at
this
new
stage
in
my
life
and
i
found
it
both
a
challenge
and
an
honor
as
well
as
yet
another
opportunity
to
share
to
give
back
some
of
what
i
would
learn
over
the
year
review
that
particular
speech
today
i
believe
it
accurately
and
succinctly
sum
up
not
only
the
major
reason
for
the
success
i
have
enjoy
in
business
but
my
personal
action
plan
to
this
moment
allow
me
to
re
state
in
abbreviate
and
edit
form
some
of
those
remark
right
here
my
theme
no
surprise
be
ready
fire
aim
i
begin
by
provide
two
example
of
how
the
concept
work
for
us
in
the
early
day
of
medtronic
in
be
in
graduate
school
in
electrical
engineering
to
be
of
service
and
because
of
my
long
term
interest
i
spent
some
time
repair
early
medical
electronic
device
for
the
university
of
minnesota
and
abbott
northwestern
hospital
ready
there
seem
to
be
a
need
so
one
even
at
a
family
gathering
my
brother
in
law
and
i
decide
to
set
up
a
company
to
service
such
equipment
fire
we
start
medtronic
in
a
garage
we
do
not
analyze
or
study
the
market
we
just
do
it
however
service
be
not
as
profitable
as
we
like
so
we
adjust
our
aim
and
start
sell
other
manufacturer
medical
electronic
equipment
please
note
medtronic
be
not
create
to
manufacture
pacemaker
that
come
eight
year
later
as
we
continued
to
adjust
our
aim
sell
and
service
other
manufacturer
equipment
we
become
acquaint
with
the
surgeon
at
the
u
of
m
namely
dr
c
walton
lillehei
and
his
colleague
in
after
a
massive
power
blackout
one
of
the
so
call
blue
baby
lillehei
and
his
team
be
treat
for
heart
block
die
when
the
big
ac
power
pacemaker
that
be
keep
the
child
alive
follow
surgery
fail
because
we
be
there
we
have
the
opportunity
to
make
the
first
wearable
battery
power
transistorize
pacemaker
prototype
ready
it
be
just
four
week
from
the
definition
of
need
until
those
u
of
m
doctor
use
the
unit
on
child
fire
the
first
unit
be
not
child
proof
so
we
correct
our
aim
and
so
begin
our
manufacture
of
pacemaker
for
individual
first
for
infant
then
for
adult
million
of
patient
have
since
be
restore
to
full
life
with
the
help
of
implantable
pacemaker
the
same
philosophy
of
action
have
be
medtronic
mode
of
operation
throughout
its
history
we
do
a
great
deal
of
careful
planning
but
we
look
for
the
unexpected
chance
to
act
quickly
on
those
opportunity
and
also
on
problem
i
could
cite
a
long
list
of
positive
result
as
well
as
some
miss
opportunity
where
we
wait
too
long
to
fire
the
lesson
be
have
a
bias
for
action
use
your
intuition
think
out
of
the
box
do
not
over
analyze
do
not
hesitate
while
look
for
the
perfect
result
do
it
correct
your
aim
later
so
how
do
we
get
ready
we
get
ready
by
set
a
personal
mission
which
include
a
set
of
value
a
goal
that
help
humanity
and
a
meaningful
role
for
your
life
we
get
ready
by
continued
learn
and
education
by
reading
book
and
journal
attend
seminar
and
lecture
learn
from
other
language
and
culture
and
study
our
failure
as
well
as
our
success
we
get
ready
by
continually
feed
our
mind
with
information
the
half
life
of
an
engineer
or
physicist
education
be
very
short
today
about
three
year
even
though
i
be
retire
i
still
study
and
read
extensively
to
be
able
to
consult
with
my
company
and
other
organization
we
also
get
ready
by
develop
a
belief
in
our
intuition
we
visualize
result
and
hold
that
vision
until
it
be
a
reality
i
have
sometimes
be
call
a
visionary
really
i
have
only
described
what
my
intuition
told
me
we
get
ready
finally
by
think
in
unstructured
way
we
think
like
einstein
create
like
da
vinci
and
invent
like
edison
humorize
idea
twist
translate
and
look
for
crazy
solution
until
an
idea
be
born
chase
the
impossible
dream
the
impossible
be
a
great
challenge
but
often
a
great
opportunity
as
well
my
dream
have
be
fulfil
but
now
i
have
new
dream
and
how
do
we
fire
we
fire
by
act
on
our
vision
and
value
we
take
the
first
step
even
if
the
direction
be
not
clear
we
do
something
understand
that
one
person
can
make
a
difference
we
take
responsibility
for
what
we
do
we
act
like
a
leader
we
walk
the
talk
and
set
the
way
we
act
on
our
intuition
we
do
not
wait
or
plan
to
do
something
in
the
future
when
the
time
be
right
because
the
year
go
by
too
fast
we
stick
our
neck
out
risk
our
job
if
necessary
become
a
maverick
a
rag
evangelist
for
our
idea
we
act
outside
the
accepted
way
of
do
thing
we
understand
that
failure
be
closer
to
success
than
inaction
we
proceed
fearlessly
into
area
where
no
one
have
be
the
world
be
change
we
get
in
front
of
the
power
curve
and
how
do
we
aim
we
try
again
our
first
attempt
may
not
succeed
but
the
education
we
gain
by
try
be
very
important
and
success
will
come
with
persistence
we
flood
our
mind
with
information
read
incessantly
examine
the
reason
we
have
not
succeed
and
fire
again
we
do
not
drop
an
idea
before
it
matures
most
good
idea
will
succeed
give
enough
time
the
target
be
probably
move
we
need
to
assimilate
all
the
information
and
continue
to
adjust
the
aim
we
simultaneously
aim
at
several
target
in
different
category
we
become
broadly
knowledgeable
but
remain
focus
different
target
within
the
same
focus
can
amplify
each
other
a
correct
aim
eventually
brings
in
the
envision
success
the
world
be
rapidly
change
the
year
go
by
so
fast
do
not
hesitate
when
in
doubt
believe
in
your
intuition
and
envision
your
dream
remember
the
three
magic
word
ready
fire
aim
the
reaction
to
that
speech
be
enthusiastic
and
encourage
the
hundred
of
young
engineer
on
the
threshold
of
their
career
seem
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
lesson
i
be
try
to
impart
i
be
also
amuse
when
after
the
speech
one
of
the
grad
a
young
chinese
man
want
to
talk
to
me
about
ballroom
dance
one
of
the
newly
mint
engineer
take
a
brief
detour
on
his
way
across
the
stage
to
receive
his
diploma
shook
my
hand
and
told
me
he
be
start
the
next
medtronic
in
two
week
i
told
him
i
could
not
have
be
more
pleased
and
wish
him
all
the
luck
in
the
world
i
knew
you
see
that
what
i
be
tell
those
young
people
really
work
i
knew
from
long
personal
experience
that
the
gospel
i
be
preach
have
a
proven
and
practical
application
in
real
life
though
i
have
use
the
medtronic
story
as
my
example
it
be
a
twin
city
audience
remember
i
could
just
as
easily
and
accurately
have
refer
to
our
north
hawaii
community
hospital
where
we
have
rely
on
our
dream
intuition
energy
and
perseverance
to
make
the
institution
a
reality
ready
fire
aim
it
be
indeed
the
lesson
of
a
lifetime

if
i
need
a
reminder
of
that
fact
if
for
that
matter
i
require
reinforcement
of
my
lifelong
objective
or
a
reason
to
get
up
in
the
morning
all
i
would
have
to
do
be
