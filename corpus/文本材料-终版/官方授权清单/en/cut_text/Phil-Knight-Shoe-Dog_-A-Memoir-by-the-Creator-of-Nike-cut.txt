dawn
i
be
up
before
the
others
before
the
bird
before
the
sun
i
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
wolfed
down
a
piece
of
toast
put
on
my
short
and
sweatshirt
and
lace
up
my
green
run
shoe
then
slip
quietly
out
the
back
door
i
stretch
my
leg
my
hamstring
my
low
back
and
groan
as
i
take
the
first
few
balky
step
down
the
cool
road
into
the
fog
why
be
it
always
so
hard
to
get
start
there
be
no
car
no
people
no
sign
of
life
i
be
all
alone
the
world
to
myself
though
the
tree
seem
oddly
aware
of
me
then
again
this
be
oregon
the
tree
always
seem
to
know
the
tree
always
have
your
back
what
a
beautiful
place
to
be
from
i
thought
gaze
around
calm
green
tranquil
i
be
proud
to
call
oregon
my
home
proud
to
call
little
portland
my
place
of
birth
but
i
felt
a
stab
of
regret
too
though
beautiful
oregon
struck
some
people
as
the
kind
of
place
where
nothing
big
have
ever
happen
or
be
ever
likely
to
if
we
oregonian
be
famous
for
anything
it
be
an
old
old
trail
we
d
have
to
blaze
to
get
here
since
then
thing
have
be
pretty
tame
the
best
teacher
i
ever
have
one
of
the
fine
men
i
ever
knew
spoke
of
that
trail
often
it
s
our
birthright
he
d
growl
our
character
our
fate
our
dna
the
coward
never
start
he
d
tell
me
and
the
weak
die
along
the
way
that
leaf
us
us
some
rare
strain
of
pioneer
spirit
be
discover
along
that
trail
my
teacher
believe
some
outsized
sense
of
possibility
mixed
with
a
diminish
capacity
for
pessimism
and
it
be
our
job
as
oregonian
to
keep
that
strain
alive
i
d
nod
show
him
all
due
respect
i
love
the
guy
but
walk
away
i
d
sometimes
think
jeez
it
s
just
a
dirt
road
that
foggy
morning
that
momentous
morning
in
i
d
recently
blaze
my
own
trail
back
home
after
seven
long
year
away
it
be
strange
be
home
again
strange
be
lash
again
by
the
daily
rain
stranger
still
be
living
again
with
my
parent
and
twin
sister
sleep
in
my
childhood
bed
late
at
night
i
d
lie
on
my
back
star
at
my
college
textbook
my
high
school
trophy
and
blue
ribbon
think
this
be
me
still
i
move
quicker
down
the
road
my
breath
form
round
frosty
puff
swirl
into
the
fog
i
savor
that
first
physical
awaken
that
brilliant
moment
before
the
mind
be
fully
clear
when
the
limb
and
joint
first
begin
to
loosen
and
the
material
body
start
to
melt
away
solid
to
liquid
faster
i
told
myself
faster
on
paper
i
thought
i
m
an
adult
graduate
from
a
good
college
university
of
oregon
earn
a
master
s
from
a
top
business
school
stanford
survive
a
yearlong
hitch
in
the
u
s
army
fort
lewis
and
fort
eustis
my
r
sum
say
i
be
a
learn
accomplish
soldier
a
twenty
four
year
old
man
in
full
so
why
i
wonder
why
do
i
still
feel
like
a
kid
bad
like
the
same
shy
pale
rail
thin
kid
i
d
always
be
maybe
because
i
still
hadn
t
experienced
anything
of
life
least
of
all
its
many
temptation
and
excitement
i
hadn
t
smoke
a
cigarette
hadn
t
try
a
drug
i
hadn
t
broken
a
rule
let
alone
a
law
the
s
be
just
under
way
the
age
of
rebellion
and
i
be
the
only
person
in
america
who
hadn
t
yet
rebel
i
couldn
t
think
of
one
time
i
d
cut
loose
do
the
unexpected
i
d
never
even
be
with
a
girl
if
i
tend
to
dwell
on
all
the
thing
i
wasn
t
the
reason
be
simple
those
be
the
thing
i
knew
best
i
d
have
found
it
difficult
to
say
what
or
who
exactly
i
be
or
might
become
like
all
my
friend
i
want
to
be
successful
unlike
my
friend
i
didn
t
know
what
that
meant
money
maybe
wife
kid
house
sure
if
i
be
lucky
these
be
the
goal
i
be
taught
to
aspire
to
and
part
of
me
do
aspire
to
them
instinctively
but
deep
down
i
be
search
for
something
else
something
more
i
have
an
ache
sense
that
our
time
be
short
shorter
than
we
ever
know
short
as
a
morning
run
and
i
want
mine
to
be
meaningful
and
purposeful
and
creative
and
important
above
all
different
i
want
to
leave
a
mark
on
the
world
i
want
to
win
no
that
s
not
right
i
simply
didn
t
want
to
lose
and
then
it
happen
as
my
young
heart
begin
to
thump
as
my
pink
lung
expand
like
the
wing
of
a
bird
as
the
tree
turn
to
greenish
blur
i
saw
it
all
before
me
exactly
what
i
want
my
life
to
be
play
yes
i
thought
that
s
it
that
s
the
word
the
secret
of
happiness
i
d
always
suspect
the
essence
of
beauty
or
truth
or
all
we
ever
need
to
know
of
either
lay
somewhere
in
that
moment
when
the
ball
be
in
midair
when
both
boxer
sense
the
approach
of
the
bell
when
the
runner
near
the
finish
line
and
the
crowd
rise
as
one
there
s
a
kind
of
exuberant
clarity
in
that
pulse
half
second
before
win
and
lose
be
decide
i
want
that
whatever
that
be
to
be
my
life
my
daily
life
at
different
time
i
d
fantasize
about
become
a
great
novelist
a
great
journalist
a
great
statesman
but
the
ultimate
dream
be
always
to
be
a
great
athlete
sadly
fate
have
make
me
good
not
great
at
twenty
four
i
be
finally
resign
to
that
fact
i
d
run
track
at
oregon
and
i
d
distinguish
myself
letter
three
of
four
year
but
that
be
that
the
end
now
as
i
begin
to
clip
off
one
brisk
six
minute
mile
after
another
as
the
rise
sun
set
fire
to
the
low
needle
of
the
pine
i
ask
myself
what
if
there
be
a
way
without
be
an
athlete
to
feel
what
athlete
feel
to
play
all
the
time
instead
of
work
or
else
to
enjoy
work
so
much
that
it
becomes
essentially
the
same
thing
the
world
be
so
overrun
with
war
and
pain
and
misery
the
daily
grind
be
so
exhaust
and
often
unjust
maybe
the
only
answer
i
thought
be
to
find
some
prodigious
improbable
dream
that
seem
worthy
that
seem
fun
that
seem
a
good
fit
and
chase
it
with
an
athlete
s
single
mind
dedication
and
purpose
like
it
or
not
life
be
a
game
whoever
denies
that
truth
whoever
simply
refuse
to
play
get
left
on
the
sideline
and
i
didn
t
want
that
more
than
anything
that
be
the
thing
i
do
not
want
which
lead
as
always
to
my
crazy
idea
maybe
i
thought
just
maybe
i
need
to
take
one
more
look
at
my
crazy
idea
maybe
my
crazy
idea
just
might
work
maybe
no
no
i
thought
run
faster
faster
run
as
if
i
be
chase
someone
and
be
chase
all
at
the
same
time
it
will
work
by
god
i
ll
make
it
work
no
maybes
about
it
i
be
suddenly
smile
almost
laugh
drench
in
sweat
move
as
gracefully
and
effortlessly
as
i
ever
have
i
saw
my
crazy
idea
shin
up
ahead
and
it
didn
t
look
all
that
crazy
it
didn
t
even
look
like
an
idea
it
look
like
a
place
it
look
like
a
person
or
some
life
force
that
exist
long
before
i
do
separate
from
me
but
also
part
of
me
wait
for
me
but
also
hiding
from
me
that
might
sound
a
little
high
flown
a
little
crazy
but
that
s
how
i
felt
back
then
or
maybe
i
didn
t
maybe
my
memory
be
enlarge
this
eureka
moment
or
condense
many
eureka
moment
into
one
or
maybe
if
there
be
such
a
moment
it
be
nothing
more
than
runner
s
high
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
say
so
much
about
those
day
and
the
month
and
year
into
which
they
slowly
sort
themselves
have
vanished
like
those
round
frosty
puff
of
breath
face
number
decision
that
once
seem
press
and
irrevocable
they
re
all
go
what
remains
however
be
this
one
comfort
certainty
this
one
anchor
truth
that
will
never
go
away
at
twenty
four
i
do
have
a
crazy
idea
and
somehow
despite
be
dizzy
with
existential
angst
and
fear
about
the
future
and
doubt
about
myself
as
all
young
men
and
woman
in
their
midtwenties
be
i
do
decide
that
the
world
be
make
up
of
crazy
idea
history
be
one
long
processional
of
crazy
idea
the
thing
i
love
most
book
sport
democracy
free
enterprise
start
as
crazy
idea
for
that
matter
few
idea
be
as
crazy
as
my
favorite
thing
run
it
s
hard
it
s
painful
it
s
risky
the
reward
be
few
and
far
from
guaranteed
when
you
run
around
an
oval
track
or
down
an
empty
road
you
have
no
real
destination
at
least
none
that
can
fully
justify
the
effort
the
act
itself
becomes
the
destination
it
s
not
just
that
there
s
no
finish
line
it
s
that
you
define
the
finish
line
whatever
pleasure
or
gain
you
derive
from
the
act
of
run
you
must
find
them
within
it
s
all
in
how
you
frame
it
how
you
sell
it
to
yourself
every
runner
know
this
you
run
and
run
mile
after
mile
and
you
never
quite
know
why
you
tell
yourself
that
you
re
run
toward
some
goal
chase
some
rush
but
really
you
run
because
the
alternative
stop
scare
you
to
death
so
that
morning
in
i
told
myself
let
everyone
else
call
your
idea
crazy
just
keep
go
don
t
stop
don
t
even
think
about
stop
until
you
get
there
and
don
t
give
much
thought
to
where
there
be
whatever
come
just
don
t
stop
that
s
the
precocious
prescient
urgent
advice
i
manage
to
give
myself
out
of
the
blue
and
somehow
manage
to
take
half
a
century
later
i
believe
it
s
the
best
advice
maybe
the
only
advice
any
of
us
should
ever
give
part
one
now
here
you
see
it
take
all
the
run
you
can
do
to
keep
in
the
same
place
if
you
want
to
get
somewhere
else
you
must
run
at
least
twice
as
fast
as
that
lewis
carroll
through
the
look
glass

when
i
broach
the
subject
with
my
father
when
i
work
up
the
nerve
to
speak
to
him
about
my
crazy
idea
i
make
sure
it
be
in
the
early
even
that
be
always
the
best
time
with
dad
he
be
relaxed
then
well
fed
stretch
out
in
his
vinyl
recliner
in
the
tv
nook
i
can
still
tilt
back
my
head
and
close
my
eye
and
hear
the
sound
of
the
audience
laugh
the
tinny
theme
song
of
his
favorite
show
wagon
train
and
rawhide
his
all
time
favorite
be
red
button
every
episode
begin
with
red
sing
ho
ho
hee
hee
strange
thing
be
happen
i
set
a
straight
back
chair
beside
him
and
give
a
wan
smile
and
wait
for
the
next
commercial
i
d
rehearse
my
spiel
in
my
head
over
and
over
especially
the
opening
sooo
dad
you
remember
that
crazy
idea
i
have
at
stanford
it
be
one
of
my
final
class
a
seminar
on
entrepreneurship
i
d
write
a
research
paper
about
shoe
and
the
paper
have
evolve
from
a
run
of
the
mill
assignment
to
an
all
out
obsession
be
a
runner
i
knew
something
about
run
shoe
be
a
business
buff
i
knew
that
japanese
camera
have
make
deep
cut
into
the
camera
market
which
have
once
be
dominate
by
german
thus
i
argue
in
my
paper
that
japanese
run
shoe
might
do
the
same
thing
the
idea
interested
me
then
inspire
me
then
captivate
me
it
seem
so
obvious
so
simple
so
potentially
huge
i
d
spent
week
and
week
on
that
paper
i
d
move
into
the
library
devour
everything
i
could
find
about
import
and
export
about
start
a
company
finally
as
require
i
d
give
a
formal
presentation
of
the
paper
to
my
classmate
who
react
with
formal
boredom
not
one
ask
a
single
question
they
greet
my
passion
and
intensity
with
labor
sigh
and
vacant
stare
the
professor
thought
my
crazy
idea
have
merit
he
give
me
an
a
but
that
be
that
at
least
that
be
suppose
to
be
that
i
d
never
really
stop
think
about
that
paper
through
the
rest
of
my
time
at
stanford
through
every
morning
run
and
right
up
to
that
moment
in
the
tv
nook
i
d
ponder
go
to
japan
find
a
shoe
company
pitch
them
my
crazy
idea
in
the
hope
that
they
d
have
a
more
enthusiastic
reaction
than
my
classmate
that
they
d
want
to
partner
with
a
shy
pale
rail
thin
kid
from
sleepy
oregon
i
d
also
toyed
with
the
notion
of
make
an
exotic
detour
on
my
way
to
and
from
japan
how
can
i
leave
my
mark
on
the
world
i
thought
unless
i
get
out
there
first
and
see
it
before
run
a
big
race
you
always
want
to
walk
the
track
a
backpacking
trip
around
the
globe
might
be
just
the
thing
i
reason
no
one
talk
about
bucket
list
in
those
day
but
i
suppose
that
s
close
to
what
i
have
in
mind
before
i
die
become
too
old
or
consume
with
everyday
minutia
i
want
to
visit
the
planet
s
most
beautiful
and
wondrous
place
and
its
most
sacred
of
course
i
want
to
taste
other
food
hear
other
language
dive
into
other
culture
but
what
i
really
crave
be
connection
with
a
capital
c
i
want
to
experience
what
the
chinese
call
tao
the
greek
call
logo
the
hindu
call
j
na
the
buddhist
call
dharma
what
the
christian
call
spirit
before
set
out
on
my
own
personal
life
voyage
i
thought
let
me
first
understand
the
great
voyage
of
humankind
let
me
explore
the
grandest
temple
and
church
and
shrine
the
holiest
river
and
mountaintops
let
me
feel
the
presence
of
god
yes
i
told
myself
yes
for
want
of
a
well
word
god
but
first
i
d
need
my
father
s
approval
more
i
d
need
his
cash
i
d
already
mention
make
a
big
trip
the
previous
year
and
my
father
seem
open
to
it
but
surely
he
d
forgotten
and
surely
i
be
push
it
add
to
the
original
proposal
this
crazy
idea
this
outrageous
side
trip
to
japan
to
launch
a
company
talk
about
boondoggle
surely
he
d
see
this
as
a
bridge
too
far
and
a
bridge
too
darn
expensive
i
have
some
saving
from
the
army
and
from
various
part
time
job
over
the
last
several
summer
on
top
of
which
i
plan
to
sell
my
car
a
cherry
black
mg
with
race
tire
and
a
twin
cam
the
same
car
elvis
drove
in
blue
hawaii
all
of
which
amount
to
fifteen
hundred
dollar
leave
me
a
grand
short
i
now
told
my
father
he
nod
uh
huh
mm
hmm
and
flick
his
eye
from
the
tv
to
me
and
back
again
while
i
laid
it
all
out
remember
how
we
talk
dad
how
i
say
i
want
to
see
the
world
the
himalaya
the
pyramid
the
dead
sea
dad
the
dead
sea
well
haha
i
m
also
think
of
stop
off
in
japan
dad
remember
my
crazy
idea
japanese
run
shoe
right
it
could
be
huge
dad
huge
i
be
lay
it
on
thick
put
on
the
hard
sell
extra
hard
because
i
always
hat
sell
and
because
this
particular
sell
have
zero
chance
my
father
have
just
fork
out
hundred
of
dollar
to
the
university
of
oregon
thousand
more
to
stanford
he
be
the
publisher
of
the
oregon
journal
a
solid
job
that
paid
for
all
the
basic
comfort
include
our
spacious
white
house
on
claybourne
street
in
portland
s
quietest
suburb
eastmoreland
but
the
man
wasn
t
make
of
money
also
this
be
the
earth
be
big
then
though
human
be
begin
to
orbit
the
planet
in
capsule
percent
of
american
still
have
never
be
on
an
airplane
the
average
man
or
woman
have
never
venture
farther
than
one
hundred
mile
from
his
or
her
own
front
door
so
the
mere
mention
of
global
travel
by
airplane
would
unnerve
any
father
and
especially
mine
whose
predecessor
at
the
paper
have
die
in
an
air
crash
set
aside
money
set
aside
safety
concern
the
whole
thing
be
just
so
impractical
i
be
aware
that
twenty
six
of
twenty
seven
new
company
fail
and
my
father
be
aware
too
and
the
idea
of
take
on
such
a
colossal
risk
go
against
everything
he
stood
for
in
many
way
my
father
be
a
conventional
episcopalian
a
believer
in
jesus
christ
but
he
also
worship
another
secret
deity
respectability
colonial
house
beautiful
wife
obedient
kid
my
father
enjoy
have
these
thing
but
what
he
really
cherished
be
his
friend
and
neighbor
know
he
have
them
he
like
be
admire
he
like
do
a
vigorous
backstroke
each
day
in
the
mainstream
go
around
the
world
on
a
lark
therefore
would
simply
make
no
sense
to
him
it
wasn
t
do
certainly
not
by
the
respectable
son
of
respectable
men
it
be
something
other
people
s
kid
do
something
beatnik
and
hipster
do
possibly
the
main
reason
for
my
father
s
respectability
fixation
be
a
fear
of
his
inner
chaos
i
felt
this
viscerally
because
every
now
and
then
that
chaos
would
burst
forth
without
warn
late
at
night
the
phone
in
the
front
hall
would
jingle
and
when
i
answer
there
would
be
that
same
gravelly
voice
on
the
line
come
getcher
old
man
i
d
pull
on
my
raincoat
it
always
seem
on
those
night
that
a
mist
rain
be
fall
and
drive
downtown
to
my
father
s
club
as
clearly
as
i
remember
my
own
bedroom
i
remember
that
club
a
century
old
with
floor
to
ceiling
oak
bookcase
and
wing
back
chair
it
look
like
the
draw
room
of
an
english
country
house
in
other
word
eminently
respectable
i
d
always
find
my
father
at
the
same
table
in
the
same
chair
i
d
always
help
him
gently
to
his
foot
you
okay
dad
course
i
m
okay
i
d
always
guide
him
outside
to
the
car
and
the
whole
way
home
we
d
pretend
nothing
be
wrong
he
d
sit
perfectly
erect
almost
regal
and
we
d
talk
sport
because
talk
sport
be
how
i
distract
myself
soothe
myself
in
time
of
stress
my
father
like
sport
too
sport
be
always
respectable
for
these
and
a
dozen
other
reason
i
expect
my
father
to
greet
my
pitch
in
the
tv
nook
with
a
furrow
brow
and
a
quick
put
down
haha
crazy
idea
fat
chance
buck
my
give
name
be
philip
but
my
father
always
call
me
buck
in
fact
he
d
be
call
me
buck
since
before
i
be
born
my
mother
told
me
he
d
be
in
the
habit
of
pat
her
stomach
and
ask
how
s
little
buck
today
as
i
stop
talk
however
as
i
stop
pitch
my
father
rock
forward
in
his
vinyl
recliner
and
shot
me
a
funny
look
he
say
that
he
always
regret
not
travel
more
when
he
be
young
he
say
a
trip
might
be
just
the
finish
touch
to
my
education
he
say
a
lot
of
thing
all
of
them
focus
more
on
the
trip
than
the
crazy
idea
but
i
wasn
t
about
to
correct
him
i
wasn
t
about
to
complain
because
in
sum
he
be
give
his
blessing
and
his
cash
okay
he
say
okay
buck
okay
i
thanked
my
father
and
flee
the
nook
before
he
have
a
chance
to
change
his
mind
only
later
do
i
realize
with
a
spasm
of
guilt
that
my
father
s
lack
of
travel
be
an
ulterior
reason
perhaps
the
main
reason
that
i
want
to
go
this
trip
this
crazy
idea
would
be
one
sure
way
of
become
someone
other
than
him
someone
less
respectable
or
maybe
not
less
respectable
maybe
just
less
obsess
with
respectability
the
rest
of
the
family
wasn
t
quite
so
supportive
when
my
grandmother
get
wind
of
my
itinerary
one
item
in
particular
appalled
her
japan
she
cry
why
buck
it
be
only
a
few
year
ago
the
jap
be
out
to
kill
us
don
t
you
remember
pearl
harbor
the
jap
try
to
conquer
the
world
some
of
them
still
don
t
know
they
lose
they
re
in
hiding
they
might
take
you
prisoner
buck
gouge
out
your
eyeball
they
re
know
for
that
your
eyeball
i
love
my
mother
s
mother
whom
we
all
call
mom
hatfield
and
i
understood
her
fear
japan
be
about
as
far
as
you
could
get
from
roseburg
oregon
the
farm
town
where
she
be
born
and
where
she
d
live
all
her
life
i
d
spent
many
summer
down
there
with
her
and
pop
hatfield
almost
every
night
we
d
sat
out
on
the
porch
listen
to
the
croak
bullfrog
compete
with
the
console
radio
which
in
the
early
s
be
always
tune
to
news
of
the
war
which
be
always
bad
the
japanese
we
be
told
repeatedly
hadn
t
lose
a
war
in
twenty
six
hundred
year
and
it
sure
didn
t
seem
they
be
go
to
lose
this
one
either
in
battle
after
battle
we
suffer
defeat
after
defeat
finally
in
mutual
broadcasting
s
gabriel
heatter
open
his
nightly
radio
report
with
a
shrill
cry
good
even
everyone
there
s
good
news
tonight
the
american
have
won
a
decisive
battle
at
last
critic
skewer
heatter
for
his
shameless
cheerlead
for
abandon
all
pretense
of
journalistic
objectivity
but
the
public
hatred
of
japan
be
so
intense
most
people
hail
heatter
as
a
folk
hero
thereafter
he
open
all
broadcast
the
same
way
good
news
tonight
it
s
one
of
my
early
memory
mom
and
pop
hatfield
beside
me
on
that
porch
pop
peel
a
gravenstein
apple
with
his
pocketknife
hand
me
a
slice
then
eat
a
slice
then
hand
me
a
slice
and
so
on
until
his
apple
par
pace
slow
dramatically
heatter
be
come
on
sssh
hush
up
i
can
still
see
us
all
chew
apple
and
gaze
at
the
night
sky
so
japan
obsess
that
we
half
expect
to
see
japanese
zero
crisscross
the
dog
star
no
wonder
my
first
time
on
an
airplane
right
around
five
year
old
i
ask
dad
be
the
jap
go
to
shoot
us
down
though
mom
hatfield
get
the
hair
on
my
neck
stand
up
i
told
her
not
to
worry
i
d
be
fine
i
d
even
bring
her
back
a
kimono
my
twin
sister
jeanne
and
joanne
four
year
young
than
me
didn
t
seem
to
care
one
way
or
another
where
i
go
or
what
i
do
and
my
mother
as
i
recall
say
nothing
she
rarely
do
but
there
be
something
different
about
her
silence
this
time
it
equal
consent
even
pride
i
spent
week
reading
planning
prepare
for
my
trip
i
go
for
long
run
muse
on
every
detail
while
race
the
wild
geese
as
they
flew
overhead
their
tight
v
formation
i
d
read
somewhere
that
the
geese
in
the
rear
of
the
formation
cruise
in
the
backdraft
only
have
to
work
percent
as
hard
as
the
leader
every
runner
understands
this
front
runner
always
work
the
hardest
and
risk
the
most
long
before
approach
my
father
i
d
decide
it
would
be
good
to
have
a
companion
on
my
trip
and
that
companion
should
be
my
stanford
classmate
carter
though
he
d
be
a
hoop
star
at
william
jewell
college
carter
wasn
t
your
typical
jock
he
wore
thick
glass
and
read
book
good
book
he
be
easy
to
talk
to
and
easy
not
to
talk
to
equally
important
quality
in
a
friend
essential
in
a
travel
companion
but
carter
laugh
in
my
face
when
i
laid
out
the
list
of
place
i
want
to
see
hawaii
tokyo
hong
kong

that
we
re
often
cast
aside
at

i
will
never
forget
that
day
drag
my
bat
along
the
sidewalk
i
stagger
home
and
hole
up

he
sell
the

to
his

i
pass
out
when
i
woke
we
be
in
a
steep
rapid
descent
below
us
lay
a
startlingly
bright
tokyo
the
ginza
in
particular
be
like
a
christmas
tree
drive
to
my
hotel
however
i
saw
only
darkness
vast
section
of
the
city

s
old

three
hundred
thousand
people

and
nearly
percent
of
the
building
be
vaporize
for
long
solemn
stretch
the
cabdriver
and
i
say
nothing
there
be
nothing
to
say
finally
the
driver
stop
at
the
address
write
in
my
notebook
a
dingy
hostel
beyond
dingy
i
d
make
the
reservation
through
american
express
sight
unseen
a
mistake
i
now
realize
i
cross
the
pit
sidewalk
and
enter
a
building
that
seem
about
to
implode
an
old
japanese
woman
behind
the
front
desk
bow
to
me
i
realize
she
wasn
t
bow
she
be
bent
by
age
like
a
tree
that
s
weather
many
storm
slowly
she
lead
me
to
my
room
which
be
more
a
box
tatami
mat
lopsided
table
nothing
else
i
didn
t
care
i
barely
notice
that
the
tatami
mat
be
wafer
thin
i
bow
to
the
bent
old
woman
bidding
her
good
night
oyasumi
nasai
i
curl
up
on
the
mat
and
pass
out
hour
later
i
woke
in
a
room
flood
with
light
i
crawl
to
the
window
apparently
i
be
in
some
kind
of
industrial
district
on
the
city
s
fringe
fill
with
dock
and
factory
this
district
must
have
be
a
primary
target
of
the
b
s
everywhere
i
look
be
desolation
building
crack
and
broken
block
after
block
simply
level
go
luckily
my
father
knew
people
in
tokyo
include
a
group
of
american
guy
work
at
united
press
international
i
take
a
cab
there
and
the
guy
greet
me
like
family
they
give
me
coffee
and
a
breakfast
ring
and
when
i
told
them
where
i
d
spent
the
night
they
laugh
they
book
me
into
a
clean
decent
hotel
then
they
write
down
the
name
of
several
good
place
to
eat
what
in
god
s
name
be
you
do
in
tokyo
i
explain
that
i
be
go
around
the
world
then
i
mention
my
crazy
idea
huh
they
say
give
a
little
eye
roll
they
mention
two
ex
gi
who
ran
a
monthly
magazine
call
importer
talk
to
the
fella
at
importer
they
say
before
you
do
anything
rash
i
promise
i
would
but
first
i
want
to
see
the
city
guidebook
and
minolta
box
camera
in
hand
i
sought
out
the
few
landmark
that
have
survive
the
war
the
old
temple
and
shrine
i
spent
hour
sit
on
bench
in
wall
garden
reading
about
japan
s
dominant
religion
buddhism
and
shinto
i
marvel
at
the
concept
of
kensho
or
satori
enlightenment
that
come
in
a
flash
a
blinding
pop
sort
of
like
the
bulb
on
my
minolta
i
like
that
i
want
that
but
first
i
d
need
to
change
my
whole
approach
i
be
a
linear
thinker
and
accord
to
zen
linear
think
be
nothing
but
a
delusion
one
of
the
many
that
keep
us
unhappy
reality
be
nonlinear
zen
say
no
future
no
past
all
be
now
in
every
religion
it
seem
self
be
the
obstacle
the
enemy
and
yet
zen
declares
plainly
that
the
self
doesn
t
exist
self
be
a
mirage
a
fever
dream
and
our
stubborn
belief
in
its
reality
not
only
waste
life
but
shortens
it
self
be
the
bald
face
lie
we
tell
ourselves
daily
and
happiness
require
see
through
the
lie
debunk
it
to
study
the
self
say
the
thirteenth
century
zen
master
dogen
be
to
forget
the
self
inner
voice
outer
voice
it
s
all
the
same
no
divide
line
especially
in
competition
victory
zen
say
come
when
we
forget
the
self
and
the
opponent
who
be
but
two
half
of
one
whole
in
zen
and
the
art
of
archery
it
s
all
laid
out
with
crystal
clarity
perfection
in
the
art
of
swordsmanship
be
reach
when
the
heart
be
troubled
by
no
more
thought
of
i
and
you
of
the
opponent
and
his
sword
of
one
s
own
sword
and
how
to
wield
it
all
be
emptiness
your
own
self
the
flash
sword
and
the
arm
that
wield
it
even
the
thought
of
emptiness
be
no
longer
there
my
head
swim
i
decide
to
take
a
break
to
visit
a
very
un
zen
landmark
in
fact
the
most
anti
zen
place
in
japan
an
enclave
where
men
focus
on
self
and
nothing
but
self
the
tokyo
stock
exchange
house
in
a
marble
romanesque
building
with
great
big
greek
column
the
tosho
look
from
across
the
street
like
a
stodgy
bank
in
a
quiet
town
in
kansa
inside
however
all
be
bedlam
hundred
of
men
wave
their
arm
pull
their
hair
scream
a
more
deprave
version
of
cornfeld
s
boiler
room
i
couldn
t
look
away
i
watch
and
watch
ask
myself
be
this
what
it
s
all
about
really
i
appreciate
money
as
much
as
the
next
guy
but
i
want
my
life
to
be
about
so
much
more
after
the
tosho
i
need
peace
i
go
deep
into
the
silent
heart
of
the
city
to
the
garden
of
the
nineteenth
century
emperor
meiji
and
his
empress
a
space
thought
to
posse
immense
spiritual
power
i
sat
contemplative
reverent
beneath
sway
ginkgo
tree
beside
a
beautiful
torii
gate
i
read
in
my
guidebook
that
a
torii
gate
be
usually
a
portal
to
sacred
place
and
so
i
bask
in
the
sacredness
the
serenity
try
to
soak
it
all
in
the
next
morning
i
lace
up
my
run
shoe
and
jogged
to
tsukiji
the
world
s
large
fish
market
it
be
the
tosho
all
over
again
with
shrimp
instead
of
stock
i
watch
ancient
fisherman
spread
their
catch
onto
wooden
cart
and
haggle
with
leather
face
merchant
that
night
i
take
a
bus
up
to
the
lake
region
in
the
northern
hakone
mountain
an
area
that
inspire
many
of
the
great
zen
poet
you
cannot
travel
the
path
until
you
have
become
the
path
yourself
say
the
buddha
and
i
stood
in
awe
before
a
path
that
twist
from
the
glassy
lake
to
cloud
ring
mount
fuji
a
perfect
snow
clad
triangle
that
look
to
me
exactly
like
mount
hood
back
home
the
japanese
believe
climb
fuji
be
a
mystical
experience
a
ritual
act
of
celebration
and
i
be
overcome
with
a
desire
to
climb
it
right
then
i
want
to
ascend
into
the
cloud
i
decide
to
wait
however
i
would
return
when
i
have
something
to
celebrate
i
go
back
to
tokyo
and
present
myself
at
importer
the
two
ex
gi
in
charge
thick
necked
brawny
very
busy
look
as
if
they
might
chew
me
out
for
intrude
and
waste
their
time
but
within
minute
their
gruff
exterior
dissolve
and
they
be
warm
friendly
pleased
to
meet
someone
from
back
home
we
talk
mostly
about
sport
can
you
believe
the
yankee
won
it
all
again
how
about
that
willie
may

then
they
told
me
their
story
they
be
the
first
american
i
ever
met
who
love
japan
station
there
during
the
occupation
they
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
culture
the
food
the
woman
and
when
their
hitch
be
up
they
simply
couldn
t
bring
themselves
to
leave
so
they
d
launch
an
import
magazine
when
no
one
anywhere
be
interested
in
import
anything
japanese
and
somehow
they
d
manage
to
keep
it
afloat
for
seventeen
year
i
told
them
my
crazy
idea
and
they
listen
with
some
interest
they
make
a
pot
of
coffee
and
invite
me
to
sit
down
be
there

particular
line
of

to
face
in
that
case
the
ex
gi
say
you
d
well
learn
a
few
thing
about
do
business
with
the
japanese
the
key
they
say
be
don
t
be
pushy
don
t
come
on
like
the
typical
asshole
american
the
typical
gaijin
rude
loud
aggressive
not
take
no
for
an
answer
the
japanese
do
not
react
well
to
the
hard
sell
negotiation
here
tend
to
be
soft
sinewy
look
how
long
it
take
the
american
and
russian
to
coax
hirohito
into
surrender
and
even
when
he
do
surrender
when
his
country
be
reduce
to
a
heap
of
ash
what
do
he
tell
his
people
the
war
situation
hasn
t
developed
to
japan
s
advantage
it
s
a
culture
of
indirection
no
one
ever
turn
you
down
flat
no
one
ever
say
straight
out
no
but
they
don
t
say
yes
either
they
speak
in
circle
sentence
with
no
clear
subject
or
object
don
t
be
discourage
but
don
t
be
cocky
you
might
leave
a
man
s
office
think
you
ve
blown
it
when
in
fact
he
s
ready
to
do
a
deal
you
might
leave
think
you
ve
close
a
deal
when
in
fact
you
ve
just
be
reject
you
never
know
i
frown
under
the
best
of
circumstance
i
be
not
a
great
negotiator
now
i
be
go
to
have
to
negotiate
in
some
kind
of
funhouse
with
trick
mirror
where
normal
rule
didn
t
apply
after
an
hour
of
this
baffling
tutorial
i
shook
hand
with
the
ex
gi
and
say
my
good
bye
feel
suddenly
that
i
couldn
t
wait
that
i
need
to
strike
quickly
while
their
word
be
fresh
in
my
mind
i
race
back
to
my
hotel
threw
everything
into
my
little
suitcase
and
backpack
and
phone
onitsuka
to
make
an
appointment
later
that
afternoon
i
board
a
train
south
japan
be
renowned
for
its
impeccable
order
and
extreme
cleanliness
japanese
literature
philosophy
clothing
domestic
life
all
be
marvelously
pure
and
spare
minimalist
expect
nothing
seek
nothing
grasp
nothing
the
immortal
japanese
poet
write
line
that
seem
polished
and
polished
until
they
gleam
like
the
blade
of
a
samurai
s
sword
or
the
stone
of
a
mountain
brook
spotless
so
why
i
wonder
be
this
train
to
kobe
so
filthy
the
floor
be
strewn
with
newspaper
and
cigarette
butt
the
seat
be
cover
with
orange
rind
and
discard
newspaper
bad
every
car
be
packed
there
be
barely
room
to
stand
i
found
a
strap
by
a
window
and
hung
there
for
seven
hour
as
the
train
rock
and
inched
past
remote
village
past
farm
no
big
than
the
average
portland
backyard
the
trip
be
long
but
neither
my
leg
nor
my
patience
give
out
i
be
too
busy
go
over
and
over
my
tutorial
with
the
ex
gi
when
i
arrive
i
take
a
small
room
in
a
cheap
ryokan
my
appointment
at
onitsuka
be
early
the
next
morning
so
i
lay
down
immediately
on
the
tatami
mat
but
i
be
too
excite
to
sleep
i
roll
around
on
the
mat
most
of
the
night
and
at
dawn
i
rise
wearily
and
star
at
my
gaunt
bleary
reflection
in
the
mirror
after
shave
i
put
on
my
green
brook
brother
suit
and
give
myself
a
pep
talk
you
be
capable
you
be
confident
you
can
do
this
you
can
do
this
then
i
go
to
the
wrong
place
i

first
shoe
factory
i
d

everything
about
it
interest
even
musical
each
time
a
shoe
be
mold
the
metal
last
would
fall
to
the
floor
with
a
silvery
tinkle
a
melodic
cling
clong
every
few
second
cling
clong
cling
clong
a
cobbler
s
concerto
the
executive
seem
to
enjoy
it
too
they
smile
at
me
and
each
other
we
pass
through
the
accounting
department
everyone
in
the
room
men
and
woman
leap
from
their
chair
and
in
unison
bow
a
gesture
of
kei
respect
for
the
american
tycoon
i
d
read
that
tycoon
come
from
taikun
japanese
for
warlord
i
didn
t
know
how
to
acknowledge
their
kei
to
bow
or
not
bow
that
be
always
the
question
in
japan
i
give
a
weak
smile
and
a
half
bow
and
kept
move
the
executive
told
me
that
they
churn
out
fifteen
thousand
pair
of
shoe
each
month
impressive
i
say
not
know
if
that
be
a
lot
or
a
little
they
lead
me
into
a
conference
room
and
point
me
to
the
chair
at
the
head
of
a
long
round
table
mr
knight
someone
say
here
seat
of
honor
more
kei
they
arrange
themselves
around
the
table
and
straighten
their
tie
and
gaze
at
me
the
moment
of
truth
have
arrive
i
d
rehearse
this
scene
in
my
head
so
many
time
as
i
d
rehearse
every
race
i
d
ever
run
long
before
the
start
pistol
but
now
i
realize
this
be
no
race
there
be
a
primal
urge
to
compare
everything
life
business
adventure
of
all
sort
to
a
race
but
the
metaphor
be
often
inadequate
it
can
take
you
only
so
far
unable
to
remember
what
i
d
want
to
say
or
even
why
i
be
here
i
take
several
quick
breath
everything
depend
on
my
rise
to
this
occasion
everything
if
i
didn
t
if
i
muffed
this
i
d
be
doom
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
day
sell
encyclopedia
or
mutual
fund
or
some
other
junk
i
didn
t
really
care
about
i
d
be
a
disappointment
to
my
parent
my
school
my
hometown
myself
i
look
at
the
face
around
the
table
whenever
i
d
imagine
this
scene
i
d
omit
one
crucial
element
i
d
fail
to
foresee
how
present
world
war
ii
would
be
in
that
room
the
war
be
right
there
beside
us
between
us
attach
a
subtext
to
every
word
we
spoke
good
even
everyone
there
s
good
news
tonight
and
yet
it
also
wasn
t
there
through
their
resilience
through
their
stoic
acceptance
of
total
defeat
and
their
heroic
reconstruction
of
their
nation
the
japanese
have
put
the
war
cleanly
behind
them
also
these
executive
in
the
conference
room
be
young
like
me
and
you
could
see
that
they
felt
the
war
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
on
the
other
hand
their
father
and
uncle
have
try
to
kill
mine
on
the
other
hand
the
past
be
past
on
the
other
hand
that
whole
question
of
win
and
lose
which
cloud
and
complicates
so
many
deal
get
even
more
complicate
when
the
potential
winner
and
loser
have
recently
be
involve
albeit
via
proxy
and
ancestor
in
a
global
conflagration
all
of
this
interior
static
this
seesaw
confusion
about
war
and
peace
create
a
low
volume
hum
in
my
head
an
awkwardness
for
which
i

i
stood
before
the
little
mirror
on
my
bureau
in
the
servant
quarter
and
told
myself
it
s
official
you
re
back
and
yet
i
wasn
t
there
be
something
about
me
that
would
never
return
my
mother
notice
it
before
anyone
else
over
dinner
one
night
she
give
me
a
long
search
look
you
seem
more
worldly
worldly
i
thought
gosh
until
the
shoe
arrive
whether
or
not
the
shoe
ever
arrive
i
d
need
to
find
some
way
to
earn
cash
money
before
my
trip
i
d
have
that
interview
with
dean
witter
maybe
i
could
go
back
there
i
ran
it
by
my
father
in
the
tv
nook
he
stretch
out
in
his
vinyl
recliner
and
suggest
i
first
go
have
a
chat
with
his
old
friend
don
frisbee
ceo
of
pacific
power
light
i
knew
mr
frisbee
in
college
i
d
do
a
summer
internship
for
him
i
like
him
and
i
like
that
he
d
graduate
from
harvard
business
school
when
it
come
to
school
i
be
a
bit
of
a
snob
also
i
marvel
that
he
d
go
on
rather
quickly
to
become
ceo
of
a
new
york
stock
exchange
company
i
recall
that
he
welcome
me
warmly
that
spring
day
in
that
he
give
me
one
of
those
double
hand
handshake
and
lead
me
into
his
office
into
a
chair
across
from
his
desk
he
settle
into
his
big
high
back
leather
throne
and
raise
his
eyebrow
so
what
s
on
your
mind
honestly
mr
frisbee
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
about
or
with
a
job
or
career
weakly
i
add
my
life
i
say
i
be
think
of
go
to
dean
witter
or
else
maybe
come
back
to
the
electric
company
or
else
maybe
work
for
some
large
corporation
the
light
from
mr
frisbee
s
office
window
glint
off
his
rimless
glass
and
into
my
eye
like
the
sun
off
the
ganges
phil
he
say
those
be
all
bad
idea
sir
i
don
t
think
you
should
do
any
of
those
thing
oh
everyone
but
everyone
change
job
at
least
three
time
so
if
you
go
to
work
for
an
investment
firm
now
you
ll
eventually
leave
and
then
at
your
next
job
you
ll
have
to
start
all
over
if
you
go
work
for
some
big
company
son
same
deal
no
what
you
want
to
do
while
you
re
young
be
get
your
cpa
that
along
with
your
mba
will
put
a
solid
floor
under
your
earnings
then
when
you
change
job
which
you
will
trust
me
at
least
you
ll
maintain
your
salary
level
you
won
t
go
backward
that
sound
practical
i
certainly
didn
t
want
to
go
backward
i
hadn
t
major
in
accounting
however
i
need
nine
more
hour
to
even
qualify
to
take
the
exam
so
i
quickly
enrol
in
three
accounting
class
at
portland
state
more
school
my
father
grumble
bad
the

its
portland
branch

be
small
one
partner
three
junior
accountant
suit
me
i
thought
smallness
meant
the
firm
would
be
intimate
conducive
to
learn
and
it
do
start
out
that
way
my
first
assignment
be

my

over
his
book
but
i
be
too

fully
enjoy
it
the
trouble
with
a
small
satellite
branch
within
a

the

la
i

thought
to
blowing
my
brain
out

the
notice
arrive
right
around
christmas
so
i
must
have
driven
down
to
the
waterfront
warehouse
the
first
week
of
i
don
t
recall
exactly
i
know
it
be
early
morning
i
can
see
myself
get
there
before
the
clerk
unlocked
the
door
i
hand
them
the
notice
and
they
go
into
the
back
and
return
with
a
large
box
cover
in
japanese
write
i
race
home
scurry
down
to
the
basement
ripped
open
the
box
twelve
pair
of
shoe
creamy
white
with
blue
stripe
down
the
side
god
they
be
beautiful
they
be
more
than
beautiful
i
d
see
nothing
in
florence
or
paris
that
surpass
them
i
want
to
put
them
on
marble
pedestal
or
in
gilt
edge
frame
i
held
them
up
to
the
light
caress
them
as
sacred
object
the
way
a
writer
might
treat
a
new
set
of
notebook
or
a
baseball
player
a
rack
of
bat
then
i
sent
two
pair
to
my
old
track
coach
at
oregon
bill
bowerman
i
do
so
without
a
second
thought
since
it
be
bowerman
who
d
first
make
me
think
really
think
about
what
people
put
on
their
foot
bowerman
be
a
genius
coach
a
master
motivator
a
natural
leader
of
young
men
and
there
be
one
piece
of
gear
he
deem
crucial
to
their
development
shoe
he
be
obsess
with
how
human
being
be
shod
in
the
four
year
i
d
run
for
him
at
oregon
bowerman
be
constantly
sneak
into
our
locker
and
steal
our
footwear
he
d
spend
day
tear
them
apart
stitch
them
back
up
then
hand
them
back
with
some
minor
modification
which
make
us
either
run
like
deer
or
bleed
regardless
of
the
result
he
never
stop
he
be
determine
to
find
new
way
of
bolster
the
instep
cushion
the
midsole
building
out
more
room
for
the
forefoot
he
always
have
some
new
design
some
new
scheme
to
make
our
shoe
sleeker
softer
lighter
especially
lighter
one
ounce
slice
off
a
pair
of
shoe
he
say
be
equivalent
to
pound
over
one
mile
he
wasn
t
kid
his
math
be
solid
you
take
the
average
man
s
stride
of
six
foot
spread
it
out
over
a
mile
foot
you
get
step
remove
one
ounce
from
each
step
that
s
pound
on
the
button
lightness
bowerman
believe
directly
translate
to
less
burden
which
meant
more
energy
which
meant
more
speed
and
speed
equal
win
bowerman
didn
t
like
to
lose
i
get
it
from
him
thus
lightness
be
his
constant
goal
goal
be
put
it
kindly
in
quest
of
lightness
he
be
willing
to
try
anything
animal
vegetable
mineral
any
material
be
eligible
if
it
might
improve
on
the
standard
shoe
leather
of
the
day
that
sometimes
meant
kangaroo
skin
other
time
cod
you
haven
t
live
until
you
ve
compete
against
the
fast
runner
in
the
world
wear
shoe
make
of
cod
there
be
four
or
five
of
us
on
the
track
team
who
be
bowerman
s
podiatry
guinea
pig
but
i
be
his
pet
project
something
about
my
foot
spoke
to
him
something
about
my
stride
also
i
afford
a
wide
margin
of
error
i
wasn
t
the
best
on
the
team
not
by
a
long
shot
so
he
could
afford
to
make
mistake
on
me
with
my
more
talented
teammate
he
didn
t
dare
take
undue
chance
as
a
freshman
as
a
sophomore
as
a
junior
i
lose
count
of
how
many
race
i
ran
in
flat
or
spike
modify
by
bowerman
by
my
senior
year
he
be
make
all
my
shoe
from
scratch
naturally
i
believe
this
new
tiger
this
funny
little
shoe
from
japan
that
have
take
more
than
a
full
year
to
reach
me
would
intrigue
my
old
coach
of
course
it
wasn
t
as
light
as
his
cod
shoe
but
it
have
potential
the
japanese
be
promising
to
improve
it
well
yet
it
be
inexpensive
i
knew
this
would
appeal
to
bowerman
s
innate
frugality
even
the
shoe
s
name
struck
me
as
something
bowerman
might
flip
for
he
usually
call
his
runner
men
of
oregon
but
every
once
in
a
while
he
d
exhort
us
to
be
tiger
i
can
see
him
pace
the
locker
room
tell
us
before
a
race
be
tiger
out
there
if
you
weren
t
a
tiger
he
d
often
call
you
a
hamburger
now
and
then
when
we
complain
about
our
skimpy
prerace
meal
he
d
growl
a
tiger
hunt
best
when
he
s
hungry
with
any
luck
i
thought
coach
will
order
a
few
pair
of
tiger
for
his
tiger
but
whether
or
not
he
place
an
order
impress
bowerman
would
be
enough
that
alone
would
constitute
success
for
my
fledgling
company
it
s
possible
that
everything
i
do
in
those
day
be
motivate
by
some
deep
yearn
to
impress
to
please
bowerman
besides
my
father
there
be
no
man
whose
approval
i
crave
more
and
besides
my
father
there
be
no
man
who
give
it
less
often
frugality
carry
over
to
every
part
of
the
coach
s
makeup
he
weigh
and
hoard
word
of
praise
like
uncut
diamond
after
you
d
won
a
race
if
you
be
lucky
bowerman
might
say
nice
race
in
fact
that
s
precisely
what
he
say
to
one
of
his
miler
after
the
young
man
become
one
of
the
very
first
to
crack
the
mythical
four
minute
mark
in
the
united
state
more
likely
bowerman
would
say
nothing
he
d
stand
before
you
in
his
tweed
blazer
and
ratty
sweater
vest
his
string
tie
blowing
in
the
wind
his
batter
ball
cap
pull
low
and
nod
once
maybe
stare
those
ice
blue
eye
which
miss
nothing
give
nothing
everyone
talk
about
bowerman
s
dash
good
look
his
retro
crew
cut
his
ramrod
posture
and
plan
jawline
but
what
always
get
me
be
that
gaze
of
pure
violet
blue
it
get
me
on
day
one
from
the
moment
i
arrive
at
the
university
of
oregon
in
august
i
love
bowerman
and
fear
him
and
neither
of
these
initial
impulse
ever
go
away
they
be
always
there
between
us
i
never
stop
love
the
man
and
i
never
found
a
way
to
shed
the
old
fear
sometimes
the
fear
be
less
sometimes
more
sometimes
it
go
right
down
to
my
shoe
which
he
d
probably
cobble
with
his
bare
hand
love
and
fear
the
same
binary
emotion
govern
the
dynamic
between
me
and
my
father
i
wonder
sometimes
if
it
be
mere
coincidence
that
bowerman
and
my
father
both
cryptic
both
alpha
both
inscrutable
be
both
name
bill
and
yet
the
two
men
be
driven
by
different
demon
my
father
the
son
of
a
butcher
be
always
chase
respectability
whereas
bowerman
whose
father
have
be
governor
of
oregon
didn
t
give
a
darn
for
respectability
he
be
also
the
grandson
of
legendary
pioneer
men
and
woman
who
d
walk
the
full
length
of
the
oregon
trail
when
they
stop
walk
they
found
a
tiny
town
in
eastern
oregon
which
they
call
fossil
bowerman
spent
his
early
day
there
and
compulsively
return
part
of
his
mind
be
always
back
in
fossil
which
be
funny
because
there
be
something
distinctly
fossilize
about
him
hard
brown
ancient
he
possess
a
prehistoric
strain
of
maleness
a
blend
of
grit
and
integrity
and
calcify
stubbornness
that
be
rare
in
lyndon
johnson
s
america
today
it
s
all
but
extinct
he
be
a
war
hero
too
of
course
he
be
as
a
major
in
the
tenth
mountain
division
station
high
in
the
italian
alp
bowerman
have
shot
at
men
and
plenty
have
shot
back
his
aura
be
so
intimidate
i
don
t
recall
anyone
ever
ask
if
he
d
actually
kill
a
man
in
case
you
be
tempt
to
overlook
the
war
and
the
tenth
mountain
division
and
their
central
role
in
his
psyche
bowerman
always
carry
a
batter
leather
briefcase
with
a
roman
numeral
x
engrave
in
gold
on
the
side
the
most
famous
track
coach
in
america
bowerman
never
consider
himself
a
track
coach
he
detest
be
call
coach
give
his
background
his
makeup
he
naturally
thought
of
track
as
a
mean
to
an
end
he
call
himself
a
professor
of
competitive
response
and
his
job
as
he
saw
it
and
often
described
it
be
to
get
you
ready
for
the
struggle
and
competition
that
lay
ahead
far
beyond
oregon
despite
this
lofty
mission
or
perhaps
because
of
it
the
facility
at
oregon
be
spartan
dank
wooden
wall
locker
that
hadn
t
be
paint
in
decade
the
locker
have
no
door
just
slat
to
separate
your
stuff
from
the
next
guy
s
we
hung
our
clothes
on
nail
rusty
nail
we
sometimes
ran
without
sock
complain
never
cross
our
mind
we
saw
our
coach
as
a
general
to
be
obeyed
quickly
and
blindly
in
my
mind
he
be
patton
with
a
stopwatch
that
be
when
he
wasn
t
a
god
like
all
the
ancient
god
bowerman
live
on
a
mountaintop
his
majestic
ranch
sat
on
a
peak
high
above
the
campus
and
when
repose
on
his
private
olympus
he
could
be
vengeful
as
the
god
one
story
told
to
me
by
a
teammate
brought
this
fact
pointedly
home
apparently
there
be
a
truck
driver
who
often
dare
to
disturb
the
peace
on
bowerman
mountain
he
take
turn
too
fast
and
frequently
knock
over
bowerman
s
mailbox
bowerman
scold
the
trucker
threaten
to
punch
him
in
the
nose
and
so
forth
but
the
trucker
paid
no
heed
he
drove
as
he
pleased
day
after
day
so
bowerman
rig
the
mailbox
with
explosive
next
time
the
trucker
knock
it
over
boom
when
the
smoke
clear
the
trucker
found
his
truck
in
piece
its
tire
reduce
to
ribbon
he
never
again
touch
bowerman
s
mailbox
a
man
like
that
you
didn
t
want
to
get
on
his
wrong
side
especially
if
you
be
a
gangly
middle
distance
runner
from
the
portland
suburb
i
always
tiptoed
around
bowerman
even
so
he
d
often
lose
patience
with
me
though
i
remember
only
one
time
when
he
get
really
sore
i
be
a
sophomore
be
worn
down
by
my
schedule
class
all
morning
practice
all
afternoon
homework
all
night
one
day
fear
that
i
be
come
down
with
the
flu
i
stop
by
bowerman
s
office
to
say
that
i
wouldn
t
be
able
to
practice
that
afternoon
uh
huh

the
way

to
have
a
time
trial
today
i
be
close
to
tear
but
i
held
it
together
channel
all
my
emotion
into
my
run
and
post
one
of
my
best
time
of
the
year
as
i
walk
off
the
track
i
glower
at
bowerman
happy
now
you
son
of
a
he
look
at
me
checked
his
stopwatch
look
at
me
again
nod
he
d
test
me
he
d
broken
me
down
and
remade
me
just
like
a
pair
of
shoe
and
i
d
held
up
thereafter
i
be
truly
one
of
his
men
of
oregon
from
that
day
on
i
be
a
tiger
i
heard
back
right
away
from
bowerman
he
write
to
say
he
be
come
to
portland
the
follow
week
for
the
oregon

he
invite
me
to
lunch
at
the
cosmopolitan
hotel
where
the
team
would
be
stay
january
i
be
terribly
nervous
as
the
waitress
show
us
to
our
table
i
recall
that
bowerman
order
a
hamburger
and
i
say
croakily
make
it
two
we
spent
a
few
minute
catch
up
i
told
bowerman
about
my
trip
around
the
world
kobe
jordan
the
temple
of
nike
bowerman
be
especially
interested
in
my
time
in
italy
which
despite
his
brush
with
death
he
remember
fondly
at
last
he
come
to
the
point
those
japanese
shoe
he
say
they
re
pretty
good
how
about
let
me
in
on
the
deal
i
look
at
him
in
deal
it
take
me
a
moment
to
absorb
and
understand
what
he
be
say
he
didn
t
merely
want
to
buy
a
dozen
tiger
for
his
team
he
want
to
become
my
partner
have
god
spoken
from
the
whirlwind
and
ask
to
be
my
partner
i
wouldn
t
have
be
more
surprised
i
stammer
and
stutter
and
say
yes
i
put
out
my
hand
but
then
i
pull
it
back
what
kind
of
partnership
do
you
have
in
mind
i
ask
i
be
dare
to
negotiate
with
god
i
couldn
t
believe
my
nerve
nor
could
bowerman
he
look
bemuse
fifty
fifty
he
say
well
you
ll
have
to
put
up
half
the
money
of
course
i
figure
the
first
order
will
be
for
a
thousand
dollar
your
half
will
be
five
hundred
i
m
good
for
that
when
the
waitress
drop
off
the
check
for
the
two
hamburger
we
split
that
too
fifty
fifty
i
remember
it
as
the
next
day
or
maybe
sometime
in
the
next
few
day
or
week
and
yet
all
the
document
contradict
my
memory
letter
diary
appointment
book
they
all
definitively
show
it
take
place
much
later
but
i
remember
what
i
remember
and
there
must
be
a
reason
why
i
remember
it
the
way
i
do
as
we
left
the
restaurant
that
day
i
can
see
bowerman
put
on
his
ball
cap
i
can
see
him
straighten
his
string
tie
i
can
hear
him
say
i
ll
need
you
to
meet
my
lawyer
john
jaqua
he
can
help
us
get
this
in
write
either
way
day
later
week
later
year
later
the
meeting
happen
like
this
i
pull
up
to
bowerman
s
stone
fortress
and
marvel
as
i
always
do
at
the
set
remote
not
many
folk
make
it
out
there
along
coburg
road
to
mackenzie
drive
until
you
found
a
wind
dirt
lane
that
go
a
couple
mile
up
the
hill
into
the
wood
eventually
you
come
to
a
clearing
with
rosebush
solitary
tree
and
a
pleasant
house
small
but
solid
with
a
stone
face
bowerman
have
built
it
with
his
bare
hand
as
i
slip
my
valiant
into
park
i
wonder
how
on
earth
he
d
manage
all
that
backbreaking
labor
by
himself
the
man
who
move
a
mountain
begin
by
carry
away
small
stone
wrap
around
the
house
be
a
wide
wooden
porch
with
several
camp
chair
he
d
built
that
by
himself
too
it
afford
sweep
view
of
the
mckenzie
river
and
it
wouldn
t
have
take
much
convincing
to
have
me
believe
bowerman
have
laid
the
river
between
its
bank
as
well
now
i
saw
bowerman
stand
on
the
porch
he
squint
and
strode
down
the
step
toward
my
car
i
don
t
remember
a
lot
of
small
talk
as
he
get
in
i
just
slam
it
into
drive
and
set
a
course
for
his
lawyer
s
house
besides
be
bowerman
s
lawyer
and
best
friend
jaqua
be
his
next
door
neighbor
he
own
fifteen
hundred
acre
at
the
base
of
bowerman
s
mountain
prime
bottomland
right
on
the
mckenzie
drive
there
i
couldn
t
imagine
how
this
be
go
to
be
good
for
me
i
get
along
fine
with
bowerman
sure
and
we
have
ourselves
a
deal
but
lawyer
always
mess
thing
up
lawyer
specialized
in
mess
thing
up
and
best
friend
lawyer
bowerman
meanwhile
be
do
nothing
to
put
my
mind
at
ease
he
sat
ramrod
straight
and
watch
the
scenery
amid
the
boom
silence
i
kept
my
eye
on
the
road
and
mull
over
bowerman
s
eccentric
personality
which
carry
over
to
everything
he
do
he
always
go
against
the
grain
always
for
example
he
be
the
first
college
coach
in
america
to
emphasize
rest
to
place
as
much
value
on
recovery
as
on
work
but
when
he
work
you
brother
he
work
you
bowerman
s
strategy
for
run
the
mile
be
simple
set
a
fast
pace
for
the
first
two
lap
run
the
third
as
hard
as
you
can
then
triple
your
speed
on
the
fourth
there
be
a
zen
like
quality
to
this
strategy
because
it
be
impossible
and
yet
it
work
bowerman
coached
more
sub
four
minute
miler
than
anybody
ever
i
wasn
t
one
of
them
however
and
this
day
i
wonder
if
i
be
go
to
fall
short
once
again
in
that
crucial
final
lap
we
found
jaqua
stand
out
on
his
porch
i
d
met
him
before
at
a
track
meet
or
two
but
i
d
never
gotten
a
really
good
look
at

turn
to
stone

she
d
often
remind
them
in

up
my

simply
fill
all
the

the
day
my
sister
and
i
be
bickering
and
clamor
for
lunch
despite

a
savage
scream
and
hurl

out
of

perhaps
nothing

true
nature

frequent
drill

me

that
spring
i
post
the
best
time
of

too
surprised
by
my

next
move
when

my

way
of
dig
at
my
father
a
show
of
loyalty

only
son
an
affirmation
of
her
love

i
don
t
know
but
no
matter

never
fail
to
move
me
the
sight
of
her
stand
at
the
stove
or

kitchen
sink
cooking
dinner
or
wash
dish
in
a
pair
of
japanese
run
shoe

probably
because
he
didn
t
want
any
trouble
with
my
mother
my
father
loan
me
the
thousand
buck
this
time
the

warehouse
district
and

over
ten
enormous
carton
again
i
hurry
home
carry
the
carton
down
to
the
basement
ripped
them
open
each
carton
held
thirty
pair
of
tiger
and
each
pair
be
wrap
in
cellophane
shoe
box
would
have
be
too
costly
within
minute
the
basement
be
fill
with
shoe
i
admire
them
study
them
played
with
them
roll
around
on
top
of
them
then
i
stack
them
out
of
the
way
arrange
them
neatly
around
the
furnace
and
under
the
ping
pong
table
as
far
as
possible
from
the
washer
and
dryer
so
my
mother
could
still
do
laundry
lastly
i
try
on
a
pair
i
ran
circle
around
the
basement
i
jumped
for
joy
day
later
come
a
letter
from
mr

that
be
all
i
need
to
my
father
s
horror
and
my
mother
s
subversive
delight
i
quit
my
job
at
the
accounting
firm
and
all
that
spring
i
do
nothing
but
sell
shoe
out
of
the
trunk
of
my
valiant
my
sale
strategy
be
simple
and
i
thought
rather
brilliant
after
be
reject
by
a
couple
of
sport
good
store
kid
what
this
world
do
not
need
be
another
track
shoe
i
drove
all
over
the
pacific
northwest
to
various
track
meet
between
race
i
d
chat
up
the
coach
the
runner
the
fan
and
show
them
my
ware
the
response
be
always
the
same
i
couldn
t
write
order
fast
enough
drive
back
to
portland
i
d
puzzle
over
my
sudden
success
at
sell
i
d
be
unable
to
sell
encyclopedia
and
i
d
despise
it
to
boot
i
d
be
slightly
well
at
sell
mutual
fund
but
i
d
felt
dead
inside
so
why
be
sell
shoe
so
different
because
i
realize
it
wasn
t
sell
i
believe
in
run
i
believe
that
if
people
get
out
and
ran
a
few
mile
every
day
the
world
would
be
a
well
place
and
i
believe
these
shoe
be
well
to
run
in
people
sense
my
belief
want
some
of
that
belief
for
themselves
belief
i
decide
belief
be
irresistible
sometimes
people
want
my
shoe
so
badly
that
they
d
write
me
or
phone
me
say
they

about
the
new
tiger
and
just
have
to
have
a
pair

i
please
send
them
cod
without
my
even
try
my
mail
order
business
be
born
sometimes
people
would
simply
show
up
at
my
parent
house
every
few
night
the
doorbell
would
ring
and
my
father
grumble
would
get
up
from
his
vinyl
recliner
and
turn
down
the
tv
and
wonder
who
in
the
world
there
on
the
porch
would
be
some
skinny
kid
with
oddly
muscular
leg
shifty
eyed
and
twitchy
like
a
junky
look
to
score
buck
here
the
kid
would
say
my
father
would
call
through
the
kitchen
to
my
room
in
the
servant
quarter
i
d
come
out
invite
the
kid
in
show
him
over
to
the
sofa
then
kneel
before
him
and
measure
his
foot

out
that
mr

be
something
of
a
celebrity
before
become
a
high
school
wrestling
coach
he
d
be
a
model
one
of
the
original
marlboro
men
beautiful
i
thought
just
what
i
need
a
piss
match
with
some
mythic
american
cowboy
i
go
into
a
deep
funk
i
become
such
a
grouch
such
poor
company
the
girlfriend
fell
away
each
night
i
d
sit
with
my
family
at
dinner
move
my
mother
s
pot
roast
and
vegetable
around
my
plate
then
i
d
sit
with
my
father
in
the
nook
star
glumly
at
the
tv
buck
my
father
say
you
look
like
someone
hit
you
in
the
back
of
the
head
with
a
two
by
four
snap
out
of
it
but
i
couldn
t
i
kept
go
over
my
meeting
at
onitsuka
the
executive
have
show
me
such
kei
they
d
bow
to
me
and
vice
versa
i
d
be
straightforward
with
them
honest
for
the
most
part
sure
i
hadn
t
technically
own
a
business
call
blue
ribbon
but
that
be
splitting
hair
i
own
one
now
and
it
have
single
handedly
brought
tiger
to
the
west
coast
and
it
could
sell
tiger
ten
time
faster
if
onitsuka
give
me
half
a
chance
instead
the
company
be
go
to
cut
me
out
throw
me
over
for
the
fricking
marlboro
man
come
to
where
the
flavor
be
toward
summer
s
end
i
still
hadn
t
heard
from
onitsuka
and
i
d
all
but
give
up
on
the
idea
of
sell
shoe
labor
day
however
i
have
a
change
of
heart
i
couldn
t
give
up
not
yet
and
not
give
up
meant
fly
back
to
japan
i
need
to
force
a
showdown
with
onitsuka
i
ran
the
idea
by
my
father
he
still
didn
t
like
me
jackassing
around
with
shoe
but
what
he
really
didn
t
like
be
someone
mistreat
his
son
he
furrow
his
brow
you
should
probably
go
he
say
i
talk
it
over
with
my
mother
no
probablys
about
it
she
say
in
fact
she
d
drive
me
to
the
airport
fifty
year
later
i
can
see
us
in
that
car
i
can
recall
every
detail
it
be
a
bright
clear
day
no
humidity
temperature
in
the
low
eighty
both
of
us
quietly
watch
the
sunlight
play
across
the
windshield
say
nothing
the
silence
between
us
be
like
the
silence
on
the
many
day
she
drove
me
to
meet
i
be
too
busy
fight
my
nerve
to
talk
and
she
well
than
anyone
understood
she
respect
the
line
we
draw
around
ourselves
in
crisis
then
as
we
near
the
airport
she
broke
the
silence
just
be
yourself
she
say
i
look
out
the
window
be
myself
really
be
that
my
best
option
to
study
the
self
be
to
forget
the
self
i
look
down
i
certainly
wasn
t
dress
like
myself
i
be
wear
a
new
suit
a
proper
charcoal
gray
and
tot
a
small
suitcase
in
the
side
pocket
be
a
new
book
how
to
do
business
with
the
japanese
heaven
only
know
how
or
where
i
d
heard
about
it
and
now
i
grimace
to
remember
this
last
detail
i
be
also
wear
a
black
bowler
hat
i
d
bought
it
expressly
for
this
trip
think
it
make
me
look
old
in
fact
it
make
me
look
mad
stark
star
mad
as
if
i
d
escape
from
a
victorian
insane
asylum
inside
a
painting
by
magritte
i
spent
most
of
the
flight
memorize
how
to
do
business
with
the
japanese
when
my
eye
grow
tire
i
shut
the
book
and
star
out
the
window
i
try
to
talk
to
myself
to
coach
myself
up
i
told
myself
that
i
need
to
put
aside
hurt
feeling
put
aside
all
thought
of
injustice
which
would
only
make
me
emotional
and
keep
me
from
think
clearly
emotion
would
be
fatal
i
need
to
remain
cool
i
thought
back
on
my
run
career
at
oregon
i
d
compete
with
and
against
men
far
well
faster
more
physically
gift
many
be
future
olympian
and
yet
i
d
train
myself
to
forget
this
unhappy
fact
people
reflexively
assume
that
competition
be
always
a
good
thing
that
it
always
brings
out
the
best
in
people
but
that
s
only
true
of
people
who
can
forget
the
competition
the
art
of
compete
i
d
learn
from
track
be
the
art
of
forget
and
i
now
remind
myself
of
that
fact
you
must
forget
your
limit
you
must
forget
your
doubt
your
pain
your
past
you
must
forget
that
internal
voice
scream
beg
not
one
more
step
and
when
it
s
not
possible
to
forget
it
you
must
negotiate
with
it
i
thought
over
all
the
race
in
which
my
mind
want
one
thing
and
my
body
want
another
those
lap
in
which
i
d
have
to
tell
my
body
yes
you
raise
some
excellent
point
but
let
s
keep
go
anyway
despite
all
my
negotiation
with
that
voice
the
skill
have
never
come
naturally
and
now
i
fear
that
i
be
out
of
practice
as
the
plane
swoop
down
toward
haneda
airport
i
told
myself
that
i
d
need
to
summon
the
old
skill
quickly
or
lose
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
lose
the
olympics
be
about
to
be
held
in
japan
so
i
have
my
pick
of
brand
new
reasonably
price
lodging
in
kobe
i
get
a
room
right
downtown
at
the
newport
which
feature
a
revolve
restaurant
on
the
top
just
like
the
one
atop
the
space
needle
a
touch
of
the
great
northwest
to
settle
my
nerve
before
unpack
i
phone
onitsuka
and
left
a
message
i
m
here
and
i
request
a
meeting
then
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
star
at
the
phone
at
last
it
rang
a
prim
sound

my
hotel

tomorrow

i
go
to
bed
early
slept
fitfully
dream
of
car
chase
prison
duel
the
same
dream
that
always
plague
me
the
night
before
a
big
meet
or
date
or
exam

rise
at
dawn

a
breakfast
of
raw
egg
pour
over
hot
rice
and
some
grill
fish
and
wash
it
down
with
a
pot
of
green
tea
then
recite
memorize
passage
from
how
to
do
business
with
the
japanese
i
shave
my
pale
jaw
i
cut
myself
once
or
twice
and
have
trouble
stop
the
bleeding
i
must
have
be
a
sight
finally
i
put
on
my
suit
and
shamble
onto
the
elevator
as
i
press
the
button
for
the
top
floor
i
notice
that
my
hand
be
white
as

morimoto
arrive
on
time
he
be
about
my
age
but
far
more
mature
more
self
assure
he
wore
a
rumple
sport
coat
and
have
a
kind
of
rumple
face
we
sat
at
a
table
by
the
window
immediately
before
the
waiter
come
to
take
our
order
i
launch
into
my
pitch
say
everything
i
d
vowed
not
to
say
i
told
morimoto
how
distressed
i
be
by
this
marlboro
man
encroach
on
my
turf
i
say
i
d
be
under
the
impression
that
i
d
make
a
personal
connection
with
the
executive
i
d
met
the
previous
year
and
the
impression
be
underscored
by
a
letter
from
mr
miyazaki
say
the
thirteen
western
state
be
exclusively
mine
i
be
therefore
at
a
loss
to
explain
this
treatment
i
appeal
to
morimoto
s
sense
of
fairness
to
his
sense
of
honor
he
look
uncomfortable
so
i
take
a
breath
pause
i
raise
it
from
the
personal
to
the
professional
i
cite
my
robust
sale
i
drop
the
name
of
my
partner
the
legendary
coach
whose
reputation
have
cachet
even
on
the
other
side
of
the
pacific
i
emphasize
all
that
i
might
do
for
onitsuka
in
the
future
if
give
a
chance
morimoto
take
a
sip
of
tea
when
it
be
clear
that
i
d
talk
myself
out
he
set
down
his
cup
and
look
out
the
window
slowly
we
rotate
above

the
window
watch
the
ship
bobbing
on
kobe

dark
purple
bay
beautiful

i
thought
too
bad
all
beauty
be
beyond
me
the
world
be
without
beauty
when
you
lose
and
i
be
about
to
lose
big
time
i
knew
that
in
the
morning
morimoto
would
tell
me
he
be
sorry
nothing
personal
it
be
just

nationwide
but

mr

the
uncharmable
knight

my
shy
mother
my
autocratic
father
they

no
match
for
her
especially
my
father
when
she
shook
his
hand
she
melt
something
hard
at
his
core
maybe
it

the
candy
bar
people
and
all
their
mogul
friend
she
have
the
kind
of
self
confidence
you
run
across
once
or
twice
in

certainly
the
only
person
i
d

casually
drop
babe
paley
and
hermann

book
about
him
one
day

worldwide
headquarters
of

in
the
basement
and

operation
i
give
her
a
pair
of
limber
ups
she
wore
them
when
we
drove
out
to
the
coast

go
hike
up

mountain
and

bereft
i
write
her
every
other
day
my
first
ever
love
letter
dear
sarah
i
think
about
sit
beside
that
torii
gate
with
you
she
always
write
back
right
away
she
always
express
her
undying
love
that
christmas
she

this
time
i
picked
her
up
at
the
airport
on
the
way
to
my
house
she
told
me
that
there
have
be
a
terrible
row
before
she
get
on
the
plane
her
parent
forbade
her
to

they
didn
t
approve
of
me
my
father
scream

say
what
do

scream
i
ask
she

his
voice
you
can
t
meet
a
guy
on
mount
fuji
who
s
go
to
amount
to
anything
i
wince
i
knew
i
have
two
strike
against
me
but
i
didn
t
realize
climb
mount
fuji
be
one
of
them
what
be
so
bad
about
climb
mount
fuji
how
do
you
get
away
i
ask
my
brother
he
snuck
me
out
of
the
house
early
this
morning
and
drove
me
to
the
airport
i
wonder
if
she
really
love
me
or
just
saw
me
as
a
chance
to
rebel
during
the
day
while
i
be
busy
work
on
blue
ribbon
stuff
sarah
would
hang
out
with
my
mother
at
night
she
and
i
would
go
downtown
for
dinner
and
drink
on
the
weekend
we
ski
mount
hood
when
it
be
time
for
her
to
return
home
i
be
bereft
again
dear
sarah

love
you
she
write
back
right
away
she
miss
me
too
she
love
me
too
then
with
the
winter
rain
there
be
a
slight
cool
in
her
letter
they
be
less
effusive
or
so
i
thought
maybe
it
s
just
my
imagination
i
told
myself
but
i
have
to
know
i
phone
her
it
wasn
t
my
imagination
she
say
she
d
give
it
a
lot
of
thought
and
she
wasn
t
sure
we
be
right
for
each
other
she
wasn
t
sure
i
be
sophisticated
enough
for
her
sophisticated
that
be
the
word
she
use
before
i
could
protest
before
i
could
negotiate
she
hung
up
i
take
out
a
piece
of
paper
and
typed
her
a
long
letter
beg
her
to
reconsider
she
write
back
right
away
no
sale
the
new
shipment
of
shoe
arrive
from
onitsuka
i
could
hardly
bring
myself
to
care
i
spent
week
in
a
fog
i
hid
in
the
basement
i
hid
in
the
servant
quarter
i
lay
on
my
bed
and
star
at
my
blue
ribbon
though
i
didn
t
tell
them
my
family
knew
they
didn
t
ask
for
detail
they
didn
t
need
them
or
want
them
except
my
sister
jeanne
while
i
be
out
one
day
she
go
into
the
servant
quarter
and
into
my
desk
and
found
sarah
s
letter
later
when
i
come
home
and
go
down
to
the
basement
jeanne
come
and
found
me
she
sat
on
the
floor
beside
me
and
say
she
d
read
the
letter
all
of
them
carefully
conclude
with
the
final
rejection
i
look
away
you
re
well
off
without
her
jeanne
say
my
eye
fill
with
tear
i
nod
thanks
not
know
what
to
say
i
ask
jeanne
if
she
d
like
to
do
some
part
time
work
for
blue
ribbon
i
be
pretty
far
behind
and
i
could
sure
use
some
help
since
you
re
so
interested
in
mail
i
say
hoarsely
maybe
you
d
enjoy
do
some
secretarial
work
dollar
and
a
half
an
hour
she
chuckle
and
thus
my
sister
become
the
first
ever
employee
of
blue
ribbon

i
get
a
letter
from
that
jeff
johnson
fellow
at
the
start
of
the
year
after
our
chance
meeting
at
occidental
i
d
sent
him
a
pair
of
tiger
as
a
gift
and
now
he
write
to
say
that
he
d
try
them
on
and
go
for
a
run
he
like
them
he
say
he
like
them
a
whole
lot
others
like
them
too
people
kept
stop
him
and
point
at
his
foot
and
ask
where
they
could
buy
some
neat
shoe
like
those
johnson
have
gotten
married
since
i
last
saw
him
he
say
and
there
be
already
a
baby
on
the
way
so
he
be
look
for
way
to
earn
extra
cash
apart
from
his
gig
as
a
social
worker
and
this
tiger
shoe
seem
to
have
more
upside
than
adidas
i
write
him
back
and
offer
him
a
post
as
a
commission
salesman
meaning
i
d
give
him
for
each
pair
of
run
shoe
he
sell
two
buck
for
each
pair
of
spike
i
be
just
begin
to
put
together
a
crew
of
part
time
sale
rep
and
that
be
the
standard
rate
i
be
offering
he
write
back
right
away
accept
the
offer
and
then
the
letter
didn
t
stop
on
the
contrary
they
increase
in
length
and
number
at
first
they
be
two
page
then
four
then
eight
at
first
they
come
every
few
day
then
they
come
faster
and
faster
tumble
almost
daily
through
the
mail
slot
like
a
waterfall
each
one
with
that
same
return
address
p
o
box
seal
beach
ca
until
i
wonder
what
in
god
s
name
i
d
do
in
hire
this
guy
i
like
his
energy
of
course
and
it
be
hard
to
fault
his
enthusiasm
but
i
begin
to
worry
that
he
might
have
too
much
of
each
with
the
twentieth
letter
or
the
twenty
fifth
i
begin
to
worry
that
the
man
might
be
unhinged
i
wonder
why
everything
be
so
breathless
i
wonder
if
he
be
ever
go
to
run
out
of
thing
he
urgently
need
to
tell
me
or
ask
me
i
wonder
if
he
be
ever
go
to
run
out
of
stamp
every
time
a
thought
cross
johnson
s
mind
seemingly
he
write
it
down
and
stuck
it
into
an
envelope
he
write
to
tell
me
how
many
tiger
he
d
sell
that
week
he
write
to
tell
me
how
many
tiger
he
d
sell
that
day
he
write
to
tell
me
who
d
worn
tiger
at
which
high
school
meet
and
in
what
place
they
d
finish
he
write
to
say
that
he
want
to
expand
his
sale
territory
beyond
california
to
include
arizona
and
possibly
new
mexico
he
write
to
suggest
that
we
open
a
retail
store
in
los
angeles
he
write
to
tell
me
that
he
be
consider
place
ad
in
run
magazine
and
what
do
i
think
he
write
to
inform
me
that
he
d
place
those
ad
in
run
magazine
and
the
response
be
good
he
write
to
ask
why
i
hadn
t
answer
any
of
his
previous
letter
he
write
to
plead
for
encouragement
he
write
to
complain
that
i
hadn
t
respond
to
his
previous
plea
for
encouragement
i
d
always
consider
myself
a
conscientious
correspondent
i
d
sent
countless
letter
and
postcard
home
during
my
trip
around
the
world
i
d
write
faithfully
to
sarah
and
i
always
meant
to
answer
johnson
s
letter
but
before
i
get
around
to
it
there
be
always
another
one
wait
something
about
the
sheer
volume
of
his
correspondence
stop
me
something
about
his
neediness
make
me
not
want
to
encourage
him
many
night
i
d
sit
down
at
the
black
royal
typewriter
in
my
basement
workshop
curl
a
piece
of
paper
into
the
roller
and
type

jeff
then
i
d

a
blank
i
wouldn
t
know
where
to
begin
which
of
his
fifty
question
to
start
with
so
i
d
get
up

to
other
thing
and
the
next
day
there

yet

the
way
to
the
bottom
but

people
person
in
fact
he
d
always
seem
somewhat
misanthropic
it
be
one
of
the
thing
i
d
like
about
him
in
april
he
write
to
say
he
d
quit
his
day
job
he
d
always
hat
it
he
say
but
the
last
straw
have
be
a
distressed
woman
in
the
san
fernando
valley
he
d
be
schedule
to
check
on
her
because
she
d
threaten
to
kill
herself
but
he
d
phone
her
first
to
ask
if
she
really
be
go
to
kill
herself
that
day
if
so
he
didn
t
want
to
waste
the
time
and
gas
money
drive
all
the
way
out
to
the
valley
the
woman
and
johnson
s
superior
take
a
dim
view
of
his
approach
they
deem
it
a
sign
that
johnson
didn
t
care
johnson
deem
it
the
same
way
he
didn
t
care
and
in
that
moment
johnson
write
me
he
understood
himself
and
his
destiny
social
work
wasn
t
it
he
wasn
t
put
here
on
this
earth
to
fix
people
s
problem
he
prefer
to
focus
on
their
foot
in
his
heart
of
heart
johnson
believe
that
runner
be
god
s
chosen
that
run
do
right
in
the
correct
spirit
and
with
the
proper
form
be
a
mystical
exercise
no
less
than
meditation
or
prayer
and
thus
he
felt
call
to
help
runner
reach
their
nirvana
i
d
be
around
runner
much
of
my
life
but
this
kind
of
dewy
romanticism
be
something
i
d
never
encounter
not
even
the
yahweh
of
run
bowerman
be
as
pious
about
the
sport
as
blue
ribbon
s
part
time
employee
number
two
in
fact
in
run
wasn
t
even
a
sport
it
wasn
t
popular
it
wasn
t
unpopular
it
just
be
to
go
out
for
a
three
mile
run
be
something
weirdo
do
presumably
to
burn
off
manic
energy
run
for
pleasure
run
for
exercise
run
for
endorphin
run
to
live
well
and
longer
these
thing
be
unheard
of
people
often
go
out
of
their
way
to
mock
runner
driver
would
slow
down
and
honk
their
horn
get
a
horse
they
d
yell
throw
a
beer
or
soda
at
the
runner
s
head
johnson
have
be
drench
by
many
a
pepsi
he
want
to
change
all
this
he
want
to
help
all
the
oppress
runner
of
the
world
to
bring
them
into
the
light
enfold
them
in
a
community
so
maybe
he
be
a
social
worker
after
all
he
just
want
to
socialize
exclusively
with
runner
above
all
johnson
want
to
make
a
living
do
it
which
be
next
to
impossible
in
in
me
in
blue
ribbon
he
thought
he
saw
a
way
i
do
everything
i
could
to
discourage
johnson
from
think
like
this
at
every
turn
i
try
to
dampen
his
enthusiasm
for
me
and
my
company
besides
not
write
back
i
never
phone
never
visit
never
invite
him
to
oregon
i
also
never
miss
an
opportunity
to
tell
him
the
unvarnished
truth
in
one
of
my
rare
reply
to
his
letter
i
put
it
flatly
though
our
growth
have
be
good
i
owe
first
national
bank
of
oregon
cash
flow
be
negative
he
write
back
immediately
ask
if
he
could
work
for
me
full
time
i
want
to
be
able
to
make
it
on
tiger
and
the
opportunity
would
exist
for
me
to
do
other
thing
as
well
run
school
not
to
mention
be
my
own
bos
i
shook
my
head
i
tell
the
man
blue
ribbon
be
sinking
like
the
titanic
and
he
responds
by
beg
for
a
berth
in
first
class
oh
well
i
thought
if
we
do
go
down
misery
love
company
so
in
the
late
summer
of
i
write
and
accepted
johnson
s
offer
to
become
the
first
full
time
employee
of
blue
ribbon
we
negotiate
his
salary
via
the
mail
he
d
be
make
a
month
as
a
social
worker
but
he
say
he
could
live
on
i
agree
reluctantly
it
seem
exorbitant
but
johnson
be
so
scatter
so
flighty
and
blue
ribbon
be
so
tenuous
one
way
or
another
i
figure
it
be
temporary
as
ever
the
accountant
in
me
saw
the
risk
the
entrepreneur
saw
the
possibility
so
i
split
the
difference
and
kept
move
forward
and
then
i
stop
think
about
johnson
altogether
i
have
big
problem
at
the
moment
my
banker
be
upset
with
me
after
post
eight
thousand
dollar
in
sale
in
my
first
year
i
be
project
sixteen
thousand
dollar
in
my
second
year
and
accord
to
my
banker
this
be
a
very
trouble
trend
a
one
hundred
percent
increase
in
sale
be
trouble
i
ask
your
rate
of
growth
be
too
fast
for
your
equity
he
say
how
can
such
a
small
company
grow
too
fast
if
a
small
company
grows
fast
it
build
up
its
equity
it
s
all
the
same
principle
regardless
of
size
he
say

dangerous
life
be
growth
i
say
business
be
growth
you
grow
or
you
die
that
s
not
how
we
see
it
you
might
as
well
tell
a
runner
in
a
race
that
he
s
run
too
fast
apple
and
orange
your
head
be
full
of
apple
and
orange
i
want
to
say
it
be
textbook
to
me
grow
sale
plus
profitability
plus
unlimited
upside
equal
quality
company
in
those
day
however
commercial
bank
be
different
from
investment
bank
their
myopic
focus
be
cash
balance
they
want
you
to
never
ever
outgrow
your
cash
balance
again
and
again
i
d
gently
try
to
explain
the
shoe
business
to
my
banker
if
i
don
t
keep
grow
i
d
say
i
won
t
be
able
to
persuade
onitsuka
that
i
m
the
best
man
to
distribute
their
shoe
in
the
west
if
i
can
t
persuade
onitsuka
that
i
m
the
best
they
ll
find
some
other
marlboro
man
to
take
my
place
and
that
doesn
t
even
take
into
account
the
battle
with
the
big
monster
out
there
adidas
my
banker
be
unmoved
unlike
athena
he
do
not
admire
my
eye
of
persuasion
mr
knight
he
d
say
again
and
again
you
need
to
slow
down
you
don
t
have
enough
equity
for
this
kind
of
growth
equity
how
i
be
begin
to
loathe
this
word
my
banker
use
it
over
and
over
until
it
become
a
tune
i
couldn
t
get
out
of
my
head
equity
i
heard
it
while
brushing
my
teeth
in
the
morning
equity
i
heard
it
while
punch
my
pillow
at
night
equity
i
reach
the
point
where
i
refuse
to
even
say
it
aloud
because
it
wasn
t
a
real
word
it
be
bureaucratic
jargon
a
euphemism
for
cold
hard
cash
of
which
i
have
none
purposely
any
dollar
that
wasn
t
nail
down
i
be
plow
directly
back
into
the
business
be
that
so
rash
to
have
cash
balance
sit
around
do
nothing
make
no
sense
to
me
sure
it
would
have
be
the
cautious
conservative
prudent
thing
but
the
roadside
be
litter
with
cautious
conservative
prudent
entrepreneur
i
want
to
keep
my
foot
press
hard
on
the
gas
pedal
somehow
in
meeting
after
meeting
i
held
my
tongue
everything
my
banker
say
i
ultimately
accepted
then
i
d
do
exactly
as
i
pleased
i
d
place
another
order
with
onitsuka
double
the
size
of
the
previous
order
and
show
up
at
the
bank
all
wide
eyed
innocence
ask
for
a
letter
of
credit
to
cover
it
my
banker
would
always
be
shock
you
want
how
much
and
i
d
always
pretend
to
be
shock
that
he
be
shock
i
thought
you
d
see
the
wisdom
i
d
wheedle
grovel
negotiate
and
eventually
he
d
approve
my
loan
after
i
d
sell
out
the
shoe
and
repaid
the
borrowing
in
full
i
d
do
it
all
over
again
place
a
mega
order
with
onitsuka
double
the
size
of
the
previous
order
then
go
to
the
bank
in
my
best
suit
an
angelic
look
on
my
face
my
banker
s
name
be
harry
white
fiftyish
avuncular
with
a
voice
like
a
handful
of
gravel
in
a
blender
he
didn
t
seem
to
want
to
be
a
banker
and
he
particularly
didn
t
want
to
be
my
banker
he
inherit
me
by
default
my
first
banker
have
be
ken
curry
but
when
my
father
refuse
to
be
my
guarantor
curry
phone
him
straightaway
between
us
bill
if
the
kid
s
company
go
under
you
ll
still
back
him
right
hell
no
my
father
say
so
curry
decide
he
want
no
part
of
this
father
son
internecine
war
and
turn
me
over
to
white
white
be
a
vice
president
at
first
national
but
this
title
be
mislead
he
didn
t
have
much
power
the
boss
be
always
look
over
his
shoulder
second
guess
him
and
the
bossiest
of
boss
be
a
man
name
bob
wallace
it
be
wallace
who
make
life
difficult
for
white
and
thereby
for
me
it
be
wallace
who
fetishize
equity
and
pooh
poohed
growth
squarely
built
with
a
thuggish
face
and
nixonian
five
o
clock
shadow
wallace
be
ten
year
my
senior
but
somehow
thought
himself
the
bank
s
boy
wonder
he
be
also
determine
to
become
the
bank
s
next
president
and
he
view
all
bad
credit
risk
as
the
main
roadblock
between
him
and
that
goal
he
didn
t
like
give
credit
to
anyone
for
anything
but
with
my
balance
hover
always
around
zero
he
saw
me
as
a
disaster
wait
to
happen
one
slow
season
one
downturn
in
sale
i
d
be
out
of
business
the
lobby
of
wallace
s
bank
would
be
fill
with
my
unsold
shoe
and
the
holy
grail
of
bank
president
would
slip
from
his
grasp
like
sarah
atop
mount
fuji
wallace
saw
me
as
a
rebel
but
he
didn
t
think
of
this
as
a
compliment
nor
in
the
end
come
to
think
of
it
have
she
of
course
wallace
didn
t
always
say
all
this
directly
to
me
it
be
often
conveyed
by
his
middleman
white
white
believe
in
me
and
in
blue
ribbon
but
he
d
tell
me
all
the
time
with
a
sad
head
shake
that
wallace
make
the
decision
wallace
sign
the
check
and
wallace
be
no
fan
of
phil
knight
i
thought
it
be
fitting
and
tell
and
hopeful
that
white
would
use
that
word
fan
he
be
tall
lean
a
former
athlete
who
love
to
talk
sport
no
wonder
we
saw
eye
to
eye
wallace
on
the
other
hand
look
as
if
he
d
never
set
foot
on
a
ball
field
unless
maybe
to
repossess
the
equipment
what
sweet
satisfaction
it
would
have
be
to
tell
wallace
where
he
could
shove
his
equity
then
storm
out
and
take
my
business
elsewhere
but
in
there
be
no
elsewhere
first
national
bank
be
the
only
game
in
town
and
wallace
knew
it
oregon
be
small
back
then
and
it
have
just
two
bank
first
national
and
u
s
bank
the
latter
have
already
turn
me
down
if
i
get
thrown
out
of
the
former
i
d
be
do
today
you
can
live
in
one
state
and
bank
in
another
no
problem
but
banking
regulation
be
much
tighter
in
those
day
also
there
be
no
such
thing
as
venture
capital
an
aspire
young
entrepreneur
have
very
few
place
to
turn
and
those
place
be
all
guard
by
risk
averse
gatekeeper
with
zero
imagination
in
other
word
banker
wallace
be
the
rule
not
the
exception
to
make
everything
more
difficult
onitsuka
be
always
late
shipping
my
shoe
which
meant
less
time
to
sell
which
meant
less
time
to
make
enough
money
to
cover
my
loan
when
i
complain
onitsuka
didn
t
answer
when
they
do
answer
they
fail
to
appreciate
my
quandary
time
and
again
i
d
send
them
a
frantic
telex
inquire
about
the
whereabouts
of
the
late
shipment
and
in
response
i
d
typically
get
a
telex
that
be
maddeningly
obtuse
little
more
day
it
be
like
dial
and
hearing
someone
on
the
other
end
yawn
give
all
these
problem
give
blue
ribbon
s
cloudy
future
i
decide
that
i
d
well
get
a
real
job
something
safe
to

i
d
met

knew

who

a

with

to
the

born
in

of
otherwise
unspectacular
four

the

from

rhapsodic

demotic
truth

prediction
hayes
could
use
number
to
tell
the

day
after
day
i
watch
hayes
do
something
i
d
never
thought
possible
he
make
accounting
an
art
which
meant
he
and
i
and
all
of
us
be
artist
it
be
a
wonderful
thought
an
ennoble
thought
one
that
would
have
never
occur
to
me
intellectually
i
always
knew
that
number
be
beautiful
on
some
level
i
understood
that
number
represent
a
secret
code
that
behind
every
row
of
number
lay
ethereal
platonic
form
my
accounting
class
have
taught
me
that
sort
of
as
have
sport
run
track
give
you
a
fierce
respect
for
number
because
you
be
what
your
number
say
you
be
nothing
more
nothing
less
if
i
post
a
bad
time
in
a
race
there
might
have
be
reason
injury
fatigue
broken
heart
but
no
one
care
my
number
in
the
end
be
all
that
anyone
would
remember
i
d
live
this
reality
but
hayes
the
artist
make
me
feel
it
ala
i
come
to
fear
that
hayes
be
the
tragic
kind
of
artist
the
self
sabotage
van
gogh
kind
he
undercut
himself
at
the
firm
every
day
by
dress
badly
slouch
badly
behaving
badly
he
also
have
an
array
of
phobia
height
snake
bug
confine
space
which
could
be
off
put
to
his
boss
and
colleague
but
he
be
most
phobic
about
diet
price
waterhouse
would
have
make
hayes
a
partner
without
hesitation
despite
all
his
many
vice
but
the
firm
couldn
t
overlook
his
weight
it
wasn
t
go
to
tolerate
a
three
hundred
pound
partner
more
than
likely
it
be
this
unhappy
fact
that
make
hayes
eat
so
much
in
the
first
place
whatever
the
reason
he
ate
a
lot
by
he
drank
as
much
as
he
ate
which
be
say
a
lot
and
he
refuse
to
drink
alone
come
quit
time
he
d
insist
that
all
his
junior
accountant
join
him
he
talk
like
he
drank
nonstop
and
some
of
the
other
accountant
call
him
uncle
remus
but
i
never
do
i
never
roll
my
eye
at
hayes
s
stem
winder
each
story
contain
some
gem
of
wisdom
about
business
what
make
company
work
what
the
ledger
of
a
company
really
meant
thus
many
night
i
d
voluntarily
even
eagerly
enter
some
portland
dive
and
match
hayes
round
for
round
shot
for
shot
in
the
morning
i
d
wake
feel
sicker
than
i
have
in
that
hammock
in
calcutta
and
it
would
take
all
my
self
discipline
to
be
of
any
use
to
price
waterhouse
it
didn
t
help
that
when
i
wasn
t
a
foot
soldier
in
hayes
s
army
i
be
still
serve
in
the
reserve
a
seven
year
commitment
tuesday
night
from
seven
to
ten
i
have
to
throw
a
switch
in
my
brain
and
become
first
lieutenant
knight
my
unit
be
compose
of
longshoreman
and
we
be
often
station
in
the
warehouse
district
a
few
football
field
away
from
where
i
picked
up
my
shipment
from
onitsuka
most
night
my
men
and
i
would
load
and
unload
ship
maintain
jeep
and
truck
many
night
we
d
do
pt
physical
training
push
ups
pull
ups
sit
ups
run
i
remember
one
night
i
lead
my
company
on
a
four
mile
run
i
need
to
sweat
out
the
booze
from
a
hayes
binge
so
i
set
a
kill
pace
and
steadily
increase
it
grind
myself
and
the
men
to
dust
after
i
overheard
one
pant
soldier
tell
another
i
be
listen
real
close
as
lieutenant
knight
count
cadence
i
never
once
heard
that
man
take
a
deep
breath
it
be
perhaps
my
only
triumph
of
some
tuesday
night
in
the
reserve
be
set
aside
for
classroom
time
instructor
would
talk
to
us
about
military
strategy
which
i
found
rivet
the
instructor
would
often
begin
class
by
dissect
some
long
ago
famous
battle
but
invariably
they
would
drift
off
topic
onto
vietnam
the
conflict
be
get
hotter
the
united
state
be
be
drawn
toward
it
inexorably
as
if
by
a
giant
magnet
one
instructor
told
us
to
get
our
personal
life
in
order
kiss
our
wife
and
girlfriend
good
bye
we
be
go
to
be
in
the
shit
real
soon
i
have
grown
to
hate
that
war
not
simply
because
i
felt
it
be
wrong
i
also
felt
it
be
stupid
wasteful
i
hat
stupidity
i
hat
waste
above
all
that
war
more
than
other
war
seem
to
be
run
along
the
same
principle
as
my
bank
fight
not
to
win
but
to
avoid
lose
a
surefire
lose
strategy
my
fellow
soldier
felt
the
same
way
be
it
any
wonder
that
the
moment
we
be
dismiss
we
march
double
time
to
the
near
bar
between
the
reserve
and
hayes
i
wasn
t
sure
my
liver
be
go
to
see
now
and
then
hayes
would
hit
the
road
visit
client
across
oregon
and
i
frequently
found
myself
part
of
his
travel
medicine
show
of
all
his
junior
accountant
i
might
have
be
his
favorite
but
especially
when
he
travel
i
like
hayes
a
lot
but
i
be
alarmed
to
discover
that
when
on
the
road
he
really
let
his
hair
down
and
as
always
he
expect
his
cohort
to
do
the
same
it
be
never
enough
to
just
drink
with
hayes
he
demand
that
you
match
him
drop
for
drop
he
count
drink
as
carefully
as
he
count
credit
and
debit
he
say
often
that
he
believe
in
teamwork
and
if
you
be
on
his
team
by
god
you
d
well
finish
that
damn
drink
half
a
century
later
my
stomach
roll
when
i
recall
tour
with
hayes
around
albany
oregon
do
a
job
for
wah
chung
exotic
metal
each
night
after
crunch
the
number
we
d
hit
a
little
dive
on
the
edge
of
town
and
close
it
down
i
also
recall
dimly
blur

stand
until
i
misbehave
and
get
us
kick
out
i
don
t
remember
what
i
do
but
i
m
sure
it

remember
him
very
sweetly
and
patiently
tell
me
to
clean
it
up
what
i
remember
vividly
be
that
hayes
grow
red
in
the
face
righteously
indignant
on
my
behalf
even
though
i
be
clearly
in

wrong
and

such
loyalty
such
unreasonable
and
unwarranted
fealty
that
might
have
be
the
moment
i
fell
in
love
with
hayes
i
look
up
to
the
man
when
he
saw
something
deeper
in
number
but
i
love
him
when
he
saw
something
special
in
me
on
one
of
those
road
trip
in
one
of
our
boozy
late
night
conversation

told
hayes
about
blue

saw
promise
in
it

also
saw
doom
the
number

with
the
entire
production
team
at
the
onitsuka
factory
he
be
send
them
bunch
of
idea
and
modification
of
their
product
though
all
people
be
the
same
under
the
skin
bowerman
have
come
to
believe
that
all
foot
be
not
create
equal
american
have
different
body
than
japanese
do
longer
heavier
and
american
therefore
need
different
shoe
after
dissect
a
dozen
pair
of
tiger
bowerman
saw
how
they
could
be
tailor
to
cater
to
american
customer
to
that
end
he
have
a
slew
of
note
sketch
design
all
of
which
he
be
fire
off
to
japan
sadly
he
be
discover
as
i
have
that
no
matter
how
well
you
get
along
in
person
with
the
team
at
onitsuka
thing
be
different
once
you
be
back
on
your
side
of
the
pacific
most
of
bowerman
s
letter
go
unanswered
when
there
be
an
answer
it
be
cryptic
or
curtly
dismissive
it
pain
me
at
time
to
think
the
japanese
be
treat
bowerman
the
way
i
be
treat
johnson
but
bowerman
wasn
t
me
he
didn
t
take
rejection
to
heart
like
johnson
when
his
letter
go
unanswered
bowerman
simply
write
more
with
more
underlined
word
more
exclamation
mark
nor
do
he
flag
in
his
experiment
he
continued
to
tear
apart
tiger
continued
to
use
the
young
men
on
his
track
team
as
lab
mouse
during
the
autumn
track
season
of
every
race
have
two
result
for
bowerman
there
be
the
performance
of
his
runner
and
there
be
the
performance
of
their
shoe
bowerman
would
note
how
the
arch
held
up
how
the
sol
gripped
the
cinder
how
the
toe
pinch
and
the
instep
flexed
then
he
d
airmail
his
note
and
finding
to
japan
eventually
he
broke
through
onitsuka
make
prototype
that
conform
to
bowerman
s
vision
of
a
more
american
shoe
soft
inner
sole
more
arch
support
heel
wedge
to
reduce
stress
on
the
achilles
tendon
they
sent
the
prototype
to
bowerman
and
he
go
wild
for
it
he
ask
for
more
he
then
hand
these
experimental
shoe
out
to
all
his
runner
who
use
them
to
crush
the
competition
a
little
success
always
go
to
bowerman
s
head
in
the
best
way
around
this
time
he
be
also
test
sport
elixir
magic
potion
and
powder
to
give
his
runner
more
energy
and
stamen
when
i
be
on
his
team
he
d
talk
about
the
importance
of
replace
an
athlete
s
salt
and
electrolyte
he
d
force
me
and
others
to
choke
down
a
potion
he
d
invent
a
vile
goo
of
mush
banana
lemonade
tea
honey
and
several
unnamed
ingredient
now
while
tinker
with
shoe
he
be
also
monkey
with
his
sport
drink
recipe
make
it
taste
bad
and
work
well
it
wasn
t
until
year
later
that
i
realize
bowerman
be
try
to
invent
gatorade
in
his
free
time
he
like
to
noodle
with
the
surface
at
hayward
field
hayward
be
hallow
ground
steep
in
tradition
but
bowerman
didn
t
believe
in
let
tradition
slow
you
down
whenever
rain
fell
which
it
do
all
the
time
in
eugene
hayward
s
cinder
lane
turn
to
venetian
canal
bowerman
thought
something
rubbery
would
be
easy
to
dry
sweep
and
clean
he
also
thought
something
rubbery
might
be
more
forgive
on
his
runner
foot
so
he
bought
a
cement
mixer
fill
it
with
old
shred
tire
and
assort
chemical
and
spent
hour
search
for
just
the
right
consistency
and
texture
more
than
once
he
make
himself
violently
sick
from
inhale
the
fume
of
this
witch
brew
blinding
headache
a
pronounce
limp
loss
of
vision
these
be
a
few
of
the
last
cost
of
his
perfectionism
again
it
be
year
before
i
realize
what
bowerman
be
actually
up
to
he
be
try
to
invent
polyurethane
i
once
ask
him
how
he
fit
everything
into
a
twenty
four
hour
day
coach
travel
experiment
raise
a
family
he
grunt
as
if
to
say
it
s
nothing
then
he
told
me
sotto
voce
that
on
top
of
everything
else
he
be
also
write
a
book
a
book
i
say
about
jogging
he
say
gruffly
bowerman
be
forever
grip
that
people
make
the
mistake
of
think
only
elite
olympian
be
athlete
but
everyone
s
an
athlete
he
say
if
you
have
a
body
you
re
an
athlete
now
he
be
determine
to
get
this
point
across
to
a
large
audience
the
reading
public
sound
interest
i
say
but
i
thought
my
old
coach
have
popped
a
screw
who
in
heck
would
want
to
read
a
book
about
jogging

as
i
near
the
end
of
my
contract
with
onitsuka
i
checked
the
mail
every
day
hop
for
a
letter
that
would
say
they
want
to
renew
or
that
they
didn
t
there
would
be
relief
in
know
either
way
of
course
i
be
also
hop
for
a
letter
from
sarah
say
she
d
change
her
mind
and
as
always
i
be
brace
for
a
letter
from
my
bank
tell
me
my
business
be
no
longer
welcome
but
every
day
the
only
letter
be
from
johnson
like
bowerman
the
man
didn
t
sleep
ever
i
could
think
of
no
other
explanation
for
his
ceaseless
stream
of
correspondence
much
of
which
be
pointless
along
with
gob
of
information
i
didn
t
need
the
typical
johnson
letter
would
include
several
long
parenthetical
aside
and
some
kind
of
ramble
joke
there
might
also
be
a
hand
drawn
illustration
there
might
also
be
a
musical
lyric
sometimes
there
be
a
poem
bat
out
on
a
manual
typewriter
that
violently
braille
the
onionskin
page
many
johnson
letter
contain
some
kind
of
story
maybe
parable
be
a
well
word
how
johnson
have
sell
this
person
a
pair
of
tiger
but
down
the
road
say
person
might
be
good
for
x
more
pair
and
therefore
johnson
have
a
plan
how
johnson
have
chase
and
badger
the
head
coach
at
such
and
such
high
school
and
try
to
sell
him
six
pair
but
in
the
end
sell
him
a
baker
s
dozen
which
just
go
to
show
often
johnson
would
describe
in
excruciate
detail
the
late
ad
he
d
place
or
be
contemplate
place
in
the
back
page
of
long
distance
log
or
track
field
news
or
he
d
describe
the
photograph
of
a
tiger
shoe
he
d
include
with
the
ad
he
d
construct
a
makeshift
photo
studio
in
his
house
and
he
d
pose
the
shoe
seductively
on
the
sofa
against
a
black
sweater
never
mind
that
it
sound
a
bit
like
shoe
porn
i
just
didn
t
see
the
point
of
place
ad
in
magazine
read
exclusively
by
run
nerd
i
didn
t
see
the
point
of
advertising
period
but
johnson
seem
to
be
have
fun
and
he
swore
the
ad
work
so
fine
far
be
it
from
me
to
stop
him
the
typical
johnson
letter
would
invariably
close
with
a
lament
either
sarcastic
or
pointedly
earnest
about
my
failure
to
respond
to
his
previous
letter
and
the
one
before
that
etc
then
there
would
be
a
p
and
usually
another
p
and
sometimes
a
pagoda
of
p
s
then
one
last
plea
for
encourage
word
which
i
never
sent
i
didn
t
have
time
for
encourage
word
besides
it
wasn
t
my
style
i
look
back
now
and
wonder
if
i
be
truly
be
myself
or
if
i
be
emulate
bowerman
or
my
father
or
both
be
i
adopt
their
man
of
few
word
demeanor
be
i
maybe
model
all
the
men
i
admire
at
the
time
i
be
reading
everything
i
could
get
my
hand
on
about
general
samurai
shogun
along
with
biography
of
my
three
main
hero
churchill
kennedy
and
tolstoy
i
have
no
love
of
violence
but
i
be
fascinate
by
leadership
or
lack
thereof
under
extreme
condition
war
be
the
most
extreme
of
condition
but
business
have
its
warlike
parallel
someone
somewhere
once
say
that
business
be
war
without
bullet
and
i
tend
to
agree
i
wasn
t
that
unique
throughout
history
men
have
look
to
the
warrior
for
a
model
of
hemingway
s
cardinal
virtue
pressurize
grace
hemingway
himself
write
most
of
a
moveable
feast
while
gaze
at
a
statue
of
marshal
ney
napol
on
s
favorite
commander
one
lesson
i
take
from
all
my
home
school
about
hero
be
that
they
didn
t
say
much
none
be
a
blabbermouth
none
micromanaged
don
t
tell
people
how
to
do
thing
tell
them
what
to
do
and
let
them
surprise
you
with
their
result
so
i
didn
t
answer
johnson
and
i
didn
t
pester
him
have
told
him
what
to
do
i
hop
that
he
would
surprise
me
maybe
with
silence
to
johnson
s
credit
though
he
crave
more
communication
he
never
let
the
lack
of
it
discourage
him
on
the
contrary
it
motivate
him
he
be
anal
he
recognize
that
i
be
not
and
though
he
enjoy
complain
to
me
to
my
sister
to
mutual
friend
he
saw
that
my
managerial
style
give
him
freedom
left
to
do
as
he
pleased
he
respond
with
boundless
creativity
and
energy
he
work
seven
day
a
week
sell
and
promote
blue
ribbon
and
when
he
wasn
t
sell
he
be
beaverishly
building
up
his
customer
data
file
each
new
customer
get
his
or
her
own
index
card
and
each
index
card
contain
that
customer
s
personal
information
shoe
size
and
shoe
preference
this
database
enable
johnson
to
keep
in
touch
with
all
his
customer
at
all
time
and
to
keep
them
all
feel
special
he
sent
them
christmas
card
he
sent
them
birthday
card
he
sent
them
note
of
congratulation
after
they
complete
a
big
race
or
marathon
whenever
i
get
a
letter
from
johnson
i
knew
it
be
one
of
dozen
he
d
carry
down
to
the
mailbox
that
day
he
have
hundred
and
hundred
of
customer
correspondent
all
along
the
spectrum
of
humanity
from
high
school
track
star
to
octogenarian
weekend
jogger
many
upon
pull
yet
another
johnson
letter
from
their
mailbox
must
have
thought
the
same
thing
i
do
where
do
this
guy
find
the
time
unlike
me
however
most
customer
come
to
depend
on
johnson
s
letter
most
write
him
back
they
d
tell
him
about
their
life
their
trouble
their
injury
and
johnson
would
lavishly
console
sympathize
and
advise
especially
about
injury
few
in
the
s
knew
the
first
thing
about
run
injury
or
sport
injury
in
general
so
johnson
s
letter
be
often
fill
with
information
that
be
impossible
to
find
anywhere
else
i
worried
briefly
about
liability
issue
i
also
worried
that
i
d
one
day
get
a
letter
say
johnson
have
rent
a
bus
and
be
drive
them
all
to
the
doctor
some
customer
freely
volunteer
their
opinion
about
tiger
so
johnson
begin
aggregate
this
customer
feedback
use
it
to
create
new
design
sketch
one
man
for
instance
complain
that
tiger
flat
didn
t
have
enough
cushion
he
want
to
run
the
boston
marathon
but
didn
t
think
tiger
would
last
the
twenty
six
mile
so
johnson
hire
a
local
cobbler
to
graft
rubber
sol
from
a
pair
of
shower
shoe
into
a
pair
of
tiger
flat
voil
johnson
s
frankenstein
flat
have
space
age
full
length
midsole
cushion
today
it
s
standard
in
all
training
shoe
for
runner
the
jerry
rig
johnson
sole
be
so
dynamic
so
soft
so
new
johnson
s
customer
post
a
personal
best
in
boston
johnson
forward
me
the
result
and
urge
me
to
pas
them
along
to
tiger
bowerman
have
just
ask
me
to
do
the
same
with
his
batch
of
note
a
few
week
earlier
good
grief
i
thought
one
mad
genius
at
a
time
every
now
and
then
i
d
make
a
mental
note
to
warn
johnson
about
his
grow
list
of
pen
pal
blue
ribbon
be
suppose
to
confine
itself
to
the
thirteen
western
state
and
full
time
employee
number
one
be
not
do
so
johnson
have
customer
in
thirty
seven
state
include
the
entire
eastern
seaboard
which
be
the
heart
of
marlboro
country
the
marlboro
man
wasn
t
do
anything
with
his
territory
so
johnson
s
incursion
seem
harmless
but
we
didn
t
want
to
rub
the
man
s
nose
in
it

enough
to
serve
as
the
headquarters
of

t
big
enough

spiffy
new
high

at

despite
all
these
recent
calamity
johnson
be
of
good
cheer
he
assure
me
in
a
series
of
chirpy
follow
up
letter
that
he
be
manage
to
meet
all
his
obligation
he
be
drag

not

worry
p
o
box
be
still
fully
operational
in
closing
he
add
that
because
he
be
now
face
alimony
child
support
and
untold
medical
bill
he
need
to
inquire
about
the
long
term
prospect
of
blue
ribbon
how
do
i
see
the
future
i
didn
t
lie
exactly
maybe
out
of
pity
maybe
haunt
by
the
image
of
johnson
single
lonely
his
body
wrap
in
plaster
of
paris
gamely
try
to
keep
himself
and
my
company
alive
i
sound
an
upbeat
tone
blue
ribbon
i
say
would
probably
morph
over
the
year
into
a
generalize
sport
good
company
we
d
probably
have
office
on
the
west
coast
and
one
day
maybe
in
japan
farfetched
i
write
but
it
seem
worth
shoot
for
this
last
line
be
wholly
truthful
it
be
worth
shoot
for
if
blue
ribbon
go
bust
i
d
have
no
money
and
i
d
be
crush
but
i
d
also
have
some
valuable
wisdom
which
i
could
apply
to
the
next
business
wisdom
seem
an
intangible
asset
but
an
asset
all
the
same
one
that
justified
the
risk
start
my
own
business
be
the
only
thing
that
make
life
s
other
risk
marriage
vega
alligator
wrestling
seem
like
sure
thing
but
my
hope
be
that
when
i
fail
if
i
fail
i
d
fail
quickly
so
i
d
have
enough
time
enough
year
to
implement
all
the
hard
won
lesson
i
wasn
t
much
for
set
goal
but
this
goal
kept
flash
through
my
mind
every
day
until
it
become
my
internal
chant
fail
fast
in
closing
i
told
johnson
that
if
he
could
sell
pair
of
tiger
by
the
end
of
june
completely
impossible
by
my
calculation
i
would
authorize
him
to
open
that
retail
outlet
he
d
be
harass
me
about
i
even
put
a
p
at
the
bottom
which
i
knew
he
d
devour
like
a
candy
treat
i
remind
him
that
he
be
sell
so
many
shoe
so
fast
he
might
want
to
speak
to
an
accountant
there
be
income
tax
issue
to
consider
i
say
he
fire
back
a
sarcastic
thanks
for
the
tax
advice
he
wouldn
t
be
filing
tax
he
say
because
gross
income
be
while
expense
total
his
leg
broken
his
heart
broken
he
told
me
that
he
be
also
flat
broke
he
sign
off
please
send
encourage
word
i
didn
t
somehow
johnson
hit
the
magic
number
by
the
end
of
june
he
d
sell
pair
of
tiger
and
he
d
heal
thus
he
be
hold
me
to
my
end
of
the
bargain
before
labor
day
he
lease
a
small
retail
space
at
pico
boulevard
in
santa
monica
and
open
our
first
ever
retail
store
he
then
set
about
turn
the
store
into
a
mecca
a
holy
of
holy
for
runner
he
bought
the
most
comfortable
chair
he
could
find
and
afford
yard
sale
and
he
create
a
beautiful
space
for
runner
to
hang
out
and
talk
he
built
shelf
and
fill
them
with
book
that
every
runner
should
read
many
of
them
first
edition
from
his
own
library
he
cover
the
wall
with
photo
of
tiger
shod
runner
and
laid
in
a
supply
of
silk
screen
t
shirt
with
tiger
across
the
front
which
he
hand
out
to
his
best
customer
he
also
stuck
tiger
to
a
black
lacquer
wall
and
illuminate
them
with
a
strip
of
can
light
very
hip
very
mod
in
all
the
world
there

never
be
such
a
sanctuary
for
runner
a
place
that
didn
t
just
sell
them
shoe
but
celebrate
them
and
their
shoe
johnson
the
aspire
cult
leader
of
runner
finally
have
his
church
service
be
monday
through
saturday
nine
to
six
when
he
first
write
me
about
the
store
i
thought
of
the
temple
and
shrine
i
d
see
in
asia
and
i
be
anxious
to
see
how
johnson
s
compare
but
there
just
wasn
t
time
between
my
hour
at
price
waterhouse
my
drunken
revel
with
hayes
my
night
and
weekend
handle
the
minutia
connect
with
blue
ribbon
and
my
fourteen
hour
each
month
soldier
in
the
reserve
i
be
on
fume
then
johnson
write
me
a
fateful
letter
and
i
have
no
choice
i
jumped
on
a
plane
johnson
s
customer
pen
pal
now
numbered
in
the
hundred
and
one
of
them
a
high
school
kid
on
long
island
have
write
to
johnson
and
inadvertently
reveal
some
trouble
news
the
kid
say
his
track
coach
have
recently
be
talk
about
acquire
tiger
from
a
new
source
some
wrestling
coach
in
valley
stream
or
massapequa
or
manhasset
the
marlboro
man
be
back
he
d
even
place
a
national
ad
in
an
issue
of
track
and
field
while
johnson
be
busy
poach
on
the
marlboro
man
s
turf
the
marlboro
man
be
poach
our
poach
johnson
have
do
all
this
marvelous
groundwork
have
built
up
this
enormous
customer
base
have
spread
the
word
about
tiger
through
his
doggedness
and
crude
marketing
and
now
the
marlboro
man
be
go
to
swoop
in
and
capitalize
i
m
not
sure
why
i
hopped
on
the
next
plane
to
los
angeles
i
could
have
phone
maybe
like
johnson
s
customer
i
need
a
sense
of
community
even
if
it
be
a
community
of
just
two
the
first
thing
we
do
be
go
for
a
long
punish
run
on
the
beach
then
we
bought
a
pizza
and
brought
it
back
to
his
apartment
which
be
your
standard
divorce
guy
pad
only
more
so
tiny
dark
sparse
it
remind
me
of
some
of
the
no
frill
hostel
where
i
d
stayed
on
my
trip
around
the
world
of
course
there
be
a
few
distinctly
johnsonian
touch
like
shoe
everywhere
i
thought
my
apartment
be
fill
with
shoe
but
johnson
basically
live
inside
a
run
shoe
shove
into
every
nook
and
cranny
spread
across
every
surface
be
run
shoe
and
more
run
shoe
most
in
some
state
of
deconstruction
the
few
nook
and
cranny
that
didn
t
hold
shoe
be
fill
with
book
and
more
book
pile
on
homemade
bookshelf
rough
plank
laid
on
cinder
block
and
johnson
didn
t
read
trash
his
collection
be
mostly
thick
volume
of
philosophy
religion
sociology
anthropology
and
the
classic
of
western
literature
i
thought
i
love
to
read
johnson
be
next
level
what
struck
me
most
be
the
eerie
violet
light
that
suffuse
the
whole
place
its
source
be
a
seventy
five
gallon
saltwater
fish
tank
after
clearing
a
place
for
me
on
the
sofa
johnson
pat
the
tank
and
explain
most
newly
divorce
guy
like
to
prowl
single
bar
but
johnson
spent
his
night
prowl
under
the
seal
beach
pier
look
for
rare
fish
he
capture
them
with
something
call
a
slurp
gun
which
he
wave
under
my
nose
it
look
like
a
prototype
for
the
first
ever
vacuum
cleaner
i
ask
how
it
work
just
stick
this
nozzle
into
shallow
water
he
say
and
suck
up
the
fish
into
a
plastic
tube
then
into
a
small
chamber
then
shoot
it
into
your
bucket
and
schlep
it
home
he
d
manage
to
accumulate
a
wide
variety
of
exotic
creature
seahorse
opal
eye
perch
which
he
show
me
with
pride
he
point
out
the
jewel
of
his
collection
a
baby
octopus
he
d
name
stretch
speak
of
which
johnson
say
feed
time
he
reach
into
a
paper
sack
and
pull
out
a
live
crab
come
on
stretch
he
say
dangle
the
crab
over
the
tank
the
octopus
didn
t
stir
johnson
lower
the
crab
leg
wriggle
onto
the
tank
s
sand
strewn
floor
still
no
reaction
from
stretch
he
dead
i
ask
watch
johnson
say
the
crab
dance
left
and
right
panic
seek
cover
there
be
none
however
and
stretch
knew
it
after
a
few
minute
something
emerge
tentatively
from
stretch
s
undercarriage
an
antenna
or
tentacle
it
unfurled
toward
the
crab
and
lightly
tapped
its
carapace
yoo
hoo
stretch
just
inject
poison
in
the
crab
johnson
say
grin
like
a
proud
dad
we
watch
the
crab
slowly
stop
dance
stop
move
altogether
we
watch
stretch
gently
wrap
his
antenna
tentacle
around
the
crab
and
drag
it
back
to
his
lair
a
hole
he
d
dug
into
the
sand
beneath
a
big
rock
it
be
a
morbid
puppet
show
a
dark
kabuki
play
star
a
witless
victim
and
a
micro
kraken
be
it
a
sign
a
metaphor
for
our
dilemma
one
living
thing
be
eat
by
another
this
be
nature
wet
in
tooth
and
claw
and
i
couldn
t
help
wonder
if
it
be
also
to
be
the
story
of
blue
ribbon
and
the
marlboro
man
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
even
sit
at
johnson
s
kitchen
table
and
go
over
the
letter
from
his
long
island
informant
he
read
it
aloud
and
then
i
read
it
silently
and
then
we
debate
what
to
do
get
thee
to
japan
johnson
say
what
you
gotta
go
he
say
tell
them
about
the
work
we
ve
do
demand
your
right
kill
this
marlboro
man
once
and
for
all
once
he
start
sell
run
shoe
once
he
really
get
go
there
will
be
no
stop
him
either
we
draw
a
line
in
the
sand
right
now
or
it
s
over
i
d
just
come
back
from
japan
i
say
and
i
didn
t
have
the
money
to
go
again
i
d
pour
all
my
saving
into
blue
ribbon
and
i
couldn
t
possibly
ask
wallace
for
another
loan
the
thought
nauseate
me
also
i
didn
t
have
time
price
waterhouse
allow
two
week
vacation
a
year
unless
you
need
that
two
week
for
the
reserve
which
i
do
then
they
give
you
one
extra
week
which
i
d
already
use
above
all
i
told
johnson
it
s
no
use
the
marlboro
man
s
relationship
with

undaunted
johnson
pull
out
his
typewriter
the
one
he
d
be
use
to
torture
me
and
begin
draft
note
idea
list
which
we
could
then
turn
into
a
manifesto
for
me
to
deliver
to
the
executive
at
onitsuka
while
stretch
finish
off
the
crab
we
munch
our
pizza
and
guzzle
beer
and
plot
late
into
the
night
back
in
oregon
the
next
afternoon
i
go
straight
in
to
see
the
office
manager
at
price
waterhouse
i
ve
get
to
have
two
week
off
i
say
right
now
he
look
up
from
the
paper
on
his
desk
and
glare
at
me
and
for
one
hellishly
long
moment
i
thought
i
be
go
to
be
fire
instead
he
clear
his
throat
and
mumble
something
odd
i
couldn
t
make
out
every
word
but
he
seem
to
think
from
my
intensity
my
vagueness
i
d
gotten
someone
pregnant
i
take
a
step
back
and
start
to
protest
then
shut
my
mouth
let
the
man
think
what
he
want
so
long
as
he
give
me
the
time
run
a
hand
through
his
thin
hair
he
finally
sigh
and
say
go
good
luck
hope
it
all
work
out
i
put
the
airfare
on
my
credit
card
twelve
month
to
pay
and
unlike
my
last
visit
to
japan
this
time
i
wire
ahead
i
told
the
executive
at
onitsuka
that
i
be
come
and
that
i
want
a
meeting
they
wire
back
come
ahead
but
their
wire
go
on
to
say
that
i
wouldn
t
be
meeting
with
morimoto
he
be
either
fire
or
dead
there
be
a
new
export
manager
the
wire
say
his
name
be
kitami
kishikan
japanese
for
d
j
vu
again
i
found
myself
boarding
a
flight
for
japan
again
i
found
myself
underline
and
memorize
my
copy
of
how
to
do
business
with
the
japanese
again
i
found
myself
take
the
train
to
kobe
check
into
the
newport
pace
in
my
room
at
zero
hour
i
take
a
cab
over
to
onitsuka
i
expect
that
we
d
go
into
the
old
conference
room
but
no
they
d
do
some
remodel
since
my
last
visit
new
conference
room
they
say
sleeker
big
it
have
leather
chair
instead
of
the
old
cloth
one
and
a
much
longer
table
more
impressive
but
less
familiar
i
felt
disorient
intimidate
it
be
like
prepping
for
a
meet
at
oregon
state
and
learn
at
the
last
minute
that
it
have
be
move
to
the
los
angeles
memorial
coliseum
a
man
walk
into
the
conference
room
and
extend
his
hand
kitami
his
black
shoe
be
brightly
polished
his
hair
equally
polished
jet
black
swept
straight
back
not
a
strand
out
of
place
he
be
a
great
contrast
to
morimoto
who
always
look
as
if
he
d
dress
blindfold
i
be
put
off
by
kitami
s
veneer
but
suddenly
he
give
me
a
warm
ready
smile
and
encourage
me
to
sit
relax
tell
him
why
i
d
come
and
now
i
get
the
distinct
sense
that
despite
his
slick
appearance
he
wasn
t
altogether
sure
of
himself
he
be
in
a
brand
new
job
after
all
he
didn
t
yet
have
much
equity
the
word
sprang
to
mind
it
occur
to
me
also
that
i
have
high
value
for
kitami
i
wasn
t
a
big
client
but
i
wasn
t
small
either
location
be
everything
i
be
sell
shoe
in
america
a
market
vital
to
the
future
of
onitsuka
maybe
just
maybe
kitami
didn
t
want
to
lose
me
just
yet
maybe
he
want
to
hold
on
to
me
until
they
d
transition
to
the
marlboro
man
i
be
an
asset
i
be
a
credit
for
the
moment
which
meant
i
might
be
hold
well
card
than
i
thought
kitami
spoke
more
english
than
his
predecessor
but
with
a
thicker
accent
my
ear
need
a
few
minute
to
adjust
as
we
chat
about
my
flight
the
weather
sale
all
the
while
other
executive
be
filing
in
join
us
at
the
conference
table
at
last
kitami
lean
back
hai
he
wait
mr
onitsuka
i
ask
mr
onitsuka
will
not
be
able
to
join
us
today
he
say
damn
i
be
hop
to
draw
upon
mr
onitsuka
s
fondness
for
me
not
to
mention
his
bond
with
bowerman
but
no
alone
without
ally
trap
in
the
unfamiliar
conference
room
i
plunge
ahead
i
told
kitami
and
the
other
executive
that
blue
ribbon
have
do
a
remarkable
job
thus
far
we
d
sell
out
every
order
while
develop
a
robust
customer
base
and
we
expect
this
solid
growth
to
continue
we
have
forty
four
thousand
dollar
in
sale
for
and
project
to
have
eighty
four
thousand
dollar
in
i
described
our
new
store
in
santa
monica
and
laid
out
plan
for
other
store
for
a
big
future
then
i
lean
in
we
would
very
much
like
to
be
the
exclusive
u
s
distributor
for
tiger
s
track
and
field
line
i
say
and
i
think
it
be
very
much
in
tiger
s
interest
that
we
become
that
i
didn
t
even
mention
the
marlboro
man
i
look
around
the
table
grim
face
none
grimmer
than
kitami
s
he
say
in
a
few
terse
word
that
this
would
not
be
possible
onitsuka
want
for
its
u
s
distributor
someone
big
more
establish
a
firm
that
could
handle
the
workload
a
firm
with
office
on
the
east
coast
but
but
i
splutter
blue
ribbon
do
have
office
on
the
east
coast
kitami
rock
back
in
his
chair
oh
yes
i
say
we
re
on
the
east
coast
the
west
coast
and
soon
we
may
be
in
the
midwest
we
can
handle
national
distribution
no
question
i
look
around
the
table
the
grim
face
be
become
less
grim
well
kitami
say
this
change
thing
he
assure
me
that
they
would
give
my
proposal
careful
consideration
so
hai
meeting
adjourn
i
walk
back
to
my
hotel
and
spent
a
second
night
pace
first
thing
the
next
morning
i
receive
a
call
summon
me
back
to
onitsuka
where
kitami
award
me
exclusive
distribution
right
for
the
united
state
he
give
me
a
three
year
contract
i
try
to
be
nonchalant
as
i
sign
the
paper
and
place
an
order
for
five
thousand
more
shoe
which
would
cost
twenty
thousand
dollar
i
didn
t
have
kitami
say
he
d
ship
them
to
my
east
coast
office
which
i
also
didn
t
have
i
promise
to
wire
him
the
exact
address
on
the
flight
home
i
look
out
the
window
at
the
cloud
above
the
pacific
ocean
and
thought
back
to
sit
atop
mount
fuji
i
wonder
how
sarah
would
feel
about
me
now
after
this
coup
i
wonder
how
the
marlboro
man
would
feel
when
he
get
word
from
onitsuka
that
he
be
toast
i
stow
away
my
copy
of
how
to
do
business
with
the
japanese
my
carry
on
be
stuffed
with
souvenir
kimono
for
my
mother
and
sister
and
mom
hatfield
a
tiny
samurai
sword
to
hang
above
my
desk
and
my
crown
glory
a
small
japanese
tv
spoil
of
war
i
thought
smile
but
somewhere
over
the
pacific
the
full
weight
of
my
victory
come
over
me
i
imagine
the
look
on
wallace
s
face
when
i
ask
him
to
cover
this
gigantic
new
order
if
he
say
no
when
he
say
no
what
then
on
the
other
hand
if
he
say
yes
how
be
i
go
to
open
an
office
on
the
east
coast
and
how
be
i
go
to
do
it
before
those
shoe
arrive
and
who
be
i
go
to
get
to
run
it
i
star
at
the
curve
glow
horizon
there
be
only
one
person
on
the
planet
rootless
enough
energetic
enough
gung
ho
enough
crazy
enough
to
pick
up
and
move
to
the
east
coast
on
a
moment
s
notice
and
get
there
before
the
shoe
do
i
wonder
how
stretch
be
go
to
like
the
atlantic
ocean

i
didn
t
handle
it
well
not
well
at
all
know
what
his
reaction
would
be
and
dread
it
i
put
off
tell
johnson
the
whole
story
i
shot
him
a
quick
note
say
the
meeting
with
onitsuka
have
go
fine
tell
him
i
d
secure
national
distribution
right
but
i
left
it
at
that
i
think
i
must
have
held
out
hope
in
the
back
of
my
mind
that
i
might
be
able
to
hire
someone
else
to
go
east
or
that
wallace
would
blow
the
whole
plan
up
and
in
fact
i
do
hire
someone
else
a
former
distance
runner
of
course
but
he
change
his
mind
back
out
just
day
after
agree
to
go
so
frustrate
distract
mire
in
a
cycle
of
anxiety
and
procrastination
i
turn
to
the
much
simpler
problem
of
find
someone
to
replace
johnson
at
the
store
in
santa
monica
i
ask
john
bork
a
high
school
track
coach
in
los
angeles
a
friend
of
a
friend
he
jumped
at
the
chance
he
couldn
t
have
be
more
eager
how
could
i
have
know
he
d
be
quite
so
eager
the
next
morning
he
appear
at
johnson
s
store
and
announce
that
he
be
the
new
bos
the
new
what
johnson
say
i
ve
be
hire
to
take
over
for
you
when
you
go
back
east
bork
say
when
i
go
where
johnson
say
reach
for
the
phone
i
didn
t
handle
that
conversation
well
either
i
told
johnson
that
haha
hey
man
i
be
just
about
to
call
you
i
say
i
be
sorry
he
d
heard
the
news
that
way
how
awkward
and
i
explain
that
i
d
be
force
to
lie
to
onitsuka
and
claim
we
already
have
an
office
on
the
east
coast
thus
we
be
in
one
heck
of
a
jam
the
shoe
would
soon
be
on
the
water
an
enormous
shipment
steam
for
new
york
and
no
one
but
johnson
could
handle
the
task
of
claim
those
shoe
and
set
up
an
office
the
fate
of
blue
ribbon
rest
on
his
shoulder
johnson
be
flabbergast
then
furious
then
freak
all
in
the
space
of
one
minute
so
i
get
on
a
plane
and
flew
down
to
visit
him
at
his
store
he
didn
t
want
to
live
on
the
east
coast
he
told
me
he
love
california
he
d
live
in
california
all
his
life
he
could
go
run
year
round
in
california
and
run
as
i
knew
be
all
to
johnson
how
be
he
suppose
to
go
run
during
those
bitter
cold
winter
back
east
on
and
on
it
go
all
at
once
his
manner
change
we
be
stand
in
the
middle
of
his
store
his
sneaker
sanctuary
and
in
a
barely
audible
mumble
he
acknowledge
that
this
be
a
make
or
break
moment
for
blue
ribbon
in
which
he
be
heavily
invest
financially
emotionally
spiritually
he
acknowledge
that
there
be
no
one
else
who
could
set
up
an
east
coast
office
he
deliver
himself
of
a
long
ramble
semi
internal
monologue
say
that
the
santa
monica
store
practically
ran
itself
so
he
could
train
his
replacement
in
one
day
and
he
d
already
set
up
a
store
in
a
remote
location
once
so
he
could
do
it
again
fast
and
we
need
it
do
fast
with
the
shoe
on
the
water
and
back
to
school
order
about
to
roll
in
and
then
he
look
off
and
ask
the
wall
or
the
shoe
or
the
great
spirit
why
he
shouldn
t
just
shut
up
and
do
it
do
whatever
i
ask
and
be
down
on
his
knee
grateful
for
the
damn
opportunity
when
anyone
could
see
that
he
be
he
search
for
the
exact
word
a
talentless
fuck
i
might
have
say
something
like
oh
no

re
not
don
t
be
so
hard
on
yourself
i
might
have
but
i
didn
t
i
kept
my
mouth
shut
and
wait
and
wait

last

different
portland
that
ll
confuse
the
heck
out
of
the
japanese
we
hash
it
out
some
more
and
finally
decide
new
york
and
boston
be
the
most
logical
place
especially
boston
it
s
where
most
of
our
order
be
come
from
one
of
us
say
okay
he
say
boston
here
i
come
then
i
hand
him
a
bunch
of
travel
brochure
for
boston
play
up
the
fall
foliage
angle
a
little
heavy
hand
but
i
be
desperate
he
ask
how
i
happen
to
have
these
brochure
on
me
and
i
told
him
i
knew
he
d
make
the
right
decision
he
laugh
the
forgiveness
johnson
show
me
the
overall
good
nature
he
demonstrate
fill
me
with
gratitude
and
a
new
fondness
for
the
man
and
perhaps
a
deeper
loyalty
i
regret
my
treatment
of
him
all
those
unanswered
letter
there
be
team
player
i
thought
and
then
there
be
team
player
and
then
there
s
johnson
and
then
he
threaten
to
quit
via
letter
of
course
i
think
i
have
be
responsible
for
what
success
we
have
have
so
far
he
write
and
any
success
that
will
be
come
in
for
the
next
two
year
at
least
therefore
he
give
me
a
two
part
ultimatum
make
him
a
full
partner
in
blue
ribbon
raise
his
salary
to
six
hundred
dollar
a
month
plus
a
third
of
all
profit
beyond
the
first
six
thousand
pair
of
shoe
sell
or
else
he
say
good
bye
i
phone
bowerman
and
told
him
that
full
time
employee
number
one
be
stag
a
mutiny
bowerman
listen
quietly
consider
all
the
angle
weigh
the
pro
and
con
then
render
his
verdict
fuck
him
i
say
i
wasn
t
sure
fuck
him
be
the
best
strategy
maybe
there
be
some
middle
way
of
mollify
johnson
of
give
him
a
stake
in
the
company
but
as
we
talk
about
it
in
great
detail
the
math
just
didn
t
pencil
out
neither
bowerman
nor
i
want
to
surrender
any
portion
of
our
stake
so
johnson
s
ultimatum
even
if
i
d
want
to
accept
it
be
a
nonstarter
i
flew
to
palo
alto
where
johnson
be
visit
his
parent
and
ask
for
a
sit
down
johnson
say
he
want
his
father
owen
to
join
us
the
meeting
take
place
at
owen
s
office
and
i
be
immediately
stun
by
the
similarity
between
father
and
son
they
look
alike
sound
alike
even
have
many
of
the
same
mannerism
the
similarity
end
there
however
from
the
start
owen
be
loud
aggressive
and
i
could
see
that
he
d
be
the
instigator
behind
this
mutiny
by
trade
owen
be
a
salesman
he
sell
voice
record
equipment
like
dictaphone
and
he
be
darn
good
at
it
for
him
as
with
most
salesman
life
be
one
long
negotiation
which
he
relish
in
other
word
he
be
my
complete
opposite
here
we
go
i
thought
yet
another
shootout
with
a
consummate
negotiator
when
will
it
end
before
get
down
to
brass
tack
owen
first
want
to
tell
me
a
story
salesman
always
do
since
i
be
an
accountant
he
say
he
be
remind
of
an
accountant
he
d
met
recently
who
have
a
topless
dancer
for
a
client
the
story
i
believe
revolve
around
whether
the
dancer
s
silicone
implant
be
deductible
at
the
punch
line
i
laugh
to
be
polite
then
gripped
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
wait
for
owen
to
stop
laugh
and
make
his
opening
move
he
begin
by
cite
all
the
thing
his
son
have
do
for
blue
ribbon
he
insist
that
his
son
be
the
main
reason
blue
ribbon
still
exist
i
nod
let
him
talk
himself
out
and
resist
the
urge
to
make
eye
contact
with
johnson
who
sat
off
to
the
side
i
wonder
if
they
d
rehearse
all
this
the
way
johnson
and
i
rehearse
my
pitch
before
my
last
trip
to
japan
when
owen
finish
when
he
say
that
give
the
fact
his
son
obviously
should
be
a
full
partner
in
blue
ribbon
i
clear
my
throat
and
concede
that
johnson
be
a
dynamo
that
his
work
have
be
vital
and
invaluable
but
then
i
drop
the
hammer
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
we
have
forty
thousand
dollar
in
sale
and
more
than
that
in
debt
so
there
s
simply
nothing
to
divvy
up
here
fella
we
re
fight
over
slice
of
a
pie
that
doesn
t
exist
moreover
i
told
owen
that
bowerman
be
unwilling
to
sell
any
of
his
stake
in
blue
ribbon
and
therefore
i
couldn
t
sell
any
of
mine
if
i
do
i
d
be
surrender
majority
control
of
the
thing
i
d
create
that
wasn
t
feasible
i
make
my
counteroffer
i
would
give
johnson
a
fifty
dollar
raise
owen
star
it
be
a
fierce
tough
stare
hone
during
many
intense
negotiation
a
lot
of
dictaphone
have
move
out
the
door
after
that
stare
he
be
wait
for
me
to
bend
to
up
my
offer
but
for
once
in
my
life
i
have
leverage
because
i
have
nothing
left
to
give
take
it
or
leave
it
be
like
four
of
a
kind
hard
to
beat
finally
owen
turn
to
his
son
i
think
we
both
knew
from
the
start
that
johnson
would
be
the
one
to
settle
this
and
i
saw
in
johnson
s
face
that
two
contrary
desire
be
fight
for
his
heart
he
didn
t
want
to
accept
my
offer
but
he
didn
t
want
to
quit
he
love
blue
ribbon
he
need
blue
ribbon
he
saw
blue
ribbon
as
the
one
place
in
the
world
where
he
fit
an
alternative
to
the
corporate
quicksand
that
have
swallow
most
of
our
schoolmate
and
friend
most
of
our
generation
he
d
complain
a
million
time
about
my
lack
of
communication
but
in
fact
my
laissez
faire
management
style
have
foster
him
unleashed
him
he
wasn
t
likely
to
find
that
kind
of
autonomy
anywhere
else
after
several
second
he
reach
out
his
hand
deal
he
say
deal
i
say
shake
it
we
seal
our
new
agreement
with
a
six
mile
run
as
i
remember
i
won
with
johnson
on
the
east
coast
and
bork
take
over
his
store
i
be
awash
in
employee
and
then
i
get
a
call
from
bowerman
ask
me
to
add
yet
another
one
of
his
former
track
guy
geoff
hollister
i
take
hollister
out
for
a
hamburger
and
we
get
along
fine
but
he
cinched
the
deal
by
not
even
flinch
when
i
reach
into
my
pocket
and
found
i
didn
t
have
any
money
to
pay
for
lunch
so
i
hire
him
to
go
around
the
state
sell
tiger
thereby
make
him
full
time
employee
number
three
soon
bowerman
phone
again
he
want
me
to
hire
another
person
quadruple
my
staff
in
the
span
of
a
few
month
do
my
old
coach
think
i
be
general
motor
i
might
have
balk
but
then
bowerman
say

job

woodell
i
knew
the
name
of
course

the
name
woodell
have
be
a
standout
on
bowerman

a
star
but
a
gritty
and
inspire
competitor

long
jump
against
vaunt

d
be
there
i
d
watch
him
do
it
and
i
d
go
away
mighty
impressed
the
next
day
there
have
be
a
bulletin
on
tv
an
accident
at
oregon
s
mother

and
twenty
of
his
frat
brother

a
float
down
to
the
millrace

stream
that
wound
through
campus
they
be
try
to
flip
it
over
and
someone
lose
their
footing
then
someone
lose
their

scream
everyone
ran

his
first
lumbar
vertebra
there
seem
little
hope
of
his
walk
again
bowerman
have
held
a
twilight
meet
at
hayward
field
to
raise
money
for
woodell
s
medical
expense
now
he
face
the
task
of
find
something
for
woodell
to
do
at
present
he
say
the
poor
guy
be
sit
around
his
parent
house
in
a
wheelchair
star
at
the
wall
woodell
have
make
tentative
inquiry
about
be
bowerman
s
assistant
coach
but
bowerman
say
to
me
i
just
don
t
think
that
s
go
to
work
buck
maybe
he
could
do
something
for
blue
ribbon
i
hung
up
and
dial
woodell
i
nearly
say
how
sorry
i
be
about
his
accident
but
i
caught
myself
i
wasn
t
sure
that
be
the
right
thing
to
say
in
my
mind
i
ran
through
another
half
dozen
thing
each
of
which
seem
wrong
i
d
never
be
so
at
a
loss
for
word
and
i
d
spent
half
my
life
tongue
tie
what
do
one
say
to
a
track
star
who
suddenly
can
t
move
his
leg
i
decide
to
keep
it
strictly
business
i
explain
that
bowerman
have
recommend
woodell
and
say
i
might
have
a
job
for
him
with
my
new
shoe
company
i
suggest
we
get
together
for
lunch
sure
thing
he
say
we
met
the
next
day
at
a
sandwich
shop
in
downtown
beaverton
a
suburb
north
of
portland
woodell
drove
there
himself
he
d
already
master
a
special
car
a
mercury
cougar
with
hand
control
in
fact
he
be
early
i
be
fifteen
minute
late
if
not
for
his
wheelchair
i
don
t
know
that
i
d
have
recognize
woodell
when
i
first
walk
in
i
d
see
him
once
in
person
and
several
time
on
tv
but
after
his
many
ordeal
and
surgery
he
be
shockingly
thinner
he
d
lose
sixty
pound
and
his
naturally
sharp
feature
be
now
drawn
with
a
much
finer
pencil
his
hair
however
be
still
jet
black
and
still
grow
in
remarkably
tight
curl
he
look
like
a
bust
or
frieze
of
hermes
i
d
see
somewhere
in
the
greek
countryside
his
eye
be
black
too
and
they
shone
with
a
steeliness
a
shrewdness
maybe
a
sadness
not
unlike
johnson
s
whatever
it
be
it
be
mesmerize
and
endear
i
regret
be
late
lunch
be
suppose
to
be
a
job
interview
but
the
interview
part
be
a
formality
we
both
knew
men
of
oregon
take
care
of
their
own
fortunately
loyalty
aside
we
hit
it
off
we
make
each
other
laugh
mostly
about
bowerman
we
reminisce
about
the
many
way
he
torture
runner
ostensibly
to
instill
toughness
like
heating
a
key
on
a
stove
and
press
it
against
their
naked
flesh
in
the
sauna
we
d
both
fall
victim
before
long
i
felt
that
i
d
have
give
woodell
a
job
even
if
he
d
be
a
stranger
gladly
he
be
my
kind
of
people
i
wasn
t
certain
what
blue
ribbon
be
or
if
it
would
ever
become
a
thing
at
all
but
whatever
it
be
or
might
become
i
hop
it
would
have
something
of
this
man
s
spirit
i
offer
him
a
position
opening
our
second
retail
store
in
eugene
off
the
campus
at
a
monthly
salary
of
four
hundred
dollar
he
didn
t
negotiate
thank
goodness
if
he
d
ask
for
four
thousand
a
month
i
might
have
found
a
way
deal
i
say
deal
he
say
he
reach
out
shook
my
hand
he
still
have
the
strong
grip
of
an
athlete
the
waitress
brought
the
check
and
i
told
woodell
grandly
that
lunch
be
on
me
i
pull
out
my
wallet
and
found
that
it
be
empty
i
ask
blue
ribbon
s
full
time
employee
number
four
if
he
could
float
me
just
till
payday
when
he
wasn
t
send
me
new
employee
bowerman
be
send
me
the
result
of
his
late
experiment
in
he
d
notice
that
the
spring
up
s
outer
sole
melt
like
butter
whereas
the
midsole
remain
solid
so
he
d
urge
onitsuka
to
take
spring
up
s
midsole
and
fuse
it
with
the
limber
up
s
outer
sole
thus
create
the
ultimate
distance
training
shoe
now
in
onitsuka
sent
us
the
prototype
and
it
be
astonish
with
its
luxurious
cushion
and
its
sleek
line
it
look
like
the
future
onitsuka
ask
what
we
thought
it
should
be
call
bowerman
like
aztec
in
homage
to
the
olympics
which
be
be
held
in
mexico
city
i
like
that
too
fine
onitsuka
say
the
aztec
be
born
and
then
adidas
threaten
to
sue
adidas
already
have
a
new
shoe
name
the
azteca
gold
a
track
spike
they
be
planning
to
introduce
at
the
same
olympics
no
one
have
ever
heard
of
it
but
that
didn
t
stop
adidas
from
kick
up
a
fuss
aggravate
i
drove
up
the
mountain
to
bowerman
s
house
to
talk
it
all
over
we
sat
on
the
wide
porch
look
down
at
the
river
it
sparkle
that
day
like
a
silver
shoelace
he
take
off
his
ball
cap
put
it
on
again
rubbed
his
face
who
be
that
guy
who
kick
the
shit
out
of
the
aztec
he
ask
cortez
i
say
he
grunt
okay
let
s
call
it
the
cortez
i
be
develop
an
unhealthy
contempt
for
adidas
or
maybe
it
be
healthy
that
one
german
company
have
dominate
the
shoe
market
for
a
couple
of
decade
and
they
possess
all
the
arrogance
of
unchallenged
dominance
of
course
it
s
possible
that
they
weren
t
arrogant
at
all
that
to
motivate
myself
i
need
to
see
them
as
a
monster
in
any
event
i
despise
them
i
be
tire
of
look
up
every
day
and
see
them
far
far
ahead
i
couldn
t
bear
the
thought
that
it
be
my
fate
to
do
so
forever
the
situation
put
me
in
mind
of
jim
grelle
in
high
school
grelle
pronounce
grella
or
sometimes
gorilla
have
be
the
fast
runner
in
oregon
and
i
have
be
the
second
fast
which
meant
four
year
of
star
at
grelle
s
back
then
grelle
and
i
both
go
to
the
university
of
oregon
where
his
tyranny
over
me
continued
by
the
time
i
graduate
i
hop
never
again
to
see
grelle
s
back
year
later
when
grelle
won
the
in
moscow
s
lenin
stadium
i
be
wear
an
army
uniform
sit
on
a
couch
in
the
day
room
at
fort
lewis
i
pumped
my
fist
at
the
screen
proud
of
my
fellow
oregonian
but
i
also
die
a
little
at
the
memory
of
the
many
time
he
d
best
me
now
i
begin
to
see
adidas
as
a
second
grelle
chase
them
be
legally
checked
by
them
irritated
me
to
no
end
it
also
drove
me
hard
once
again
in
my
quixotic
effort
to
overtake
a
superior
opponent
i
have
bowerman
as
my
coach
once
again
he
be
do
everything
he
could
to
put
me
in
position
to
win
i
often
drew
on
the
memory
of
his
old
prerace
pep
talk
especially
when
we
be
up
against
our
blood
rival
oregon
state
i
would
replay
bowerman
s
epic
speech
hear
him
tell
us
that
oregon
state
wasn
t
just
any
opponent
beating
usc
and
cal
be
important
he
say
but
beating
oregon
state
be
pause
different
nearly
sixty
year
later
it
give
me
chill
to
recall
his
word
his
tone
no
one
could
get
your
blood
go
like
bowerman
though
he
never
raise
his
voice
he
knew
how
to
speak
in
subliminal
italic
to
slyly
insert
exclamation
mark
like
hot
key
against
the
flesh
for
extra
inspiration
i
d
sometimes
think
back
to
the
first
time
i
saw
bowerman
walk
around
the
locker
room
and
hand
out
new
shoe
when
he
come
to
me
i
wasn
t
even
sure
i
d
make
the
team
i
be
a
freshman
still
unproven
still
develop
but
he
shove
a
new
pair
of
spike
straight
into
my
chest
knight
he
say
that
be
all
just
my
name
not
a
syllable
more
i
look
down
at
the
shoe
they
be
oregon
green
with
yellow
stripe
the
most
breathtaking
thing
i
d
ever
see
i
cradle
them
and
later
i
carry
them
back
to
my
room
and
put
them
gingerly
on
the
top
shelf
of
my
bookcase
i
remember
that
i
train
my
gooseneck
desk
lamp
on
them
they
be
adidas
of
course
by
the
tail
end
of
bowerman
be
inspire
many
people
besides
me
that
book
he
d
be
talk
about
that
silly
book
about
jogging
be
do
and
out
in
bookstore
a
slight
one
hundred
page
jogging
preach
the
gospel
of
physical
exercise
to
a
nation
that
have
seldom
heard
that
sermon
before
a
nation
that
be
collectively
loll
on
the
couch
and
somehow
the
book
caught
fire
it
sell
a
million
copy
spark
a
movement
change
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
run
before
long
thanks
to
bowerman
and
his
book
run
be
no
longer
just
for
weirdo
it
be
no
longer
a
cult
it
be
almost
cool
i
be
happy
for
him
but
also
for
blue
ribbon
his
bestseller
would
surely
generate
publicity
and
bump
our
sale
then
i
sat
down
and
read
the
thing
my
stomach
drop
in
his
discussion
of
proper
equipment
bowerman
give
some
commonsense
advice
follow
by
some
confound
recommendation
discuss
shin
splint
or
buck
shin
he
say
the
right
shoe
be
important
but
almost
any
shoe
would
work
probably
the
shoe
you
wear
for
gardening
or
work
around
the
house
will
do
just
fine
what
as
for
workout
clothes
bowerman
told
reader
that
proper
clothing
may
help
the
spirit
but
add
that
people
shouldn
t
get
hung
up
on
brand
maybe
he
thought
this
be
true
for
the
casual
jogger
as
oppose
to
the
train
athlete
but
by
god
do
he
need
to
say
so
in
print
when
we
be
fight
to
establish
a
brand
more
to
the
point
what
do
this
mean
about
his
true
opinion
of
blue
ribbon
and
me
any
shoe
would
do
if
that
be
true
why
in
the
world
be
we
bother
to
sell
tiger
why
be
we
jackassing
around
here
i
be
chase
adidas
but
in
a
way
i
be
still
chase
bowerman
seek
his
approval
and
as
always
it
seem
highly
unlikely
in
late
that
i
d
ever
catch
either
one
thanks
largely
to
bowerman
s
cortez
we
close
the
year
in
a
blaze
meeting
our
expectation
of
revenue
eighty
four
thousand
dollar
i
almost
look
forward
to
my
next
trip
to
first
national
finally
wallace
would
back
off
loosen
the
purse
string
maybe
he
d
even
concede
the
value
of
growth
in
the
meantime
blue
ribbon
have
outgrown
my
apartment
maybe
it
s
more
accurate
to
say
that
it
have
take
over
the
place
be
now
the
equal
of
johnson
s
bachelor
pad
all
it
need
be
a
violet
light
and
a
baby
octopus
i
couldn
t
put
it
off
any
longer
i
need
a
proper
office
space
so
i
rent
a
large
room
on
the
east
side
of
town
it
wasn
t
much
a
plain
old
workspace
with
a
high
ceiling
and
high
window
several
of
which
be
broken
or
stuck
open
meaning
the
room
be
a
constant
brisk
fifty
degree
right
next
door
be
a
raucous
tavern
the
pink
bucket
and
every
day
at
p
m
promptly
the
jukebox
would
kick
in
the
wall
be
so
thin
you
could
hear
the
first
record
drop
and
feel
every
thump
note
thereafter
you
could
almost
hear
people
strike
match
light
cigarette
clink
glass
cheer
salud
mud
in
your
eye
but
the
rent
be
cheap
fifty
buck
a
month
when
i
take
woodell
to
see
it
he
allow
it
have
a
certain
charm
woodell
need
to
like
it
because
i
be
transfer
him
from
the
eugene
store
to
this
office
he
d
show
tremendous
skill
at
the
store
a
flair
for
organize
along
with
boundless
energy
but
i
could
use
him
well
in
what
i
would
be
call
the
home
office
sure
enough
on
day
one
he
come
up
with
a
solution
to
the
stuck
window
he
brought
in
one
of
his
old
javelin
to
hook
the
window
latch
and
push
them
shut
we
couldn
t
afford
to
fix
the
broken
glass
in
the
other
window
so
on
really
cold
day
we
just
wore
sweater
meanwhile
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
erect
a
plywood
wall
thereby
create
warehouse
space
in
the
back
and
retail
office
space
up
front
i
be
no
handyman
and
the
floor
be
badly
warp
so
the
wall
wasn
t
close
to
straight
or
even
from
ten
foot
away
it
appear
to
undulate
woodell
and
i
decide
that
be
kind
of
groovy
at
an
office
thrift
store
we
bought
three
batter
desk
one
for
me
one
for
woodell
one
for
the
next
person
stupid
enough
to
work
for
us
i
also
built
a
corkboard
wall
to
which
i
pin
different
tiger
model
borrowing
some
of
johnson
s
d
cor
idea
in
santa
monica
in
a
far
corner
i
set
up
a
small
sit
area
for
customer
to
try
on
shoe
one
day
at
five
minute
before
p
m
a
high
school
kid
wander
in
need
some
run
shoe
he
say
timidly
woodell
and
i
look
at
each
other
look
at
the
clock
we
be
beat
but
we
need
every
sale
we
talk
to
the
kid
about
his
instep
his
stride
his
life
and
give
him
several
pair
to
try
on
he
take
his
time
lace
them
up
walk
around
the
room
and
each
pair
he
declare
not
quite
right
at
p
m
he
say
he
d
have
to
go
home
and
think
about
it
he
left
and
woodell
and
i
sat
amid
the
mound
of
empty
box
and
scatter
shoe
i
look
at
him
he
look
at
me
this
be
how
we
re
go
to
build
a
shoe
company
as
i
gradually
move
my
inventory
out
of
my
apartment
into
my
new
office
the
thought
cross
my
mind
that
it
might
make
more
sense
to
give
up
the
apartment
altogether
just
move
into
the
office
since
i
d
basically
be
living
there
anyway
when
i
wasn
t
at
price
waterhouse
make
the
rent
i
d
be
at
blue
ribbon
and
vice
versa
i
could
shower
at
the
gym
but
i
told
myself
that
living
in
your
office
be
the
act
of
a
crazy
person
and
then
i
get
a
letter
from
johnson
say
he
be
living
in
his
new
office
he
d
chosen
to
locate
our
east
coast
office
in
wellesley
a
tony
suburb
of
boston
of
course

a
hand
drawn
map
and

the
history
and
topography
and
weather
pattern
of
wellesley
also
he
told
me
how

with
the
high
school
kid
who
d
alert
him
to
the
marlboro
man

secret
machination
the
kid
drove
johnson
all
over
and
johnson
saw
enough
of
long
island
to
know
that
this
place
wasn
t
his
bag
he
left
the
high
school
kid
head
north
on
i
and
when
he
hit

put
in
six
day
a
week
at
price
waterhouse
spending
early
morning
and
late
night
and
all
weekend
and
vacation
at
blue
ribbon
no
friend
no
exercise
no
social
life
and
wholly
content
my
life
be
out
of
balance
sure
but
i
didn
t
care
in
fact
i
want
even
more
imbalance
or
a
different
kind
of
imbalance
i
want
to
dedicate
every
minute
of
every
day
to
blue
ribbon
i
d
never
be
a
multitasker
and
i
didn
t
see
any
reason
to
start
now
i
want
to
be
present
always
i
want
to
focus
constantly
on
the
one
task
that
really
matter
if
my
life
be
to
be
all
work
and
no
play
i
want
my
work
to
be

i
want
to
quit
price
waterhouse
not

t
me
i
want
what
everyone
want

it
wasn
t
possible

be
on
track
to
double
sale
for
a
fifth
straight
year
it
still
couldn
t
justify
a
salary
for
its
cofounder
so
i
decide
to
compromise
find
a
different
day
job
one
that
would
pay
my
bill
but
require
few
hour
leave
me
more
time
for
my
passion
the
only
job
i
could
think
of
that
fit
this
criterion
be

and
get
a

hour
prepping

concept
and
as
fall
arrive
the
balance
of
my
life
shift
just
as
i
d
plan
i
still
didn
t
have
all
the
time
i
want
or
need
for
blue
ribbon
but
i
have
more
i
be
follow
a
path
that
felt
like
my
path
and
though
i
wasn
t
sure
where
it
would
lead
i
be
ready
to
find
out
so
i
be
beam
with
hope
on
that
first
day
of
the
semester
in
early
september
my
student
however
be
not
slowly
they
file
into
the
classroom
each
one
radiate
boredom
and
hostility
for
the
next
hour
they
be
to
be
confine
in
this
stifle
cage
force
fed
some
of
the
driest
concept
ever
devise
and
i
be
to
blame
which
make
me
the
target
of
their
resentment
they
eyed
me
frown
a
few
scowl
i
empathize
but
i
wasn
t
go
to
let
them
rattle
me
stand
at
the
lectern
in
my
black
suit
and
skinny
gray
tie
i
remain
calm
for
the
most
part
i
be
always
somewhat
restless
somewhat
twitchy
and
in
those
day
i
have
several
nervous
tic
like
wrap
rubber
band
around
my
wrist
and
play
with
them
snap
them
against
my
skin
i
might
have
snap
them
extra
fast
extra
hard
as
i
saw
the
student
slump
into
the
room
like
prisoner
on
a
chain
gang
suddenly
sweep
lightly
into
the
classroom
and
take
a
seat
in
the
front
row
be
a
strike
young
woman
she
have
long
golden
hair
that
brush
her
shoulder
and
match
golden
hoop
earring
that
also
brush
her
shoulder
i
look
at
her
and
she
look
at
me
bright
blue
eye
set
off
by
dramatic
black
eyeliner
i
thought
of
cleopatra
i
thought
of
julie
christie
i
thought
jeez
julie
christie
s
kid
sister

in
my
accounting
class
i
wonder
how

couldn
t
yet
be
twenty
i
guess
snap
my
rubber
band
against
my
wrist
snap
snap
and
star
then
pretend
not
to
stare
she
be
hard
to
look
away
from
and
hard
to
figure
so
young
and
yet
so
worldly
those
earring
they
be
strictly
hippie
and
yet
that
eye
makeup
be
tr
s
chic
who
be
this
girl
and
how
be
i
go
to
concentrate
on
teach
with
her
in
the
front
row
i
call
roll
i
can
still
remember
the
name
mr
trujillo
here
mr
peterson
here
mr
jameson
here
miss
park
here
say
julie
christie
s
kid
sister
softly
i
look
up
give
a
half
smile
she
give
a
half
smile
i
pencil
a
shaky
check
next
to
her
full
name
penelope
park
penelope
like
the
faithful
wife
of
world
travel
odysseus
present
and
account
for
i
decide
to
employ
the
socratic
method
i
be
emulate
the
oregon
and
stanford
professor
whose
class
i
d
enjoy
most
i
guess
and
i
be
still
under
the
spell
of
all
thing
greek
still
enchant
by
my
day
at
the
acropolis
but
maybe
by
ask
question
rather
than
lecture
i
be
also
try
to
deflect
attention
from
myself
force
student
to
participate
especially
certain
pretty
student
okay
class
i
say
you
buy
three
virtually
identical
widget
for
one
dollar
two
dollar
and
three
dollar
respectively
you
sell
one
for
five
dollar
what
s
the
cost
of
that
sell
widget
and
what
s
the
gross
profit
on
the
sale
several
hand
go
up
none
ala
be
miss
park
s
she
be
look
down
shier
than
the
professor
apparently
i
be
force
to
call
on
mr
trujillo
and
then
mr
peterson
okay
i
say
now
mr
trujillo
record
his
inventory
on
a
fifo
basis
and
make
a
gross
profit
of
four
dollar
mr
peterson
use
lifo
and
have
a
gross
profit
of
two
dollar
so
who
have
the
well
business
a
spirit
discussion
follow
involve
nearly
everybody
but
miss
park
i
look
at
her
and
look
she
didn
t
speak
she
didn
t
look
up
maybe
she
wasn
t
shy
i
thought
maybe
she
just
wasn
t
very
bright
how
sad
if
she
d
have
to
drop
the
class
or
if
i
d
have
to
flunk
her
early
on
i
drum
into
my
student
the
primary
principle
of
all
accounting
asset
equal
liability
plus
equity
this
foundational
equation
i
say
must
always
always
be
in
balance
accounting
be
problem
solve
i
say
and
most
problem
boil
down
to
some
imbalance
in
this
equation
to
solve
therefore
get
it
balance
i
felt
a
little
hypocritical
say
this
since
my
company
have
an
out
of
whack
liability
to
equity
ratio
of
ninety
to
ten
more
than
once
i
wince
to
think
what
wallace
would
say
if
he
could
sit
in
on
one
of
my
class
my
student
apparently
weren
t
any
more
capable
than
i
of
balance
this
equation
their
homework
paper
be
dreadful
that
be
with
the
exception
of
miss
park
she
ace
the
first
assignment
with
the
next
and
the
next
she
establish
herself
as
the
top
student
in
the
class
and
she
didn
t
just
get
every
answer
right
her
penmanship
be
exquisite
like
japanese
calligraphy
a
girl
that
look
like
that
and
whip
smart
she
go
on
to
record
the
high
grade
in
the
class
on
the
midterm
i
don
t
know
who
be
happier
miss
park
or
mr
knight
not
long
after
i
hand
back
the
test
she
linger
at
my
desk
ask
if
she
could
have
a
word
of
course
i
say
reach
for
my
wrist
rubber
band
give
them
a
series
of
vehement
snap
she
ask
if
i
might
consider
be
her
adviser
i
be
take
back
oh
i
say
oh
i
d
be
honor
then
i
blurt
how
would
you
like
a
job
a
what
i
ve
get
this
little
shoe
company
uh
on
the
side
and

some
bookkeeping

she
be
hold
her
textbook
against
her
chest
she
adjust
them
and
flutter
her
eyelash
oh
she
say
oh
well
okay
that
sound
fun
i
offer
to
pay
her
two
dollar
an
hour
she
nod
deal
day
later
she
arrive
at
the
office
woodell
and
i
give
her
the
third
desk
she
sat
place
her
palm
on
the
desktop
look
around
the
room
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
she
ask
woodell
hand
her
a
list
of
thing
type
bookkeeping
schedule
stock
filing
invoice
and
told
her
to
pick
one
or
two
each
day
and
have
at
it
but
she
didn
t
pick
she
do
them
all
quickly
and
with
ease
inside
a
week
neither
woodell
nor
i
could
remember
how
we
d
ever
gotten
along
without
her
it
wasn
t
just
the
quality
of
miss
park
s
work
that
we
found
so
valuable
it
be
the
blithe
spirit
in
which
she
do
it
from
day
one
she
be
all
in
she
grasped
what
we
be
try
to
do
what
we
be
try
to
build
here
she
felt
that
blue
ribbon
be
unique
that
it
might
become
something
special
and
she
want
to
do
what
she
could
to
help
which
prove
to
be
a
lot
she
have
a
remarkable
way
with
people
especially
the
sale
rep
we
be
continue
to
hire
whenever
they
come
into
the
office
miss
park
would
size
them
up
fast
and
either
charm
them
or
put
them
in
their
place
depend
on
what
be
call
for
though
shy
she
could
be
wry
funny
and
the
sale
rep
that
be
the
one
she
like
often
left
laugh
look
back
over
their
shoulder
wonder
what
just
hit
them
the
impact
of
miss
park
be
most
apparent
in
woodell
he
be
go
through
a
bad
time
just
then
his
body
be
fight
the
wheelchair
resist
its
life
imprisonment
he
be
plague
by
bedsore
and
other
malady
related
to
sit
motionless
and
often
he
d
be
out
sick
for
week
at
a
time
but
when
he
be
in
the
office
when
he
be
sit
alongside
miss
park
she
brought
the
color
back
to
his
cheek
she
have
a
heal
effect
on
him
and
see
this
have
a
bewitching
effect
on
me
most
day
i
surprised
myself
offering
eagerly
to
run
across
the
street
to
get
lunch
for
miss
park
and
woodell
this
be
the
kind
of
thing
we
might
have
ask
miss
park
to
do
but
day
after
day
i
volunteer
be
it
chivalry
devilry
what
be
happen
to
me
i
didn
t
recognize
myself
and
yet
some
thing
never
change
my
head
be
so
full
of
debit
and
credit
and
shoe
shoe
shoe
that
i
rarely
get
the
lunch
order
right
miss
park
never
complain
nor
do
woodell
invariably
i
d
hand
each
of
them
a
brown
paper
bag
and
they
d
exchange
a
know
glance
can
t
wait
to
see
what
i
m
eat
for
lunch
today
woodell
would
mutter
miss
park
would
put
a
hand
over
her
mouth
conceal
a
smile
miss
park
saw
my
bewitchment
i
think
there
be
several
long
look
between
us
several
meaningfully
awkward
pause
i
recall
one
burst
of
particularly
nervous
laughter
one
portentous
silence
i
remember
one
long
moment
of
eye
contact
that
kept
me
awake
that
night
then
it
happen
on
a
cold
afternoon
in
late
november
when
miss
park
wasn
t
in
the
office
i
be
walk
toward
the
back
of
the
office
and
notice
her
desk
drawer
open
i
stop
to
close
it
and
inside
i
saw
a
stack
of
check
all
her
paycheck
uncashed
this
wasn
t
a
job
to
her
this
be
something
else
and
so
perhaps
be
i
maybe
maybe
later
i
learn
woodell
be
do
the
same
thing
that
thanksgiving
a
record
cold
spell
hit
portland
the
breeze
come
through
the
hole
in
the
office
window
be
now
a
fierce
arctic
wind
at
time
the
gust
be
so
strong
paper
flew
from
the
desktop
shoelace
on
the
sample
flutter
the
office
be
intolerable
but
we
couldn
t
afford
to
fix
the
window
and
we
couldn
t
shut
down
so
woodell
and
i
move
to
my
apartment
and
miss
park
join
us
there
each
afternoon
one
day
after
woodell
have
go
home
neither
miss
park
nor
i
say
much
at
quit
time
i
walk
her
out
to
the
elevator
i
press
the
down
button
we
both
smile
tensely
i
press
down
again
we
both
star
at
the
light
above
the
elevator
door
i
clear
my
throat
miss
park
i
say
would
you
like
to
uhh
maybe
go
out
on
friday
night
those
cleopatra
eye
they
double
in
size
me
i
don
t
see
anyone
else
here
i
say
ping
the
elevator
door
slid
open
oh
she
say
look
down
at
her
foot
well
okay
okay
she
hurry
onto
the
elevator
and
as
the
door
close
she
never
lift
her
gaze
from
her
shoe
i
take
her
to
the
oregon
zoo
i
don
t
know
why
i
guess
i
thought
walk
around
and
gaze
at
animal
would
be
a
low
key
way
of
get
to
know
each
other
also
burmese
python
nigerian
goat
african
crocodile
they
would
give
me
ample
opportunity
to
impress
her
with
tale
of
my
travel
i
felt
the
need
to
brag
about
see
the
pyramid
the
temple
of
nike
i
also
told
her
about
fall
ill
in
calcutta
i
d
never
described
that
scary
moment
in
detail
to
anyone
i
didn
t
know
why
i
be
tell
miss
park
except
that
calcutta
have
be
one
of
the
lonely
moment
of
my
life
and
i
felt
very
unlonely
just
then
i
confess
that
blue
ribbon
be
tenuous
the
whole
thing
might
go
bust
any
day
but
i
still
couldn
t
see
myself
do
anything
else
my
little
shoe
company
be
a
living
breathing
thing
i
say
which
i
d
create
from
nothing
i
d
breathe
it
into
life
nurture
it
through
illness
brought
it
back
several
time
from
the
dead
and
now
i
want
need
to
see
it
stand
on
its
own
foot
and
go
out
into
the
world
do
that
make
sense
i
say
mm
hm

for
someone
else
i
want
to
build
something
that
be
my
own
something
i
could
point
to
and
say
i
make
that
it
be
the
only
way
i
saw
to
make
life
meaningful
she
nod
like
basic
accounting
principle
she
grasped
it
all
intuitively
right
away

of
my
sister
driver
s
license
and
go
for
cocktail
at
trader
vic
s
downtown

their
magic
by
february
around
my
thirtieth
birthday
she
be
spending
every
minute
of
her
free
time
at
blue
ribbon
and

at
my
apartment
at
some
point

mr

inevitably
i
brought
her
home
to
meet
my
family
we
all
sat
around
the
din
room
table

mom
s
pot
roast
wash
it
down
with
cold
milk
pretend
it
wasn
t
awkward
penny
be
the
second
girl
i
d
ever
brought
home
and
though
she
didn
t
have
the
wild
charisma
of
sarah
what
she
have
be
well
her
charm
be
real
unrehearsed
and
though
the
knight
seem
to
like
it
they
be
still
the
knight
my
mother
say
nothing
my
sister
try
in
vain
to
be
a
bridge
to
my
mother
and
father
my
father
ask
a
series
of
probe
thoughtful
question
about
penny
s
background
and
upbringing
which
make
him
sound
like
a
cross
between
a
loan
officer
and
a
homicide
detective
penny
told
me
later
that
the
atmosphere
be
the
exact
opposite
of
her
house
where
dinner
be
a
free
for
all
everyone
laugh
and
talk
over
one
another
dog
barking
and
tv
blaring
in
the
background
i
assure
her
that
no
one
would
have
suspect
she
felt
out
of
her
element
next
she
brought
me
home
and
i
saw
the
truth
of
everything
she
d
told
me
her
house
be
the
opposite
though
much
grander
than
chateau
knight
it
be
a
mess
the
carpet
be
stain
from
all
the
animal
a
german
shepherd
a
monkey
a
cat
several
white
rat
an
ill
temper
goose
and
chaos
be
the
rule
besides
the
park
clan
and
their
arkful
of
pet
it
be
a
hangout
for
all
the
stray
kid
in
the
neighborhood
i
try
my
best
to
be
charm
but
i
couldn
t
seem
to
connect
with
anyone
human
or
otherwise
slowly
painstakingly
i
make
inroad
with
penny
s
mother
dot
she
remind
me
of
auntie
mame
zany
madcap
eternally
young
in
many
way
she
be
a
permanent
teenager
resist
her
role
as
matriarch
it
struck
me
that
she
be
more
like
a
sister
to
penny
than
a
mother
and
indeed
soon
after
dinner
when
penny
and
i
invite
her
to
come
get
a
drink
with
us
dot
jumped
at
the
chance
we
hit
several
hot
spot
and
wound
up
at
an
after
hour
joint
on
the
east
side

after
two
cocktail
switch
to
water
but
not
dot

right
on
go
and

and
soon
she
be
jumping
up
to
dance
with
all
sort
of
strange
men
sailor
and
bad
at
one
point
she
jabbed
a
thumb
in
penny
s
direction
and
say
to
me
let
s
ditch
this
wet
blanket
she
s
dead
weight
penny
put
both

eye
i
laugh
and
kick
back
i
d
pass
the
dot
test

seal
of
approval

asset

a
long
weekend
though
penny

at
my
apartment
we
be
still
in
some
way
constrain
by
propriety
as
long
as
she
live
under
their
roof
penny
felt
bound
to
obey
her
parent
to
abide
by
their
rule
and
ritual
so
i
be
bound
to
get
her
mother
s
consent
before
such
a
big
trip
wear
a
suit
and
tie

present
myself
at
the
house
i
make
nice
with
the
animal
pet

goose
and
ask
dot
for
a
word
the
two
of
us

at
the
kitchen

thought
and

the
next

house
and
again
ask
dot
for
a
moment
of

sugar
into
her
coffee

an
odd
look
on
her
face

look
of
fear
and
frustration
she
hadn
t
found
herself
involve
in
many
negotiation
and
she
didn
t
know
that
the
basic
rule
of
negotiation
be
to
know
what
you
want
what
you
need
to
walk
away
with
in
order
to
be
whole
so

about
the
metal
seat
in
the
bleacher
which

to
griddle
she
didn
t
get
bore
when

loneliness
and
craftsmanship
of
the

we
stood
with
my
former

and
watch
the
day
s
last
race
that
night
we
stayed
at
a
hotel
on
the
edge
of
town
in
a
suite
paint
and
decorate
in
an
unsettle
shade
of
brown
the
color
of
burn
toast
we
agree
sunday
morning
we
spent
in
the
pool
hiding
from
the
sun
share
the
shade
beneath
the
dive
board
at
some
point
i
raise
the
subject
of
our
future
i
be
leave
the
next
day
for
a
long
and
vital
trip
to
japan
to
cement
my
relationship
with
onitsuka
i
hop
when
i
return
later
that
summer
we
couldn
t
keep
date
i
told
her
portland
state
frown
on
teacher
student
relationship
we
d
have
to
do
something
to
formalize
our
relationship
to
set
it
above
reproach
meaning
marriage
can
you
handle
arrange
a
wedding
by
yourself
while
i
m
go
i
say
yes
she
say
there
be
very
little
discussion
or
suspense
or
emotion
there
be
no
negotiation
it
all
felt
like
a
foregone
conclusion
we
go
inside
the
burn
toast
suite
and
phone
penny
s
house
dot
answer
first
ring
i
give
her
the
news
and
after
a
long
strangle
pause
she
say
you
son
of
a
bitch
click
moment
later
she
phone
back
she
say
she
d
react
impulsively
because
she
d
be
planning
to
spend
the
summer
have
fun
with
penny
and
she
d
felt
disappointed
now
she
say
it
would
be
almost
as
much
fun
to
spend
the
summer
planning
penny
s
wedding
we
phone
my
parent
next
they
sound
pleased
but
my
sister
jeanne
have
just
gotten
married
and
they
be
a
bit
weddinged
out
we
hung
up
look
at
each
other
look
at
the
brown
wallpaper
and
the
brown
rug
and
both
sigh
so
this
be
life
i
kept
say
to
myself
over
and
over
i
m
engage
i
m
engage
but
it
didn
t
sink
in
maybe
because
we
be
in
a
hotel
in
the
middle
of
a
heat
wave
in
exurban
sacramento
later
when
we
get
home
and
go
to
a
zales
and
picked
out
an
engagement
ring
with
an
emerald
stone
it
start
to
feel
real
the
stone
and
set
cost
five
hundred
dollar
that
be
very
real
but
i
never
once
felt
nervous
never
ask
myself
with
that
typical
male
remorse
oh
god
what
have
i
do
the
month
of
date
and
get
to
know
penny
have
be
the
happiest
of
my
life
and
now
i
would
have
the
chance
to
perpetuate
that
happiness
that
s
how
i
saw
it
basic
as
accounting
asset
equal
liability
plus
equity
not
until
i
left
for
japan
not
until
i
kiss
my
fianc
e
good
bye
and
promise
to
write
as
soon
as
i
get
there
do
the
full
reality
with
all
its
dimension
and
contour
hit
me
i
have
more
than
a
fianc
e
a
lover

d
never
before

good
bye
to

true
partner

again

m
tell
a
roomful
of
people
that
something
be
possible
that
something
can
be
successful
when
in
fact
i
don
t
really
know
i
m
speak
from
theory
faith
and
bluster
like
every
groom
and
every
bride
it
would
be
up
to
me
and
penny
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
we
say
that
day
the
reception
be
at
the
garden
club
of
portland
where
society
lady
gather
on
summer
night
to
drink
daiquiri
and
trade
gossip
the
night
be
warm
the
sky
threaten
rain
but
never
open
i
dance
with
penny
i
dance
with
dot
i
dance
with
my
mother
before
midnight
penny
and
i
say
good
bye
to
all
and
jumped
into
my
brand
new
car
a
racy
black
cougar
i
speed
us
to
the
coast
two
hour
away
where
we
plan
to
spend
the
weekend
at
her
parent
beach
house
dot
call
every
half
hour

suddenly
a
whole
new
cast
of
character
be
wander
in
and
out
of
the
office
rise
sale
enable
me
to
hire
more
and
more
rep
most
be
ex
runner
and
eccentric
as
only
ex
runner
can
be
but
when
it
come
to
sell
they
be
all
business
because
they
be
inspire
by
what
we
be
try
to
do
and
because
they
work
solely
on
commission
two
dollar
a
pair
they
be
burning
up
the
road
hit
every
high
school
and
college
track
meet
within
a
thousand
mile
radius
and
their
extraordinary
effort
be
boost
our
number
even
more
we
d
post
in
sale
in
and
in
we
be
on
our
way
to
just
under
though
wallace
be
still
breathing
down
my
neck
hassle
me
to
slow
down
and
moan
about
my
lack
of
equity
i
decide
that
blue
ribbon
be
do
well
enough
to
justify
a
salary
for
its
founder
right
before
my
thirty
first
birthday
i
make
the
bold
move
i
quit
portland
state
and
go
full
time
at
my
company
pay
myself
a
fairly
generous
eighteen
thousand
dollar
a
year
above
all
i
told
myself
the
best
reason
for
leave
portland
state
be
that
i
d
already
gotten
more
out
of
the
school
penny
than
i
d
ever
hop
i
get
something
else
too
i
just
didn
t
know
it
at
the
time
nor
do
i
dream
how
valuable
it
would
prove
to
be
in
my
last
week
on
campus
walk
through
the
hall
i
notice
a
group
of
young
woman
stand
around
an
easel
one
of
them
be
daub
at
a
large
canvas
and
just
as
i
pass
i
heard
her
lament
that
she
couldn
t
afford
to
take
a
class
on
oil
painting
i
stop
admire
the
canvas
my
company
could
use
an
artist
i
say
what
she
say
my
company
need
someone
to
do
some
advertising
would
you
like
to
make
some
extra
money
i
still
didn
t
see
any
bang
for
the
buck
in
advertising
but
i
be
start
to
accept
that
i
could
no
longer
ignore
it
the
standard
insurance
company
have
just
run
a
full
page
ad
in
the
wall
street
journal
tout
blue
ribbon
as
one
of
the
dynamic
young
company
among
its
client
the
ad
feature
a
photo
of
bowerman
and
me
star
at
a
shoe
not
as
if
we
be
shoe
innovator
more
as
if
we
d
never
see
a
shoe
before
we
look
like
moron
it
be
embarrass
in
some
of
our
ad
the
model
be
none
other
than
johnson
see
johnson
rock
a
blue
tracksuit
see
johnson
wave
a
javelin
when
it
come
to
advertising
our
approach
be
primitive
and
slapdash
we
be
make
it
up
as
we
go
along
learn
on
the
fly
and
it
show
in
one
ad
for
the
tiger
marathon
flat
i
think
we
refer
to
the
new
fabric
as
swooshfiber
to
this
day
none
of
us
remembers
who
first
come
up
with
the
word
or
what
it
meant
but
it
sound
good
people
be
tell
me
constantly
that
advertising
be
important
that
advertising
be
the
next
wave
i
always
roll
my
eye
but
if
icky
photo
and
make
up
word
and
johnson
pose
seductively
on
a
couch
be
slip
into
our
ad
i
need
to
start
pay
more
attention
i
ll
give
you
two
buck
an
hour
i
told
this
starve
artist
in
the
hallway
at
portland
state
to
do
what
she
ask
design
print
ad
i
say
do
some
letter
logo
maybe
a
few
chart
and
graph
for
presentation
it
didn
t
sound
like
much
of
a
gig
but
the
poor
kid
be
desperate
she
write
her
name
on
a
piece
of
paper
carolyn
davidson
and
her
number
i
shove
it
in
my
pocket
and
forgot
all
about
it
hire
sale
rep
and
graphic
artist
show
great
optimism
and
i
didn
t
consider
myself
an
optimist
by
nature
not
that
i
be
a
pessimist
i
generally
try
to
hover
between
the
two
commit
to
neither
but
as
approach
i
found
myself
star
into
space
and
think
the
future
might
be
bright
after
a
good
night
s
sleep
after
a
hearty
breakfast
i
could
see
plenty
of
reason
for
hope
aside
from
our
robust
and
rise
sale
number
onitsuka
would
soon
be
bring
out
several
excite
new
model
include
the
obori
which
feature
a
feather
light
nylon
upper
also
the
marathon
another
nylon
with
line
sleek
as
a
karmann
ghia
these
shoe
will
sell
themselves
i
told
woodell
many
time
hang
them
on
the
corkboard
also
bowerman
be
back
from
mexico
city
where
he
d
be
an
assistant
coach
on
the
u
s

team
meaning
he
d

a
pivotal
role
in
the

medal
than

nation

my
partner

more
than
famous
he
be
legendary
i
phone
bowerman
eager
to
get
his
overall
thought
on
the
game
and
particularly
on
the
moment
for
which
they
would
forever
be
remember
the
protest
of
john
carlos
and
tommie
smith
stand
on
the
podium
during
the
play
of
the
star
spangle
banner
both
men
have
bow
their
head
and
raise
black
gloved
fist
a
shock
gesture
meant
to
call
attention
to
racism
poverty
human
right
abuse
they
be
still
be
condemn
for
it
but
bowerman
as
i
fully
expect
support
them
bowerman
support
all
runner
carlos
and
smith
be
shoeless
during
the
protest
they
d
conspicuously
remove
their
puma
and
left
them
on
the
stand
i
told
bowerman
i
couldn
t
decide
if
this
have
be
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
for
puma
be
all
publicity
really
good
publicity
be
publicity
like
advertising
a
chimera
bowerman
chuckle
and
say
he
wasn
t
sure
he
told
me
about
the
scandalous
behavior
of
puma
and
adidas
throughout
the
game
the
world
s
two
big
athletic
shoe
company
run
by
two
german
brother
who
despise
each
other
have
chase
each
other
like
keystone
kops
around
the
olympic
village
jockeying
for
all
the
athlete
huge
sum
of
cash
often
stuffed
in
run
shoe
or
manila
envelope
be
pass
around
one
of
puma
s
sale
rep
even
get
thrown
in
jail
there
be
rumor
that
adidas
have
frame
him
he
be
married
to
a
female
sprinter
and
bowerman
joked
that
he
d
only
married
her
to
secure
her
endorsement
bad
it
didn
t
stop
at
mere
payouts
puma
have
smuggle
truckloads
of
shoe
into
mexico
city
while
adidas
cleverly
manage
to
evade
mexico
s
stiff
import
tariff
i
heard
through
the
grapevine
they
do
it
by
make
a
nominal
number
of
shoe
at
a
factory
in
guadalajara
bowerman
and
i
didn
t
feel
morally
offend
we
felt
left
out
blue
ribbon
have
no
money
for
payouts
and
therefore
no
presence
at
the
game
we
d
have
one
meager
booth
in
the
olympic
village
and
one
guy
work
it
bork
i
didn
t
know
if
bork
have
be
sit
there
reading
comic
book
or
just
hadn
t
be
able
to
compete
with
the
massive
presence
of
adidas
and
puma
but
either
way
his
booth
generate
zero
business
zero
buzz
no
one
stop
by
actually
one
person
do
stop
by
bill
toomey
a
brilliant
american
decathlete
ask
for
some
tiger
so
he
could
show
the
world
that
he
couldn
t
be
bought
but
bork
didn
t
have
his
size
nor
the
right
shoe
for
any
of
his
event
plenty
of
athlete
be
training
in
tiger
bowerman
report
we
just
didn
t
have
anybody
actually
compete
in
them
part
of
the
reason
be
quality
tiger
just
weren
t
good
enough
yet
the
main
reason
however
be
money
we
have
not
a
penny
for
endorsement
deal
we
re
not
broke
i
told
bowerman
we
just
don
t
have
any
money
he
grunt
either
way
he
say
wouldn
t
it
be
wonderful
to
be
able
to
pay
athlete
legally
lastly
bowerman
told
me
he
d
bumped
into
kitami
at
the
game
he
didn
t
much
care
for
the
man
doesn
t
know
a
damn
thing
about
shoe
bowerman
grumble
and
he
s
a
little
too
slick
little
too
full
of
himself
i
be
start
to
have
the
same
inkling
i
d
gotten
a
sense
from
kitami
s
last
few
wire
and
letter
that
he
might
not
be
the
man
he
d
seem
and
that
he
wasn
t
the
fan
of
blue
ribbon
he
d
appear
to
be
when
i
be
last
in
japan
i
have
a
bad
feel
in
my
bone
maybe
he
be
get
ready
to
jack
up
our
price
i
mention
this
to
bowerman
and
told
him
i
be
take
measure
to
protect
us
before
hang
up
i
boast
that
though
i
didn
t
have
enough
cash
or
cachet
to
pay
athlete
i
do
have
enough
to
buy
someone
at
onitsuka
i
have
a
man
on
the
inside
i
say
a
man
act
as
my
eye
and
ear
and
keep
tab
on
kitami
i
sent
out
a
memo
say
as
much
to
all
blue
ribbon
employee
by
now
we
have
around
forty
though
i
d
fall
in
love
with
japanese
culture
i
kept
my
souvenir
samurai
sword
beside
my
desk
i
also
warn
them
that
japanese
business
practice
be
thoroughly
perplex
in
japan
you
couldn
t
predict
what
either
your
competition
or
your
partner
might
do
i
d
give
up
try
instead
i
write
i
ve
take
what
i
think
be
a
big
step
to
keep
us
inform
i
ve
hire
a
spy
he
work
full
time
in
the
onitsuka
export
department
without
go
into
a
lengthy
discussion
of
why
i
will
just
tell
you
that
i
feel
he
be
trustworthy
this
spy
may
seem
somewhat
unethical
to
you
but
the
spy
system
be
ingrain
and
completely
accepted
in
japanese
business
circle
they
actually
have
school
for
industrial
spy
much
as
we
have
school
for
typist
and
stenographer
i
can
t
imagine
what
make
me
use
the
word
spy
so
wantonly
so
boldly
other
than
the
fact
that
james
bond
be
all
the
rage
just
then
nor
can
i
understand
why
when
i
be
reveal
so
much
i
didn
t
reveal
the
spy
s
name
it
be
fujimoto
whose
bicycle
i
d
replace
i
think
i
must
have
know
on
some
level
that
the
memo
be
a
mistake
a
terribly
stupid
thing
to
do
and
that
i
would
live
to
regret
it
i
think
i
knew
but
i
often
found
myself
as
perplex
as
japanese
business
practice
kitami
and
mr
onitsuka
both
attend
the
game
in
mexico
city
and
afterward
they
both
flew
to
los
angeles
i
flew
down
from
oregon
to
meet
them
for
dinner
at
a
japanese
restaurant
in
santa
monica
i
be
late
of
course
and
by
the
time
i
arrive
they
be
full
of
sake
like
schoolboy
on
holiday
each
be
wear
a
souvenir
sombrero
loudly
woohooing
i
try
hard
to
mirror
their
festive
mood
i
match
them
shot
for
shot
help
them
finish
off
several
platter
of
sushi
and
generally
bond
with
them
both
at
my
hotel
that
night
i
go
to
bed
think
hop
i
d
be
paranoid
about
kitami
the
next
morning
we
all
flew
to
portland
so
they
could
meet
the
gang
at
blue
ribbon
i
realize
that
in
my
letter
to
onitsuka
not
to
mention
my
conversation
with

have
overplayed
the
grandeur
of
our
worldwide
headquarters
sure
enough
i
saw
kitami
s
face

tightly
but
we
do
a
lot
of
business
out
of
this
room
they
look
at
the
broken
window
the
javelin
window
closer

wavy
plywood
room
divider
they
look
at

they
felt
the
wall
vibrate
from
the
pink
bucket
jukebox
they
look
at
each
other
dubious
i
told
myself
whelp

s
all
over
sense
my
embarrassment
mr
onitsuka
put
a
reassure
hand
on
my
shoulder
it
be
most
charm
he
say
on
the
far
wall
woodell
have
hung
a
large
handsome
map
of
the
united
state
and
he
d
put
a
red
pushpin
everywhere
we
d
sell
a
pair
of
tiger
in
the
last
five
year
the

for
one
merciful
moment
it
divert

he

here
not

swoosh
by
i

penny
and
i
be
learn
to
live
together
learn
to
meld
our
personality
and
idiosyncrasy
though
we
agree
that
she
be
the
one
with
all
the
personality
and
i
be
the
idiosyncratic
one
therefore
it
be
she
who
have
more
to
learn
for
instance
she
be
learn
that
i
spent

down
mental
wormhole
try
to
solve
some
problem
or
construct
some
plan
i
often
didn
t
hear
what
she
say
and
if
i
do
hear
i
didn
t
remember
it
minute
later
she

and
come
home
empty
hand
without
the
one
item
she
d
ask
me
to
buy
because
all
the
way
there
and
all
the
way
back
i
d
be
puzzle
over
the
late

delay
she
be

misplace
everything
especially
the

helpless
i
couldn
t
cook
or
clean
or
do
even
the
simplest
thing
for
myself
because

me
be
a
special
form
of
agony
i
often
flippantly
blame

but
it
go
way
back
i
told
her
about
play
ping
pong
with
my
father
when
i
be
a
boy
and
the
pain
of
never

to
beat
him
i
told
her
that
my
father
would
sometimes
laugh
when
he
won
which
sent
me
into
a
rage
more
than
once
i

thrown
down
my
paddle
and

corner
of

a
waste
of
my
time
apparently
though
he
didn
t
say
so
explicitly
he
do
seem
to
find
the
problem
i
face
interest
and
challenge
which
amount

the
same
thing

cozy
apartment

now
completely
inappropriate

in
my
recliner

we
found
a
house
in
beaverton
small

hundred
square
foot
but
it
have
an
acre
of

also
a
huge
pine
tree
in
the
front
and
a
japanese

me
several
time
what
my
dream

day
they
hand
me

charcoal
pencil
and
a
pad
and
make
me
draw
it
after

in
my
sister

out
the
old
charcoal
sketch

be
an
exact
picture
of
the
beaverton
house
the
price
be
thirty
four
thousand
dollar
and
i
popped
my
shirt
button
to
discover
that
i
have
percent
of
that
in
saving
on
the
other
hand
i
d
pledge
those

saving
for
a
down
payment
on

he
say
on
this
one

t
have
to
consult
wallace
that
night
i
told
penny
that
if
blue
ribbon
fail
we
d
lose
the
house
she
put
a
hand
on
her
stomach
and
sat
down
this
be
the
kind
of
insecurity
she
d
always
vowed
to
avoid
okay
she
kept
say
okaaaay
with
so
much
at
stake
she
felt
compel
to
keep
work
for
blue
ribbon
right
through
her
pregnancy
she
would
sacrifice
everything
to
blue
ribbon
even
her
deeply
held
goal
of
graduate
from
college
and
when
she
wasn
t
physically
in
the
office
she
would
run
a
mail
order
business
out
of
the
new
house
in
alone
despite
morning
sickness
swollen
ankle
weight
gain
and
constant
fatigue
penny
get
out
fifteen
hundred
order
some
of
the
order
be
nothing
more
than
crude
tracing
of
a
human
foot
sent
in
by
customer
in
far
flung
place
but
penny
didn
t
care
she
dutifully
match
the
trace
to
the
correct
shoe
and
fill
the
order
every
sale
count
at
the
same
time
that
my
family
outgrew
its
home
so
do
my
business
one
room
beside
the
pink
bucket
could
no
longer
contain
us
also
woodell
and
i
be
tire
of
shout
to
be
heard
above
that
jukebox
so
each
night
after
work
we
d
go
out
for
cheeseburger
then
drive
around
look
at
office
space
logistically
it
be
a
nightmare
woodell
have
to
drive
because
his
wheelchair
wouldn
t
fit
in
my
cougar
and
i
always
felt
guilty
and
uncomfortable
be
chauffeur
by
a
man
with
so
many
limitation
i
also
felt
craze
with
nerve
because
many
of
the
office
we
look
at
be
up
a
flight
of
stair
or
several
flight
this
meant
i
d
have
to
wheel
woodell
up
and
down
at
such
moment
i
be
remind
painfully
of
his
reality
during
a
typical
workday
woodell
be
so
positive
so
energetic
it
be
easy
to
forget
but
wheel
him
maneuvering
him
upstairs
downstairs
i
be
repeatedly
struck
by
how
delicate
how
helpless
he
could
be
i
d
pray
under
my
breath
please
don
t
let
me
drop
him
please
don
t
let
me
drop
him
woodell
hearing
me
would
tense
up
and
his
tension
would
make
me
more
nervous
relax
i
d
say
i
haven
t
lose
a
patient
yet
haha
no
matter
what
happen
he
d
never
lose
his
composure
even
at
his
most
vulnerable
with
me
balance
him
precariously
at
the
top
of
some
dark
flight
of
stair
he
d
never
lose
touch
with
his
essential
philosophy
don
t
you
dare
feel
sorry
for
me
i
m
here
to
kill
you
the
first
time
i
ever
sent
him
to
a
trade
show
the
airline
lose
his
wheelchair
and
when
they
found
it
the
frame
be
bent
like
a
pretzel
no
problem
in
his
mutilate
chair
woodell
attend
the
show
ticked
off
every
item
on
his
to
do
list
and
come
home
with
an
ear
to
ear
mission
accomplish
smile
on
his
face
at
the
end
of
each
night
s
search
for
new
office
space
woodell
and
i
would
always
have
a
big
belly
laugh
about
the
whole
debacle
most
night
we
d
wind
up
at
some
dive
bar
giddy
almost
delirious
before
part
we
d
often
play
a
game
i
d
bring
out
a
stopwatch
and
we
d
see
how
fast
woodell
could
fold
up
his
wheelchair
and
get
it
and
himself
into
his
car
as
a
former
track
star
he
love
the
challenge
of
a
stopwatch
of
try
to
beat
his
personal
best
his
record
be
forty
four
second
we
both
cherished
those
night
the
silliness
the
sense
of
share
mission
and
we
mutually
ranked
them
among
the
solid
gold
memory
of
our
young
life
woodell
and
i
be
very
different
and
yet
our
friendship
be
base
on
a
selfsame
approach
to
work
each
of
us
found
pleasure
whenever
possible
in
focus
on
one
small
task
one
task
we
often
say
clear
the
mind
and
each
of
us
recognize
that
this
small
task
of
find
a
big
office
meant
we
be
succeed
we
be
make
a
go
of
this
thing
call
blue
ribbon
which
spoke
to
a
deep
desire
in
each
of
us
to
win
or
at
least
not
lose
though
neither
of
us
be
much
of
a
talker
we
brought
out
a
chatty
streak
in
each
other
those
night
we
discuss
everything
open
up
to
each
other
with
unusual
candor
woodell
told
me
in
detail
about
his
injury
if
i
be
ever
tempt
to
take
myself
too
seriously
woodell
s
story
always
remind
me
that
thing
could
be
bad
and
the
way
he
handle
himself
be
a
constant
bracing
lesson
in
the
virtue
and
value
of
good
spirit
his
injury
wasn
t
typical
he
say
and
it
wasn
t
total
he
still
have
some
feel
still

a
family
he
also
have
hope
of
a
cure
he
be
take
an
experimental
new
drug
which
have
show
promise
in
paraplegic
trouble
be
it
have
a
garlicky
aroma
some
night
on
our
office
hunt
expedition
woodell
would
smell
like
an
old
school
pizzeria
and
i
d
let
him
hear
about
it
i
ask
woodell
if
he
be
i
hesitate
fear
i
have
no
right
happy
he
give
it
some
thought
yes
he
say
he
be
he
love
his
work
he
love
blue
ribbon
though
he
sometimes
cringed
at
the
irony
a
man
who
can
t
walk
peddle
shoe
not
sure
what
to
say
to
this
i
say
nothing
often
penny
and
i
would
have
woodell
over
to
the
new
house
for
dinner
he
be
like
family
we
love
him
but
we
also
knew
we
be
fill
a
void
in
his
life
a
need
for
company
and
domestic
comfort
so
penny
always
want
to
cook
something
special
when
woodell
come
over
and
the
most
special
thing
she
could
think
of
be
cornish
game
hen
plus
a
dessert
make
from
brandy
and
iced
milk
she
get
the
recipe
from
a
magazine
which
left
us
all
blotto
though
hen
and
brandy
put
a
serious
dent
in
her
twenty
five
dollar
grocery
budget
penny
simply
couldn
t
economize
when
it
come
to
woodell
if
i
told
her
that
woodell
be
come
to
dinner
she
d
reflexively
gush
i
ll
get
some
capon
and
brandy
it
be
more
than
want
to
be
hospitable
she
be
fatten
him
up
she
be
nurture
him
woodell
i
think
spoke
to
her
newly
activate
maternal
streak
i
struggle
to
remember
i
close
my
eye
and
think
back
but
so
many
precious
moment
from
those
night
be
go
forever
numberless
conversation
breathless
laugh
fit
declaration
revelation
confidence
they
ve
all
fall
into
the
sofa
cushion
of
time
i
remember
only
that
we
always
sat
up
half
the
night
catalog
the
past
mapping
out
the
future
i
remember
that
we
take
turn
describe
what
our
little
company
be
and
what
it
might
be
and
what
it
must
never
be
how
i
wish
on
just
one
of
those
night
i
d
have
a
tape
recorder
or
kept
a
journal
as
i
do
on
my
trip
around
the
world
still
at
least
i
can
always
call
to
mind
the
image
of
woodell
seat
at
the
head
of
our
dinette
carefully
dress
in
his
blue
jean
his
trademark
v
neck
sweater
over
a
white
t
and
always
on
his
foot
a
pair
of
tiger
the
rubber
sol
pristine
by
then
he
d
grown
a
long
beard
and
a
bushy
mustache
both
of
which
i
envy
heck
it
be
the
sixty
i
d
have
have
a
beard
down
to
my
chin
but
i
be
constantly
need
to
go
to
the
bank
and
ask
for
money
i
couldn
t
look
like
a
bum
when
i
present
myself
to
wallace
a
clean
shave
be
one
of
my
few
concession
to
the
man
woodell
and
i
eventually
found
a
promising
office
in
tigard
south
of
downtown
portland
it
wasn
t
a
whole
office
building
we
couldn
t
afford
that
but
a
corner
of
one
floor
the
rest
be
occupy
by
the
horace
mann
insurance
company
invite
almost
plush
it
be
a
dramatic
step
up
and
yet
i
hesitate
there
have
be
a
curious
logic
in
our
be
next
door
to
a
honky
tonk
but
an
insurance
company
with
carpet
hall
and
water
cooler
and
men
in
tailor
suit
the
atmosphere
be
so
button
down
so
corporate
our
surroundings
i
felt
have
much
to
do
with
our
spirit
and
our
spirit
be
a
big
part
of
our
success
and
i
worried
how
our
spirit
might
change
if
we
be
suddenly
share
space
with
a
bunch
of
organization
men
and
automaton
i
take
to
my
recliner
give
it
some
thought
and
decide
a
corporate
vibe
might
be
asymmetrical
contrary
to
our
core
belief
but
it
might
also
be
just
the
thing
with
our
bank
maybe
when
wallace
saw
our
boring
sterile
new
office
space
he
d
treat
us
with
respect
also
the
office
be
in
tigard
sell
tiger
out
of
tigard
maybe
it
be
meant
to
be
then
i
thought
about
woodell
he
say
he
be
happy
at
blue
ribbon
but
he
d
mention
the
irony
maybe
it
be
more
than
ironic
send
him
out
to
high
school
and
college
to
sell
tiger
out
of
his
car
maybe
it
be
torture
and
maybe
it
be
a
poor
use
of
his
talent
what
suit
woodell
best
be
bring
order
to
chaos
problem
solve
one
small
task
after
he
and
i
go
together
to
sign
the
tigard
lease
i
ask
him
if
he
d
like
to
change
job
become
operation
manager
for
blue
ribbon
no
more
sale
call
no
more
school
instead
he
d
be
in
charge
of
deal
with
all
the
thing
for
which
i
didn
t
have
the
time
and
patience
like
talk
to
bork
in
l
a
or
correspond
with
johnson
in
wellesley
or
opening
a
new
office
in
miami
or
hire
someone
to
coordinate
all
the
new
sale
rep
and
organize
their
report
or
approve
expense
account
best
of
all
woodell
would
have
to
oversee
the
person
who
monitor
company
bank
account
now
if
he
didn
t
cash
his
own
paycheck
he
d
have
to
explain
the
overage
to
his
bos
himself
beam
woodell
say
he
like
the
sound
of
that
very
much
he
reach
out
his
hand
deal
he
say
still
have
the
grip
of
an
athlete
penny
go
to
the
doctor
in
september
a
checkup
the

but
the

remorse
the
moment

i
realize
that
bork
be
a
valuable
part
of
the
team
that
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
him
that
i
couldn
t
afford
to
lose
him
i
dispatch
our
new
operation
manager
woodell
to
los
angeles
to
patch
thing
up
woodell
take

and
try
to
explain
that
i
wasn
t

much
with
a
new
baby
and
all
also
woodell
told

i
be
feel
tremendous
stress
after
the
visit
from
kitami
and
mr
onitsuka
woodell
joked
about
my
unique
management
style
tell

everyone
pull
their
hair
out
about
my
nonresponses

woodell
spent
a
few
day
with
bork
smooth
his
feather
go
over
the
operation
he
discover
that
bork

back
room
which
have
basically
become
our
national
warehouse
be
in
shamble
box
everywhere
invoice
and
paper
stack
to
the
ceiling
bork
couldn
t
keep
pace
when
woodell
return
he
give
me
the
picture
i
think
bork
s
back
in
the
fold
he
say
but
we
need
to
relieve
him
of
that
warehouse
we
need
to
transfer
all
warehouse
operation
up
here
moreover
he
add
we
need
to
hire
woodell
s
mother
to
run
it
she
d
work
for
year
in
the
warehouse
at
jantzen
the
legendary
oregon
outfitter
so
it
wasn
t
nepotism
he
say
ma
woodell
be
perfect
for
the
job
i
wasn
t
sure
i
care
if
woodell
be
good
with
it
i
be
good
with
it
plus
the
way
i
saw
it
the
more
woodells
the
well

i
have
to
fly
to
japan
again
and
this
time
two
week
before
christmas
i
didn
t
like
leave
penny
alone
with
matthew
especially
around
the
holiday
but
it
couldn
t
be
avoid
i
need
to
sign
a
new
deal
with
onitsuka
or
not
kitami
be
keep
me
in
suspense
he
wouldn
t
tell
me
his
thought
about
renew
me
until
i
arrive
yet
again
i
found
myself
at
a
conference
table
surround
by
onitsuka
executive
this
time
mr
onitsuka
didn
t
make
his
trademark
late
entrance
nor
do
he
absent
himself
pointedly
he
be
there
from
the
start
preside
he
open
the
meeting
by
say
that
he
intend
to
renew
blue
ribbon
for
another
three
year
i
smile
for
the
first
time
in
week
then
i
press
my
advantage
i
ask
for
a
longer
deal
yes
seem
light
year
away
but
it
would
be
here
in
a
blink
i
need
more
time
and
security
my
banker
need
more
five
year
i
say
mr
onitsuka
smile
three
he
then
give
a
strange
speech
notwithstanding
several
year
of
sluggish
worldwide
sale
he
say
plus
some
strategic
misstep
the
outlook
be
rosy
for
onitsuka
through
cost
cut
and
reorganization
his
company
have
regain
its
edge
sale
for
the
upcoming
fiscal
year
be
expect
to
top
million
a
good
portion
of
which
would
come
from
the
united
state
a
recent
survey
show
that
percent
of
all
american
runner
own
a
pair
of
tiger
i
knew
that
maybe
i
d
have
a
little
something
to
do
with
that
i
want
to
say
that
s
why
i
want
a
longer
contract
but
mr
onitsuka
say
that
one
major
reason
for
onitsuka
s
solid
number
be
kitami
he
look
down
the
table
bestow
a
fatherly
smile
on
kitami
therefore
mr
onitsuka
say
kitami
be
be
promote
henceforth
he
d
be
the
company
s
operation
manager
he
d
now
be
onitsuka
s
woodell
though
i
remember
think
that
i
wouldn
t
trade
one
woodell
for
a
thousand
kitamis
with
a
bow
of
my
head
i
congratulate
mr
onitsuka
on
his
company
s
good
fortune
i
turn
and
bow
my
head
at
kitami
congratulate
him
on
his
promotion
but
when
i
raise
my
head
and
make
eye
contact
with
kitami
i
saw
in
his
gaze
something
cold
something
that
stayed
with
me
for
day
we
drew
up
the
agreement
it
be
four
or
five
paragraph
a
flimsy
thing
the
thought
cross
my
mind
that
it
should
be
more
substantive
and
that
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
lawyer
vet
it
but
there
wasn
t
time
we
all
sign
it
then
move
on
to
other
topic
i
be
relieve
to
have
a
new
contract
but
i
return
to
oregon
feel
troubled
anxious
more
so
than
at
any
time
in
the
last
eight
year
sure
my
briefcase
held
a
guarantee
that
onitsuka
would
supply
me
with
shoe
for
the
next
three
year
but
why
be
they
refuse
to
extend
beyond
three
more
to
the
point
the
extension
be
mislead
onitsuka
be
guarantee
me
a
supply
but
their
supply
be
chronically
dangerously
late
about
which
they
still
have
a
maddeningly
blas
attitude
little
more
day
with
wallace
continually
act
more
like
a
loan
shark
than
a
banker
a
little
more
day
could
mean
disaster
and
when
the
shipment
from
onitsuka
do
finally
arrive
they
often
contain
the
wrong
number
of
shoe
often
the
wrong
size
sometimes
the
wrong
model
this
kind
of
disarray
clog
our
warehouse
and
rankle
our
sale
rep
before
i
left
japan
mr
onitsuka
and
kitami
assure
me
that
they
be
building
new
state
of
the
art
factory
delivery
problem
would
soon
be
a
thing
of
the
past
they
say
i
be
skeptical
but
there
be
nothing
i
could
do
i
be
at
their
mercy
johnson
meanwhile
be
lose
his
mind
his
letter
once
mumbly
with
angst
be
become
shrill
with
hysteria
the
main
problem
be
bowerman
s
cortez
he
say
it
be
simply
too
popular
we
d
gotten
people
hooked
on
the
thing
turn
them
into
full
blown
cortez
addict
and
now
we
couldn
t
meet
the
demand
which
create
anger
and
resentment
up
and
down
the
supply
chain
god
we
be
really
screw
our
customer
johnson
write
happiness
be
a
boatload
of
cortez
reality
be
a
boatload
of
boston
with
steel
wool
upper
tongue
make
out
of
old
razor
blade
size
to
he
be
exaggerate
but
not
much
it
happen
all
the
time
i
d
secure
a
loan
from
wallace
then
hang
fire
wait
for
onitsuka
to
send
the
shoe
and
when
the
boat
finally
docked
it
wouldn
t
contain
any
cortez
six
week
later
we
d
get
too
many
cortez
and
by
then
it
be
too
late
why
it
couldn
t
just
be
onitsuka
s
decrepit
factory
we
all
agree
and
sure
enough
woodell
eventually
figure
out
that
onitsuka
be
satisfy
its
local
customer
in
japan
first
then
worry
about
foreign
export
terribly
unfair
but
again
what
could
i
do
i
have
no
leverage
even
if
onitsuka
s
new
factory
end
all
delivery
problem
even
if
every
shipment
of
shoe
hit
the
water
right
on
time
with
all
the
correct
quantity
of
size
s
and
no
size
s
i
d
still
face
problem
with
wallace
big
order
would
require
big
loan
and
big
loan
would
be
harder
to
pay
off
and
in
wallace
be
tell
me
that
he
wasn
t
interested
in
play
that
game
anymore
i
recall
one
day
sit
in
wallace
s
office
both
he
and
white
be
work
me
over
pretty
good
wallace
seem
to
be
enjoy
himself
though
white
kept
give
me
look
that
say
sorry
pal
this
be
my
job
as
always
i
politely
take
the
abuse
they
dish
out
play
the
role
of
meek
small
business
owner
long
on
contrition
short
on
credit
i
knew
the
role
backward
and
forward
but
i
remember
feel
that
at
any
moment
i
might
cut
loose
a
bloodcurdling
scream
here
i
d
built
this
dynamic
company
from
nothing
and
by
all
measure
it
be
a
beast
sale
double
every
year
like
clockwork
and
this
be
the
thanks
i
get
two
banker
treat
me
like
a
deadbeat
white
try
to
cool
thing
off
say
a
few
nominal
thing
in
support
of
blue
ribbon
i
watch
his
word
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
wallace
i
take
a
breath
start
to
speak
then
stop
i
didn
t
trust
my
voice
i
just
sat
up
straighter
and
hug
myself
this
be
my
new
nervous
tic
my
new
habit
rubber
band
be
no
longer
cut
it
whenever
i
felt
stress
whenever
i
want
to
choke
someone
i
d
wrap
my
arm
good
and
tight
around
my
torso
that
day
the
habit
be
more
pronounce
i
must
have
look
as
if
i
be
practice
some
exotic
yoga
pose
i
d
learn
in
thailand
at
issue
be
more
than
the
old
philosophical
disagreement
about
growth
blue
ribbon
be
approach
six
hundred
thousand
dollar
in
sale
and
that
day
i
d
go
in
to
ask
for
a
loan
of
million
a
number
that
have
symbolic
meaning
for
wallace
it
be
the
first
time
i
d
broken
the
million
dollar
barrier
in
his
mind
this
be
like
the
four
minute
mile
very
few
people
be
meant
to
break
it
he
be
weary
of
this
whole
thing
he
say
weary
of
me
for
the
umpteenth
time
he
explain
that
he
live
on
cash
balance
and
for
the
umpteenth
time
i
suggest
ever
so
politely
that
if
my
sale
and
earnings
be
go
up
up
up
wallace
should
be
happy
to
have
my
business
wallace
rapped
his
pen
on
the
table
my
credit
be
maxed
out
he
say
officially
irrevocably
immediately
he
wasn
t
authorize
one
more
cent
until
i
put
some
cash
in
my
account
and
left
it
there
meanwhile
henceforth
he
d
be
impose
strict
sale
quota
for
me
to
meet
miss
one
quota
he
say
by
even
one
day
and
well
he
didn
t
finish
the
sentence
his
voice
trail
off
and
i
be
left
to
fill
the
silence
with
bad
case
scenario
i
turn
to
white
who
give
me
a
look
what
can
i
do
pal
day
later
woodell
show
me
a
telex
from
onitsuka
the
big
spring
shipment
be
ready
to
hit
the
water
and
they
want
twenty
thousand
dollar
great
we
say
for
once
they
re
shipping
the
shoe
on
time
just
one
hitch
we
didn
t
have
twenty
thousand
dollar
and
it
be
clear
i
couldn
t
go
to
wallace
i
couldn
t
ask
wallace
for
change
of
a
five
so
i
telexed
onitsuka
and
ask
them
to
hold
the
shoe
please
until
we
brought
in
some
more
revenue
from
our
sale
force
please
don
t
think
we
be
in
financial
difficulty
i
write
it
wasn
t
a
lie
per
se
as
i
told
bowerman
we
weren
t
broke
we
just
have
no
money
lot
of
asset
no
cash
we
simply
need
more
time
now
it
be
my
turn
to
say
little
more
day
while
await
onitsuka
s
response
i
realize
that
there
be
only
one
way
to
solve
this
cash
flow
problem
once
and
for
all
a
small
public
offering
if
we
could
sell
percent
of
blue
ribbon
at
two
buck
a
share
we
could
raise
three
hundred
thousand
dollar
overnight
the
timing
for
such
an
offering
seem
ideal
in
the
first
ever
venture
capital
firm
be
start
to
sprout
up
the
whole
concept
of
venture
capital
be
be
invent
before
our
eye
though
the
idea
of
what
constitute
a
sound
investment
for
venture
capitalist
wasn
t
very
broad
most
of
the
new
venture
capital
firm
be
in
northern
california
so
they
be
mainly
attract
to
high
tech
and
electronics
company
silicon
valley
almost
exclusively
since
most
of
those
company
have
futuristic
sound
name
i
form
a
hold
company
for
blue
ribbon
and
give
it
a
name
design
to
attract
tech
happy
investor
sport
tek
inc
woodell
and
i
sent
out
flier
advertising
the
offering
then
sat
back
and
brace
for
the
clamorous
response
silence
a
month
pass
deafen
silence
no
one
phone
not
one
person
that
be
almost
no
one

still
hope

restore
onitsuka
s
faith

kitami
s
mind
i
would
just
need
to
remind
kitami
of
what
blue
ribbon
be
and
who
i
be
which
would
mean
invite
him
to
the
united
state
for
a
friendly
visit

guess
who
s
come
to
dinner
woodell
say
he
wheel
into
my
office
and
hand
me
the
telex
ki
tami
have
accepted
my
invitation
he
be
come
to
portland
to
spend
a
few
day
then
he
be
go
to
make
a
wider
tour
of
the
united
state
for
reason
he
decline
to
share
visit
other
potential
distributor
i
say
to
woodell
he
nod
it
be
march
we
vowed
that
kitami
be
go
to
have
the
time
of
his
life
that
he
would
return
home
feel
love
in
his
heart
for
america
oregon
blue
ribbon
and
me
when
we
be
do
with
him
he
d
be
incapable
of
do
business
with
anyone
else
and
so
we
agree
the
visit
should
close
on
a
high
note
with
a
gala
dinner
at
the
home
of
our
prize
asset
bowerman
in
mount
this
charm
offensive
naturally
i
enlist
penny
together
we
met
kitami
s
flight
and
together
we
whisk
him
straight
to
the
oregon
coast
to
her
parent
oceanfront
cottage
where
we
d
spent
our
wedding
night
kitami
have
a
companion
with
him
a
sort
of
bag
carrier
personal
assistant
amanuensis
name
hiraku
iwano
he
be
just
a
kid
na
ve
innocent
in
his
early
twenty
and
penny
have
him
eat
out
of
her
hand
before
we
hit
sunset
highway
we
both
slave
to
give
the
two
men
an
idyllic
pacific
northwest
weekend
we
sat
on
the
porch
with
them
and
breathe
in
the
sea
air
we
take
them
for
long
walk
on
the
beach
we
fed
them
world
class
salmon
and
pour
them
glass
after
glass
of
good
french
wine
we
try
to
focus
most
of
our
attention
on
kitami
but
both
penny
and
i
found
it
easy
to
talk
to
iwano
who
read
book
and
seem
guileless
kitami
seem
like
a
man
who
be
import
guile
by
the
boatload
monday
bright
and
early
i
drove
kitami
back
to
portland
to
first
national
bank
just
as
i
be
determine
to
charm
him
on
this
trip
i
thought
that
he
could
be
helpful
in
charm
wallace
that
he
could
vouch
for
blue
ribbon
and
make
credit
easy
to
get
white
met
us
in
the
lobby
and
walk
us
into
a
conference
room
i
look
around
where
s
wallace
i
ask
ah
white
say
he
won
t
be
able
to
join
us
today
what
that
be
the
whole
point
of
visit
the
bank
i
want
wallace
to
hear
kitami
s
ring
endorsement
oh
well
i
thought
good
cop
will
just
have
to
relay
the
endorsement
to
bad
cop
i
say
a
few
preliminary
word
express
confidence
that
kitami
could
bolster
first
national
s
faith
in
blue
ribbon
then
turn
the
floor
over
to
kitami
who
scowl
and
do
the
one
thing
guaranteed
to
make
my
life
harder
why
do
you
not
give
my
friend
more
money
he
say
to
white
w
w
what
white
say
why
do
you
refuse
to
extend
credit
to
blue
ribbon
kitami
say
pound
his
fist
on
the
table
well
now
white
say
kitami
cut
him
off
what
kind
of
bank
be
this
i
do
not
understand
maybe
blue
ribbon
would
be
well
off
without
you
white
turn
white
i
try
to
jump
in
i
try
to
rephrase
what
kitami
be
say
try
to
blame
the
language
barrier
but
the
meeting
be
over
white
storm
out
and
i
star
in
astonishment
at
kitami
who
be
wear
an
expression
that
say
job
well
do
i
drove
kitami
to
our
new
office
in
tigard
and
show
him
around
introduce
him
to
the
gang
i
be
fight
hard
to
maintain
my
composure
to
remain
pleasant
to
block
out
all
thought
about
what
have
just
happen
i
be
afraid
that
at
any
second
i
might
lose
it
but
when
i
settle
kitami
into
a
chair
across
from
my
desk
it
be
he
who
lose

much
well
stun
i
say
that
our
sale
be
double
every
year
not
good
enough
he
snap
should
be
triple
some
people
say
he
say
what
people
i
ask
never
mind
he
say
he
take
a
folder
from
his
briefcase
flip
it
open
read
it
snap
it
shut
he

that
he
didn
t
like
our
number
that
he
didn
t
think
we
be
do
enough
he
open
the
folder
again
shut
it
again
shove
it
back
into
his
briefcase
i
try
to
defend
myself
but
he
wave
his
hand
in
disgust
back
and
forth
we
go
for
quite
a
while
civil
but
tense
after
nearly
an
hour
of
this
he
stood
and
ask
to
use
the
men
s
room
down
the
hall
i
say
the
moment
he
be
out
of
sight
i
jumped
from
behind
my
desk
i
open
his
briefcase
and
rummage
through
and
take
out
what
look
like
the
folder
he
d
be
refer
to
i
slid
it
under
my
desk
blotter
then
jumped
behind
my
desk
and
put
my
elbow
on
the
blotter
wait
for
kitami
to
return
i
have
the
strangest
thought
i
recall
all
the
time
i
d
volunteer
with
the
boy
scout
all
the
time
i
d
sat
on
eagle
scout
review
board
hand
out
merit
badge
for
honor
and
integrity
two
or
three
weekend
a
year
i
d
question
pink
cheeked
boy
about
their
probity
their
honesty
and
now
i
be
steal
document
from
another
man
s
briefcase
i
be
head
down
a
dark
path
no
tell
where
it
might
lead
wherever
there
be
no
get
around
one
immediate
consequence
of
my
action
i
d
have
to
recuse
myself
from
the
next
review
board
how
i
long
to
study
the
content
of
that
folder
and
photocopy
every
scrap
of
paper
in
it
and
go
over
it
all
with
woodell
but
kitami
be
soon
back
i
let
him
resume
scold
me
about
sluggish
number
let
him
talk
himself
out
and
when
he
stop
i
sum
up
my
position
calmly
i
say
that
blue
ribbon
might
increase
its
sale
if
we
could
order
more
shoe
and
we
might
order
more
shoe
if
we
have
more
financing
and
our
bank
might
give
us
more
financing
if
we
have
more
security
meaning
a
longer
contract
with
onitsuka
again
he
wave
his
hand
excuse
he
say
i
raise
the
idea
of
funding
our
order
through
a
japanese
trading
company
like
nissho
iwai
as
i
d
mention
in
my
wire
month
before
baah
he
say
trading
company
they
send
money
first
men
later
take
over
work
way
into
your
company
then
take
over
translation
onitsuka
be
only
manufacturing
a
quarter
of
its
own
shoe
subcontract
the
other
three
quarter
kitami
be
afraid
that
nissho
would
find
onitsuka
s
network
of
factory
then
go
right
around
onitsuka
and
become
a
manufacturer
and
put
onitsuka
out
of
business
kitami
stood
he
need
to
go
back
to
his
hotel
he
say
have
a
rest
i
say
i
d
have
someone
drive
him
and
i
d
meet
him
for
a
cocktail
later
at
his
hotel
bar
the
instant
he
be
go
i
go
and
found

and
told
him
what

happen
i
held
up
the
folder
i
stole
this
from
his
briefcase
i
say
you
do
what
woodell
say
he
start
to
act
appalled
but
he
be
just
as
curious
as
i
be
about
the
folder
s
content
together
we
open
it
and
laid
it
on
his
desk
and
found

among
other
thing
a
list
of
eighteen
athletic
shoe
distributor
across
the
united
state
and
a
schedule
of
appointment
with

one
marlboro
man
twenty
more
rise
up
to
take
his
place
i
be
outrage
of
course
but
mostly
hurt
for
seven
year
we
d
devote
ourselves
to
tiger
shoe
we
d
introduce
them
to
america

d
reinvent
the
line

and
their
design
be
now
foundational
set
sale
record
change
the
face
of
the
industry
and
this
be
how
we
be
repaid
and
now
i
say
to
woodell
i
have
to
go
meet
this
juda
for
cocktail
first
i
go
for
a
six
mile
run
i
don
t
know
when
i
ve
run
harder
or
be
less
present
in
my
body
with
each
stride
i
yell
at
the
tree
scream
at
the
cobweb
hang
in
the
branch
it
help
by
the
time
i
d
shower
and
dress
and
driven
to
meet
kitami
at
his
hotel
i
be
almost
serene
or
maybe
i
be
in
shock
what
kitami
say
during
that
hour
together
what
i
say
no
memory
the
next
thing
i
remember
be
this
the
follow
morning
when
kitami
come
to
the
office
woodell
and
i
ran
a
sort
of
shell
game
while
someone
whisk
kitami
into
the
coffee
room
woodell
block
the
door
to
my
office
with
his
wheelchair
and
i
slid
the
folder
back
into
the
briefcase
on
the
last
day
of
kitami
s
visit
hour
before
the
big
dinner
party
i
hurry
down
to
eugene
to
confer
with
bowerman
and
his
lawyer
jaqua
i
left
penny
to
drive
kitami
down
later
in
the
day
think
what
s
the
bad
that
could
happen
cut
to
penny
hair
dishevel
dress
smear
with
grease
pull
up
to
bowerman
s
house
as
she
stumble
out
of
the
car
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
kitami
have
attack
her
but
she
take
me
aside
and
explain
that
they
d
have
a
flat
that
son
of
a
bitch
she
whisper
stayed
in
the
car
on
the
highway
and
let
me
fix
the
tire
all
by
myself
i
steer
her
inside
we
both
need
something
strong
to
drink
this
wasn
t
a
simple
matter
however
mr
bowerman
a
devout
christian
scientist
didn
t
normally
allow
alcohol
in
her
home
she
be
make
an
exception
on
this
special
night
but
she
d
ask
me
ahead
of
time
to
please
be
sure
that
everyone

and
no
one
overdid
it
so
though
my
wife
and
i
both
need
a
stiff
one
i
be
force
to
make
it
a
small
one
mr
bowerman
now
gather
us
all
in
the
living
room
in
honor
of
our
distinguish
guest
she
announce
tonight
we
be
serve
mai
tai
applause
kitami
and
i
still
have
at
least
one
thing
in
common
we
both
like
mai
tai
very
much
something
about
them
remind
each
of
us
of
hawaii
that
wonderful
layover
between
the
west
coast
and
japan
where
you
could
unwind
before
go
back
into
the
long
workday
still
he
and
i
stop
at
one
that
even
mindful
of
mr
bowerman
so
do
everyone
else
everyone
but
bowerman
he
d
never
be
much
of
a
drinker
and
he
d
certainly
never
taste
a
mai
tai
before
and
we
all
watch
in
dread
and
dismay
as
the
drink
take
effect
and
then
some
something
about
that
tangy
combination
of
cura
ao
and
lime
juice
pineapple
and
rum
hit
bowerman
right
on
the
screw
after
two
mai
tai
he
be
a
different
person
as
he
try
to
fix
his
third
mai
tai
he
bellow
we
re
out
of
ice
no
one
answer
so
he
answer
himself
no
problem
he
march
out
to
the
garage
to
the
large
meat
freezer
and
grabbed
a
bag
of
frozen
blueberry
he
tore
it
open
scatter
blueberry
everywhere
he
then
toss
a
huge
handful
of
frozen
blueberry
into
his
drink
taste
well
this
way
he
announce
return
to
the
living
room
now
he
walk
around
the
room
slop
handful
of
frozen
blueberry
into
everyone
s
glass
sit
he
begin
to
tell
a
story
which
seem
in
highly
questionable
taste
it
built
to
a
crescendo
i
fear
we
d
all
remember
for
year
to
come
that
be
if
we
could
understand
the
crescendo
bowerman
s
word
normally
so
crisp
so
precise
be
grow
squishy
around
the
edge
mr
bowerman
glare
at
me
but
what
could
i
do
i
shrug
my
shoulder
and
thought
you
married
him
and
then
i
thought
oh
wait
so
do
i
back
when
the
bowermans
attend
the
olympics
in
japan
mr
bowerman
have
fall
in
love
with
nashi
pear
which
be
like
small
green
apple
only
sweeter
they
don
t
grow
in
the
united
state
so
she
smuggle
a
few
seed
home
in
her
purse
and
plant
them
in
her
garden
every
few
year
she
told
kitami
when
the
nashis
bloom
they
refresh
her
love
of
all
thing
japanese
he
seem
quite
beguile
by
this
story
och
bowerman
say
exasperate
japples
i
put
a
hand
over
my
eye
finally
come
the
moment
when
i
thought
the
party
might
spin
out
of
control
when
i
wonder
if
we
might
actually
need
to
call
the
cop
i
look
across
the
room
and
spot
jaqua
sit
beside
his
wife
glare
at
kitami
i
knew
that
jaqua
have
be
a
fighter
pilot
in
the
war
that
his
wingman
one
of
his
closest
friend
have
be
shot
out
of
the
sky
by
a
japanese
zero
in
fact
jaqua
and
his
wife
have
name
their
first
child
after
that
dead
wingman
and
i
suddenly
regret
tell
jaqua
about
kitami
s
folder
of
betrayal
i
perceive
something
bubbling
inside
jaqua
and
rise
to
his
throat
and
i
sense
the
real
possibility
that
bowerman
s
lawyer
and
best
friend
and
neighbor
might
stand
and
march
across
the
room
and
sock
kitami
in
the
jaw
the
one
person
who
seem
to
be
have
an
uncomplicatedly
wonderful
time
be
kitami
go
be
the
angry
kitami
from
the
bank
go
be
the
scold
kitami
from
my
office
talk
laugh
slap
his
knee
he
be
so
personable
that
i
wonder
what
might
have
happen
if
i
d
give
him
a
mai
tai
before
drive
him
over
to
first
national
late
in
the
even
he
spot
something
across
the
room
a
guitar
it
belong
to
one
of
bowerman
s
three
son
kitami
walk
over
picked
it
up
and
begin
to
finger
the
string
then
strum
them
he
carry
the
guitar
to
a
short
flight
of
step
that
lead
from
the
bowermans
sunken
living
room
to
their
din
room
and
stand
on
the
top
step
start
to
play
and
sing
all
head
turn
conversation
cease
it
be
a
country
western
song
of
some
sort
but
kitami
perform
it
like
a
traditional
japanese
folk
song
he
sound
like
buck
owen
on
a
koto
harp
then
without
any
segue
he
switch
to
o
sole
mio
i
recall
think
be
he
really
sing
o
sole
mio
he
sang
it
louder
o
sole
mio
sta
nfronte
a
te
o
sole
o
sole
mio
sta
nfronte
a
te
a
japanese
businessman
strum
a
western
guitar
sing
an
italian
ballad
in
the
voice
of
an
irish
tenor
it
be
surreal
then
a
few
mile
past
surreal
and
it
didn
t
stop
i
d
never
know
there
be
so
many
verse
to
o
sole
mio
i
d
never
know
a
roomful
of
active
restless
oregonian
could
sit
so
still
and
quiet
for
so
long
when
he
set
down
the
guitar
we
all
try
not
to
make
eye
contact
with
each
other
as
we
give
him
a
big
hand
i
clapped
and
clapped
and
it
all
make
sense
for
kitami
this
trip
to
the
united
state
the
visit
to
the
bank
the
meeting
with
me

dinner
with
the
bowermans
wasn
t
about
blue

nor
be

like
everything
else

be
all
about

secret
mission

some
consult
work
for
blue
ribbon
and
now
i
huddle
with
him
and
try
to
decide
my
next
move
before
kitami
s
return
we
agree
that
the
best
thing
to
do
be
keep
the
peace
try
to
convince
kitami
not
to
leave
us
not
to
abandon
us
as
angry
and
wound
as
i
be
i
need
to
accept
that
blue
ribbon
would
be
lose
without
onitsuka
i
need
hayes
say
to
stick
with
the
devil
i
knew
and
persuade
him
to
stick
with
the
devil
he
knew
later
that
week
when
the
devil
return
i
invite
him
out
to
tigard
for
one
more
visit
before
his
flight
home
again
i
try
to
rise
above
it
all
i
brought
him
into
the
conference
room
and
with
woodell
and
i
on
one
side
of
the
table
and
kitami
and
his
assistant
iwano
on
the
other
i
screw
a
big
smile
onto
my
face
and
say
that
we
hop
he
d
enjoy
his
visit
to
our
country
he
say
yet
again
that
he
be
disappointed
in
the
performance
of
blue
ribbon
this
time
however
he
say
he
have
a
solution
shoot
i
say
sell
us
your
company
he
say
it
so
very
softly
the
thought
cross
my
mind
that
some
of
the
hardest
thing
ever
say
in
our
lifetime
be
say
softly
excuse
me
i
say
onitsuka
co
ltd
will
buy
control
interest
in
blue
ribbon
fifty
one
percent
it
be
best
deal
for
your
company
and
you
you
would
be
wise
to
accept
a
takeover
a
hostile
freak
takeover
i
look
at
the
ceiling
you
gotta
be
kid
i
thought
of
all
the
arrogant
underhanded
ungrateful
bullying
and
if
we
do
not
we
will
have
no
choice
but
to
set
up
superior
distributor
superior
uh
huh
i
see
and
what
about
our
write
agreement
he
shrug
so
much
for
agreement
i
couldn
t
let
my
mind
go
to
any
of
those
place
it
be
try
to
go
i
couldn
t
tell
kitami
what
i
thought
of
him
or
where
to
stick
his
offer
because
hayes
be
right
i
still
need
him
i
have
no
backup
no
plan
b
no
exit
strategy
if
i
be
go
to
save
blue
ribbon
i
need
to
do
it
slowly
on
my
own
schedule
so
as
not
to
spook
customer
and
retailer
i
need
time
and
therefore
i
need
onitsuka
to
keep
send
me
shoe
for
as
long
as
possible
well
i
say
fight
to
control
my
voice
i
have
a
partner
of
course
coach
bowerman
i
ll
have
to
discus
your
offer
with
him
i
be
certain
kitami
would
see
through
this
amateurish
stall
but
he
rise
hitch
his
pant
and
smile
talk
it
over
with
dr
bowerman
get
back
to
me
i
want
to
hit
him
instead
i
shook
his
hand
he
and
iwano
walk
out
in
the
suddenly
kitami
less
conference
room
woodell
and
i
star
into
the
grain
of
the
conference
table
and
let
the
stillness
settle
over
us
i
sent
my
budget
and
forecast
for
the
come
year
to
first
national
with
my
standard
credit
request
i
want
to
send
a
note
of
apology
beg
forgiveness
for
the
kitami
debacle
but
i
knew
white
would
roll
with
it
and
besides
wallace
hadn
t
be
there
day
after
white
get
my
budget
and
forecast
he
told
me
to
come
on
down
he
be
ready
to
talk
thing
over
i
wasn
t
in
the
hard
little
chair
across
from
his
desk
more
than
two
second
before
he
deliver
the
news
phil
i
m
afraid
first
national
will
not
be
able
to
do
business
any
longer
with
blue
ribbon
we
will
issue
no
more
letter
of
credit
on
your
behalf
we
will
pay
off
your
last
remain
shipment
as
they
come
in
with
what
remains
in
your
account
but
when
that
last
bill
be
paid
our
relationship
will
be
terminate
i
could
see
by
white
s
waxy
pallor
that
he
be
stricken
he
d
have
no
part
in
this
this
be
come
from
on
high

i
spread
my
arm

do
harry

down
at
his

them
fasten
them
with
a
paper
clip
he
told
me
that
the
question
of
blue
ribbon
have
deeply
divide
the
bank
officer
some
be
for
us
some
be
against
ultimately
it
be
wallace
who
d
cast
the
decide
vote
i
m
sick
about
this
white
say

that
option
i
stagger
out
of

say
they
have
no
desire
to
buy
first

secondhand
problem
three

company
born
from
nothing
and
now
finish
with
sale
of

with
my
father

with
every
other

a
charter

western
state
include
oregon

the
storm
and
a
small
line
of
credit

d
think
they

desperately
to
help
me
why
for
starter
nissho

huge
volume
on
low
net
margin

therefore
it
love
growth
company
with
big
upside
that
be
us
in
spade
in
the
eye
of
wallace
and
first
national
we
d
be
a
land
mine
to
nissho
we
be
a
potential
gold
mine

sumeragi
look
strikingly
like
the
great
film
actor
toshiro
mifune
who
be
famous
for
his
portrayal
of
miyamoto
musashi
the
epic
samurai
duelist
and
author
of
a
timeless
manual
on
combat
and
inner
strength
the
book
of
five
ring
sumeragi
look
most
like
the
actor
when
lipping
a
lucky
strike
and
he
lipped
them
a
lot
twice
as
much
when
he
drank
unlike
hayes
however
who
drank
because
he
like
the
way
booze
make
him
feel
sumeragi
drank
because
he
be
lonely
in
america
almost
every
even
after
work
he
d
head
to
the
blue
house
a
japanese
bar
restaurant
and
talk
in
his
native
tongue
with
the
mama
san
which
just
make
him
lonelier
he
told
me
that
nissho
be
willing
to
take
a
second
position
to
the
bank
on
their
loan
that
would
certainly
quell
my
banker
he
also
offer
this
nugget
of
information
nissho
have
recently
dispatch
a
delegation
to
kobe
to
investigate
financing
shoe
for
us
and
to
convince
onitsuka
to
let
such
a
deal
go
through
but
onitsuka
have
thrown
the
nissho
delegation
out
on
their
ass
a
million
company
throw
out
a
billion
company
nissho
be
embarrass
and
angry
we
can
introduce
you
to
many
quality
sport
shoe
manufacturer
in
japan
sumeragi
say
smile
i
ponder
i
still
held
out
some
hope
that
onitsuka
would
come
to
its
sens
and
i
worried
about
a
paragraph
in
our
write
agreement
that
forbade
me
from
import
other
brand
of
track
and
field
shoe
maybe
down
the
road
i
say
sumeragi
nod
all
in
good
time
reel
from
all
this
drama
i
be
deeply
tire
when
i
return
home
each
night
but
i
d
always
get
a
second
wind
after
my
six
mile
run
follow
by
a
hot
shower
and
a
quick
dinner
alone
penny
and
matthew
ate
around
four
i
d
always
try
to
find
time
to
tell
matthew
a
bedtime
story
and
i
d
always
try
to
find
a
bedtime
story
that
would
be
educational
i
invent
a
character
call
matt
history
who
look
and
act
a
lot
like
matthew
knight
and
i
insert
him
into
the
center
of
every
yarn
matt
history
be
there
at
valley
forge
with
george

a
precocious
young
horseman
from
the
suburb
of
portland
oregon
matthew
would
always
laugh
delighted
to
find
himself
caught
up
in
these
adventure
he
d
sit
up
straighter
in
bed
he
d
beg
for
more
more
when
matthew
be
asleep
penny
and
i
would
talk
about
the
day
she
d
often
ask
what
we
be
go
to
do
if

all
go
south
i
d
say
i
can
always
fall
back
on
accounting
i
do
not
sound
sincere
because
i
wasn
t
i
be
not
delighted
to
be
caught
up
in
these
adventure
eventually
penny
would
look
away
watch
tv
resume
her
needlepoint
or
read
and
i
d
retreat
to
my
recliner
where
i
d
administer
the
nightly
self
catechism
what
do
you
know
i
know
onitsuka
can
t
be
trust
what
else
do
you
know
i
know
my
relationship
with
kitami
can
t
be
salvage
what
do
the
future
hold
one
way
or
another
blue
ribbon
and
onitsuka
be
go
to
break
up
i
just
need
to
stay
together
as
long
as
possible
while
i
develop
other
supply
source
so
i
can
manage
the
breakup
what
s
step
one
i
need
to
scare
off
all
the
other
distributor
onitsuka
have
line
up
to
replace
me
blast
them
right
out
of
the
water
by
fire
off
letter
threaten
to
sue
if
they
breach
my
contract
what
s
step
two
find
my
own
replacement
for
onitsuka
i
flash
on
a
factory
i
d
heard
about
in
guadalajara
the
one
where
adidas
have
manufacture
shoe
during
the
olympics
allegedly
to
skirt
mexican
tariff
the
shoe
be
good
as
i
recall
so
i
set
up
a
meeting
with
the
factory
manager
even
though
it
be
in
central
mexico
the
factory
be
call
canada
right
away
i
ask
the
manager
why
they
chose
the
name
they
say
because
it
sound
foreign
exotic
i
laugh
canada
exotic
it
be
more
comic
than
exotic
not
to
mention
confuse
a
factory
south
of
the
border
name
for
a
country
north
of
the
border
oh
well
i
didn
t
care
after
look
the
place
over
after
take
inventory
of
their
present
line
of
shoe
after
survey
their
leather
room
i
be
impressed
the
factory
be
big
clean
well
run
plus
it
be
adidas
endorse
i
told
them
i
d
like
to
place
an
order
three
thousand
pair
of
leather
soccer
shoe
which
i
plan
to
sell
as
football
shoe
the
factory
owner
ask
me
about
the
name
of
my
brand
i
told
them
i
d
have
to
get
back
to
them
on
that
they
hand
me
the
contract
i
look
at
the
dot
line
above
my
name
pen
in
hand
i
pause
the
question
be
now
officially
on
the
table
be
this
a
violation
of
my
deal
with
onitsuka
technically
no
my
deal
say
i
could
import
only
onitsuka
track
and
field
shoe
no
others
it
say
nothing
about
import
someone
else
s
football
shoe
so
i
knew
this
contract
with
canada
wouldn
t
violate
the
letter
of
my
onitsuka
deal
but
the
spirit
six
month
previously
i
would
never
have
do
this
thing
be
different
now
onitsuka
have
already
broken
the
spirit
of
our
deal
and
my
spirit
so
i
pull
the
cap
off
my
pen
and
sign
the
contract
i
sign
the
heck
out
of
that
canada
contract
then
i
go
out
for
mexican
food
now
about
that
logo
my
new
soccer
qua
football
shoe
would
need
something
to
set
it
apart
from
the
stripe
of
adidas
and
onitsuka
i
recall
that
young
artist
i
d
met
at
portland
state
what
be
her
name
oh

sense
of

say
dubious

confuse
of

d
give
it
a
try

two
week
later

back
with
a
portfolio
of
rough
sketch
they
be
all
variation
on
a
single
theme
and
the
theme
seem
to
be
fat
lightning
bolt
chubby
check
mark
morbidly
obese
squiggle
her
design
do
evoke
motion
of
a
kind
but
also
motion
sickness
none
spoke
to
me
i
single
out
a
few
that
held
out
some
promise
and
ask
her

across

a
few
on
the
wall
she
d
do
several
dozen
more
variation
on
the
original
theme
but
with
a
freer
hand
these
be
well
closer
woodell
and
i
and
a
few
others
look
them
over
i
remember
johnson
be
there
too
though
why
he
d
come
out
from
wellesley
i
can
t
recall
gradually
we
inched
toward
a
consensus
we
like
this
one
slightly
more
than
the
others
it
look
like
a
wing
one
of
us
say
it
look
like
a
whoosh
of
air
another
say
it
look
like
something
a
runner
might
leave
in
his
or
her
wake
we
all
agree
it
look
new
fresh
and
yet
somehow
ancient
timeless
for
her
many
hour
of
work
we
give
carolyn
our
deepest
thanks
and
a
check
for
thirty
five
dollar
then
sent
her
on
her
way
after
she
left
we
continued
to
sit
and
stare
at
this
one
logo
which
we
d
sort
of
select
and
sort
of
settle
on
by
default
something

about
it
johnson
say
woodell
agree

but
me

on
my
pad

tick
tock
i
need
to
telex
the
factory
now
i
hat
make
decision
in
a
hurry
and
that
s
all
i
seem
to
do
in
those
day
i
look
to
the
ceiling
i
give
myself
two
more
minute
to
mull
over
the
different
option
then
walk
down
the
hall
to
the
telex
machine
i
sat
before
it
give
myself
three
more
minute
reluctantly
i
punch
out
the
message
name
of
new
brand
be
a
lot
of
thing
be
roll
around
in
my
head
consciously
unconsciously
first
johnson
have
point
out
that
seemingly
all
iconic
brand
clorox
kleenex
xerox
have
short
name
two
syllable
or
less
and
they
always
have
a
strong
sound
in
the
name
a
letter
like
k
or
x
that
stick
in
the
mind
that
all
make
sense
and
that
all
described
nike
also
i
like
that
nike
be
the
goddess
of
victory
what
s
more
important
i
thought
than
victory
i
might
have
heard
in
the
far
recess
of
my
mind
churchill
s
voice
you
ask
what
be
our
aim
i
can
answer
in
one
word
it
be
victory
i
might
have
recall
the
victory
medal
award
to
all
veteran
of
world
war
ii
a
bronze
medallion
with
athena
nike
on
the
front
break
a
sword
in
two
i
might
have
sometimes
i
believe
that
i
do
but
in
the
end
i
don
t
really
know
what
lead
me
to
my
decision
luck
instinct
some
inner
spirit
yes
what
d
you
decide
woodell
ask
me
at
the
end
of
the
day
nike
i
mumble
hm
he
say
yeah
i
know
i
say
maybe
it
ll
grow
on
us
he
say
maybe
my
brand
new
relationship
with
nissho
be
promising
but
it
be
brand
new
and
who
would
dare
predict
how
it
might
evolve
i
d
once
felt
the
relationship
with
onitsuka
be
promising
and
look
where
that
stood
nissho
be
infuse
me
with
cash
but
i
couldn
t
let
that
make
me
complacent
i
need
to
develop
as
many
source
of
cash
as
possible
which
brought
me
back
to
the
idea
of
a
public
offering
i
didn
t
think
i
could
withstand
the
disappointment
of
a
second
fail
offering
so
i
plot
with
hayes
to
ensure
that
this
one
would
work
we
decide
that
the
first
offering
hadn
t
be
aggressive
enough
we
hadn
t
sell
ourselves
this
time
we
hire
a
hard
drive
salesman
also
this
time
we
decide
not
to
sell
stock
but
convertible
debenture
if
business
truly
be
war
without
bullet
then
debenture
be
war
bond
the
public
loan
you
money
and
in
exchange
you
give
them
quasi
stock
in
your
cause
the
stock
be
quasi
because
debenture
holder
be
strongly
encourage
and
incentivized
to
hold
their
share
for
five
year
after
that
they
can
convert
the
share
to
common
stock
or
get
their
money
back
with
interest
with
our
new
plan
and
our
gung
ho
salesman
we
announce
in
june
that
blue
ribbon
would
be
offering
two
hundred
thousand
share
of
debenture
at
one
dollar
per
and
this
time
the
share
sell
fast
one
of
the
first
to
buy
be
my
friend
cale
who
didn
t
hesitate
to
cut
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollar
a
princely
sum
buck
he
say
i
be
there
at
the
start
i
ll
be
there
at
the
bitter
end
canada
be
a
letdown
the
factory
s
leather
football
shoe
be
pretty
but
in
cold
weather
its
sole
split
and
crack
irony
upon
irony
a
shoe
make
in
a
factory
call
canada
which
couldn
t
take
the
cold
then
again
maybe
it
be
our
fault
use
a
soccer
shoe
for
football
maybe
we
be
ask
for
it
the
quarterback
for
notre
dame
wore
a
pair
that
season
and
it
be
a
thrill
to
see
him
trot
onto
that
hallow
gridiron
at
south
bend
in
a
pair
of
nike
until
those
nike
disintegrate
just
like
the
irish
do
that
year
job
one
therefore
be
find
a
factory
that
could
make
sturdier
more
weather
resistant
shoe
nissho
say
they
could
help
they
be
only
too
happy
to
help
they
be
beef
up
their
commodity
department
so
sumeragi
have
a
wealth
of
information
about
factory
around
the
world
he
d
also
recently
hire
a
consultant
a
bona
fide
shoe
wizard
who
d
be
a
disciple
of
jonas
senter
i
d
never
heard
of
senter
but
sumeragi
assure
me
the
man
be
a
genuine
head
to
toe
shoe
dog
i
d
heard
this
phrase
a
few
time
shoe
dog
be
people
who
devote
themselves
wholly
to
the
make
sell
buying
or
design
of
shoe
lifer
use
the
phrase
cheerfully
to
describe
other
lifer
men
and
woman
who
have
toil
so
long
and
hard
in
the
shoe
trade
they
thought
and
talk
about
nothing
else
it
be
an
all
consume
mania
a
recognizable
psychological
disorder
to
care
so
much
about
insole
and
outsole
lining
and
welt
rivet
and
vamp
but
i
understood
the
average
person
take
seventy
five
hundred
step
a
day
million
step
over
the
course
of
a
long
life
the
equivalent
of
six
time
around
the
globe
shoe
dog
it
seem
to
me
simply
want
to
be
part
of
that
journey
shoe
be
their
way
of
connect
with
humanity
what
well
way
of
connect
shoe
dog
thought
than
by
refining
the
hinge
that
join
each
person
to
the
world
s
surface
i
felt
an
unusual
sympathy
for
such
sad
case
i
wonder
how
many
i
might
have
met
in
my
travel
the
shoe
market
just
then
be
flood
with
knockoff
adidas
and
it
be
senter
who
d
unleashed
the
flood
he
be
the
knockoff
king
apparently
he
also
knew
everything
worth
know
about
asia
s
legitimate
shoe
trade
factory
import
export
he
d
help
set
up
a
shoe
division
for
mitsubishi
japan
s
large
trading
company
nissho
couldn
t
hire
senter
himself
for
various
reason
so
they
d
hire
senter
s
prot
g
a
man
name
sole
really
i
say
a
shoe
guy
name
sole
before
meeting
sole
before
go
any
far
with
nissho
i
consider
if
i
be
walk
into
another
trap
if
i
partner
with
nissho
i
d
soon
be
into
them
for
a
lot
of
money
if
they
also
become
the
source
of
all
our
footwear
i
would
then
be
even
more
vulnerable
to
them
than
i
have
be
to
onitsuka
and
if
they
turn
out
to
be
as
aggressive
as
onitsuka
it
would
be
light
out
at
bowerman
s
suggestion
i
talk
it
over
with
jaqua
and
he
saw
the
conundrum
quite
a
pickle
he
say
he
didn
t
know
what
to
advise
but
he
knew
someone
who
would
his
brother
in
law
chuck
robinson
be
ceo
of
marcona
mining
which
have
joint
venture
all
over
the
world
each
of
the
big
eight
japanese
trading
company
be
a
partner
in
at
least
one
of
marcona
s
mine
so
chuck
be
arguably
the
west
s
lead
expert
on
do
business
with
these
guy
i
finagle
a
meeting
with
chuck
at
his
office
in
san
francisco
and
found
myself
wildly
intimidate
from
the
moment
i
walk
in
the
door
i
be
agog
at
his
office
s
size
big
than
my
house
and
at
its
view
window
overlook
all
of
san
francisco
bay
with
enormous
tanker
glide
slowly
to
and
from
the
world
s
great
port
and
line
the
wall
be
scale
model
of
marcona
s
tanker
fleet
which
supply
coal
and
other
mineral
to
every
corner
of
the
globe
only
a
man
of
enormous
power
and
brain
could
command
such
a
redoubt
i
stammer
through
my
presentation
but
chuck
still
manage
to
quickly
get
the
drift
he
boil
my
complicate
situation
down
to
a
compelling
pr
ci
if
the
japanese
trading
company
understands
the
rule
from
the
first
day
he
say
they
will
be
the
best
partner
you
ll
ever
have
reassure
embolden
i
go
back
to
sumeragi
and
told
him
the
rule
no
equity
in
my
company
ever
he
go
away
and
consult
with
a
few
people
in
his
office
upon
return
he
say
no
problem
but
here
s
our
deal
we
take
four
percent
off
the
top
as
a
markup
on
product
and
market
interest
rate
on
top
of
that
i
nod
day
later
sumeragi
sent
sole
to
meet
me
give
the
man
s
reputation
i
be
expect
some
kind
of
godlike
figure
with
fifteen
arm
each
one
wave
a
wand
make
out
of
shoe
tree
but
sole
be
a
plain
ordinary
middle
age
businessman
with
a
new
york
accent
and
a
sharkskin
suit
not
my
kind
of
guy
and
i
wasn
t
his
kind
either
and
yet
we
have
no
trouble
find
common
ground
shoe
sport
plus
an
abide
distaste
for
kitami
when
i
mention
kitami
s
name
sole
scoffed
the
man
s
an
as
we
re
go
to
be
fast
friend
i
thought
sole
promise
to
help
me
beat
kitami
get
free
of
him
i
can
solve
all
your
problem
he
say
i
know
factory
factory
that
can
make
nike
i
ask
hand
him
my
new
football
shoe
i
can
think
of
five
off
the
top
of
my
head
he
say
he
be
adamant
he
seem
to
have
two
mental
state
adamant
and
dismissive
i
realize
that
he
be
sell
me
that
he
want
my
business
but
i
be
willing
to
be
sell
and
more
than
ready
to
be
want
the
five
factory
sole
mention
be
all
in
japan
so
sumeragi
and
i
decide
to
go
there
and
look
them
over
in
september
sole
agree
to
be
our
guide
a
week
before
we
be
to
leave
sumeragi
phone
mr
sole
have
suffer
a
heart
attack
he
say
oh
no
i
say
he
s
expect
to
recover
sumeragi
say
but
travel
at
this
time
be
impossible
his
son
who
be
very
capable
will
take
his
place
sumeragi
sound
as
if
he
be
try
to
convince
himself
more
than
me
i
flew
alone
to
japan
and
met
sumeragi
and
sole
jr
at
nissho
s
office
in
tokyo
i
be
take
aback
when
sole
jr
step
forward
hand
outstretched
i
assume
he
d
be
young
but
he
look
like
a
teenager
i
have
a
hunch
he
d
be
dress
in
sharkskin
like
his
father
and
he
be
but
his
suit
be
three
size
too
big
be
it
in
fact
his
father
s
and
like
so
many
teen
he
start
every
sentence
with
i
i
think
this
i
think
that
i
i
i
i
shot
a
glance
at
sumeragi
he
look
gravely
concerned
the
first
of
the
factory
we
want
to
see
be
outside
hiroshima
all
three
of
us
go
there
by
train
arrive
midday
a
cool
overcast
afternoon
we
weren
t
due
at
the
factory
until
the
next
morning
so
i
felt
it
important
to
take
the
extra
time
and
visit
the
museum
and
i
want
to
go
by
myself
i
told
sumeragi
and
sole
jr
i
would
meet
them
in
the
hotel
lobby
the
follow
morning
walk
through
those
museum
room
i
couldn
t
take
it
all
in
i
couldn
t
process
it
mannequin
dress
in
sing
clothes
clump
of
scorch
irradiate
jewelry
cookware
i
couldn
t
tell
photo
that
take
me
to
a
place
far
beyond
emotion
i
stood
in
horror
before
a
child
s
liquefy
tricycle
i
stood
open
mouth
before
the
blacken
skeleton
of
a
building
where
people
have
love
and
work
and
laugh
until
i
try
to
feel
and
hear
the
moment
of
impact
i
felt
sick
at
heart
as
i
turn
a
corner
and
come
upon
a
scorch
shoe
under
glass
the
footprint
of
its
owner
still
visible
the
next
morning
these
ghastly
image
still
fresh
in
my
head
i
be
somber
heavily
subdue
as
i
drove
with
sumeragi
and
sole
jr
into
the
countryside
and
i
be
almost
startle
by
the
good
cheer
of
the
factory
official
they
be
delighted
to
meet
us
to
show
us
their
ware
also
they
say
forthrightly
they
be
most
eager

with
the
exception
of

i
d
always
found
the
japanese
unfailingly
polite
even
in
the
heat
of
disagreement
or
intense
negotiation
and
i
d
always
strive
to
reciprocate
but
in
hiroshima
of
all
place
i
felt
that
politeness
be
that
much
more
essential
here
if
nowhere
else
on
earth
human
should
be
gentle
and

city
drank
sapporo
and
sake
ate
yakitori
and
dream
of

i
revisit
the
meiji
garden
and

beneath

ginkgo
beside
the
torii

but
they
be
close
they
have
trust
me
enough
to
give
me
a
pas
however
so
i
let
myself
in
and
sat
in
a
big
room
amid
row
and
row
of
empty
desk
inspect
the
sample
i
held
them
to
the
light
turn
them
this
way
and
that
i
ran
my
finger
along
the
sol
along
the
check
or
wing
or
whatever
our
new
side
stripe
would
be
call
they
be
not
perfect
the
logo
on
this
shoe
wasn
t
quite
straight
the
midsole
on
that
shoe
be
a
bit
too
thin
there
should
be
more
lift
on
this
other
one
i
make
note
for
the
factory
official
but
minor
imperfection
aside
they
be
very
good
at
last
the
only
thing
to
do
be
think
up
name
for
the
different
model
i
be
panicked
i
d
do
such
a
poor
job

for
my
new
brand
dimension
six
everyone
at
blue
ribbon
still
mocked
me
i
d

savant
like

now
i
be
on
my
own
in
an

to
trust
myself

held
up
the
tennis
shoe

decide
to
call
it
the
wimbledon
well
that
be
easy
i
held

set
for
the
first
u

held
up
a
basketball
shoe
i
call

the
blazer
after
my
hometown
nba
team
i
held
up
another
basketball
shoe

best
college
basketball
team
of

from
it
take
a
half
hour
to
name
them

like
coleridge

kubla
khan
in
an
opium
daze
i
then
mail
my
name
off
to

dark
as

over
me
unlike

i
d
ever
experienced
i
felt
spent
but
proud
i
felt
drain
but
exhilarate
i
felt
everything
i
ever
hop
to
feel
after
a
day

work
i
felt
like
an
artist
a
creator
i
look
back
over
my
shoulder
take
one
last
look
at

in
their
neighborhood
and
didn
t
stop
by
they
d
know

for
them

find
out
or
figure
out
that
i
be
line
up

extra
layer
of
complexity
i
look
around

and
thought

enemy

spy
some
life
though
the
tone
be
friendly
cordial
i
could
feel
the
tangle
subtext
of
every
remark
it
be
like
a
loose
wire
buzzing
and
spark
in
the
background
i
kept
wait
for
kitami
to
come
out
with

press
me
for

from
the
folder
in
kitami

briefcase
still
it
be
nice
to

an
ally
so

pillow
he
use
my
toothbrush
as
soon
as
i
get
back
to
oregon
i
invite
bowerman
up
to
portland
to
meet
with
me
and
woodell
talk
about
the
state
of
the
business
it
seem
like
any
old
meeting
at
some
point
in
the
course
of
conversation
woodell
and
i
point
out
that
the
outer
sole
of
the
training
shoe
hadn
t
change
in
fifty
year
the
tread
be
still
just
wave
or
groove
across
the
bottom
of
the
foot
the
cortez
and
boston
be
breakthrough
in
cushion
and
nylon
revolutionary
in
upper
construction
but
there
hadn
t
be
a
single
innovation
in
outer
sol
since
before
the
great
depression
bowerman
nod
he
make
a
note
he
didn
t
seem
all
that
interested
as
i
recall
once
we
d
cover
all
the
new
business
on
the
agenda
bowerman
told
us
that
a
wealthy
alum
have
just
donate
a
million
dollar
to
oregon
earmark
for
a
new
track
the
world
s
fine
his
voice
rise
bowerman
described
the
surface
he
d
create
with
that
windfall
it
be
polyurethane
the
same
spongy
surface
that
be
to
be
use
in
munich
in
the
olympics
where
bowerman
be
on
tap
to
be
head
coach
of
the
track
team
he
be
pleased
and
yet
he
say
he
be
far
from
satisfied
his
runner
still
weren
t
get
the
full
benefit
of
this
new
surface
their
shoe
still
weren
t
grip
it
right
on
the
two
hour
drive
back
to
eugene
bowerman
mull
what
woodell
and
i
have
say
and
mull
his
problem
with
the
new
track
and
these
two
problem
simmer
and
congeal
in
his
thought
the
follow
sunday
sit
over
breakfast
with
his
wife
bowerman
s
gaze
drift
to
her
waffle
iron
he
note
the
waffle
iron
s
gridded
pattern
it
conform
with
a
certain
pattern
in
his
mind
s
eye
a
pattern
he
d
be
see
or
seek
for
month
if
not
year
he
ask
mr
bowerman
if
he
could
borrow
it
he
have
a
vat
of
urethane
in
his
garage
left
over
from
the
installation
of
the
track
he
carry
the
waffle
iron
out
to
the
garage
fill
it
with
urethane
heat
it
up
and
promptly
ruin
it
the
urethane
seal
it
shut
because
bowerman
hadn
t
add
a
chemical
release
agent
he
didn
t
know
from
chemical
release
agent
another
person
would
have
quit
right
then
but
bowerman
s
brain
also
didn
t
have
a
release
agent
he
bought
another
waffle
iron
and
this
time
fill
it
with
plaster
and
when
the
plaster
harden
the
jaw
of
the
waffle
iron
open
no
problem
he
take
the
result
mold
to
the
oregon
rubber
company
and
paid
them
to
pour
liquid
rubber
into
it
another
failure
the
rubber
mold
be
too
rigid
too
brittle
it
broke
right
away
but
bowerman
felt
he
be
get
closer
he
give
up
the
waffle
iron
altogether
instead
he
take
a
sheet
of
stainless
steel
and
punch
it
with
hole
create
a
waffle
like
surface
and
brought
this
back
to
the
rubber
company
the
mold
they
make
from
that
steel
sheet
be
pliable
workable
and
bowerman
now
have
two
foot
size
square
of
hard
rubber
nub
which
he
brought
home
and
sew
to
the
sole
of
a
pair
of
run
shoe
he
give
these
to
one
of
his
runner
the
runner
lace
them
on
and
ran
like
a
rabbit
bowerman
phone
me
excite
and
told
me
about
his
experiment
he
want
me
to
send
a
sample
of
his
waffle
sole
shoe
to
one
of
my
new
factory
of
course
i
say
i
d
send
it
right
away
to
nippon
rubber
i
look
back
over
the
decade
and
see
him
toil
in
his
workshop
mr
bowerman
carefully
help
and
i
get
goosebump
he
be
edison
in
menlo
park
da
vinci
in
florence
tesla
in
wardenclyffe
divinely
inspire
i
wonder
if
he
knew
if
he
have
any
clue
that
he
be
the
daedalus
of
sneaker
that
he
be
make
history
remake
an
industry
transform
the
way
athlete
would
run
and
stop
and
jump
for
generation
i
wonder
if
he
could
conceive
in
that
moment
all
that
he
d
do
all
that
would
follow
i
know
i
couldn
t

everything
depend
on
chicago
our
every
thought
our
every
conversation
at
the
start
of
begin
and
end
with
chicago
because
chicago
be
the
site
of
the
national
sport
good
association
show
chicago
be
important
every
year
the
sport
good
show
be
where
sale
rep
from
across
the
nation
get
their
first
look
at
all
the
new
athletic
product
from
all
the
different
company
and
vote
up
or
down
via
the
size
of
their
order
but
this
show
be
go
to
be
more
than
important
it
be
go
to
be
our
super
bowl
and
our
olympics
and
our
bar
mitzvah
because
it
be
where
we
d
decide
to
introduce
the
world
to
nike
if
sale
rep
like
our
new
shoe
we
d
live
to
see
another
year
if
not
we
wouldn
t
be
back
for
the
show
onitsuka
meanwhile
be
eye
chicago
too
day
before
the
start
of
the
show
without
a
word
to
me
onitsuka
give
the
japanese
press
an
announcement
trumpet
their
acquisition
of
blue
ribbon
the
announcement
set
off
shock
wave
everywhere
but
especially
at
nissho
sumeragi
write
me
ask
in
essence
what
the
in
my
impassioned
two
page
reply
i
told
him
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
onitsuka
s
announcement
i
assure
him
that
onitsuka
be
try
to
bully
us
into
sell
but
they
be
our
past
and
nissho
like
nike
be
our
future
in
closing
i
confess
to
sumeragi
that
i
hadn
t
yet
mention
any
of
this
to
onitsuka
so
mum
s
the
word
i
ask
that
you
keep
the
above
information
in
strict
confidence
for
obvious
reason
in
order
to
maintain
our
present
distribution
system
for
future
nike
sale
it
s
important
that
we
have
about
one
or
two
more
month
of
shipment
from
onitsuka
and
if
these
shipment
be
cut
off
it
would
be
very
harmful
i
felt
like
a
married
man
caught
in
a
tawdry
love
triangle
i
be
assure
my
lover
nissho
that
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
i
divorce
my
spouse
onitsuka
meanwhile
i
be
encourage
onitsuka
to
think
of
me
as
a
love
and
devote
husband
i
do
not
like
this
way
of
do
business
i
write
sumeragi
but
i
feel
it
be
thrust
upon
us
by
a
company
with
the
bad
possible
intention
we
ll
be
together
soon
darling
just
have
patience
right
before
we
all
left
for
chicago
a
wire
come
from
kitami
he
d
thought
up
a
name
for
our
new
company
the
tiger
shoe
company
he
want
me
to
unveil
it
in
chicago
i
wire
back
that
the
name
be
beautiful
lyrical
sheer
poetry
but
ala
it
be
too
late
to
unveil
anything
at
the
show
all
the
sign
and
promotional
literature
have
be
print
already
on
day
one
of
the
show
i
walk
into
the
convention
center
and
found
johnson
and
woodell
already
busy
arrange
our
booth
they
d
stack
the
new
tiger
in
neat
row
and
now
they
be
stack
the
new
nike
in
pyramid
of
orange
shoe
box
in
those
day
shoe
box
be
either
white
or
blue
period
but
i
d
want
something
that
would
stand
out
that
would
pop
on
the
shelf
of
sport
good
store
so
i
d
ask
nippon
rubber
for
box
of
bright
neon
orange
figure
it
be
the
boldest
color
in
the
rainbow
johnson
and
woodell
love
the
orange
and
love
the
lowercase
nike
letter
in
white
on
the
side
of
the
box
but
as
they
open
the
box
and
examine
the
shoe
themselves
both
men
be
shaken
up
these
shoe
the
first
wave
produce
by
nippon
rubber
didn
t
have
the
quality
of
tiger
nor
of
the
sample
we
d
see
earlier
the
leather
be
shiny
and
not
in
a
good
way
the
wet
flyte
look
literally
wet
as
if
cover
with
cheap
paint
or
lacquer
that
hadn
t
dry
the
upper
be
coat
with
polyurethane
but
apparently
nippon
be
no
more
proficient
than
bowerman
at
work
with
that
tricky
mercurial
substance
the
logo
on
the
side
carolyn
s
wing
whoosh
thingamajig
which
we
d
take
to
call
a
swoosh
be
crooked
i
sat
down
and
put
my
head
in
my
hand
i
look
at
our
orange
pyramid
my
mind
go
to
the
pyramid
of
giza
only
ten
year
before
i
d
be
there
rid
a
camel
like
lawrence
of
arabia
across
the
sand
free
as
a
man
could
be
now
i

of
a
teeter
shoe

shoddy
workmanship
and
crooked

at
the
thousand
of

rep
swarm
the

t
work
hard
enough
on
his

t
start
until
the
night
before
the
other
kid

built
erupt
volcano
and
lightning
machine
and
all
i
have

our
kind
of
people

be
extrovert
we
be

we
didn
t
get
them
and
yet
our
future
depend
on
them
and
now
we
d
have
to
persuade
them
somehow
that
this
nike
thing
be
worth
their
time
and
trust
and
money
i
be
on
the
verge
of
lose
it
right
on
the
verge
then
i
saw
that
johnson
and
woodell
be
already

and
i
realize
that
i
couldn
t
afford

me
to
the
panic
attack
punch
look

be
the
bad
the
shoe

get
well
so
if
we
can
just
sell
these
we
ll
be
on
our
way
each
give
a
resign
shake
of
the
head
what
choice
do
we
have
we
look
out
and
here
they
come
a
mob
of
salesman
walk
like
zombie
toward
our
booth
they
picked
up
the
nike
held
them
to
the
light
they
touch
the
swoosh
one
say
to
another

that
s
a
swoosh

s
the
sound
of

his
dumbfoundedness
and
irregularity

and

not
to
think
about
my
many
half
truth
and
untruth
with
onitsuka
good
news
travel
fast
bad
news
travel
faster
than

two
week
after
chicago
kitami
walk
into
my

notice
no
head

bet
in
case
onitsuka
do
as
threaten
and
yank
the
rug
out
from
under
us
the
answer
disarm
him

it
should
have

d
rehearse

t
know
how
to
respond
he
d
come
spoil
for
a
fight
and

or
so
he
told
me
later
kitami

bathroom
a
ploy
of
course
he
knew
the
bathroom
be
somewhere
in
the
back
and
he
need
an
excuse
to
snoop
back
there
bork
didn
t
see

ploy
or
didn
t

moment
later
kitami
be
stand

the
stockroom
under
a
bare
lightbulb
glower
at

of
orange

his
way
into
the
stockroom
it
s
over
phil
i
hung
up
slump
in
my
chair
well
i
say
out
loud
to
no
one
i
guess
we
re
go
to
find
out
if
we
can
exist
without
tiger
we
found
out
something
else
too
soon
after
that
day
bork
quit
actually
i
don
t
remember
if
he
quit
or
woodell
fire
him
either
way
not
long
after
that
we
heard
bork
have
a
new
job
work
for
kitami
i
spent
day
and
day
star
into
space
gaze
out
window
wait
for
kitami
to
play
his
next
card
i
also
watch
a
lot
of
tv
the
nation
the
world
be
agog
at
the
sudden
opening
of
relation
between
the
united
state
and
china
president
nixon
be
in
beijing
shake
hand
with
mao
zedong
an
event
nearly
on
a
par
with
the
moon
land
i
never
thought
i
d
see
it
in
my
lifetime
a
u
s
president
in
the
forbidden
city
touch
the
great
wall
i
thought
of
my
time
in
hong
kong
i
d
be
so
close
to
china
and
yet
so
far
i
thought
i
d
never
have
another
chance
but
now
i
thought
one
day
maybe
maybe
at
last
kitami
make
his
move
he
return
to
oregon
and
ask
for
a
meeting
at
which
he
request
that
bowerman
be
present
to
make
that
easy
for
bowerman
i
suggest
jaqua
s
office
down
in
eugene
as
the
site
when
the
day
come
as
we
be
all
filing
into
the
conference
room
jaqua
grabbed
my
arm
and
whisper
whatever
he
say
you
say
nothing
i
nod
on
one
side
of
the
conference
table
be
jaqua
bowerman
and
i
on
the
other
side
be
kitami
and
his
lawyer
a
local
guy
who
didn
t
look
like
he
want
to
be
there
plus
iwano
be
back
i
thought
he
might
have
half
smile
at
me
before
remember
that
this
wasn
t
a
social
call
jaqua
s
conference
room
be
big
than
ours
in
tigard
but
that
day
it
felt
like
a
dollhouse
kitami
have
ask
for
the
meeting
so
he
kick
it
off
and
he
didn
t
beat
around
the
bonsai
tree
he
hand
jaqua
a
letter
effective
immediately
our
contract
with
onitsuka
be
null
and
void
he
look
at
me
then
back
to
jaqua
very
very
regret
he
say
furthermore
insult
to
injury
he
be
billing
us
which
he
claimed
we
owe
for
shoe
deliver
to
be
exact
he
demand
jaqua
push
the
letter
aside
and
say
that
if
kitami
dare
to
pursue
this
reckless
course
if
he
insist
on
cut
us
off
we
d
sue
you
cause
this
kitami
say
blue
ribbon
have
breach
its
contract
with
onitsuka
by
make
nike
shoe
he
say
and
he
be
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
we
d
ruin
such
a
profitable
relationship
why
we
d
launch
this
this
this
nike
that
be
more
than
i
could
bear
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
blurt
jaqua
turn
on
me
and
shout
shut
up
buck
jaqua
then
told
kitami
that
he
hop
something
could
still
be
work
out
a
lawsuit
would
be
highly
damage
to
both
company
peace
be
prosperity
but
kitami
be
in
no
mood
for
peace
he
stood
motion
to
his
lawyer
and
iwano
to
follow
when
he
get
to
the
door
he
stop
his
face
change
he
be
about
to
say
something
conciliatory
he
be
prepare
to
offer
an
olive
branch
i
felt
myself
soften
toward
him
onitsuka
he
say
like
to
continue
use
mr
bowerman
as
consultant
i
pull
on
my
ear
surely
i
hadn
t
heard
him
correctly
bowerman
shook
his
head
and
turn
to
jaqua
who
say
that
bowerman
would
henceforth
consider
kitami
a
competitor
aka
a
sworn
enemy
and
would
help
him
in
no
way
whatsoever
kitami
nod
he
ask
if
someone
could
please
drive
him
and
iwano
to
the
airport
i
told
johnson
to
get
on
a
plane
what
plane
he
say
the
next
plane
i
say
he
arrive
the
follow
morning
we
go
for
a
run
during
which
neither
of
us
say
anything
then
we
drove
to
the
office
and
gather
everyone
into
the
conference
room
there
be
about
thirty
people
there
i
expect
to
be
nervous
they
expect
me
to
be
nervous
on
any
different
day
under
any
other
circumstance
i
would
have
be
for
some
reason
however
i
felt
weirdly
at
peace
i
laid
out
the
situation
we
face
we
ve
come
folk
to
a
crossroad
yesterday
our
main
supplier
onitsuka

us
off
i
let
that
sink
in
i
watch
everyone
s
jaw
drop
we
ve
threaten
to
sue
them
for
damage
i
say
and
of
course
they
ve
threaten
to
file
a
lawsuit
of
their
own
breach
of
contract
if
they
sue
us
first
in
japan
we
ll
have
no
choice
but
to
sue
them
here
in
america
and
sue
fast
we
re
not
go
to
win
a
lawsuit
in
japan
so
we
ll
have
to
beat
them
to
the
courthouse
get
a
quick
verdict
here
to
pressure
them
into
withdraw
meanwhile
until
it
all
sort
out
we
re
completely
on
our
own
we
re
set
adrift
we
have
this
new
line
nike
which
the
rep
in
chicago
seem
to
like
but
well
frankly
that
s
all
we
ve
get
and
as
we
know
there
be
big
problem

the
moment
i
say
this
be
the
moment
we
ve
be
wait
for
our
moment
no
more
sell
someone
else
s
brand
no
more
work
for
someone
else
onitsuka
have
be
hold
us
down
for
year
their
late
delivery
their
mixed
up
order
their
refusal
to
hear
and
implement
our
design
idea
who
among
us
isn
t
sick
of
deal
with
all
that
it
s
time
we
face
fact
if
we
re
go
to
succeed
or
fail
we
should
do
so
on
our
own
term
with
our
own
idea
our
own
brand
we
post
two
million
in
sale
last
year
none
of
which
have
anything
to
do
with
onitsuka
that
number
be
a
testament
to
our
ingenuity
and
hard
work
let
s
not
look
at
this
as
a
crisis
let
s
look
at
this
as
our
liberation
our
independence
day
yes
it
s
go
to
be
rough
i
won
t
lie
to
you
we
re
definitely
go
to
war
people
but
we
know
the
terrain
we
know
our
way
around
japan
now
and
that
s
one
reason
i
feel
in
my
heart
this
be
a
war
we
can
win
and
if
we
win
it
when
we
win
it
i
see
great
thing
for
us
on
the
other
side
of
victory
we
be
still
alive
people
we
be
still
alive
as
i
stop
speak
i
could
see
a
wave
of
relief
swirl
around
the
table
like
a
cool
breeze
everyone
felt
it
it
be
as
real
as
the
wind
that
use
to
swirl
around
the
office
next
to
the
pink
bucket
there
be
nod
murmur
nervous
chuckle
we
spent
the
next
hour
brainstorming
about
how
to
proceed
how
to
hire
contract
factory
how
to
play
them
against
one
another
for
the
best
quality
and
price
and
how
be
we
go
to
fix
these
new
nike
anyone
we
adjourn
with
a
jovial
jittery
elate
feel
johnson
say
he
want
to
buy

the
truth

the
truth
i
say
who
knew
johnson
go
back
to
wellesley
for
the
time
be
and
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
olympic
track
and
field
trial
which
in
be
be
held
for
the
first
time
ever
in
our
backyard
eugene
we
need
to
own
those
trial
so
we
sent
an
advance
team
down
to
give
shoe
to
any
competitor
willing
to
take
them
and
we
set
up
a
stag
area
in
our
store
which
be
now
be
ably
run
by
hollister
as
the
trial
open
we
descend
on
eugene
and
set
up
a
silk
screen
machine
in
the
back
of
the
store
we
cranked
out
score
of
nike
t
shirt
which
penny
hand
out
like
halloween
candy
with
all
that
work
how
could
we
not
break
through
and
indeed
dave
davis
a
shot
putter
from
usc
drop
by
the
store
the
first
day
to
complain
that
he
wasn
t
get
free
stuff
from
either
adidas
or
puma
so
he
d
gladly
take
our
shoe
and
wear
them
and
then
he
finish
fourth
hooray
well
yet
he
didn
t
just
wear
our
shoe
he
waltz
around
in
one
of
penny
s
t
shirt
his
name
stencil
on
the
back
the
trouble
be
dave
wasn
t
the
ideal
model
he
have
a
bit
of
a
gut
and
our
t
shirt
weren
t
big
enough
which
accentuate
his
gut
we
make
a
note
buy
small
athlete
or
make
big
shirt
we
also
have
a
couple
of
semifinalist
wear
our
spike
include
an
employee
jim
gorman
who
compete
in
the
i
told
gorman
he
be
take
corporate
loyalty
too
far
our
spike
weren
t
that
great
but
he
insist
that
he
be
in
all
the
way
and
then
in
the
marathon
we
have
nike
shod
runner
finish
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
none
make
the
team
but
still
not
too
shabby
the
main
event
of
the
trial
of
course
would
come
on
the
final
day
a
duel
between
prefontaine
and
the
great
olympian
george
young
by
then
prefontaine
be
universally
know
as
pre
and
he
be
far
more
than
a
phenom
he
be
an
outright
superstar
he
be
the
big
thing
to
hit
the
world
of
american
track
and
field
since
jesse
owen
sportswriter
frequently
compare
him
to
james
dean
and
mick
jagger
and
runner
s
world
say
the
most
apt
comparison
might
be
muhammad
ali
he
be
that
kind
of
swaggery
transformative
figure
to
my
think
however
these
and
all
other
comparison
fell
short
pre
be
unlike
any
athlete
this
country
have
ever
see
though
it
be
hard
to
say
exactly
why
i
d
spent
a
lot
of
time
study
him
admire
him
puzzle
about
his
appeal
i
d
ask
myself
time
and
again
what
it
be
about
pre
that
trigger
such
visceral
response
from
so
many
people
include
myself
i
never
do
come
up
with
a
totally
satisfactory
answer
it
be
more
than
his
talent
there
be
other
talented
runner
and
it
be
more
than
his
swagger
there
be
plenty
of
swagger
runner
some
say
it
be
his
look
pre
be
so
fluid
so
poetic
with
that
flow
mop
of
hair
and
he
have
the
broad
deepest
chest
imaginable
set
on
slender
leg
that
be
all
muscle
and
never
stop
churn
also
most
runner
be
introvert
but
pre
be
an
obvious
joyous
extrovert
it
be
never
simply
run
for
him
he
be
always
put
on
a
show
always
conscious
of
the
spotlight
sometimes
i
thought
the
secret
to
pre
s
appeal
be
his
passion
he
didn
t
care
if
he
die
cross
the
finish
line
so
long
as
he
cross
first
no
matter
what
bowerman
told
him
no
matter
what
his
body
told
him
pre
refuse
to
slow
down
ease
off
he
push
himself
to
the
brink
and
beyond
this
be
often
a
counterproductive
strategy
and
sometimes
it
be
plainly
stupid
and
occasionally
it
be
suicidal
but
it
be
always
uplift
for
the
crowd
no
matter
the
sport
no
matter
the
human
endeavor
really
total
effort
will
win
people
s
heart
of
course
all
oregonian
love
pre
because
he
be
ours
he
be
born
in
our
midst
raise
in
our
rainy
forest
and
we
d
cheer
him
since
he
be
a
pup
we
d
watch
him
break
the
national
two
mile
record
as
an
eighteen
year
old
and
we
be
with
him
step
by
step
through
each
glorious
ncaa
championship
every
oregonian
felt
emotionally
invest
in
his
career
and
at
blue
ribbon
of
course
we
be
prepare
to
put
our
money
where
our
emotion
be
we
understood
that
pre
couldn
t
switch
shoe
right
before
the
trial
he
be
use
to
his
adidas
but
in
time
we
be
certain
he
d
be
a
nike
athlete
and
perhaps
the
paradigmatic
nike
athlete
with
these
thought
in
mind
walk
down
agate
street
toward
hayward
field
i
wasn
t
surprised
to
find
the
place
shake
rock
tremble
with
cheer
the
coliseum
in
rome
could
not
have
be
louder
when
the
gladiator
and
lion
be
turn
loose
we
found
our
seat
just
in
time
to
see
pre
do
his
warm
ups
every
move
he
make
cause
a
new
ripple
of
excitement
every
time
he
jogged
down
one
side
of
the
oval
or
up
the
other
the
fan
along
his
route
stood
and
go
wild
half
of
them
be
wear
t
shirt
that
read
legend
all
of
a
sudden
we
heard
a
chorus
of
deep
guttural
boo
gerry
lindgren
arguably
the
world
s
best
distance
runner
at
the
time
appear
on
the
track
wear
a
t
shirt
that
read
stop
pre
lindgren
have
beaten
pre
when
he
be
a
senior
and
pre
a
freshman
and
he
want
everyone
especially
pre
to
remember
but
when
pre
saw
lindgren
and
saw
the
shirt
he
just
shook
his
head
and
grin
no
pressure
only
more
incentive
the
runner
take
their
mark
an
unearthly
silence
fell
then
bang
the
start
gun
sound
like
a
napol
on
cannon
pre
take
the
lead
right
away
young
tucked
in
right
behind
him
in
no
time
they
pull
well
ahead
of
the
field
and
it
become
a
two
man
affair
lindgren
be
far
behind
a
nonfactor
each
man
s
strategy
be
clear
young
meant
to
stay
with
pre
until
the
final
lap
then
use
his
superior
sprint
to
go
by
and
win
pre
meanwhile
intend
to
set
such
a
fast
pace
at
the
outset
that
by
the
time
they
get
to
that
final
lap
young
s
leg
would
be
go
for
eleven
lap
they
ran
a
half
stride
apart
with
the
crowd
now
roar
froth
shriek
the
two
men
enter
the
final
lap
it
felt
like
a
boxing
match
it
felt
like
a
joust
it
felt
like
a
bullfight
and
we
be
down
to
that
moment
of
truth
death
hang
in
the
air
pre
reach
down
found
another
level
we
saw
him
do
it
he
open
up
a
yard
lead
then
two
then
five
we
saw
young
grimace
and
we
knew
that
he
could
not
would
not
catch
pre
i
told
myself
don
t
forget
this
do
not
forget
i
told
myself
there
be
much
to
be
learn
from
such
a
display
of
passion
whether
you
be
run
a
mile
or
a
company
as
they
cross
the
tape
we
all
look
up
at
the
clock
and
saw
that
both
men
have
broken
the
american
record
pre
have
broken
it
by
a
shade
more
but
he
wasn
t
do
he
spot
someone
wave
a
stop
pre
t
shirt
and
he
go
over
and
snatch
it
and
whip
it
in
circle
above
his
head
like
a
scalp
what
follow
be
one
of
the
great
ovation
i
ve
ever
heard
and
i
ve
spent
my
life
in
stadium
i
d
never
witness
anything
quite
like
that
race
and
yet
i
didn
t
just
witness
it
i
take
part
in
it
day
later
i
felt
sore
in
my
ham
and
quad
this
i
decide
this
be
what
sport
be
what
they
can
do
like
book
sport
give
people
a
sense
of
have
live
other
life
of
take
part
in
other
people
s
victory
and
defeat
when
sport
be
at
their
best
the
spirit
of
the
fan
merges
with
the
spirit
of
the
athlete
and
in
that
convergence
in
that
transference
be
the
oneness
that
the
mystic
talk
about
walk
back
down
agate
street
i
knew
that
race
be
part
of
me
would
forever
be
part
of
me
and
i
vowed
it
would
also
be
part
of
blue
ribbon
in
our
come
battle
with
onitsuka
with
whomever
we
d
be
like
pre
we
d
compete
as
if
our
life
depend
on
it
because
they
do
next
with
saucer
eye
we
look
to
the
olympics
not
only
be
our
man
bowerman
go
to
be
the
head
coach
of
the
track
team
but
our
homeboy
pre
be
go
to
be
the
star
after
his
performance
at
the
trial
who
could
doubt
it
certainly
not
pre
sure
there
will
be
a
lot
of
pressure
he
told
sport
illustrate
and
a
lot
of
us
will
be
face
more
experienced
competitor
and
maybe
we
don
t
have
any
right
to
win
but
all
i
know
be
if
i
go
out
and
bust
my
gut
until
i
black
out
and
somebody
still
beat
me
and
if
i
have
make
that
guy
reach
down
and
use
everything
he
have
and
then
more
why
then
it
just
prof
that
on
that
day
he
s
a
well
man

pre
didn
t
see
the
sense
in
go
slow
ever
go
fast
or
die
i
couldn
t
fault
him
i
be
on
his
side
even
against
our
coach
above
all
however
pre
be
broke
the
know
nothing
and
oligarch
who
govern
american
amateur
athletics
at
that
time
decreed
that
olympic
athlete
couldn
t
collect
endorsement
money
or
government
money
which
meant
our
fine
runner
and
swimmer
and
boxer
be
reduce
to
pauper
to
stay
alive
pre
sometimes
tend
bar
in
eugene
and
sometimes
he
ran
in
europe
take
illicit
cash
from
race
promoter
of

those
extra
race

be
break
down
at

ribbon
we
worried
about
pre
we
talk
about
him
often
formally
and
informally
around
the
office
eventually
we
come
up
with
a
plan
to
keep
him
from
injure
himself
to
avoid
the
shame
of
him
go
around
with
a
beg
bowl
we
hire
him
in
we
give
him
a
job
a
modest
salary
of
five
thousand
dollar
a

and
access
to
a

own
in
los

also
give
him
a
business
card
that
say
national
director
of
public
affair
people
often
narrow
their
eye
and
ask
me
what
that
meant
i
narrow
my
eye
right
back
it
mean
he
can
run
fast
i
say
it
also
meant
he
be
our
second
celebrity
athlete
endorser
the
first
thing
pre
do
with
his
windfall
be
go
out
and
buy
himself
a
butterscotch
mg

drove
it
everywhere
fast
it
look
like
my
old
mg
i
remember
feel
enormously
vicariously
proud
i
remember
think
we
bought

i
remember
think
pre
be
the
living
breathing
embodiment
of
what
we
be
try
to
create
whenever
people
saw
pre
go
at
his
breakneck
pace
on
a
track
in
his
mg
i
want
them
to
see
nike
and
when
they
bought
a
pair
of
nike
i
want
them
to
see
pre

felt
this
strongly
about
pre
even
though

d
only
have
a
few
conversation
with
the
man
and
you
could
hardly
call
them
conversation
whenever
i
saw
him
at
a
track
or
around
the
blue
ribbon
office
i
become
mute
i
try
to
con
myself
more
than
once

told
myself
that

short
shaggy
haired
jock
with
a
porn
star
mustache
but
i
knew
well
and
a
few
minute
in
his
presence
would
prove
it
a
few
minute
be
all
i
could
take

indoor
workout
at
the
same
facility
when
his
first
novel
come
out
i
be
stun
by
how
good
it
be
especially
since
the
play
he
d
write
in
school
have
be
dreck
suddenly
he
be
a
literary
lion
the
toast
of
new
york
and
yet
i
never
felt
starstruck
in
his
presence
as
i
do
in
pre
s
in
i
decide
that
pre
be
every
bit
the
artist
that
kesey
be
and
more
pre
say
as
much
himself
a
race
be
a
work
of
art
he
told
a
reporter
that
people
can
look
at
and
be
affected
in
as
many
way
as
they
re
capable
of
understand
each
time
pre
come
into
the
office
i
note
i
wasn
t
alone
in
my
swoon
everyone
become
mute
everyone
become
shy
men
woman
it
didn
t
matter
everyone
turn
into
buck
knight
even
penny
knight
if
i
be
the
first
to
make
penny
care
about
track
and
field
pre
be
the
one
who
make
her
a
real
fan
hollister
be
the
exception
to
this
rule
he
and
pre
have
an
easy
way
around
each
other
they
be
like
brother
i
never
once
saw
hollister
act
any
differently
with
pre
than
he
do
with
say
me
so
it
make
sense
to
have
hollister
the
pre
whisperer
bring
pre
in
help
us
get
to
know
him
and
vice
versa
we
arrange
a
lunch
in
the
conference
room
when
the
day
come
it
wasn
t
wise
but
it
be
typical
of
woodell
and
me
we
chose
that
moment
to
tell
hollister
that
we
be
tweak
his
duty
in
fact
we
told
him
the
second
his
butt
hit
the
chair
in
the
conference
room
the
change
would
affect
how
he
get
paid
not
how
much
just
how
before
we
could
fully
explain
he
threw
down
his
napkin
and
storm
out
now
we
have
nobody
to
help
us
break
the
ice
with
pre
we
all
star
silently
into
our
sandwich
pre
spoke
first
be
geoff
come
back
i
don
t
think
so
i
say
long
pause
in
that
case
pre
say
can
i
eat
his
sandwich
we
all
laugh
and
pre
seem
suddenly
mortal
and
the
luncheon
ultimately
prove
invaluable
shortly
after
that
day
we
soothe
hollister
and
tweaked
his
duty
again
from
now
on
we
say
you
re
pre
s
full
time
liaison
you
re
in
charge
of
handle
pre
take
pre
out
on
the
road
introduce
pre
to
the
fan
in
fact
we
told
hollister
take
the
boy
on
a
cross
country
tour
hit
all
the
track
meet
state
fair
high
school
and
college
you
can
go
everywhere
and
nowhere
do
everything
and
nothing
sometimes
pre
would
conduct
a
run
clinic
answer
question
about
training
and
injury
sometimes
he
d
just
sign
autograph
and
pose
for
photo
no
matter
what
he
do
no
matter
where
hollister
take
him
worshipful
crowd
would
appear
around
their
bright
blue
volkswagen
bus
though
pre
s
job
title
be
intentionally
imprecise
his
role
be
real
and
his
belief
in
nike
be
authentic
as
well
he
wore
nike
t
shirt
everywhere
he
go
and
he
allow
his
foot
to
be
bowerman
s
last
for
all
shoe
experiment
pre
preach
nike
as
gospel
and
brought
thousand
of
new
people
into
our
revival
tent
he
urge
everyone
to
give
this
groovy
new
brand
a
try
even
his
competitor
he
d
often
send
a
pair
of
nike
flat
or
spike
to
a
fellow
runner
with
a
note
try
these
you
ll
love
them
among
those
most
inspire
by
pre
be
johnson
while
continue
to
build
up
our
east
coast
operation
johnson
have
spent
much
of
slave
on
something
that
he
christen
the
pre
montreal
a
shoe
that
would
be
an
homage
to
pre
and
to
the
upcoming
olympics
and
to
the
american
bicentennial
with
a
blue
suede
toe
a
red
nylon
back
and
a
white
swoosh
it
be
our
jazziest
shoe
yet
and
also
our
best
spike
we
knew
that
we
be
go
to
live
or
die
base
on
quality
and
thus
far
our
quality
on
spike
have
be
spotty
johnson
be
go
to
fix
that
with
this
design
but
he
be
go
to
do
it
in
oregon
i
decide
not
boston
i
d
be
give
a
lot
of
thought
to
johnson
for
month
he
be
turn
into
a
truly
fine
designer
and
we
need
to
take
full
advantage
of
his
talent
the
east
coast
be
run
smoothly
but
it
now
involve
too
much
administration
for
him
the
whole
thing
need
reorganize
streamline
and
that
wasn
t
the
best
use
of
johnson
s
time
or
creativity
that
be
a
job
tailor
make
for
someone
like
woodell
night
after
night
during
my
six
mile
run
i
d
wrestle
with
this
situation
i
have
two
guy
in
the
wrong
job
on
the
wrong
coast
and
neither
one
be
go
to
like
the
obvious
solution
each
guy
love
where
he
live
and
each
irritated
the
other
though
they
both
deny
it
when
i
d
promote
woodell
to
operation
manager
i
d
also
bequeath
him
johnson
i
d
put
him
in
charge
of
oversee
johnson
answer
johnson
s
letter
and
woodell
make
the
mistake
of
reading
them
thoroughly
and
try
to
keep
up
consequently
the
two
have
developed
a
chippy
deeply
sarcastic
rapport
for
instance
woodell
wheel
into
my
office
one
day
and
say
this
be
depress
jeff
complains
constantly
about
inventory
expense
reimbursement
lack
of
communication
he
say
he
s
work
his
butt
off
while
we
re
loll
around
he
doesn
t
listen
to
any
reason
include
that
our
sale
be
double
every
year
woodell
told
me
he
want
to
take
a
different
approach
to
johnson
by
all
mean
i
say
have
at
it
so
he
write
johnson
a
long
letter
admit
that
we
d
all
be
collude
against
him
try
to
make
him
unhappy
he
write
i
m
sure
you
realize
we
don
t
work
quite
as
hard
out
here
as
you
do
with
only
three
hour
in
the
work
day
it
be
hard
to
get
everything
do
still
i
make
time
to
place
you
in
all
sort
of
embarrass
situation
with
customer
and
the
business
community
whenever
you
need
money
desperately
to
pay
bill
i
send
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
what
you
need
so
that
you
ll
have
to
deal
with
bill
collector
and
lawsuit
i
take
the
destruction
of
your
reputation
as
a
personal
compliment
and
so
on
johnson
answer
back
finally
someone
out
there
understands
me
what
i
be
get
ready
to
propose
wasn
t
go
to
help
i
approach
johnson
first
i
chose
my
moment
carefully
a
trip
we
make
to
japan
to
visit
nippon
rubber
and
discus
the
pre
montreal
over
dinner
i
laid
it
all
out
for
him
we
be
in
a
ferocious
battle
a
siege
day
by
day
we
be
do
everything
we
could
to
keep
the
troop
fed
and
the
enemy
at
bay
for
the
sake
of
victory
for
the
sake
of
survival
everything
else
need
to
be
sacrifice
subordinate
and
so
at
this
crucial
moment
in
the
evolution
of
blue
ribbon
in
the
rollout
of
nike
i
m
sorry
but
well
you
two
dummy
need
to
switch
city
he
groan
of
course
it
be
santa
monica
all
over
again
but
slowly
agonizingly
he
come
around
as
do
woodell
around
the
close
of
each
man
hand
his
house
key
to
the
other
and
now
in
early
they
switch
place
talk
about
team
player
it
be
an
enormous
sacrifice
and
i
be
deeply
grateful
but
in
keep
with
my
personality
and
blue
ribbon
tradition
i
express
no
gratitude
i
spoke
not
a
word
of
thanks
or
praise
in
fact
in
several
office
memo
i
refer
to
the
switch
as
operation
dummy
reversal
in
the
late
spring
of
i
met
with
our
recent
investor
the
debenture
holder
for
a
second
time
the
first
time
they
d
love
me
how
could
they
not
sale
be
boom
celebrity
athlete
be
promote
our
shoe
sure
we
d
lose
onitsuka
and
we
be
face
a
legal
fight
down
the
road
but
we
be
on
the
right
track
this
time
however
it
be
my
duty
to
inform
the
investor
that
one
year
after
launch
nike
for
the
first
time
in
blue
ribbon
history
we
d
lose
money
the
meeting
take
place
at
the
valley
river
inn
in
eugene
it
be
thirty
men
and
woman
crammed
into
the
conference
room
with
me
at
the
head
of
a
long
conference
table
i
wore
a
dark
suit
and
try
to
project
an
air
of
confidence
as
i
deliver
the
bad
news
i
give
them
the
same
speech
i
d
give
blue
ribbon
employee
a
year
before
we
ve
get
them
right
where
we
want
them
but
this
group
wasn
t
buying
any
pep
talk
these
be
widow
and
widower
retiree
and
pensioner
also
the
previous
year
i
d
be
flank
by
jaqua
and
bowerman
this
year
both
men
be
busy
i
be
alone
half
an
hour
into
my
pitch
with
thirty
horrify
face
star
at
me
i
suggest
we
break
for
lunch
the
previous
year
i
d
hand
out
blue
ribbon
s
financial
statement
before
lunch
this
year
i
decide
to
wait
until
after
it
didn
t
help
even
on
a
full
stomach
with
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
the
number
look
bad
despite
million
in
sale
we
show
a
net
loss
of
several
cluster
of
investor
now
begin
private
conversation
while
i
be
try
to
talk
they
be
point
at
this
trouble
number
and
repeat
it
over
and
over
at
some
point
i
mention
that
anne
caris
a
young
runner
have
just
make
the
cover
of
sport
illustrate
wear
nike
we
re
break
through
people
no
one
heard
no
one
care
they
care
only
about
the
bottom
line
not
even
the
bottom
line
but
their
bottom
line
i
come
to
the
end
of
my
presentation
i
ask
if
anyone
have
a
question
thirty
hand
go
up
i
m
very
disappointed
in
this
say
one
old
man
rise
to
his
foot
any
more
question
twenty
nine
hand
go
up
another
man
call
out
i
m
not
happy
i
say
i
sympathize
my
sympathy
only
serve
to
annoy
them
they
have
every
right
they
d
put
their
confidence
in
bowerman
and
me
and
we
d
fail
we
never
could
have
anticipate
tiger
s
betrayal
but
nonetheless
these
people
be
hurt
i
saw
it
in
their
face
and
i
need
to
take
responsibility
to
make
it
right
i
decide
it
be
only
fair
to
offer
them
a
concession
their
stock
have
a
conversion
rate
which
go
up
every
year
in
the
first
year
the
rate
be
a
share
in
the
second
year
it
be
and
so
on
in
light
of
all
this
bad
news
i
told
them
i
ll
keep
the
conversion
rate
the
same
for
the
full
five
year
you
own
your
stock
they
be
placate
mildly
but
i
left
eugene
that
day
know
they
have
a
low
opinion
of
me
and
nike
i
also
left
think
i
d
never
ever
ever
take
this
company
public
if
thirty
people
could
cause
this
kind
of
acid
stomach
i
couldn
t
imagine
be
answerable
to
thousand
of
stockholder
we
be
well
off
financing
through
nissho
and
the
bank
that
be
if
there
be
anything
to
finance
as
fear
onitsuka
have
file
suit
against
us
in
japan
so
now
we
have
to
file
quickly
against
them
in
the
united
state
for
breach
of
contract
and
trademark
infringement
i
put
the
case
in
the
hand
of
cousin
houser
it
wasn
t
a
tough
call
there
be
the
trust
factor
of
course
kinship
blood
so
on
also
there
be
the
confidence
factor
though
he
be
only
two
year
old
cousin
houser
seem
vastly
more
mature
he
carry
himself
with
remarkable
assurance
especially
before
a
judge
and
jury
his
father
have
be
a
salesman
and
a
good
one
and
cousin
houser
learn
from
him
how
to
sell
his
client
well
yet
he
be
a
tenacious
competitor
when
we
be
kid
cousin
houser
and
i
use
to
play
vicious
marathon
game
of
badminton
in
his
backyard
one
summer
we
played
exactly
game
why
because
cousin
houser
beat
me
straight
time
i
refuse
to
quit
until
i

view
of

and
my
borrowing
kitami

from
his

have
to
hope
the
court
would
see
the
steal
of

by
the
sense
that
i
hadn
t

well

sense
cousin
houser
reluctantly
confirm
at
the
close
of
those
difficult
day
it
be
my
nightly
six
mile
run
that
save
my
life
and
then
it
be
my
brief
time
with
matthew
and
penny
that
preserve
my
sanity
i
d
always
try
to
find
the
time
and
energy
to
tell
matthew
his
bedtime
story
thomas
jefferson
be
toil
to
write
the
declaration
of
independence
you
see
struggle
to
find
the
word
when
little
matt
history
brought
him
a
new
quill
pen
and
the
word
seem
to
magically
flow
matthew
almost
always
laugh
at
my
bedtime
story
he
have
a
liquid
laugh
which
i
love
to
hear
because
at
other
time
he
could
be
moody
sullen
cause
for
concern
he
d
be
very
late
learn
to
talk
and
now
he
be
show
a
worrisome
rebellious
streak
i
blame
myself
if
i
be
home
more
i
told
myself
he
d
be
less
rebellious
bowerman
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
with
matthew
and
he
told
me
not
to
worry
i
like
his
spirit
he
say
the
world
need
more
rebel
that
spring
penny
and
i
have
the
add
worry
of
how
our
little
rebel
would
handle
a
sibling
she
be
pregnant
again
secretly
i
wonder
more
about
how
we
be
go
to
handle
it
by
the
end
of
i
thought
it
s
very
possible
i
ll
have
two
kid
and
no
job
after
turn
out
the
light
next
to
matthew
s
bed
i
d
usually
go
and
sit
in
the
living
room
with
penny
we
d
talk
about
the
day
which
meant
the
loom
trial
grow
up
penny
have
watch
several
of
her
father
s
trial
and
it
give
her
an
avid
fondness
for
courtroom
drama
she
never
miss
a
legal
show
on
tv
perry
mason
be
her
favorite
and
i
sometimes
call
her
della
street
after
mason
s
intrepid
secretary
i
kid
her
about
her
enthusiasm
but
i
also
fed
off
it
the
final
act
of
every
even
be
my
phone
call
to
my
father
time
for
my
own
bedtime
story
by
then
he
d
left
the
newspaper
and
in
his
retirement
he
have
load
of
time
to
research
old
case
and
precedent
to
spin
out
argument
that
might
be
useful
to
cousin
houser
his
involvement
plus
his
sense
of
fair
play
plus
his
bedrock
belief
in
the
rightness
of
blue
ribbon
s
cause
be
restorative
it
be
always
the
same
my
father
would
ask
about
matthew
and
penny
and
then
i
d
ask
about
mom
and
then
he
d
tell
me
what
he
d
found
in
the
law
book
i
d
take
careful
note
on
a
yellow
legal
pad
before
signing
off
he
d
always
say
that
he
like
our
chance
we
re
go
to
win
buck
that
magical
pronoun
we
he
d
always
use
it
and
it
would
always
make
me
feel
well
it
s
possible
that
we
be
never
closer
maybe
because
our
relationship
have
be
reduce
to
its
primal
essence
he
be
my
dad
i
be
his
son
and
i
be
in
the
fight
of
my
life
look
back

see
that
something
else
be
go
on
my
trial

provide
my
father
with
a
healthier
outlet
for
his
inner
chaos
my
legal
trouble

day

out
of
uc
berkeley
school
of
law
cousin
houser
say
and
he

a
damn
thing
yet
but
cousin
houser
have
an
instinct
about
the
kid
thought
he
show
tremendous
promise
plus
strasser
have
a
personality
that
be
sure
to
mesh
with
our
company
the
moment
strasser
read
our
brief
cousin
houser
told
me
he
saw
this
case
as
a
holy
crusade
well
i
like
the
sound
of
that
so
the
next
time
i
be
at
cousin
houser
s
firm
i
walk
down
the
hall
and
poked
my
head
into
the
office
of
this
strasser
fellow
he
wasn
t
there
the
office
be
pitch
dark
shade
drawn
light
off
i
turn
to
leave
then
i
heard
hello
i
turn
back
somewhere
within
the
darkness
behind
a
big
walnut
desk
a
shape
move
the
shape
grow
a
mountain
rise
from
a
dark
sea
it
slid
toward
me
now
i
saw
the
rough
contour
of
a
man
six
three
pound
with
an
extra
help
of
shoulder
and
fire
log
arm
this
be
one
part
sasquatch
one
part
snuffleupagus
though
somehow
light
on
his
foot
he
mince
toward
me
and
thrust
one
of
his
fire
log
in
my
direction
i
reach
we
shook
now
i
could
make
out
the
face
brick
red
cover
by
a
full
strawberry
blond
beard
and
glaze
with
sweat
hence
the
darkness
he
require
dimly
lit
cool
space
he
also
couldn
t
bear
wear
a
suit
everything
about
this
man
be
different
from
me
from
everyone
i
knew
and
yet
i
felt
a
strange
instant
kinship
he
say
that
he
be
thrill
to
be
work
on
my
case
honor
he
believe
that
blue
ribbon
have
be
the
victim
of
a
terrible
injustice
kinship
become
love
yes
i
say
yes
we
have
day
later
strasser
come
out
to
tigard
for
a
meeting
penny
be
in
the
office
at
the
time
and
when
strasser
glimpse
her
walk
down
a
hall
his
eye
bulge
he
tug
on
his
beard
my
god
he
say
be
that
penny
park
she
s
penny
knight
now
i
say
she
date
my
best
friend
small
world
small
when
you
re
my
size
over
the
come
day
and
week
strasser
and
i
discover
more
and
more
way
our
life
and
psyche
intersect
he
be
a
native
oregonian
and
proud
of
it
in
that
typical
truculent
way
he
d
grown
up
with
a
bug
about
seattle
and
san
francisco
and
all
the
nearby
place
that
outsider
saw
as
our
better
his
geographical
inferiority
complex
be
exacerbate
by
his
ungainly
size
and
homeliness
he
d
always
fear
that
he
wouldn
t
find
his
place
in
the
world
that
he
be
doom
to
be
an
outcast
i
get
that
he
compensate
at
time
by
be
loud
and
profane
but
mostly
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
and
downplayed
his
intelligence
rather
than
risk
alienate
people
i
get
that
too
intelligence
like
strasser
s
however
couldn
t
be
hidden
for
long
he
be
one
of
the
great
thinker
i
ever
met
debater
negotiator
talker
seeker
his
mind
be
always
whir
try
to
understand
and
to
conquer
he
saw
life
as
a
battle
and
found
confirmation
for
this
view
in
book
like
me
he
read
compulsively
about
war
also
like
me
he
live
and
die
with
the
local
team
especially
the
duck
we
have
a
huge
laugh
over
the
fact
that
oregon
s
basketball
coach
that
year
be
dick
harter
while
the
football
coach
be
still
dick
enright
the
popular
cheer
at
oregon
state
game
be
if
you
can
t
get
your
dick
enright
get
your
dick
harter
after
we
stop
laugh
strasser
start
up
again
i
be
amaze
by
the
pitch
of
his
laughter
high
giggly
twee
it
be
startle
from
a
man
his
size
more
than
anything
else
we
bond
over
father
strasser
be
the
son
of
a
successful
businessman
and
he
too
fear
that
he
d
never
live
up
to
his
old
man
s
expectation
his
father
however
be
an
exceptionally
hard
case
strasser
told
me
many
story
one
stayed
with
me
when
strasser
be
seventeen
his
parent
go
away
for
the
weekend
and
strasser
seize
the
moment
to
throw
a
party
it
turn
into
a
riot
neighbor
call
the
police
and
just
as
the
patrol
car
arrive
so
do
strasser
s
parent
they
d
come
home
early
from
their
trip
strasser
told
me
that
his
father
look
around
house
in
shamble
son
in
handcuff
and
coldly
told
the
cop
take
him
away
i
ask
strasser
early
on
how
he
gauge
our
chance
against
onitsuka
he
say
we
be
go
to
win
he
say
it
straight
out
no
hesitation
as
if
i
d
ask
him
what
he
d
have
for
breakfast
he
say
it
the
way
a
sport
fan
would
talk
about
next
year
with
uncompromising
faith
he
say
it
the
way
my
father
say
it
every
night
and
there
and
then
i
decide
that
strasser
be
one
of
the
chosen
one
of
the
brother
like
johnson
and
woodell
and
hayes
like
bowerman
and
hollister
and
pre
he
be
blue
ribbon
through
and
through
when
i
wasn
t
obsess
about
the
trial
i
be
fixate
on
sale
every
day
i
d
get
a
telex
from
our
warehouse
with
a
pair
count
meaning
the
exact
number
of
pair
ship
that
day
to
all
customer
school
retailer
coach
individual
mail
order
client
on
general
accounting
principle
a
pair
ship
be
a
pair
sell
so
the
daily
pair
count
determine
my
mood
my
digestion
my
blood
pressure
because
it
largely
determine
the
fate
of
blue
ribbon
if
we
didn
t
sell
through
sell
all
the
shoe
in
our
most
recent
order
and
quickly
convert
that
product
into
cash
we
d
be
in
big
trouble
the
daily
pair
count
told
me
if
we
be
on
our
way
to
sell
through
so
i
d
say
to
woodell
on
a
typical
morning
massachusetts
be
good
eugene
look
good
what
happen
in
memphis
ice
storm
he
might
say
or
truck
broke
down
he
have
a
superb
talent
for
underplay
the
bad
and
underplay
the
good
for
simply
be
in
the
moment
for
instance
after
the
dummy
reversal
woodell
occupy
an
office
that
be
hardly
deluxe
it
sat
on
the
top
floor
of
an
old
shoe
factory
and
a
water
tower
directly
overhead
be
caked
with
a
century
s
worth
of
pigeon
poop
plus
the
ceiling
beam
be
gapped
and
the
building
shook
every
time
the
die
cutter
stamp
out
the
upper
in
other
word
throughout
the
day
a
steady
rain
of
pigeon
poop
would
fall
on
woodell
s
hair
shoulder
desktop
but
woodell
would
simply
dust
himself
off
casually
clear
his
desk
with
the
side
of
his
hand
and
continue
with
his
work
he
also
kept
a
piece
of
company
stationery
carefully
draped
over
his
coffee
cup
at
all
time
to
ensure
it
be
only
cream
in
his
joe
i
try
often

monk
demeanor
most
day
however
it
be
beyond
me
i
boil
with
frustration
know
that
our
pair
count
could
have
be
so
much
high
if
not
for
our
constant
problem
with
supply
people
be
cry
out
for
our
shoe
but
we
just
couldn
t
get
them
out
on
time
we
d
trade
onitsuka
s
capricious
delay
for
a
new
set
of
delay
cause
by
demand
the
factory
and
nissho
be
do
their
job
we
be
now
get
what
we
order
on
time
and
intact
but
the
boom
marketplace
create
new
pressure
make
it
harder
and
harder
to
correctly
allocate
what
we
get
supply
and
demand
be
always
the
root
problem
in
business
it
s
be
true
since
phoenician
trader
race
to
bring
rome
the
covet
purple
dye
that
color
the
clothing
of
royal
and
rich
people
there
be
never
enough
purple
to
go
around
it
s
hard
enough
to
invent
and
manufacture
and
market
a
product
but
then
the
logistics
the
mechanic
the
hydraulics
of
get
it
to
the
people
who
want
it
when
they
want
it
this
be
how
company
die
how
ulcer
be
born
in
the
supply
and
demand
problem
face
the
run
shoe
industry
be
unusually
knotty
seemingly
insoluble
the
whole
world
be
suddenly
demand
run
shoe
and
the
supply
wasn
t
simply
inconsistent
it
be
slow
to
a
sputter
there
be
never
enough
shoe
in
the
pipeline
we
have
many
smart
people
work
on
the
problem
but
no
one
could
figure
out
how
to
significantly
boost
supply
without
take
on
huge
inventory
risk
there
be
some
consolation
in
the
fact
that
adidas
and
puma
be
have
the
same
problem
but
not
much
our
problem
could
tip
us
into
bankruptcy
we
be
leveraged
to
the
hilt
and
like
most
people
who
live
from
paycheck
to
paycheck
we
be
walk
the
edge
of
a
precipice
when
a
shipment
of
shoe
be
late
our
pair
count
plummet
when
our
pair
count
plummet
we
weren
t
able
to
generate
enough
revenue
to
repay
nissho
and
the
bank
of
california
on
time
when
we
couldn

repay
nissho
and
the

when
we
couldn

more
we
be
late
place
our
next
order
round
and
round
it
go
then
come
the
last
thing
we
need
a
dockworker
strike
our
man
go
down
to
boston
harbor
to
pick
up
a
shipment
of
shoe
and
found
it
lock
tight
he
could
see
it
through
the
lock
fence
box
and
box
of
what
the
world
be
clamor
for
and
no
way
to
get
at
it
we
scramble
and
arrange
for
nippon
to
send
a
new
shipment
pair
on
a
charter
we
split
the
cost
of
jet
fuel
with
them
anything
be
preferable
to
not
bring
product
to
market
on
time
our
sale
for
rise
percent
to
million
a
number
that
stagger
me
the
first
time
i
saw
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
wasn
t
it
only
yesterday
that
we
d
do
and
yet
there
be
no
celebration
between
our
legal
trouble
and
our
supply
woe
we
might
be
out
of
business
any
minute
late
at
night
i
d
sit
with
penny
and
she
d
ask
for
the
umpteenth
time
what
we
be
go
to
do
if
blue
ribbon
go
under
what
be
the
plan
and
for
the
umpteenth
time
i
d
reassure
her
with
optimistic
word
that
i
didn
t
wholly
believe
then
that
fall
i
have
an
idea
why
not
go
to
all
of
our
big
retailer
and
tell
them
that
if
they
d
sign
ironclad
commitment
if
they
d
give
us
large
and
nonrefundable
order
six
month
in
advance
we
d
give
them
hefty
discount
up
to
percent
this
way
we
d
have
longer
lead
time
and
few
shipment
and
more
certainty
and
therefore
a
well
chance
of
keep
cash
balance
in
the
bank
also
we
could
use
these
long
term
commitment
from
heavyweight
like
nordstrom
kinney
athlete
s
foot
united
sport
good
and
others
to
squeeze
more
credit
out
of
nissho
and
the
bank
of
california
especially
nissho
the
retailer
be
skeptical
of
course
but
i
beg
and
when
that
didn
t
work
i
make
bold
prediction
i
told
them
that
this
program
which
we
be
call
future
be
the
future
for
us
and
everyone
else
so
they
d
well
get
on
board
sooner
rather
than
later
i
be
persuasive
because
i
be
desperate
if
we
could
just
take
the
lid
off
our
annual
growth
limit
but
retailer
continued
to
resist
over
and
over
we
heard
you
newbie
at
nike
don
t
understand
the
shoe
industry
this
new
idea
will
never
fly
my
bargaining
position
be
suddenly
improve
when
we
roll
out
several
eye

customer
be

to

its
outsole
and
upper

together
to
give
a
more
stable

now
we
debut
an

but
this
time
on
the
drive
to
the
hospital
i
have
more
on
my
mind
than
just

up
ahead

once
again
they
wheel
penny
away
and
once
again

bad
thing

phil
go

i
sat
in
the
federal
courthouse
in
downtown
portland
at
a
little
wooden
table
alongside
strasser
and
cousin
houser
star
at
the
high
ceiling
i
try
to
take
deep
breath
i
try
not
to
look
to
my
left
at
the
oppose
table
at
the
five
raptor
eyed
lawyer
represent
onitsuka
and
four
other
distributor
all
of
whom
want
to
see
me
ruin
it
be
april
we
d
try
one
last
time
to
avoid
this
nightmare
in
the
moment
before
the
trial
begin
we
d
offer
to
settle
we
d
told
onitsuka
pay
us
eight
hundred
thousand
dollar
in
damage
withdraw
your
suit
in
japan
we
ll
withdraw
ours
and
we
ll
all
walk
away
i
didn
t
think
there
be
much
chance
of
acceptance
but
cousin
houser
thought
it
worth
a
try
onitsuka
reject
the
offer
instantly
and
make
no
counter
they
be
out
for
blood
now
the
bailiff
shout
court
be
in
session
the
judge
swoop
into
the
courtroom
and
bang
his
gavel
and
my
heart
jumped
this
be
it
i
told
myself
the
head
lawyer
for
onitsuka
s
side
wayne
hilliard
give
his
opening
statement
first
he
be
a
man
who
enjoy
his
work
who
knew
he
be
good
at
it
these
men
have
unclean
hand
he
cry
point
at
our
table
unclean
hand
he
repeat
this
be
a
standard
legal
term
but
hilliard
make
it
sound
lurid
almost
pornographic
everything
hilliard
say
sound
somewhat
sinister
to
me
because
he
be
short
and
have
a
pointy
nose
and
look
like
the
penguin
blue
ribbon
con
onitsuka
into
this
partnership
he
bellow
phil
knight
go
to
japan
in
and
pretend
there
be
a
company
call
blue
ribbon
and
thereafter
he
employ
subterfuge
theft
spy
whatever
necessary
to
perpetuate
this
con
by
the
time
hilliard
be
do
by
the
time
he
d
take
his
seat
next
to
his
four
fellow
lawyer
i
be
ready
to
find
in
favor
of
onitsuka
i
look
into
my
lap
and
ask
myself
how
could
you
have
do
all
those
terrible
thing
to
those
poor
japanese
businessmen
cousin
houser
stood
right
away
it
be
clear
that
he
didn
t
have
hilliard
s
fire
it
just
wasn
t
in
his
nature
cousin
houser
be
organize
prepared
but
he
wasn
t
fiery
at
first
i
be
disappointed
then
i
look
more
closely
at
cousin
houser
and
listen
to
what
he
be
say
and
thought
about
his
life
as
a
boy
he
d
suffer
a
severe
speech
impediment
every
r
and
l
have
be
a
hurdle
even
into
his
teen
he
d
sound
like
a
cartoon
character
now
though
he
retain
slight
trace
of
the
impediment
he
d
largely
overcome
it
and
as
he
address
the
packed
courtroom
that
day
i
be
fill
with
admiration
and
filial
loyalty
what
a
journey
he
d
make
we
d
make
i
be
proud
of
him
proud
he
be
on
our
side
moreover
he
d
take
our
case
on
contingency
because
he
d
thought
it
would
come
to
trial
in
month
two
year
later
he
hadn
t
see
a
dime
and
his
cost
be
astronomical
my
photocopy
bill
alone
be
in
the
ten
of
thousand
now
and
then
cousin
houser
mention
that
he
be
under
intense
pressure
from
his
partner
to
kick
us
to
the
curb
at
one
point
he
d
even
ask
jaqua
to
take
over
the
case
no
thanks
jaqua
say
fire
or
no
cousin
houser
be
a
true
hero
he
finish
speak
seat
himself
at
our
table
and
look
at
me
and
strasser
i
pat
his
back
game
on
as
the
plaintiff
we
present
our
case
first
and
the
first
witness
we
call
be
the
founder
and
president
of
blue
ribbon
philip
h
knight
walk
to
the
stand
i
felt
as
if
it
must
be
some
other
philip
knight
be
call
some
other
philip
knight
now
raise
his
hand
swear
to
tell
the
truth
in
a
case
marked
by
so
much
deceit
and
rancor
i
be
float
above
my
body
watch
the
scene
unfold
far
below
i
told
myself
as
i
settle
deep
into
the
creaky
wooden
chair
in
the
witness
stand
and
straighten
my
necktie
this
be
the
most
important
account
you
ll
ever
give
of
yourself
don
t
blow
it
and
then
i
blew
it
i
be
every
bit
as
bad
as
i
d
be
in
the
deposition
i
be
even
a
little
bad
cousin
houser
try
to
help
me
to
lead
me
he
struck
an
encourage
tone
give
me
a
friendly
smile
with
each
question
but
my
mind
be
go
in
multiple
direction
i
couldn
t
concentrate
i
hadn
t
slept
the
night
before
hadn
t
eat
that
morning
and
i
be
run
on
adrenaline
but
the
adrenaline
wasn
t
give
me
extra
energy
or
clarity
it
be
only
cloud
my
brain
i
found
myself
entertain
strange
almost
hallucinatory
thought
like
how
much
cousin
houser
resemble
me
he
be
about
my
age
about
my
height
with
many
of
my
same
feature
i
d
never
notice
the
family
resemblance
until
now
what
a
kafkaesque
twist
i
thought
be
interrogate
by
yourself
by
the
end
of
his
question
i
have
make
a
slight
recovery
the
adrenaline
be
go
and
i
be
start
to
make
sense
but
now
it
be
the
other
side
s
turn
to
have
a
go
at
me
hilliard
drill
down
down
he
be
relentless
and
i
be
soon
reel
i
hem
haw
couched
every
other
word
in
strange
qualifier
i
sound
shady
shifty
even
to
myself
when
i
talk
about
go
through
kitami
s
briefcase
when
i
try
to
explain
that
mr
fujimoto
wasn
t
really
a
corporate
spy
i
saw
the
courtroom
spectator
and
the
judge
look
skeptical
even
i
be
skeptical
several
time
i
look
into
the
distance
and
squint
and
thought
do
i
really
do
that
i
scan
the
courtroom
look
for
help
and
saw
nothing
but
hostile
face
the
most
hostile
be
bork
s
he
be
sit
right
behind
the
onitsuka
table
glare
now
and
then
he
d
lean
into
the
onitsuka
lawyer
whisper
hand
them
note
traitor
i
thought
benedict
arnold
prompt
by
bork
presumably
hilliard
come
at
me
from
new
angle
with
new
question
and
i
lose
track
of
the
plot
i
often
have
no
idea
what
i
be
say
the
judge
at
one
point
scold
me
for
not
make
sense
for
be
overly
complicate
just
answer
the
question
concisely
he
say
how
concisely
i
say
twenty
word
or
less
he
say
hilliard
ask
his
next
question
i
ran
a
hand
over
my
face
there
s
no
way
i
can
answer
that
question
in
twenty
word
or
less
i
say
the
judge
require
lawyer
on
both
side
to
stay
behind
their
table
while
question
witness
and
to
this
day
i
think
that
ten
yard
of
buffer
might
have
save
me
i
think
if
hilliard
have
be
able
to
get
closer
he
might
have
crack
me
might
have
reduce
me
to
tear
toward
the
end
of
his
two
day
cross
i
be
numb
i
d
hit
bottom
the
only
place
to
go
be
up
i
could
see
hilliard
decide
that
he
d
well
let
me
go
before
i
start
to
rise
and
make
a
comeback
as
i
slid
off
the
stand
i
give
myself
a
grade
of
d
minus
cousin
houser
and
strasser
didn
t
disagree
the
judge
in
our
case
be
the
honorable
james
burn
a
notorious
figure
in
oregon
jurisprudence
he
have
a
long
dour
face
and
pale
gray
eye
that
look
out
from
beneath
two
protrude
black
eyebrow
each
eye
have
its
own
little
thatch
roof
maybe
it
be
because
factory
be
so
much
on
my
mind
in
those
day
but
i
often
thought
judge
burn
look
as
if
he
d
be
built
in
some
far
off
factory
that
manufacture
hang
judge
and
i
thought
he
knew
it
too
and
take
pride
in
it
he
call
himself
in
all
seriousness
james
the
just
in
his
operatic
basso
he
d
announce
you
be
now
in
the
courtroom
of
james
the
just
heaven
have
mercy
on
anyone
who
think
james
the
just
be
be
a
bit
dramatic
dare
to
laugh
portland
be
still
a
small
town
minuscule
really
and
we
d
heard
through
the
grapevine
that
someone
have
recently
bumped
into
james
the
just
at
his
men
s
club
the
judge
be
have
a
martini
moan
about
our
case
dreadful
case
he
be
say
to
the
bartender
and
anyone
who
d
listen
perfectly
dreadful
so
we
knew
he
didn
t
want
to
be
there
any
more
than
we
do
and
he
often
take
out
his
unhappiness
on
us
berating
us
over
small
point
of
order
and
decorum
still
despite
my
horrid
performance
on
the
stand
cousin
houser
and
strasser
and
i
have
a
sense
that
james
the
just
be
incline
toward
our
side
something
about
his
demeanor
he
be
slightly
less
ogreish
to
us
on
a
hunch
therefore
cousin
houser
told
the
oppose
counsel
that
if
they
be
still
consider
our
original
settlement
forget
it
the
offer
be
no
longer
on
the
table
that
same
day
james
the
just
call
a
halt
to
the
trial
and
admonish
both
side
he
be
perturbed
he
say
by
all
he
be
reading
about
this
case
in
the
local
newspaper
he
be
damn
if
he
be
go
to
preside
over
a
medium
circus
he
order
us
to
cease
and
desist
discuss
the
case
outside
the
courthouse
we
nod
yes
your
honor
johnson
sat
behind
our
table
often
send
note
to
cousin
houser
and
always
reading
a
novel
during
sidebar
and
break
after
court
adjourn
each
day
he
d
unwind
by
take
a
stroll
around
downtown
visit
different
sport
good
store
check
on
our
sale
he
also
do
this
every
time
he
found
himself
in
a
new
city
early
on
he
report
back
that
nike

to
bowerman

waffle
trainer
the
shoe
have
just
hit
the
market
and
it
be
sell
out
everywhere
meaning
we
be
outpace
onitsuka
even
puma
the
shoe
be
such
a
hit
that
we
could
envision
for
the
first
time
one
day
approach
adidas
s
sale
number
johnson
get
to
talk
with
one
store
manager
an
old
friend
who
knew
the
trial
be
under
way
how
s
it
go
the
store
manager
say
go
well
johnson
say
so
well
in
fact
we
withdrew
our
settlement
offer
first
thing
the
next
morning
as
we
gather
in
the
courtroom
each
of
us
sip
our
coffee
we
notice
an
unfamiliar
face
at
the
defense
table
there
be
the
five
lawyer
and
one
new
guy
johnson
turn
saw
and
go
white
oh
shit
he
say
in
a
frantic
whisper
he
told
us
that
the
new
guy
be
the
store
manager
with
whom
he
d
inadvertently
discuss
the
trial
now
cousin
houser
and
strasser
go
white
the
three
of
us
look
at
each
other
and
look
at
johnson
and
in
unison
we
turn
and
look
at
james
the
just
he
be
banging
his
gavel
and
clearly
about
to
explode
he
stop
banging
silence
fill
the
courtroom
now
he
start
yell
he
spent
a
full
twenty
minute
tear
into
us
one
day
after
his
gag
order
he
say
one
day
someone
on
team
blue
ribbon
have
walk
into
a
local
store
and
run
his
mouth
we
star
straight
ahead
like
naughty
child
wonder
if
we
be
about
to
be
a
mistrial
but
as
the
judge
wound
down
his
tirade
i
thought
i
detect
the
tiniest
twinkle
in
his
eye
maybe
i
thought
just
maybe
james
the
just
be
more
performer
than
ogre
johnson
redeem
himself
with
his
testimony
articulate
dazzlingly
anal
about
the
tiniest
detail
he
described
the
boston
and
the
cortez
well
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
could
include
me
hilliard
try
and
try
to
break
him
and
couldn
t
what
a
pleasure
it
be
to
watch
hilliard
bang
his
head
against
that
cement
like
johnson
unflappability
stretch
versus
the
crab
be
less
of
a
mismatch
next
we
call
bowerman
to
the
stand
i
have
high
hope
for
my
old
coach
but
he
just
wasn
t
himself
that
day
it
be
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
fluster
even
a
bit
intimidate
and
the
reason
quickly
become
obvious
he
hadn
t
prepared
out
of
contempt
for
onitsuka
and
disdain
for
the
whole
sordid
business
he
d
decide
to
wing
it
i
be
sadden
cousin
houser
be
annoyed
bowerman
s
testimony
could
have
put
us
over
the
top
ah
well
we
console
ourselves
with
the
knowledge
that
at
least
he
hadn
t
do
anything
to
hurt
us
next
cousin
houser
read
into
the
record
the
deposition
of
iwano
the
young
assistant
who
d
accompany
kitami
on
his
two
trip
to
the
united
state
happily
iwano
prove
to
be
as
guileless
as
pure
of
heart
as
he
d
first
seem
to
me
and
penny
he
d
told
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
it
flatly
contradict
kitami
iwano
testify
that
there
be
a
firm
fix
plan
in
place
to
break
our
contract
to
abandon
us
to
replace
us
and
that
kitami
have
discuss
it
openly
many
time
we
then
call
a
note
orthopedist
an
expert
on
the
impact
of
run
shoe
on
foot
joint
and
the
spine
who
explain
the
difference
among
the
many
brand
and
model
on
the
market
and
described
how
the
cortez
and
boston
differ
from
anything
onitsuka
ever
make
essentially
he
say
the
cortez
be
the
first
shoe
ever
that
take
pressure
off
the
achilles
revolutionary
he
say
game
change
while
testify
he
spread
out
dozen
of
shoe
and
pull
them
apart
and
toss
them
around
which
agitate
james
the
just
apparently
the
judge
be
ocd
he
like
his
courtroom
neat
always
repeatedly
he
ask
our
orthopedist
to
stop
make
a
mess
to
keep
the
shoe
in
orderly
pair
and
repeatedly
our
orthopedist
ignore
him
i
start
to
hyperventilate
think
james
the
just
be
go
to
find
our
expert
witness
in
contempt
lastly
we
call
woodell

watch
him
wheel
his
chair
slowly
to
the
stand

be
the

d
ever
see
him
in
a
coat
and
tie
he
d
recently
met
a
woman
and
gotten
married
and
now
when
he
told
me
that
he
be
happy
i
believe
him
i
take
a
moment
to
enjoy
how
far
he
d
come
since
we
d
first
met
at
that
beaverton
sandwich
shop
then
i
immediately
felt
awful
because
i
be
the
cause
of
his
be
drag
through
this
muck
he
look
more
nervous
up
there
than
i
d
be
more
intimidate
than
bowerman
james
the
just
ask
him
to
spell
his
name
and
woodell
pause
as
if
he
couldn
t
remember
um
w
double

double
d
suddenly

woodell
that

be
in
the
courtroom
of

woodell

if
only
i
hadn
t
melt
under
pressure
if
only
the
orthopedist
have
kept
his
shoe
in
order
the
judge
look
down
at
us
his
protrude
eyebrow
longer
and
shaggier
than
when
the
trial
begin
he
would
not
rule
on
the
matter
of
the
contract
between
onitsuka
and
blue
ribbon
he
say
i
slump
forward
instead
he
would
rule
solely
on
the
issue
of
trademark
it
seem
clear
to
him
that
this
be
a
case
of
he
say
he
say
we
have
here
two
conflict
story
he
say
and
it
s
the
opinion
of
this
court
that
blue
ribbon
s
be
the
more
convincing
blue
ribbon
have
be
more
truthful
he
say
not
only
throughout
the
dispute
as
evidence
by
document
but
in
this
courtroom
truthfulness
he
say
be
ultimately
all
i
have
to
go
on
to
gauge
this
case
he
note
iwano
s
testimony
compelling
the
judge
say
it
would
seem
kitami
have
lie
he
then
note
kitami
s
use
of
a
translator
during
the
course
of
mr
kitami
s
testimony
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
interrupt
the
translator
to
correct
him
each
time
mr
kitami
correct
him
in
perfect
english
pause
james
the
just
look
through
his
paper
so
he
declare
it
s
therefore
my
ruling
that
blue
ribbon
will
retain
all
right
to
the
name
boston
and
cortez
far
he
say
there
be
clearly
damage
here
loss
of
business
misappropriation
of
trademark
the
question
be
how
to
assign
a
dollar
figure
for
those
damage
the
normal
course
be
to
name
a
special
master
to
determine
what
the
damage
be
this
i
will
do
in
the
come
day
he
slam
down

perfectly
still
it

he
be
just

lock
and
without
a
glance
in
our
direction
he
stood
and
stroll

we

recall
that
strasser

a
huge
sneeze
like

elephant

the
street
no

breathe
awkward
doesn
t

i
thought
washington

cornwallis
weren
t
force
to
ride
the
same
horse
away
from
yorktown
strasser

some
day
after

wind
thing
down
to
say

we
steer
him
into
the
conference
room
and
everyone
gather
around
and
give
him
a
thunderous
ovation
his

don
t
you
come
work
here
strasser
turn
red
and
laugh
that
laugh
i
be
struck
again
by
the
incongruous
falsetto
he
wave
his
hand
pshaw
as
if
we
be
kid
we
weren
t
kid

short
while

stockpot
in
beaverton
i
brought
along
hayes
who
by
now
be
work
full
time
for
blue
ribbon
and
we
make
a
hard
pitch
of
all
the
pitch
in
my
life
this
might
have
be
the
most
carefully
prepared
and
rehearse
because
i
want
strasser
and
i
knew
there
would
be
pushback
he
have
before
him
a
clear
path
to
the
very
top
of
cousin
houser
s
firm
or
any
other
firm
he
might
choose
without
much
effort
he
could
become
partner
secure
a
life
of
mean
privilege
prestige
that
be
the
know
and
we
be
offering
him
the
unknown
so
hayes
and
i
spent
day
role
play
polish
our
argument
and
counterargument
anticipate
what
objection
strasser
might
raise
i
open
by
tell
strasser
that
it
be
all
a
foregone
conclusion
really
you
re
one
of
us
i
say
one
of
us
he
knew
what
those
word
meant
we
be
the
kind
of
people
who
simply
couldn
t
put
up
with
corporate
nonsense
we
be
the
kind
of
people
who
want
our
work
to
be
play
but
meaningful
play
we
be
try
to
slay
goliath
and
though
strasser
be
big
than
two
goliath
at
heart
he
be
an
utter
david
we
be
try
to
create
a
brand
i
say
but
also
a
culture
we
be
fight
against
conformity
against
boringness
against
drudgery
more
than
a
product
we
be
try
to
sell
an
idea
a
spirit
i
don
t
know
if
i
ever
fully
understood
who
we
be
and
what
we
be
do
until
i
heard
myself
say
it
all
that
day
to
strasser
he
kept
nod
he
never
stop
eat
but
he
kept
nod
he
agree
with
me
he
say
he
d
go
directly
from
our
battle
royal
with
onitsuka
to
work
on
several
humdrum
insurance
case
and
every
morning
he
d
want
to
slit
his
wrist
with
a
paper
clip
i
miss
blue
ribbon
he
say
i
miss
the
clarity
i
miss
that
feel
every
day
of
get
a
win
so
i
thank
you
for
your
offer
still
he
wasn
t
say
yes
what
s
up
i
say
i
need
to
ask
my
dad
he
say
i
look
at
hayes
we
both
guffawed
your
dad
hayes
say
the
same
dad
who
d
told
the
cop
to
haul
strasser
away
i
shook
my
head
the
one
argument
hayes
and
i
hadn
t
prepared
for
the
eternal
pull
of
the
old
man
okay
i
say
talk
to
your
father
get
back
to
us
day
later
with
his
old
man
s
blessing
strasser
agree
to
become
the
first
ever
in
house
counsel
for
blue
ribbon
we
have
about
two
week
to
relax
and
enjoy
our
legal
victory
then
we
look
up
and
saw
a
new
threat
loom
on
the
horizon
the
yen
it
be
fluctuate
wildly
and
if
it
continued
to
do
so
it
would
spell
certain
doom
before
the
yen
to
dollar
rate
have
be
pegged
constant
unvarying
one
dollar
be
always
worth
yen
and
vice
versa
you
could
count
on
that
rate
every
day
as
sure
as
you
could
count
on
the
sun
rise
president
nixon
however
felt
the
yen
be
undervalue
he
fear
america
be
send
all
its
gold
to
japan
so
he
cut
the
yen
loose
let
it
float
and
now
the
yen
to
dollar
rate
be
like
the
weather
every
day
different
consequently
no
one
do
business
in
japan
could
possibly
plan
for
tomorrow
the
head
of
sony
famously
complain
it
s
like
play
golf
and
your
handicap
change
on
every
hole
at
the
same
time
japanese
labor
cost
be
on
the
rise
combine
with
a
fluctuate
yen
this
make
life
treacherous
for
any
company
do
the
bulk
of
its
production
in
japan
no
longer
could
i
envision
a
future
in
which
most
of
our
shoe
be
make
there
we
need
new
factory
in
new
country
fast
to
me
taiwan
seem
the
next
logical
step
taiwanese
official
sense
japan
s
collapse
be
rapidly
mobilize
to
fill
the
come
void
they
be
building
factory
at
warp
speed
and
yet
the
factory
weren
t
yet
capable
of
handle
our
workload
plus
their
quality
control
be
poor
until
taiwan
be
ready
we
d
need
to
find
a
bridge
something
to
hold
us
over
i
consider
puerto
rico
we
be
already
make
some
shoe
there
ala
they
weren
t
very
good
also
johnson
have
be
down
there
to
scout
factory
in
and
he
d
report
that
they
weren
t
much
well
than
the
dilapidate
one
he
saw
all
over
new
england
so
we
talk
about
some
sort
of
hybrid
solution
take
raw
material
from
puerto
rico
and
send
them
to
new
england
for
last
and
bottoming
toward
the
end
of
that
impossibly
long
year
this
become
our
plan
and
i
be
well
prepared
to
implement
it
i
d
do
my
homework
i
d
be
make
trip
to
the
east
coast
to
lay
the
groundwork
to
look
at
various
factory
we
might
lease
i
d
go
twice
first
with
cale
then
with
johnson
the
first
time
the
clerk
at
the
rental
car
company
decline
my
credit
card
then
confiscate
it
when
cale
try
to
smooth
it
over
offering
up
his
credit
card
the
clerk
say
he
wouldn
t
accept
cale
s
card
either
because
cale
be
with
me
guilt
by
association
talk
about
your
deadbeat
i
couldn
t
bring
myself
to
look
cale
in
the
eye
here
we
be
a
dozen
year
out
of
stanford
and
while
he
be
an
eminently
successful
businessman
i
be
still
struggle
to
keep
my
head
above
water
he
d
know
i
be
struggle
but
now
he
knew
exactly
how
much
i
be
mortify
he
be
always
there
at
the
big
moment
the
triumphant
moment
but
this
humiliate
little
moment
i
fear
would
define
me
in
his
eye
then
when
we
get
to
the
factory
the
owner
laugh
in
my
face
he
say
he
wouldn
t
consider
do
business
with
some
fly
by
night
company
he
d
never
heard
of
let
alone
from
oregon
on
the
second
trip
i
met
up
with
johnson
in
boston
i
picked
him
up
at
footwear
news
where
he
d
be
scout
potential
supplier
and
together
we
drove
to
exeter
new
hampshire
to
see
an
ancient
shutter
factory
built
around
the
time
of
the
american
revolution
the
factory
be
a
ruin
it
have
once
house
the
exeter
boot
and
shoe
company
but
now
it
house
rat
as
we
pry
open
the
door
and
swat
away
cobweb
the
size
of
fishing
net
all
sort
of
creature
scurry
past
our
foot
and
flew
past
our
ear
bad
there
be
gap
hole
in
the
floor
one
wrong
step
could
mean
a
trip
to
the
earth
s
core
the
owner
lead
us
up
to
the
third
floor
which
be
usable
he
say
he
could
rent
us
this
floor
with
an
option
to
buy
the
whole
place
he
also
say
we
d
need
help
get
the
factory
properly
clean
and
staffed
and
he
give
us
the
name
of
a
local
guy
who
could
help
bill
giampietro
we
met
giampietro
the
next
day
at
an
exeter
tavern
within
minute
i
could
see
this
be
our
man

true
shoe

he
be
fifty
thereabouts
but
his
hair
have
no

seem
paint
with
black
polish
he
have
a
thick
boston
accent
and
besides

only
subject
he
ever
broach
be
his
beloved
wife
and
kid

be
first
generation

father
of

have
be
a
cobbler
he
have
the
serene
expression
and
callus
hand
of
a
craftsman
and
he
proudly
wore
the
standard
uniform
stain
pant
stain
denim
shirt
roll
up
to
the
stain
elbow
he
say
he
d
never
do
anything
in
his
life
but
cobble
and
never
want
to
ask
anyone
he
say
they
ll
tell
you
everyone
in
new
england
call
him
geppetto
he
add
because
everyone
thought
and
still
think
pinocchio
s
father
be
a
cobbler
he
be
actually
a
carpenter
we
each
order
a
steak
and
a
beer
and
then
i
remove
a
pair
of
cortez
from
my
briefcase
can
you
equip
the
exeter
factory
to
turn
out
these
baby
i
ask
he
take
the
shoe
examine
them
pull
them
apart
yanked
out
their
tongue
he
peer
into
them
like
a
doctor
no
fuck
problem
he
say
drop
them
on
the
table
the
cost
he
do
the
math
in
his
head
rent
and
fix
up
the
exeter
factory
plus
worker
material
sundries
he
guess
let
s
do
it
i
say
later
while
johnson
and
i
be
on
a
run
he
ask
me
how
we
be
go
to
pay
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
for
a
factory
when
we
could
barely
pay
for
giampietro
s
steak
i
told
him
calmly
in
fact
with
the
calm
of
a
madman
that
i
be
go
to
have
nissho
pay
for
it
why
on
earth
be
nissho
go
to
give
you
money
to
run
a
factory
he
ask
simple
i
say
i
m
not
go
to
tell
them
i
stop
run
put
my
hand
on
my
knee
and
told
johnson
furthermore
that
i
be
go
to
need
him
to
run
that
factory
his
mouth
open
then
shut
just
one
year
ago
i
d
ask
him
to
move
across
the
country
to
oregon
now
i
want
him
to
move
back
east
again
to
work
in
close
proximity
to
giampietro
and
woodell
with
whom
he
have
a
very
complicate
rapport
craziest
thing
i
ve
ever
heard
he
say
never
mind
the
inconvenience
never
mind
the
insanity
of
schlepping
all
the
way
back
to
the
east
coast
what
do
i
know
about
run
a
factory
i
d
be
in
completely
over
my
head
i
laugh
i
laugh
and
laugh
over
your
head
i
say
over
your
head
we
re
all
in
over
our
head
way
over
he
moan
he
sound
like
a
car
try
to
start
on
a
cold
morning
i
wait
just
give
it
a
second
i
thought
he
deny
fume
bargain
get
depressed
then
accepted
the
five
stage
of
jeff
at
last
he
let
out
a
long
sigh
and
say
he
knew
this
be
a
big
job
and
like
me
he
didn
t
trust
anyone
else
to
handle
it
he
say
he
knew
that
when
it
come
to
blue
ribbon
each
of
us
be
willing
to
do
whatever
be
necessary
to
win
and
if
whatever
be
necessary
fell
outside
our
area
of
expertise
hey
as
giampietro
would
say
no
fuck
problem
he
didn
t
know
anything
about
run
a
factory
but
he
be
willing
to
try
to
learn
fear
of
failure
i
thought
will
never
be
our
downfall
as
a
company
not
that
any
of
us
thought
we
wouldn
t
fail
in
fact
we
have
every
expectation
that
we
would
but
when
we
do
fail
we
have
faith
that
we
d
do
it
fast
learn
from
it
and
be
well
for
it
johnson
frown
nod
okay
he
say
deal
and
so
as
we
enter
the
final
day
of
johnson
be
firmly
ensconce
in
exeter
and
often
late
at
night
think
of
him
back
there
i
d
smile
and
say
under
my
breath
godspeed
old
friend
you
re
giampietro
s
problem
now
our
contact
at
the
bank

be
very
much
like
harry
white
at
first
national
agreeable
friendly
loyal
but
absolutely
feckless
because
he
have
rigid
loan
limit
that

always
well
below
our
request
and
his
boss
like
white
s
be
always
press
us
to
slow
down
we
respond
in
by
mash
the
accelerator
we
be
on
pace
for
million
in
sale
and
nothing
but
nothing
be
go
to
stop
us
from
hit
that
number
in
defiance
of
the
bank
we
make
deal
with
more
store
and
open
several
store
of
our
own
and
continued
to
sign
celebrity
athlete
endorser
we
couldn
t
afford
at
the
same
time
pre
be
smash
american
record
in
nike
the
best
tennis
player
in
the
world

smash
racket
in
them
his
name
be
jimmy
connors
and
his
big
fan
be
jeff
johnson
connors
johnson
told
me
be
the
tennis
version
of
pre
rebellious
iconoclastic
he
urge
me
to
reach
out
to
connors
sign
him
to
an
endorsement
deal
fast
thus
in
the
summer
of
i
phone
connors
s
agent
and
make
my
pitch
we
d
sign
nastase
for
ten
thousand
dollar
i
say
and
we
be
willing
to
offer
his
boy
half
that
the
agent
jumped
at
the
deal
before
connors
could
sign
the
paper
however
he
left
the
country
for
wimbledon
then
against
all
odds
he
won
wimbledon
in
our
shoe
next
he
come
home
and
shock
the
world
by
win
the
u
s
open
i
be
giddy
i
phone
the
agent
and
ask
if
connors
have
sign
those
paper
yet
we
want
to
get
start
promote
him
what
paper
the
agent
say
uh
the
paper
we
have
a
deal
remember
yeah
i
don
t
remember
any
deal
we
ve
already
get
a
deal
three
time
well
than
your
deal
which
i
don
t
remember
disappoint
we
all
agree
but
oh
well
besides
we
all
say
we
ve
still
get
pre
we
ll
always
have
pre

pay
nissho
first
this
be
my
morning
chant
my
nightly
prayer
my
number
one
priority
and
it
be
my
daily
instruction
to
the
man
who
played
the
sundance
kid
to
my
butch
cassidy
hayes
before
pay
back
the
bank
i
say
before
pay
back
anyone
pay
nissho
it
wasn
t
so
much
a
strategy
as
a
necessity
nissho
be
like
equity
our
line
of
credit
at
the
bank
be
million
but
we
have
another
million
in
credit
with
nissho
which
willingly
take
second
position
which
make
the
bank
feel
more
secure
all
of
this
would
unspool
however
if
nissho
weren
t
there
ergo
we
need
to
keep
nissho
happy
always
always
pay
nissho
first
it
wasn
t
easy
however
this
pay
nissho
first
it
wasn
t
easy
pay
anyone
we
be
undergo
an
explosion
in
asset
and
inventory
which
put
enormous
strain
on
our
cash
reserve
with
any
growth
company
this
be
the
typical
problem
but
we
be
grow
faster
than
the
typical
growth
company
faster
than
any
growth
company
i
knew
of
our
problem
be
unprecedented
or
so
it
seem
i
be
also
partly
to
blame
of
course
i
refuse
to
even
consider
order
less
inventory
grow
or
die
that
s
what
i
believe
no
matter
the
situation
why
cut
your
order
from
million
down
to
million
if
you
believe
in
your
bone
that
the
demand
out
there
be
for
million
so
i
be
forever
push
my
conservative
banker
to
the
brink
force
them
into
a
game
of
chicken
i
d
order
a
number
of
shoe
that
seem
to
them
absurd
a
number
we
d
need
to
stretch
to
pay
for
and
i
d
always
just
barely
pay
for
them
in
the
nick
of
time
and
then
just
barely
pay
our
other
monthly
bill
at
the
last
minute
always
do
just
enough
and
no
more
to
prevent
the
banker
from
booting
us
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
month
i
d
empty
our
account
to
pay
nissho
and
start
from
zero
again
to
most
observer
this
would
ve
seem
a
brazenly
reckless
dangerous
way
of
do
business
but
i
believe
the
demand
for
our
shoe
be
always
great
than
our
annual
sale
besides
eight
of
every
ten
order
be
solid
gold
guaranteed
thanks
to
our
future
program
full
speed
ahead
others
might
have
argue
that
we
didn
t
need
to
fear
nissho
the
company
be
our
ally
after
all
we
be
make
them
money
how
mad
could
they
get
also
i
have
a
strong
personal
relationship
with
sumeragi
but
suddenly
in
sumeragi
be
no
longer
run
thing
our
account
have
grown
too
big
for
him
our
credit
be
no
longer
his
call
alone
we
be
now
overseen
by
the
west
coast
credit
manager
chio
suzuki
who
be
base
in
los
angeles
and
even
more
directly
by
the
financial
manager
of
the
portland
office
tadayuki
ito
whereas
sumeragi
be
warm
and
approachable
ito
be
congenitally
aloof
light
seem
to
bounce
off
him
differently
no
rather
light
didn
t
bounce
off
him
he
absorbed
it
like
a
black
hole
everybody
at
blue
ribbon
like
sumeragi
we
invite
him
to
every
office
party
but
i
don
t
think
we
ever
invite
ito
to
anything
in
my
mind
i
call
him
the
ice
man
i
still
have
difficulty
make
eye
contact
with
people
but
ito
wouldn
t
allow
me
to
divert
my
gaze
he
look
directly
into
my
eye
down
into
my
soul
and
it
be
hypnotize
especially
when
he
felt
he
have
the
upper
hand
which
be
almost
always
i
d
played
golf
with
him
once
or
twice
and
i
be
struck
even
after
he
d
hit
a
terrible
shot
at
the
way
he
turn
and
look
straight
at
me
as
he
come
off
the
tee
he
wasn
t
a
good
golfer
but
he
be
so
confident
so
self
assure
he
always
give
the
impression
that
his
ball
be
sit
yard
away
atop
a
tuft
of
grass
in
the
center
of
the
fairway
and
now
i
remember
this
in
particular
his
golf
attire
like
his
business
attire
be
meticulous
mine
of
course
be
not
during
one
of
our
match
the
weather
be
cool
and
i
be
wear
a
shaggy
mohair
sweater
as
i
approach
the
first
tee
ito
ask
under
his
breath
if
i
plan
to
go
skiing
later
i
stop
wheel
he
give
me
a
half
smile
it
be
the
first
time
i
d
ever
know
the
ice
man
to
try
humor
and
the
last
this
be
the
man
i
need
to
keep
happy
it
wouldn
t
be
easy
but
i
thought
always
do
well
in
his
eye
and
credit
will
continue
to
expand
thus
enable
blue
ribbon
to
expand
stay
in
his
good
grace
and
all
will
be
well
otherwise
my
obsession
with
keep
nissho
happy
with
keep
ito
happy
combine
with
my
refusal
to
ease
up
on
growth
create
a
frantic
atmosphere
around
the
office
we
struggle
to
make
every
payment
to
bank
of
california
to
all
our
other
creditor
but
that
nissho
payment
at
the
end
of
the
month
be
like
passing
a
kidney
stone
as
we
d
begin
scrap
together
our
available
cash
write
check
with
barely
enough
to
cover
them
we
d
start
to
sweat
the
nissho
payment
be
sometimes
so
big
that
we
d
be
dead
broke
for
a
day
or
two
then
every
other
creditor
would
have
to
wait
too
bad
for
them
i
d
tell
hayes
i
know
i
know
he
d
say
pay
nissho
first
hayes
didn
t
like
this
state
of
affair
it
be
hard
on
his
nerve
so
what
do
you
want
to
do
i
d
ask
him
slow
down
which
would
always
draw
a
guilty
smile
silly
question
occasionally
when
our
cash
reserve
be
really
stretch
thin
our
account
at
the
bank
wouldn
t
just
be
empty
it
would
be
overdrawn
then
hayes
and
i
would
have
to
go
down
to
the
bank
and
explain
the
situation
to
holland
we
d
show
him
our
financial
statement
point
out
that
our
sale
be
double
that
our
inventory
be
fly
out
the
door
our
cash
flow
situation
we
d
say
be
merely
temporary
we
knew
of
course
that
living
on
the
float
wasn
t
the
way
to
do
thing
but
we
d
always
tell
ourselves
it
s
temporary
besides
everyone
do
it
some
of
the
big
company
in
america
live
on
the
float
bank
themselves
live
on
the
float
holland
acknowledge
as
much
sure
boy
i
get
it
he
d
say
with
a
nod
as
long
as
we
be
up
front
with
him
as
long
as
we
be
transparent
he
could
work
with
us
and
then
come
that
fateful
rainy
day
a
wednesday
afternoon
the
spring
of
hayes
and
i
found
ourselves
star
into
the
abyss
we
owe
nissho
million
our
first
ever
million
dollar
payment
and
hello

didn
t
have

around

be
about
short
i
recall
that
we
be
sit
in
my
office
watch
raindrop
race
down
the
windowpane
occasionally
we
d
look
through
the
book
curse
the
number
then
look
back
at
the
raindrop
we
have
to
pay
nissho
i
say
quietly
yes
yes
yes
hayes
say
but
to
cover
a
check
this
large
we
ll
have
to
drain
all
our
other
bank
account

all
that
money
to
the
home
office

a
day
or
two
or
three
along
with
every
cent
from
johnson
s
factory
in
exeter
we
d
have
to
hold
our
breath
like
walk
past
a
graveyard
until
we
could
replenish
those
account
and
still
we
might
not
be
able
to
cover
that
massive
check
to
nissho
we
d
still
need
a
little
luck
a
payment
or
two
to
land
from
one
of
the
many
retailer

good
shape
it

remember
leave
the
bank
or
walk
out
or
go
across
the
street
or
get
on
the
elevator
or
rid
it
to
the
top
floor
i
only
recall
shake
violently
shake
as

thing
i

hayes
and
me
into
their
conference
room
they
could
sense
that
we
be
fragile
they
lead
us
to
chair
and
they
both
look
at
the
floor
as
i
spoke
kei
much
kei
well
i
say
i
have
some
bad
news
our
bank
have
thrown
us
out
ito
look
up
why
he
say
his
eye
harden
but
his
voice
be
surprisingly
soft
i
thought
of
the
wind
atop
mount
fuji
i
thought
of
the
gentle
breeze
stir
the
ginkgo
leaf
in
the
meiji
garden
i
say
mr
ito
do
you
know
how
the
big
trading
company
and
bank
live
on
the
float
okay
we
at
blue
ribbon
tend
to
do
that
too
from
time
to
time
include
last
month
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
sir
well
we
miss
the
float
and
now
the
bank
of
california
have
decide
to
kick
us
out
sumeragi
lit
a
lucky
strike
one
puff
two
ito
do
the
same
one
puff
two
but
on
the
exhale
the
smoke
didn
t
seem
to
come
from
his
mouth
it
seem
to
emanate
from
deep
down
inside
him
to
curl
from
his
cuff
and
shirt
collar
he
look
into
my
eye
he
bore
into
me
they
should
not
have
do
that
he
say
my
heart
stop
midbeat
this
be
an
almost
sympathetic
thing
for
ito
to
say
i
look
at
hayes
i
look
back
at
ito
i
allow
myself
to
think
we
might
just
get
away
with
this
then
i
realize
that
i
hadn
t
yet
told
him
the
bad
part
be
that
as
it
may
i
say
they
do
throw
us
out
mr
ito
they
do
and
the
net
net
be
that
i
have
no
bank
and
thus
i
have
no
money
and
i
need
to
make
payroll
and
i
need
to
pay
my
other
creditor
and
if
i
can
t
meet
those
obligation
i
be
out
of
business
today
in
which
case
not
only
can
i
not
pay
you
the
million
dollar
i
owe
you
sir
but
i
need
to
ask
to
borrow
another
one
million
dollar
ito
and
sumeragi

sixteen
hundred
square
foot
sanctuary
i
sigh
but
the
relief
didn
t
last
i
start
think
about
my
life
i
scroll
back
year
question
every
decision
i
d
ever
make
that
lead
to
this
point
if
only
i
d
be
well
at
sell
encyclopedia
i
thought
everything
would
be
different
i
try
to
give
myself
the
standard
catechism
what
do
you
know
but
i
didn
t
know
anything
sit
in
my
recliner
i
want
to
cry
out
i
know
nothing
i
d
always
have
an
answer
some
kind
of
answer
to
every
problem
but
this
moment
this
night
i
have
no
answer
i
get
up
found
a
yellow
legal
pad
start
make
list
but
my
mind
kept
drift
when
i
look
down
at
the
pad
there
be
only
doodle
check
mark
squiggle
lightning
bolt
in
the
eerie
glow
of
the
moon
they
all
look
like
angry
defiant
swoosh
don
t
go
to
sleep
one
night
what
you
most
want
will
come
to
you
then
i
manage
to
fall
asleep
for
an
hour
or
two
and
i
spent
most
of
that
bleary
saturday
morning
on
the
phone
reach
out
to
people
for
advice
everyone
say
monday
would
be
the
critical
day
perhaps
the
most
critical
of
my
life
i
would
need
to
act
swiftly
and
boldly
so
to
prepare
i
organize
a
summit
for
sunday
afternoon
we
all
gather
in
the
conference
room
at
blue
ribbon
there
be
woodell
who
must
have
caught
the
first
flight
out
of
boston
and
hayes
and
strasser
and
cale
flew
up
from
los
angeles
someone
brought
doughnut
someone
sent
out
for
pizza
someone
dial
johnson
and
put
him
on
the
speakerphone
the
mood
in
the
room
at
first
be
somber
because
that
be
my
mood
but
have
my
friend
around
my
team
make
me
feel
well
and
as
i
lighten
up
they
do
too
we
talk
long
into
the
even
and
if
we
agree
on
anything
we
agree
there
wasn
t
an
easy
solution
there
usually
isn
t
when
the
fbi
have
be
notify
or
when
you
ve
be
oust
by
your
bank
for
the
second
time
in
five
year
as
the
summit
drew
to
a
close
the
mood
shift
again
the
air
in
the
room
grow
stale
heavy
the
pizza
look
like
poison
a
consensus
form
the
resolution
of
this
crisis
whatever
it
might
be
be
in
the
hand
of
others
and
of
all
those
others
nissho
be
our
best
hope
we
discuss
tactic
for
monday
morning
that
s
when
the
men
from
nissho
be
due
to
arrive
ito
and
sumeragi
be
go
to
pore
through
our
book
and
while
there
be
no
tell
what
they
might
think
of
our
finance
one
thing
be
pretty
much
preordain
they
be
go
to
see
right
away
that
we
d
use
a
big
chunk
of
their
financing
not
to
purchase
shoe
from
overseas
but
to
run
a
secret
factory
in
exeter
best
case
this
would
make
them
mad
bad
case
it
would
make
them
lose
their
mind
if
they
consider
our
accounting
sleight
of
hand
a
full
fledge
betrayal
they
would
abandon
us
faster
than
the
bank
have
in
which
case
we
d
be
out
of
business
simple
as
that
we
talk
about
hiding
the
factory
from
them
but
everyone
around
the
table
agree
that
we
need
to
play
this
one
straight
as
in
the
onitsuka

found
penny

we
sat
in
the
din

i
give
her
an
update
we
agree
that
nissho
be

with
their
audit
they
d
know
everything
they
need
to
know
before
lunch
what

and
be
yet
to

be
simply
punishment
don
t
let
them
push
you
around
like
this
penny
say
be
you
kid
i
say
right
now
they
can
push
me
around
all
they
want
they
re
my
only
hope
at
least
there
be
no
more
surprise
she
say
yes
i
say
no
more
shoe
to
drop
ito
and
sumeragi
be
back
at
a
m
the
next
morning
and
take
up
their
place
in
the
conference
room
i
go
around
the
office
and
told
everyone
it
s
almost
over
just
hang
on
just
a
little
longer
there
s
nothing
else
for
them
to
find
not
long
after
they
d
arrive
sumeragi
stood
stretch
and
look
as
if
he
be
go
to
step
outside
for
a
smoke
he
motion
to
me
a
word
we
walk
down
the
hall
to
my
office
i
fear
this
audit
be
bad
than
you
realize
he
say
what
why
i
say
because
he
say
i
delayed
i
sometimes
do
not
put
invoice
through
right
away
you
do
what
now
i
say
hangdog
sumeragi
explain
that
he
d
be
worried
about
us
that
he
d
try
to
help
us
manage
our
credit
problem
by
hiding
nissho
s
invoice
in
a
drawer
he
d
held
them
back
not
sent
them
on
through
to
his
accounting
people
until
he
felt
we
have
enough
cash
to
pay
them
which
in
turn
make
it
appear
on
the
nissho
book
that
their
credit
exposure
to
us
be
much
low
than
it
actually
be
in
other
word
all
this
time
we
d
be
stress
about
pay
nissho
on
time
and
we
be
never
pay
them
on
time
because
sumeragi
wasn
t
invoice
us
on
time
think
he
be
help
this
be
bad
i
say
to
sumeragi
yes
he
say
relighting
a
lucky
strike
be
bad
buck
be
very
very
bad
i
march
him
back
to
the
conference
room
and
together
we
told
ito
who
be
of
course
appalled
at
first
he
suspect
sumeragi
of
act
at
our
behest
i
couldn
t
blame
him
a
conspiracy
be
the
most
logical
explanation
in
his
place
i
would
ve
thought
the
same
thing
but
sumeragi
who
look
as
if
he
be
about
to
prostrate
himself
before
ito
swore
on
his
life
that
he
d
be
act
independently
that
he
d
go
rogue
why
you
do
such
a
thing
ito
demand
because
i
think
blue
ribbon
could
be
great
success
sumeragi
say
maybe
million
account
i
shake
hand
many
time
with
mr
steve
prefontaine
i
shake
hand
with
mr
bill
bowerman
i
go
many
time
to
trail
blazer
game
with
mr
phil
knight
i
even
pack
order
at
warehouse
nike
be
my
business
child
always
it
be
nice
to
see
one
s
business
child
grow
so
then
ito
say
you
hide
invoice
because
you
like
these
men
deeply
ashamed
sumeragi
bow
his
head
hai
he
say
hai
i
have
no
idea
what
ito
might
do
but
i
couldn
t
stick
around
to
find
out
i
suddenly
have
another
problem
my
two
angriest
creditor
have
just
land
shesky
from
bostonian
and
manowitz
from
mano
be
both
on
the
ground
in
portland
head
our
way
quickly
i
gather
everyone
in
my
office
and
give
them
their
final
order
folk
we
re
go
to
code
red
this
building
this
forty
five
hundred
square
foot
building
be
about
to
be
swarm
with
people
to
whom
we
owe
money
whatever
else
we
do
today
we
cannot
let
any
of
them
bump
into
each
other
bad
enough
that
we
owe
them
money
if
they
cross
path
in
the
hall
if
one
unhappy
creditor
meet
another
unhappy
creditor
and
if
they
should
have
a
chance
to
compare
note
they
will
freak
out
they
could
team
up
and
decide
on
some
sort
of
collaborative
payment
schedule
which
would
be
armageddon
we
drew
up
a
plan
we
assign
a
person
to
each
creditor
someone
who
would
keep
an
eye
on
him
at
all
time
even
escort
him
to
the
restroom
then
we
assign
a
person
to
coordinate
everything
to
be
like
air
traffic
control
make
sure
the
creditor
and
their
escort
be
always
in
separate
airspace
meanwhile
i
would
scurry
from
room
to
room
apologize
and
genuflect
at
time
the
tension
be
unbearable
at
other
time
it
be
a
bad
marx
brother
movie
in
the
end
somehow
it
work
none
of
the
creditor
met
any
of
the
others
both
shesky
and
manowitz
left
the
building
that
night
feel
reassure
even
murmur
nice
thing
about
blue
ribbon
nissho
left
a
couple
hour
later
by
then
ito

accepted
that
sumeragi
be

unilaterally
hiding

d
ever
found
the
strength
to
deliver
those
word
penny
and
i
didn
t
follow
the
cortege
to
the
cemetery
we
couldn
t
we
be
too
overwrought
we
didn
t
talk
to
bowerman
either
and
i
don
t
know
that
i
ever
talk
to
him
thereafter
about
pre
s
death
neither
of
us
could
bear
it
later
i
heard
that
something
be
happen
at
the
spot
where
pre
die
it
be
become
a
shrine
people
be
visit
it
every
day
leave
flower
letter
note
gift
nike
someone
should
collect
it
all
i
thought
keep
it
in
a
safe
place
i
recall
the
many
holy
site
i
d
visit
in
someone
need
to
curate
pre
s
rock
and
i
decide
that
someone
need
to
be
us
we
didn
t
have
money
for
anything
like
that
but
i
talk
it
over
with
johnson
and
woodell
and
we
agree
that
as
long
as
we
be
in
business
we
d
find
money
for
thing
like
that

now
that
we
d
gotten
past
our
bank
crisis
now
that
i
be
reasonably
sure
of
not
go
to
jail
i
could
go
back
to
ask
the
deep
question
what
be
we
try
to
build
here
what
kind
of
company
do
we
want
to
be
like
most
company
we
have
role
model
sony
for
instance
sony
be
the
apple
of
its
day
profitable
innovative
efficient
and
it
treat
its
worker
well
when
press
i
often
say
i
want
to
be
like
sony
at
root
however
i
still
aim
and
hop
for
something
big
and
vaguer
i
would
search
my
mind
and
heart
and
the
only
thing
i
could
come
up
with
be
this
word
win
it
wasn
t
much
but
it
be
far
far
well
than
the
alternative
whatever
happen
i
just
didn
t
want
to
lose
lose
be
death
blue
ribbon
be
my
third
child
my
business
child
as
sumeragi
say
and
i
simply
couldn
t
bear
the
idea
of
it
die
it
have
to
live
i
told
myself
it
just
have
to
that
s
all
i
know
several
time
in
those
first
month
of
i
huddle
with
hayes
and
woodell
and
strasser
and
over
sandwich
and
soda
we
d
kick
around
this
question
of
ultimate
goal
this
question
of
win
and
lose
money
wasn
t
our
aim
we
agree
money
wasn
t
our
end
game
but
whatever
our
aim
or
end
money
be
the
only
mean
to
get
there
more
money
than
we
have
on
hand
nissho
be
loan
us
million
and
that
relationship
felt
sound
solidify
by
the
recent
crisis
best
partner
you
ll
ever
have
chuck
robinson
have
be
right
but
to
keep
up
with
demand
to
continue
grow
we
need
million
more
our
new
bank
be
loan
us
money
which
be
good
but
because
they
be
a
small
bank
we
d
already
reach
their
legal
limit
at
some
point
in
those
woodell
strasser
hayes
discussion
we
start
to
talk
about
the
most
logical
arithmetical
solution
which
be
also
the
most
difficult
one
emotionally
go
public
on
one
level
of
course
the
idea
make
perfect
sense
go
public
would
generate
a
ton
of
money
in
a
flash
but
it
would
also
be
highly
perilous
because
go
public
often
meant
lose
control
it
could
mean
work
for
someone
else
suddenly
be
answerable
to
stockholder
hundred
or
maybe
thousand
of
stranger
many
of
whom
would
be
large
investment
firm
go
public
could
turn
us
overnight
into
the
thing
we
loathe
the
thing
we
d
spent
our
life
run
from
for
me
there
be
an
add
consideration
a
semantic
one
define
by
shyness
intensely
private
i
found
that
phrase
itself
off
put
go
public
no
thank
you
and
yet
during
my
nightly
run
i
d
sometimes
ask
myself
hasn
t
your
life
be
a
kind
of
search
for
connection
run
for
bowerman
backpacking
around
the
world
start
a
company
marry
penny
assemble
this
band
of
brother
at
blue
ribbon
s
core
hasn
t
it
all
be
about
one
way
or
another
go
public
in
the
end
however
i
decide
we
decide
go
public
wasn
t
right
it
s
just
not
for
us
i
say
and
we
say
no
way
never
meeting
adjourn
so
we
set
about
cast
for
other
way
to
raise
money
one
way
found
us
first
state
bank
ask
us
to
apply
for
a
million
dollar
loan
which
the
u
s
small
business
administration
would
then
guarantee
it
be
a
loophole
a
way
for
a
small
bank
to
gently
expand
its
credit
line
because
their
guaranteed
loan
limit
be
great
than
their
direct
loan
limit
so
we
do
it
mainly
to
make
their
life
easy
as
be
always
the
case
the
process
turn
out
to
be
more
complicate
than
it
first
appear
first
state
bank
and
the
small
business
administration
require
that
bowerman
and
i
as
majority
shareholder
both
personally
guarantee
the
loan
we
d
do
that
at
first
national
and
at
bank
of
california
so
i
didn
t
see
a
problem
i
be
in
hock
up
to
my
neck
what
be
one
more
guarantee
bowerman
however
balk
retire
living
on
a
fix
income
dispirit
after
the
trauma
of
the
last
few
year
and
greatly
weaken
by
the
death
of
pre
he
didn
t
want
any
more
risk
he
fear
lose
his
mountain
rather
than
give
his
personal
guarantee
he
offer
to
give
me
two
third
of
his
stake
in
blue
ribbon
at
a
discount
price
he
be
bow
out
i
didn
t
want
this
never
mind
that
i
didn
t
have
the
money
to
buy
his
stake
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
the
cornerstone
of
my
company
the
anchor
of
my
psyche
but
bowerman
be
adamant
and
i
knew
well
than
to
argue
so
we
both
go
to
jaqua
and
ask
him
to
help
broker
the
deal
jaqua
be
still
bowerman
s
best
friend
but
i
d
come
to
think
of
him
as
a
close
friend
too
i
still
trust
him
completely
let
s
not
fully
dissolve
the
partnership
i
say
to
him
though
i
reluctantly
agree
to
buy
bowerman
s
stake
low
payment
spread
over
five
year
i
beg
him
to
retain
a
percentage
stay
on
as
a
vice
president
and
member
of
our
small
board
deal
he
say
we
all
shook
hand
while
we
be
busy
move
around
stake
and
dollar
the
dollar
itself
be
hemorrhage
value
it
be
all
at
once
in
a
death
spiral
against
the
japanese
yen
couple
with
rise
japanese
labor
rate
this
be
now
the
most
imminent
threat
to
our
existence
we
d
increase
and
diversified
source
of
production
we
d
add
new
factory
in
new
england
and
puerto
rico
but
we
be
still
do
nearly
all
our
manufacturing
in
volatile
japan
mostly
at
nippon
rubber
a
sudden
cripple
shortage
of
supply
be
a
real
possibility
especially
give
the
spike
in
demand
for
bowerman
s
waffle
trainer
with
its
unique
outer
sole
and
its
pillowy
midsole
cushion
and
its
below
market
price
the
waffle
trainer
be
continue
to
capture
the
popular
imagination
like
no
previous
shoe
it
didn
t
just
feel
different
or
fit
different
it
look
different
radically
so
bright
red
upper
fat
white
swoosh
it
be
a
revolution
in
aesthetic
its
look
be
draw
hundred
of
thousand
of
new
customer
into
the
nike
fold
and
its
performance
be
seal
their
loyalty
it
have
well
traction
and
cushion
than
anything
on
the
market
watch
that
shoe
evolve
in
from
popular
accessory
to
cultural
artifact
i
have
a
thought
people
might
start
wear
this
thing
to
class
and
the
office
and
the
grocery
store
and
throughout
their
everyday
life
it
be
a
rather
grandiose
idea
adidas
have
have
limited
success
convert
athletic
shoe
to
everyday
wear
with
the
stan
smith
tennis
shoe
and
the
country
run
shoe
but
neither
be
nearly
as
distinctive
or
popular
as
the
waffle
trainer
so
i
order
our
factory
to
start
make
the
waffle
trainer
in
blue
which
would
go
well
with
jean
and
that
s
when
it
really
take
off
we
couldn
t
make
enough
retailer
and
sale
rep
be
on
their
knee
plead
for
all
the
waffle
trainer
we
could
ship
the
soar
pair
count
be
transform
our
company
not
to
mention
the
industry
we
be
see
number
that
redefine
our
long
term
goal
because
they
give
us
something
we
d
always
lack
an
identity
more
than
a
brand
nike
be
now
become
a
household
word
to
such
an
extent
that
we
would
have
to
change
the
company
name
blue
ribbon
we
decide
have
run
its
course
we
would
have
to
incorporate
as
nike
inc
and
for
this
newly
name
entity
to
stay
vibrant
to
keep
grow
to
survive
the
decline
dollar
we
d
need
as
always
to
ramp
up
production
sale
rep
on
their
knee
that
wasn
t
sustainable
we
d
need
to
find
more
manufacturing
hub
outside
japan
our
exist
factory
in
america
and
puerto
rico
would
help
but
they
weren
t
nearly
enough
too
old
too
few
too
expensive
so
in
the
spring
of
it
be
finally
time
to
turn
to
taiwan
for
our
point
man
in
taiwan
i
look
to
jim
gorman
a
value
employee
long
know
for
his
almost
fanatical
loyalty
to
nike
raise
in
a
series
of
foster
home
gorman
seem
to
find
in
nike
the
family
he
d
never
have
and
thus
he
be
always
a
good
sport
always
a
team
player
it
be
gorman
for
instance
who
d
drawn
the
unpleasant
task
of
drive
kitami
to
the
airport
back
in
after
that
final
showdown
in
jaqua
s
conference
room
and
he
do
it
without
complaint
it
be
gorman
who
d
take
over
the
eugene
store
from
woodell
the
toughest
of
act
to
follow
it
be
gorman
who
wore
subpar
nike
spike
in
the
olympic
trial
in
every
instance
gorman
have
do
a
fine
job
and
never
uttered
a
sour
word
he
seem
the
perfect
candidate
to
take
on
the
late
mission
impossible
taiwan
but
first
i
d
need
to
give
him
a
crash
course
on
asia
so
i
schedule
a
trip
just
the
two
of
us
on
the
flight
overseas
gorman
prove
to
be
an
avid
student
a
virtual
sponge
he
grill
me
about
my
experience
my
opinion
my
reading
and
write
down
every
word
i
say
i
felt
as
if
i
be
back
in
school
teach
at
portland
state
and
i
like
it
i
remember
that
the
best
way
to
reinforce
your
knowledge
of
a
subject
be
to
share
it
so
we
both
benefit
from
my
transfer
everything
i
knew
about
japan
korea
china
and
taiwan
to
gorman
s
brain
shoe
producer
i
told
him
be
abandon
japan
en
masse
and
they
re
all
land
in
two
place
korea
and
taiwan
both
country
specialize
in
low
price
footwear
but
korea
have
elect
to
go
with
a
few
giant
factory
whereas
taiwan
be
building
a
hundred
small
one
so
that
s
why
we
re
choose
taiwan
our
demand
be
too
high
our
volume
too
low
for
the
big
factory
and
in
small
factory
we
ll
have
the
dominant
position
we
ll
be
in
charge
of
course
the
tougher
challenge
be
to
get
any
factory
we
chose
to
upgrade
its
quality
and
then
there
be
the
constant
threat
of
political
instability
president
chiang
kai
shek
have
just
die
i
told
gorman
and
after
twenty
five
year
in
command
he
be
leave
a
nasty
power
vacuum
for
good
measure
you
always
need
to
account
for
taiwan
s
ancient
tension
with
china
on
and
on
i
talk
as
we
sail
over
the
pacific
while
take
copious
note
gorman
also
come
up
with
new
fresh
idea
which
give
me
new
insight
thing
to
think
about
step
off
the
plane
in
taichung
our
first
stop
i
be
delighted
this
guy
be
intense
energetic
eager
to
get
start
i
be
proud
to
be
his
mentor
good
choice
i
told
myself
by
the
time
we
reach
the
hotel
however
gorman
be
wilt
taichung
look
and
smell
like
the
far
end
of
the
galaxy
a
vast
megalopolis
of
smoking
factory
and
thousand
of
people
per
square
foot
it
be
unlike
anything
i
d
ever
see
and
i
d
be
all
over
asia
so
of
course
it

map
which
prove
useless

an
unmapped
part
of
the
city
the
bad
part
gorman
and
i
walk
down
a
series
of
unmarked
lane
up
a
series
of
unnumbered
alley
do
you
see
a
street
sign
i
can
barely
see
the
street
we
must
have
gotten
lose
a
dozen
time
finally
there
it
be
a
stout
building
of
old
red
brick
inside
we
found
a
precarious
staircase
the
handrail
come
off
in
our
hand
as
we
walk
up
to
the
third
floor
and
each
stone
step
have
a
deep
indentation
from
contact
with
a
million
shoe
enter
hsieh
shout
when
we
knock
we
found
him
sit
in
the
middle
of
a
room
that
look
like
the
nest
of
a
giant
rat
everywhere
we
look
be
shoe
and
more
shoe
and
pile
of
shoe
piece
sol
and
lace
and
tongue
hsieh
jumped
to
his
foot
clear
a
space
for
us
to
sit
he
offer
us
tea
then
while
the
water
boil
he
begin
educate
us
do
you
know
that
every
country
in
the
world
have
many
many
custom
and
superstition
about
shoe
he
grabbed
a
shoe
from
a
shelf
held
it
before
our
face
do
you
know
that
in
china
when
man
marries
woman
they
throw
red
shoe
on
the
roof
to
make
sure
all
go
well
on
wedding
night
he
rotate
the
shoe
in
the
scant
daylight
that
manage
to
fight
through
the
grime
on
his
window
he
told
us
which
factory
it
come
from
why
he
thought
it
be
well
make
how
it
could
have
be
make
well
do
you
know
that
in
many
country
when
someone
start
on
a
journey
it
s
actually
good
luck
to
throw
a
shoe
at
them
he
grabbed
another
shoe
extend
it
like
hamlet
hold
yorick
s
skull
he
identify
its
provenance
told
us
why
it
be
poorly
make
why
it
would
soon
fall
apart
then
toss
it
aside
with
disdain
the
difference
from
one
shoe
to
another
he
say
nine
time
out
of
ten
be
the
factory
forget
design
forget
color
forget
all
the
other
thing
that
go
into
a
shoe
it
s
all
about
factory
i
listen
closely
and
take
note
like
gorman
on
the
plane
though
the
whole
time
i
be
think
it
s
a
performance
he
s
put
on
a
show
try
to
sell
us
he
doesn
t
realize
that
we
need
him
more
than
he
need
us
now
hsieh
go
into
his
pitch
he
told
us
that
in
exchange
for
a
small
fee
he
d
gladly
connect
us
with
the
very
best
factory
in
taiwan
this
have
the
potential
to
be
big
we
could
use
someone
on
the
ground
to
pave
our
way
to
make
introduction
to
help
gorman
acclimate
an
asian
giampietro
we
haggle
over
commission
per
pair
for
a
few
minute
but
it
be
a
friendly
haggle
then
we
shook
hand
deal
deal
we
sat
down
again
and
drew
up
an
agreement
to
establish
a
taiwan
base
subcompany
what
to
call
it
i
didn
t
want
to
use
nike
if
we
ever
want
to
do
business
in
the
people
s
republic
of
china
we
couldn
t
be
associate
with
china
s
sworn
enemy
it
be
a
faint
hope
at
best
an
impossible
dream
but
still
so
i
picked
athena
the
greek
goddess
who
brings
nike
athena
corp
and
thus
i
preserve
the
unmapped
unnumbered
road
to
heaven
or
a
shoe
dog
s
idea
of
heaven
a
country
with
two
billion
foot
i
sent
gorman
home
ahead
of
me
before
leave
asia
i
told
him
i
need
to
make
one
quick
stop
in
manila
personal
errand
i
say
vaguely
i
go
to
manila
to
visit
a
shoe
factory
a
very
good
one
then
closing
an
old
loop
i
spent
the
night
in
macarthur
s
suite
you
be
remember
for
the
rule
you
break
maybe
maybe
not
it
be
the
bicentennial
year
that
strange
moment
in
america
s
cultural
history
that
day
lollapalooza
of
self
examination
and
civics
lesson
and
seminightly
firework
from
january
to
december
of
that
year
you
couldn
t
change
the
channel
without
hit
upon
a
movie
or
documentary
about
george
washington
or
ben
franklin
or
lexington
and
concord
and
invariably
embed
in
the
patriotic
program
there
would
be
yet
another
bicentennial
minute
a
public
service
announcement
in
which
dick
van
dyke
or
lucille
ball
or
gabe
kaplan
would
recount
some
episode
that
take
place
on
this
date
during
the
revolutionary
era
one
night
it
might
be
jessica
tandy
talk
about
the
fell
of
the
liberty
tree
the
next
night
it
might
be
president
gerald
ford
exhort
all
american
to
keep
the
spirit
of
alive
it
be
all
somewhat
corny
a
little
bit
sentimental
and
immensely
move
the
yearlong
swell
of
patriotism
brought
out
an
already
strong
love
of
country
in
me
tall

into

harbor
recitation
of
the
bill
of
right
and
declaration
of
independence
fervent
talk
of
liberty
and
justice
it
all
refresh
my
gratitude
about
be
an
american
and
be
free
and
not
be
in
jail
at
the
olympic
trial
held
again
that
june
in
eugene
nike
have
a
chance
a
fantastic
chance
to
make
a
good
show
we
d
never
have
that
chance
with
tiger
whose
spike
weren
t
top
caliber
we
d
never
have
that
chance
with
the
first
generation
of
nike
product
now
at
last
we
have
our
own
stuff
and
it
be
really
good
top
quality
marathon
shoe
and
spike
we
be
buzzing
with
excitement
as
we
left
portland
finally
we
say
we
re
go
to
have
a
nike
shod
runner
make
an
olympic
team
it
be
go
to
happen
it
need
to
happen
penny
and
i
drove
to
eugene
where
we
met
up
with
johnson
who
be
photograph
the
event
despite
our
excitement
about
the
trial
we
talk
most
about
pre
as
we
take
our
seat
in
the
packed
bleacher
it
be
clear
that
pre
be
on
everyone
else
s
mind
too
we
heard
his
name
come
from
every
direction
and
his
spirit
seem
to
hover
like
the
low
cloud
roil
above
the
track
and
if
you
be
tempt
to
forget
him
even
for
a
moment
you
get
another
bracing
reminder
when
you
look
at
the
runner
foot
many
be
wear
pre
montreal
many
more
be
wear
exeter
make
product
like
the
triumph
and
the
vainqueur
hayward
that
day
look
like
a
nike
showroom
it
be
well
know
that
these
trial
would
have
be
the
start
of
pre
s
epic
comeback
after
be
knock
down
in
munich
he
d
have
risen
again
no
doubt
and
the
rise
would
have
begin
right
here
right
now
each
race
prompt
the
same
thought
the
same
image
pre
bursting
ahead
of
the
pack
pre
dive
through
the
tape
we
could
see
it
we
could
see
him
flush
with
victory
if
only
we
kept
say
our
voice
choke
if
only
at
sunset
the
sky
turn
red
white
and
a
deep
blackish
blue
but
it
be
still
bright
enough
to
read
by
as
the
runner
in
the
meter
gather
at
the
start
line
penny
and
i
try
to
clear
our
mind
as
we
stood
hand
clasped
as
if
in
prayer
we
be
counting
on
shorter
of
course
he
be
extremely
talented
and
he
d
be
the
last
person
to
see
pre
alive
it
make
sense
that
he
d
be
the
one
to
carry
pre
s
torch
but
we
also
have
nike

a
brilliant
young
runner
from
the
university
of
illinois

aah
with
every
stride
there
wasn

an
inch
of
separation
in
the

when

violently
push
ahead
in
the
jostling

and
useful
if

isn
t
happy
i
say

favorite

the
first
time
ever
be
go
to
cross
an
olympic
finish
line
ahead
of
all
other
shoe
this
be
an
enormous
rite
of
passage
for
a
run
shoe
company
you
really
weren
t
a
legitimate
card
carry
run
shoe
company
until
an
olympian
ascend
to
the
top
medal
stand
in
your
gear
i
woke
up
early
that
saturday
july
right
after
my
morning
coffee
i
take
up
my
position
in
my
recliner
i
have
a
sandwich
at
my
elbow
cold
soda
in
the
fridge
i
wonder
if
kitami
be
watch
i
wonder
if
my
former
banker
be
watch
i
wonder
if
my
parent
and
sister
be
watch
i
wonder
if
the
fbi
be
watch
the
runner
approach
the
start
line
with
them
i
crouch
forward
i
probably
have
as
much
adrenaline
in
my
system
as
shorter
have
in
his
i
wait
for
the
pistol
and
for
the
inevitable
close
up
of
shorter
s
foot
the
camera
zoom
in
i
stop
breathing
i
slid
out
of
my
recliner
onto
the
floor
and
crawl
toward
the
tv
screen
no
i
say
no
i
cry
out
in
anguish
no
no
he
be
wear
tiger
i
watch
in
horror
as
the
great
hope
of
nike
take
off
in
the
shoe
of
our
enemy
i
stood
walk
back
to
my
recliner
and
watch
the
race
unfold
talk
to
myself
mumble
to
myself
slowly
the
house
grow
dark
not
dark
enough
to
suit
me
at
some
point
i
drew
the
curtain
turn
off
the
light
but
not
the
tv
i
would
watch
all
two
hour
and
ten
minute
to
the
bitter
end
i
m
still
not
sure
i
know
exactly
what
happen
apparently
shorter
become
convince
that
his
nike
shoe
be
fragile
and
wouldn
t
hold
up
for
the
whole
twenty
six
mile
never
mind
that
they
d
perform
perfectly
well
at
the
olympic
trial
maybe
it
be
nerve
maybe
it
be
superstition
he
want
to
use
what
he
d
always
use
runner
be
funny
that
way
in
any
case
at
the
last
moment
he
switch
back
to
the
shoe
that
he
wore
when
he
won
the
gold
in
and
i
switch
from
soda
to
vodka
sit
in
the
dark
clutch
a
cocktail
i
told
myself
it
be
no
big
deal
in
the
grand
scheme
of
thing
shorter
didn
t
even
win
an
east
german
surprised
him
and
take
the
gold
of
course
i
be
lie
to
myself
it
be
a
very
big
deal
and
not
because
of
the
disappointment
or
the
lose
marketing
opportunity
if
watch
shorter
go
off
in
shoe
other
than
mine
could
affect
me
so
deeply
it
be
now
official
nike
be
more
than
just
a
shoe
i
no
longer
simply
make
nike
nike
be
make
me
if
i
saw
an
athlete
choose
another
shoe
if
i
saw
anyone
choose
another
shoe
it
wasn
t
just
a
rejection
of
the
brand
alone
but
of
me
i
told
myself
to
be
reasonable
not
everyone
in
the
world
be
go
to
wear
nike
and
i
won
t
say
that
i
become
upset
every
time
i
saw
someone
walk
down
the
street
in
a
run
shoe
that
wasn
t
mine
but
it
definitely
register
and
i
didn
t
care
for
it
at
some
point
that
night
i
phone
hollister
he
be
devastate
too
there
be
raw
anger
in
his
voice
i
be
glad
i
want
people
work
for
me
who
would
feel
that
same
burn
that
same
gut
punch
rejection
happily
there
be
few
such
rejection
all
the
time
at
the
close
of
fiscal
we
double
our
sale
million
a
startle
number
which
financial
analyst
note
and
write
about
and
yet
we
be
still
cash
poor
i
kept
borrowing
every
nickel
i
could
plow
it
into
growth
with
the
explicit
or
tacit
blessing
of
people
i
trust
woodell
strasser
hayes
in
early
the
four
of
us
have
talk
tentatively
about
go
public
and
table
the
idea
now
at
the
close
of
we
take
up
the
idea
again
more
seriously
we
analyze
the
risk
weigh
the
con
consider
the
pro
again
we
decide
no
sure
sure
we
say
we
d
love
to
have
that
quick
infusion
of
capital
oh
the
thing
we
could
do
with
that
money
the
factory
we
could
lease
the
talent
we
could
hire
but
go
public
would
change
our
culture
make
us
beholden
make
us
corporate
that
s
not
our
play
we
all
agree
week
later
strap
for
money
again
our
bank
account
at
zero
we
take
another
look
at
the
idea
and
reject
it
again
want
to
settle
the
matter
once
and
for
all
i
put
the
subject
at
the
top
of
the
agenda
for
our
biannual
gathering
a
retreat
we
d
take
to
call
the
buttface
johnson
coin
the
phrase
we
think
at
one
of
our
early
retreat
he
mutter
how
many
multimillion
dollar
company
can
you
yell
out
hey
buttface
and
the
entire
management
team
turn
around
it
get
a
laugh
and
then
it
stuck
and
then
it
become
a
key
part
of
our
vernacular
buttface
refer
to
both
the
retreat
and
the
retreaters
and
it
not
only
capture
the
informal
mood
of
those
retreat
where
no
idea
be
too
sacred
to
be
mocked
and
no
person
be
too
important
to
be
ridicule
it
also
sum
up
the
company
spirit
mission
and
ethos
the
first
few
buttfaces
take
place
at
various
oregon
resort
otter
crest
salishan
ultimately
we
come
to
prefer
sunriver
an
idyllic
spot
in
sunny
central
oregon
typically
woodell
and
johnson
would
fly
out
from
the
east
coast
and
we
d
all
drive
out
to
sunriver
late
friday
we
d
reserve
a
bunch
of
cabin
seize
a
conference
room
and
spend
two
or
three
day
shout
ourselves
hoarse
i
can
see
myself
so
clearly
at
the
head
of
a
conference
table
shout
be
shout
at
laugh
until
my
voice
be
go
the
problem
confront
us
be
grave
complex
seemingly
insurmountable
make
more
so
by
the
fact
we
be
separate
from
each
other
by
three
thousand
mile
at
a
time
when
communication
wasn
t
easy
or
instant
and
yet
we
be
always
laugh
sometimes
after
a
really
cathartic
guffaw
i
d
look
around
the
table
and
feel
overcome
by
emotion
camaraderie
loyalty
gratitude
even
love
surely
love
but
i
also
remember
feel
shock
that
these
be
the
men
i
d
assemble
these
be
the
found
father
of
a
multimillion
dollar
company
that
sell
athletic
shoe
a
paralyze
guy
two
morbidly
obese
guy
a
chain
smoking
guy
it
be
bracing
to
realize
that
in
this
group
the
one
with
whom
i
have
the
most
in
common
be
johnson
and
yet
it
be
undeniable
while
everyone
else
be
laugh
rioting
he
d
be
the
sane
one
sit
quietly
in
the
middle
of
the
table
reading
a
book
the
loud
voice
at
every
buttface
always
seem
to
be
hayes
and
the
craziest
like
his
girth
his
personality
be
ever
expand
add
new
phobia
and
enthusiasm
for
instance
by
this
time
hayes
have
developed
a
curious
obsession
with
heavy
equipment
backhoe
bulldozer
cherry
picker
crane
they
fascinate
him
they
turn
him
on
there
s
no
other
way
to
say
it
at
an
early
buttface
we
be
leave
a
local
bar
when
hayes
spy
a
bulldozer
in
the
field
behind
the
lodge
he
discover
to
his
astonishment
the
key
have
be
left
inside
so
he
hopped
in
and
move
the
earth
all
around
the
field
and
in
the
parking
lot
quit
only
when
he
narrowly
miss
crush
several
car
hayes
on
a
bulldozer
i
thought
as
much
as
the
swoosh
that
might
be
our
logo
i
always
say
that
woodell
make
the
train
run
on
time
but
it
be
hayes
who
laid
down
the
track
hayes
set
up
all
the
esoteric
accounting
system
without
which
the
company
would
have
ground
to
a
halt
when
we
first
go
from
manual
to
automate
accounting
hayes
acquire
the
first
primitive
machine
and
by
constantly
mend
them
modify
them
or
pound
them
with
his
big
hammy
fist
he
kept
them
uncannily
accurate
when
we
first
start
do
business
outside
the
united
state
foreign
currency
become
a
devilishly
tricky
problem
and
hayes
set
up
an
ingenious
currency
hedge
system
which
make
the
spread
more
reliable
more
predictable
despite
our
hijinks
despite
our
eccentricity
despite
our
physical
limitation
i
conclude
in
that
we
be
a
formidable
team
year
later
a
famous
harvard
business
professor
study
nike
come
to
the
same
conclusion
normally
he
say
if
one
manager
at
a
company
can
think
tactically
and
strategically
that
company
have
a
good
future
but
boy
be
you
lucky
more
than
half
the
buttfaces
think
that
way
undoubtedly
we
look
to
any
casual
observer
like
a
sorry
motley
crew
hopelessly
mismatch
but
in
fact
we
be
more
alike
than
different
and
that
give
a
coherence
to
our
goal
and
our
effort
we
be
mostly
oregon
guy
which
be
important
we
have
an
inborn
need
to
prove
ourselves
to
show
the
world
that
we
weren
t
hick
and
hayseed
and
we
be
nearly
all
merciless
self
loather
which
kept
the
ego
in
check
there
be
none
of
that
smartest
guy
in
the
room
foolishness
hayes
strasser
woodell
johnson
each
would
have
be
the
smartest
guy
in
any
room
but
none
believe
it
of
himself
or
the
next
guy
our
meeting
be
define
by
contempt
disdain
and
heap
of
abuse
oh
what
abuse
we
call
each
other
terrible
name
we
rain
down
verbal
blow
while
float
idea
and
shoot
down
idea
and
hash
out
threat
to
the
company
the
last
thing
we
take
into
account
be
someone
s
feeling
include
mine
especially
mine
my
fellow
buttfaces
my
employee
call
me
bucky
the
bookkeeper
constantly
i
never
ask
them
to
stop
i
knew
well
if
you
show
any
weakness
any
sentimentality
you
be
dead
i
remember
a
buttface
when
strasser
decide
we
weren
t
be
aggressive
enough
in
our
approach
too
many
bean
counter
in
this
company
he
say
so
before
this
meeting
start
i
want
to
interject
something
i
ve
prepared
here
a
counter
budget
he
wave
a
big
binder
this
right
here
be
what
we
should
be
do
with
our
money
of
course
everyone
want
to
see
his
number
but
no
one
more
than
the
number
guy
hayes
when
we
discover
that
the
number
didn
t
add
up
not
one
column
we
start
howl
strasser
take
it
personally
it
s
the
essence
i
m
get
at
he
say
not
the
specific
the
essence
the
howl
grow
louder
so
strasser
picked
up
his
binder
and
threw
it
against
the
wall
fuck
all
you
guy
he
say
the
binder
burst
open
page
flew
everywhere
and
the
laughter
be
deafen
even
strasser
couldn
t
help
himself
he
have
to
join
in
little
wonder
that
strasser
s
nickname
be
roll
thunder
hayes
meanwhile
be
doomsday
woodell
be
weight
as
in
dead
weight
johnson
be
four
factor
because
he
tend
to
exaggerate
and
therefore
everything
he
say
need
to
be
divide
by
four
no
one
take
it
personally
the
only
thing
truly
not
tolerate
at
a
buttface
be
a
thin
skin
and
sobriety
at
day
s
end
when
everybody
have
a
scratchy
throat
from
all
the
abuse
and
laugh
and
problem
solve
when
our
yellow
legal
pad
be
fill
with
idea
solution
quotation
and
list
upon
list
we
d
shift
ground
to
the
bar
at
the
lodge
and
continue
the
meeting
over
drink
many
drink
the
bar
be
call
the
owl
s
nest
i
love
to
close
my
eye
and
remember
us
storm
through
the
entrance
scatter
all
other
patron
or
make
friend
of
them
we
d
buy
drink
for
the
house
then
commandeer
a
corner
and
continue
lay
into
each
other
about
some
problem
or
idea
or
harebrained
scheme
say
the
problem
be
midsoles
not
get
from
point
a
to
point
b
round
and
round
we
d
go
everyone
speak
at
once
a
chorale
of
name
call
and
finger
point
all
make
louder
and
funnier
and
somehow
clearer
by
the
booze
to
anyone
in
the
owl
s
nest
to
anyone
in
the
corporate
world
it
would
have
look
inefficient
inappropriate
even
scandalous
but
before
the
bartender
give
last
call
we
d
know
full
well
why
those
midsoles
weren
t
get
from
point
a
to
point
b
and
the
person
responsible
would
be
contrite
and
put
on
notice
and
we
d
have
ourselves
a
creative
solution
the
only
person
who
didn
t
join
us
in
these
late
night
revel
be
johnson
he
d
typically
go
for
a
head
clearing
run
then
retreat
to
his
room
and
read
in
bed
i
don
t
think
he
ever
set
foot
in
the
owl
s
nest
or
knew
where
it
be
we
d
always
have
to
spend
the
first
part
of
the
next
morning
update
him
on
what
we
d
decide
in
his
absence
in
the
bicentennial
year
alone
we
be
struggle
with
a
number
of
unusually
stressful
problem
we
need
to
find
a
large
warehouse
on
the
east
coast
we
need
to
transfer
our
sale
distribution
center
from
holliston
massachusetts
to
a
new
forty
thousand
square
foot
space
in
greenland
new
hampshire
which
be
sure
to
be
a
logistical
nightmare
we
need
to
hire
an
advertising
agency
to
handle
the
increase
volume
of
print
ad
we
need
to
either
fix
or
get
shut
of
our
underperform
factory
we
need
to
smooth
out
glitch
in
our
future
program
we
need
to
hire
a
director
of
promotion
we
need
to
form
a
pro
club
a
sort
of
reward
system
for
our
top
nba
star
to
cement
their
loyalty
and
keep
them
in
the
nike
fold
we
need
to
approve
new
product
like
the
arsenal
a
soccer
baseball
cleat
with
leather
upper
and
vinyl
poly
foam
tongue
and
the
striker
a
multipurpose
cleat
good
for
soccer
baseball
football
softball
and
field
hockey
and
we
need
to
decide
on
a
new
logo
aside
from
the
swoosh
we
have
a
lowercase
script
name
nike
which
be
problematic
too
many
people
thought
it
be
like
or
mike
but
it
be
too
late
in
the
day
to
change
the
name
of
the
company
so
make
the
letter
more
readable
seem
a
good
idea
denny
strickland
creative
director
at
our
advertising
agency
have
design
a
block
letter
nike
all
cap
and
nest
it
inside
a
swoosh
we
spent
day
consider
it
debate
it
above
all
we
need
to
decide
once
and
for
all
this
go
public
question
in
those
early
buttfaces
a
consensus
begin
to
form
if
we
couldn
t
sustain
growth
we
couldn
t
survive
and
despite
our
fear
despite
the
risk
and
downside
go
public
be
the
best
way
to
sustain
growth
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
those
intense
discussion
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
most
try
year
in
the
company
s
history
those
buttface
meeting
be
nothing
but
a
joy
of
all
those
hour
spent
at
sunriver
not
one
minute
felt
like
work
it
be
us
against
the
world
and
we
felt
damn
sorry
for
the
world
that
be
when
we
weren
t
righteously
piss
off
at
it
each
of
us
have
be
misunderstood
misjudge
dismiss
shun
by
boss
spurn
by
luck
reject
by
society
shortchanged
by
fate
when
look
and
other
natural
grace
be
hand
out
we
d
each
be
forge
by
early
failure
we
d
each
give
ourselves
to
some
quest
some
attempt
at
validation
or
meaning
and
fall
short
hayes
couldn
t
become
a
partner
because
he
be
too
fat
johnson
couldn
t
cope
in
the
so
call
normal
world
of
nine
to
five
strasser
be
an
insurance
lawyer
who
hat
insurance
and
lawyer
woodell
lose
all
his
youthful
dream
in
one
fluke
accident
i
get
cut
from
the
baseball
team
and
i
get
my
heart
broken
i
identify
with
the
born
loser
in
each
buttface
and
vice
versa
and
i
knew
that
together
we
could
become
winner
i
still
didn
t
know
exactly
what
win
meant
other
than
not
lose
but
we
seem
to
be
get
closer
to
a
define
moment
when
that
question
would
be
settle
or
at
least
more
sharply
define
maybe
go
public
would
be
that
moment
maybe
go
public
would
finally
ensure
that
nike
would
live
on
if
i
have
any
doubt
about
blue
ribbon
s
management
team
in
they
be
mainly
about
me
be
i
do
right
by
the
buttfaces
give
them
so
little
guidance
when
they
do
well
i
d
shrug
and
deliver
my
high
praise
not
bad
when
they
err
i
d
yell
for
a
minute
or
two
then
shake
it
off
none
of
the
buttfaces
felt
the
least
threaten
by
me
be
that
a
good
thing
don
t
tell
people
how
to
do
thing
tell
them
what
to
do
and
let
them
surprise
you
with
their
result
it
be
the
right
tack
for
patton
and
his
gi
but
do
that
make
it
right
for
a
bunch
of
buttfaces
i
worried
maybe
i
should
be
more
hand
on
maybe
we
should
be
more
structure
but
then
i
d
think
whatever
i
m
do
it
must
be
work
because
mutiny
be
few
in
fact
ever
since
bork
no
one
have
thrown
a
genuine
tantrum
about
anything
not
even
what
they
be
paid
which
be
unheard
of
in
any
company
big
or
small
the
buttfaces
knew
i
wasn
t
pay
myself
much
and
they
trust
that
i
be
pay
them
what
i
could
clearly
the
buttfaces
like
the
culture
i
d
create
i
trust
them
wholly
and
didn
t
look
over
their
shoulder
and
that
breed
a
powerful
two
way
loyalty
my
management
style
wouldn
t
have
work
for
people
who
want
to
be
guide
every
step
but
this
group
found
it
liberate
empower
i
let
them
be
let
them
do
let
them
make
their
own
mistake
because
that
s
how
i
d
always
like
people
to
treat
me
at
the
end
of
a
buttface
weekend
consume
with
these
and
other
thought
i
d
drive
back
to
portland
in
a
trance
halfway
there
i
d
come
out
of
the
trance
and
start
think
about
penny
and
the
boy
the
buttfaces
be
like
family
but
every
minute
i
spent
with
them
be
at
the
cost
of
my
other
family
my
real
family
the
guilt
be
palpable
often
i
d
walk
into
my
house
and
matthew
and
travis
would
meet
me
at
the
door
where
have
you
be
they
d
ask
daddy
be
with
his
friend
i
d
say
pick
them
up
they
d
stare
confuse
but
mommy
told
us
you
be
work
it
be
around
this
time
as
nike
roll
out
its
first
child
s
shoe
wally
waffle
and
robbie
road
racer
that
matthew
announce
he
would
never
wear
nike
so
long
as
he
live
his
way
of
express
anger
about
my
absence
as
well
as
other
frustration
penny
try
to
make
him
understand
that
daddy
wasn
t
absent
by
choice
daddy
be
try
to
build
something
daddy
be
try
to
ensure
that
he
and
travis
would
one
day
be
able
to
attend
college
i
didn
t
even
bother
to
explain
i
told
myself
it
didn
t
matter
what
i
say
matthew
never
understood
and
travis
always
understood
they
seem
born
with
these
unvarying
default
position
matthew
seem
to
harbor
some
innate
resentment
toward
me
while
travis
seem
congenitally
devote
what
difference
would
a
few
more
word
make
what
difference
would
a
few
more
hour
make
my
fatherhood
style
my
management
style
i
be
forever
question
be
it
good
or
merely
good
enough
time
and
again
i
d
vow
to
change
time
and
again
i
d
tell
myself
i
will
spend
more
time
with

again
i
d
keep
that
promise
for
a
while
then
i
d
fall
back
to
my
former
routine
the
only
way
i
knew
not
hand
off
but
not
hand
on
this
might
have
be
the
one
problem
i
couldn
t
solve
by
brainstorming
with
my
fellow
buttfaces
vastly
trickier
than
how
to
get
midsoles
from
point
a
to

his
name
be
m
frank
rudy
he
be
a
former
aerospace
engineer
and
he
be
a
true
original
one
look
at
him
told
you
he
be
a
nutty
professor
though
it
wasn
t
until
year
later
that
i
learn
the
full
extent
of
his
nuttiness
he
kept
a
meticulous
diary
of
his
sex
life
and
bowel
movement
he
have
a
business
partner
bob
bogert
another
brainiac
and
they
have
a
crazy
idea
and
together
they
be
go
to
pitch
us
that
s
the
sum
total
of
what
i
knew
that
morning
in
march
as
we
settle
around
the
conference
table
i
wasn
t
even
sure
how
these
guy
reach
us
or
how
they
d
arrange
this
meeting
okay
fella
i
say
what
ve
you
get
it
be
a
beautiful
day
i
remember
the
light
outside
the
room
be
a
buttery
pale
yellow
and
the
sky
be
blue
for
the
first
time
in
month
so
i
be
distract
a
little
spring
feverish
as
rudy
lean
his
weight
on
the
edge
of
the
conference
table
and
smile
mr
knight
we
ve
come
up
with
a
way
to
inject
air
into
a
run
shoe
i
frown
and
drop
my
pencil
why
i
say
for
great
cushion
he
say
for
great
support
for
the
ride
of
a
lifetime
i
star
you
re
kid
me
right
i
d
heard
a
lot
of
silliness
from
a
lot
of
different
people
in
the
shoe
business
but
this
oh
brother
rudy
hand
me
a
pair
of
sol
that
look
as
if
they
d
be
teleport
from
the
twenty
second
century
big
clunky
they
be
clear
thick
plastic
and
inside
be
bubble
i
turn
them
over
bubble
i
say
pressurize
air
bag
he
say
i
set
down
the
sol
and
give
rudy
a
closer
look
a
full
head
to
toe
six
three
lanky
with
unruly
dark
hair
bottle
bottom
glass
a
lopsided
grin
and
a
severe
vitamin
d
deficiency
i
thought
not
enough
sunshine
or
else
a
long
lose
member
of
the
addams
family
he
saw
me
appraise
him
saw
my
skepticism
and
wasn
t
the
least
faze
he
walk
to
the
blackboard
picked
up
a
piece
of
chalk
and
begin
write
number
symbol
equation
he
explain
at
some
length
why
an
air
shoe
would
work
why
it
would
never
go
flat
why
it
be
the
next
big
thing
when
he
finish
i
star
at
the
blackboard
as
a
train
accountant
i
d
spent
a
good
part
of
my
life
look
at
blackboard
but
this
rudy
fella
s
scribble
be
something
else
indecipherable
human
have
be
wear
shoe
since
the
ice
age
i
say
and
the
underlie
design
hasn
t
change
all
that
much
in
forty
thousand
year
there
hadn
t
really
be
a
breakthrough
since
the
late
s
when
cobbler
start
last
left
and
right
shoe
differently
and
rubber
company
start
make
sol
it
didn
t
seem
all
too
likely
that
at
this
late
date
in
history
something
so
new
so
revolutionary
be
go
to
be
dream
up
air
shoe
sound
to
me
like
jet
pack
and
move
sidewalk
comic
book
stuff
rudy
still
wasn
t
discourage
he
kept
at
it
unflappable
earnest
finally
he
shrug
and
say
that
he
understood
he
d
try
to
pitch
adidas
and
they
d
be
skeptical
too
abracadabra
that
be
all
i
need
to
hear
i
ask
if
i
could
fit
his
air
sol
into
my
run
shoe
and
give
them
a
try
they
don
t
have
a
moderator
he
say
they
d
be
loose
and
wobbly
i
don
t
care
about
that
i
say
i
squeeze
the
sol
into
my
shoe
slip
the
shoe
back
on
lace
them
up
not
bad
i
say
bounce
up
and
down
i
go
for
a
six
mile
run
they
be
indeed
unstable
but
they
be
also
one
heck
of
a
ride
i
ran
back
to
the
office
still
cover
with
sweat
i
ran
straight
up
to
strasser
and
told
him
i
think
we
might
have
something
here
that
night
strasser
and
i
go
to
dinner
with
rudy
and
bogert
rudy
explain
more
of
the
science
behind
the
air
sol
and
this
second
time
around
it
start
to
make
sense
i
told
him
there
be
a
possibility
we
could
do
business
then
i
turn
it
over
to
strasser
to
close
i
d
hire
strasser
for
his
legal
mind
but
by
i
d
discover
his
true
talent
negotiate
the
first
few
time
i
ask
him
to
work
out
a
contract
with
sport
agent
the
toughest
negotiator
in
the
world
he
more
than
held
his
own
i
be
amaze
so
be
the
agent
every
time
strasser
walk
away
with
more
than
we
d
ever
hop
no
one
scar
him
no
one
match
him
in
a
clash
of
will
by
i
be
send
him
into
every
negotiation
with
total
confidence
as
if
i
be
send
in
the
eighty
second
airborne
his
secret
i
think
be
that
he
just
didn
t
care
what
he
say
or
how
he
say
it
or
how
it
go
over
he
be
totally
honest
a
radical
tactic
in
any
negotiation
i
recall
one
tug
of
war
strasser
have
over
elvin
hayes
the
washington
bullet
all
star
whom
we
badly
want
to
sign
again
elvin
s
agent
told
strasser
you
should
give
elvin
your
whole
damn
company
strasser
yawn
you
want
it
help
yourself
we
ve
get
ten
grand
in
the
bank
final
offer
take
it
or
leave
it
the
agent
take
it
now
see
great
potential
in
these
air
sol
strasser
offer
rudy
ten
cent
for
every
pair
of
sol
that
we
sell
and
rudy
demand
twenty
and
after
week
of
haggle
they
settle
somewhere
in
the
middle
we
then
ship
rudy
and
his
partner
back
to
exeter
which
be
become
our
de
facto
research
and
development
department
of
course
when
johnson
met
rudy
he
do
exactly
what
i
d
do
he
slip
some
air
sol
into
his
run
shoe
and
trot
six
brisk
mile
after
which
he
phone
me
this
could
be
huge
he
say
that
s
what
i
thought
i
say
but
johnson
worried
that
the
bubble
would
cause
friction
his
foot
felt
hot
he
say
he
have
the
start
of
a
blister
he
suggest
put
air
in
the
midsole
as
well
to
level
out
the
ride
don
t
tell
me
i
say
tell
your
new
roommate
mr
rudy
fresh
off
his
successful
closing
with
rudy
we
give
strasser
another
critical
assignment

solid
stable
of
nba
player

rise
briskly
but
we
have
virtually
no
college
team
not
even
the
university
of
oregon
unthinkable
the
coach
dick
harter
told
us
in
that

to
his

so
the
team
stayed
with
converse
the
next
year
the
team
vote
for
nike
but
harter
say
it
be
still
too
close
so
he
be
stay
with
converse
what
the
i
told
hollister
to
lobby
the
player
steadily
over
the
next
twelve
month
which
he
do
and
the
vote
be
for
nike
the
next
day
i
met
harter
in
jaqua

check
at
last
my
duck
would
wear
nike
on
the
hardboard
at
almost
this
same
odd
moment
in
time
a
second
strange
shoe
inventor
show
up
on
our
doorstep
his
name
be
sonny
vaccaro
and
he
be
just
as
unique
as
frank
rudy
short
round
with
constantly
dart
eye
he
spoke
in
a
soupy
voice
with
an
americanize
italian
accent
or
an
italianized
american
accent
i
couldn
t
place
it
he
be
a
shoe
dog
for
sure
but
a
shoe
dog
straight
out
of
the
godfather
when
he
first
arrive
at
nike
he
carry
with
him
several
shoe
of
his
own
invention
which
set
off
gale
of
laughter
around
the
conference
room
the
guy
be
no
rudy
and
yet
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
claimed
to
be
chummy
with
every
college
basketball
coach
in
the
country
somehow
year
before
he
d
found
a
popular
high
school
all
star
game
the
dapper
dan
classic
and
it
be
a
big
hit
and
through
it
he
d
gotten
to
know
all
the
coach
royalty
okay
i
told
him
you
re
hire
you
and
strasser
hit
the
road
go
out
and
see
if
you
can
crack
that
college
basketball
market
all
the
great
basketball
school
ucla
indiana
north
carolina
and
so
on
have
long
stand
deal
with
adidas
or
converse
so
who
be
left
and
what
could
we
offer
we
hurriedly
dream
up
an
advisory
board
another
version
of
our
pro
club
our
nba
reward
system
but
it
be
small
beer
i
fully
expect
strasser
and
vaccaro
to
fail
and
i
expect
to
see
neither
of
them
for
a
year
at
least
one
month
later
strasser
be
stand
in
my
office
beam
and
shout
and
tick

jerry
tarkanian
unlv
frank
mcguire

mcguire
be
a

he
d
defeat
wilt
chamberlain
s
kansa
team
to
win
the
national
championship
for
north
carolina
we
hit
pay
dirt
strasser
say
plus
almost
as
a
throw
in
he
mention
two
under
the
radar
youngster
jim
valvano
at
iona
and
john
thompson
at
georgetown
a
year
or
two
later
he
do
the
same
thing
with
college
football
coach
land
all
the
great
include
vince
dooley
and
his
national
champion
georgia
bulldog
herschel
walker
in
nike
yes
we
rush
out
a
press
release
announce
that
nike
have
these
school
under
contract
ala
the
press
release
have
a
bad
typo
iona
be
spell
iowa
lute
olson
coach
at
iowa
phone
immediately
he
be
irate
we
apologize
and
say
we
d
send
a
correction
the
next
day
he
get
quiet
well
now
wait
wait
he
say
what
s
this
advisory
board
anyway
the
harter
rule
in
full
effect
other
endorsement
be
a
great
struggle
our
tennis
effort
have
start
so
promisingly
with
nastase
but
then
we
d
hit
that
speed
bump
with
connors
and
now
nastase
be
dump
us
adidas
have
offer
him
one
hundred
thousand
dollar
a
year
include
shoe
clothes
and
racket
we
have
the
right
to
match
but
it
be
out
of
the
question
fiscally
irresponsible
i
say
to
nasty
s
agent
and
everyone
else
who
would
listen
no
one
will
ever
see
a
sport
endorsement
deal
that
big
ever
again
so
there
we
be
in
without
a
horse
in
tennis
we
quickly
hire
a
local
pro
to
be
a
consultant
and
that
summer
he
and
i
go
to
wimbledon
on
our
first
day
in
london
we
met
with
a
group
of
american
tennis
official
we
ve
get
some
great
young
player
they
say
elliot
telscher
may
be
the
best
gottfried
be
also
outstanding
whatever
you
do
just
stay
away
from
the
kid
play
out
on
court
why
he
s
a
hothead
i
go
straight
to
court
and
fell
madly
hopelessly
in
love
with
a
frizzy
haired
high
schooler
from
new
york
city
name
john
mcenroe
at
the
same
time
we
be
signing
deal
with
athlete
and
coach
and
nutty
professor
we
be
come
out
with
the
ld
a
run
shoe
that
feature
a
dramatically
flare
heel
the
heel
flare
so
much
in
fact
that
from
certain
angle
it
look
like
a
water
ski
the
theory
be
that
a
flare
heel
would
lessen
torque
on
the
leg
and
reduce
pressure
on
the
knee

the

if

the

it
never

contrary
we
heard
nothing

very
down

i
try
to
console
him
by
remind
him
that
there
be
no

so
he
should

then
i
make
the
mistake
of

the
air

we
have
in
development
i
told
bowerman
about

sit
around

out

some
not
which
lead
to
broader
discussion
of
what

why
we
didn
t
have

jumping
and
leap
in
what
be
commonly
call
the
farrah

all
of
which
meant
more
demand
and
more
problem
meeting
demand
our
manufacturing
base
be
broader
besides
japan
we
now
have
several
factory
in
taiwan
and
two
small
factory
in
korea
plus
puerto
rico
and
exeter
but
still
we
couldn
t
keep
up
also
the
more
factory
we
brought
online
the
more
strain
it
put
on
our
cash
occasionally
our
problem
have
nothing
to
do
with
cash
in
korea
for
instance
the
five
big
factory
be
so
massive
and
the
competition
among
them
so
cutthroat
we
knew
we
be
go
to
get
knock
off
soon
sure
enough
one
day
i
receive
in
the
mail
a
perfect
replica
of
our
nike
bruin
include
the
trademark
swoosh
imitation
be
flattery
but
knockoff
be
theft
and
this
theft
be
diabolical
the
detail
and
workmanship
without
any
input
from
our
people
be
startlingly
good
i
write
the
president
of
the
factory
and
demand
he
cease
and
desist
or
i
d
have
him
thrown
in
jail
for
a
hundred
year
and
by
the
way
i
add
how
would
you
like
to
work
with
us
i
sign
a
contract
with
his
factory
in
the
summer
of
which
end
our
knockoff
problem
for
the
moment
more
important
it
give
us
the
capacity
to
shift
production
in
a
huge
way
if
need
be
it
also
end
once
and
for
all
our
dependence
on
japan
the
problem
be
never
go
to
stop
i
realize
but
for
the
moment
we
have
more
momentum
than
problem
to
build
on
this
momentum
we
roll
out
a
new
ad
campaign
with
a
sexy
new
slogan
there
be
no
finish
line
it
be
the
idea
of
our
new
ad
agency
and
its
ceo
john
brown
he
d
just
open
his
own
shop
in
seattle
and
he
be
young
bright
and
of
course
the
opposite
of
an
athlete
that
be
all
we
seem
to
hire
in
those
day
besides
johnson
and
myself
nike
be
a
haven
for
the
sedentary
still
nonjock
or
not
brown
manage
to
dream
up
a
campaign
and
a
tagline
that
perfectly
capture
nike
s
philosophy
his
ad
show
a
single
runner
on
a
lonely
country
road
surround
by
tall
douglas
fir
oregon
clearly
the
copy
read
beating
the
competition
be
relatively
easy
beating
yourself
be
a
never
end
commitment
everyone
around
me
thought
the
ad
be
bold
fresh
it
didn
t
focus
on
the
product
but
on
the
spirit
behind
the
product
which
be
something
you
never
saw
in
the
s
people
congratulate
me
on
that
ad
as
if
we
d
achieve
something
earth
shatter
i
d
shrug
i
wasn
t
be
modest
i
still
didn
t
believe
in
the
power
of
advertising
at
all
a
product
i
thought
speaks
for
itself
or
it
doesn
t
in
the
end
it
s
only
quality
that
count
i
couldn
t
imagine
that
any
ad
campaign
would
ever
prove
me
wrong
or
change
my
mind
our
advertising
people
of
course
told
me
i
be
wrong
wrong
a
thousand
percent
wrong
but
again
and
again
i
d
ask
them
can
you
say
definitively
that
people
be
buying
nike
because
of
your
ad
can
you
show
it
to
me
in
black
and
white
number
silence
no
they
d
say
we
can
t
say
that
definitively
so
then
it
s
a
little
hard
to
get
enthuse
i
d
say
isn
t
it
silence
i
often
wish
i
have
more
time
to
kick
back
and
debate
the
nicety
of
advertising
our
semidaily
crisis
be
always
big
and
more
press
than
what
slogan
to
print
under
a
picture
of
our
shoe
in
the
second
half
of
the
crisis
be
our
debenture
holder
they
be
suddenly
clamor
for
a
way
to
cash
in
by
far
the
best
way
for
them
to
do
so
would
be
a
public
offering
which
we
try
to
explain
to
them
be
not
an
option
they
didn
t
want
to
hear
that
i
turn
once
more
to
chuck
robinson
he
d
serve
with
distinction
as
lieutenant
commander
on
a
battleship
in
world
war
ii
he
d
built
saudi
arabia
s
first
steel
mill
he
d
help
negotiate
the
grain
deal
with
the
soviet
chuck
knew
business
cold
well
than
anyone
i
d
ever
met
and
i
d
be
want
his
advice
for
quite
some
time
but
over
the
last
few
year
he
d
be
the
number
two
man
under
henry
kissinger
at
the
state
department
and
thereby
off
limit
to
me
accord
to
jaqua
now
with
jimmy
carter
newly
elect
chuck
be
on
wall
street
and
available
once
again
for
consultation
i
invite
him
out
to
oregon
i
ll
never
forget
his
first
day
in
our
office
i
caught
him
up
on
the
development
of
the
last
few
year
and
thanked
him
for
his
invaluable
counsel
about
japanese
trading
company
then
i
show
him
our
financial
statement
he
flip
through
them
start
to
laugh
he
couldn
t
stop
laugh
compositionally
he
say
you
be
a
japanese
trading
company
percent
debt
i
know
you
can
t
live
like
this
he
say
well
i
guess
that
s
why
you
re
here
as
the
first
order
of
business
i
invite
him
to
be
on
our
board
of
director
to
my
surprise
he
agree
then
i
ask
his
opinion
about
go
public
he
say
go
public
wasn
t
an
option
it
be
mandatory
i
need
to
solve
this
cash
flow
problem
he
say
attack
it
wrestle
it
to
the
ground
or
else
i
could
lose
the
company
hearing
his
assessment
be
frighten
but
necessary
for
the
first
time
ever
i
saw
go
public
as
inevitable
and
i
couldn
t
help
it
the
realization
make
me
sad
of
course
we
stood
to
make
a
great
deal
of
money
but
get
rich
have
never
factor
in
my
decision
and
it
matter
even
less
to
the
buttfaces
so
when
i
brought
it
up
at
the
next
meeting
and
told
them
what
chuck
have
say
i
didn
t
ask
for
another
debate
i
just
put
it
to
a
vote
hayes
be
for
johnson
be
against
strasser
too
it
ll
spoil
the
culture
he
kept
say
over
and
over
woodell
be
on
the
fence
if
there
be
one
thing
we
all
agree
on
however
it
be
the
lack
of
barrier
nothing
stood
in
the
way
of
go
public
sale
be
extraordinary
word
of
mouth
be
positive
legal
dispute
be
behind
us
we
have
debt
but
for
the
moment
it
be
manageable
at
the
start
of
the
christmas
season
as
the
brightly
color
light
appear
on
the
house
in
my
neighborhood
i
recall
think
during
one
of
my
nightly
run
everything
be
about
to
change
it
s
just
a
matter
of
time
and
then
come
the
letter
an
unimposing
little
thing
standard
white
envelope
emboss
return
address
u
s
custom
service
washington
dc
i
open
it
and
my
hand
start
to
shake
it
be
a
bill
for
million
i
read
it
and
reread
it
i
couldn
t
make
head
or
tail
as
best
i
could
determine
the
federal
government
be
say
that
nike
owe
custom
duty
date
back
three
year
by
virtue
of
something
call
the
american
sell
price
an
old
duty
assess
method
american
sell
what
i
call
strasser
into
my
office
and
thrust
the
letter
at
him
he
read
it
laugh
this
can
t
be
real
he
say
tug
his
beard
my
reaction
exactly
i
say
we
pass
it
back
and
forth
and
agree
it
have
to
be
a
mistake
because
if
it
be
real
if
we
actually
do
owe
million
to
the
government
we
be
out
of
business
just
like
that
all
this
talk
of
go
public
have
be
a
colossal
waste
of
time
everything
since
have
be
a
waste
of
time
there
be
no
finish
line
this
right
here
this
be
the
finish
line
strasser
make
a
few
phone
call
and
come
back
to
me
the
next
day
this
time
he
wasn
t
laugh
it
might
be
real
he
say
and
its
origin
be
sinister
our
american
competitor
converse
and
keds
plus
a
few
small
factory
in
other
word
what
be
left
of
the
american
shoe
industry
be
all
behind
it
they
d
lobby
washington
in
an
effort
to
slow
our
momentum
and
their
lobbying
have
paid
off
well
than
they
d
ever
dare
hope
they
d
manage
to
convince
custom
official
to
effectively
hobble
us
by
enforce
this
american
sell
price
an
archaic
law
that
date
back
to
the
protectionist
day
which
precede
some
say
prompt
the
great
depression
essentially
the
american
sell
price
law
or
asp
say
that
import
duty
on
nylon
shoe
must
be
percent
of
the
manufacturing
cost
of
the
shoe
unless
there
s
a
similar
shoe
manufacture
by
a
competitor
in
the
united
state
in
which
case
the
duty
must
be
percent
of
the
competitor
s
sell
price
so
all
our
competitor
need
to
do
be
make
a
few
shoe
in
the
united
state
get
them
declare
similar
then
price
them
sky
high
and
boom
they
could
send
our
import
duty
sky
high
too
and
that
s
just
what
they
do
one
dirty
little
trick
and
they
d
manage
to
spike
our
import
duty
by
percent
retroactively
custom
be
say
we
owe
them
import
duty
date
back
year
to
the
tune
of
million
dirty
trick
or
not
strasser
told
me
custom
wasn
t
joking
around
we
owe
them
million
and
they
want
it
now
i
put
my
head
on
my
desk
a
few
year
earlier
when
my
fight
have
be
with
onitsuka
i
told
myself
the
problem
be
root
in
cultural
difference
some
part
of
me
shape
by
world
war
ii
wasn
t
all
that
surprised
to
be
at
odds
with
a
former
foe
now
i
be
in
the
position
of
the
japanese
at
war
with
the
united
state
of
america
with
my
own
government
this
be
one
conflict
i
never
imagine
and
desperately
didn
t
want
and
yet
i
couldn
t
duck
it
lose
meant
annihilation
what
the
government
be
demand
million
be
very
nearly
our
sale
number
for
all
of
and
even
if
we
could
somehow
give
them
a
year
s
worth
of
revenue
we
couldn
t
continue
to
pay
import
duty
that
be
percent
high
so
there
be
only
one
thing
to
do
i
told
strasser
with
a
sigh
we
ll
have
to
fight
this
with
everything
we
ve
get
i
don
t
know
why
this
crisis
hit
me
harder
mentally
than
all
the
others
i
try
to
tell
myself
over
and
over
we
ve
be
through
bad
time
we
ll
get
through
this
but
this
one
just
felt
different
i
try
to
talk
to
penny
about
it
but
she
say
i
didn
t
actually
talk
i
grunt
and
star
off
here
come
the
wall
she
d
say
exasperate
and
a
little
frighten
i
should
have
told
her
that
s
what
men
do
when
they
fight
they
put
up
wall
they
pull
up
the
drawbridge
they
fill
in
the
moat
but
from
behind
my
rise
wall
i
didn
t
know
how
i
lose
the
ability
in
to
speak
it
be
either
silence
or
rage
with
me
late
at
night
after
talk
on
the
phone
with
strasser
or
hayes
or
woodell
or
my
father
i
couldn
t
see
any
way
out
i
could
only
see
myself
fold
up
this
business
i
d
work
so
hard
to
build
so
i
d
erupt
at
the
telephone
instead
of
hang
up
i
d
slam
the
receiver
down
then
slam
it
down
again
harder
and
harder
until
it
shatter
several
time
i
beat
the
living
tar
out
of
that
telephone
after
i
d
do
this
three
time
maybe
four
i
notice
the
repairman
from
the
telephone
company
eye
me
he
replace
the
phone
checked
to
make
sure
there
be
a
dial
tone
and
as
he
be
pack
up
his
tool
he
say
very
softly
this
be
really
immature
i
nod
you
re
suppose
to
be
a
grown
up
he
say
i
nod
again
if
a
phone
repairman
feel
the
need
to
chastise
you
i
told
myself
your
behavior
probably
need
modify
i
make
promise
to
myself
that
day
i
vowed
that
from
then
on
i
d
meditate
count
backward
run
twelve
mile
a
night
whatever
it
take
to
hold
it
together
hold
it
together
wasn
t
the
same
thing
as
be
a
good
father
i
d
always
promise
myself
that
i
d
be
a
well
father
to
my
son
than
my
father
have
be
to
me
meaning
i
d
give
them
more
explicit
approval
more
attention
but
in
late
when
i
evaluate
myself
honestly
when
i
look
at
how
much
time
i
be
spending
away
from
the
boy
and
how
distant
i
be
even
when
i
be
home
i
give
myself
low
mark
go
strictly
by
the
number
i
could
only
say
that
i
be
percent

father
have
be
with
me

the
minute
their

i
would
sneak
out
of
the
room
and
settle
into
my
recliner
and
reach
for
the
phone
hey

salvation
but
now
more
than

crave
thing
i
could

from
my
old

affirmation
comfort
on

i
get
them
all
in
a
burst
sport
of
course
be
the
cause
the
houston

a
jumper
and
his
teammate
kevin
kunnert
a
seven
foot
beanpole
out
of
iowa
fought
for
the
rebound
with

kermit
washington
in
the
tussle
washington
pull
down
kunnert
s
short
and
kunnert
retaliate
with
an
elbow
washington
then
sock
kunnert
in
the
head
a
fight
broke
out
as
houston

rudy
tomjanovich
ran
over
to
defend
his
teammate
washington
turn
and
threw
a
devastate
haymaker
break
tomjanovich
s
nose
and
jaw
and
separate
his
skull
and
facial
bone
from
his
skin
tomjanovich
fell
to
the
floor
as
if
hit
with
a
shotgun
blast
his
massive
body
struck
the
ground
with
a
sicken
smack
the
sound
echoed
throughout
the
upper
reach
of
the
l
a
forum
and
for
several
second
tomjanovich
lay
there
motionless
in
an
ever
widen
puddle
of
his
own
blood
i
hadn
t
heard
anything
about
it
until
i
talk
to
my
father
that
night
he
be
breathless
i
be
surprised
that
he
d
watch
the
game
but
everyone
in
portland
be
basketball
crazy
that
year
because
our
trail
blazer
be
the
defend
nba
champ
still
it
wasn
t
the
game
per
se
that
have
him
breathless
after
tell
me
about
the
fight
he
cry
oh
buck
buck
it
be
one
of
the
most
incredible
thing
i
have
ever
see
then
there
be
a
long
pause
and
he
add
the
camera
kept
zoom
in
and
you
could
see
quite
clearly
on
tomjanovich
s
shoe
the
swoosh
they
kept
zoom
in
on
the
swoosh
i
d
never
heard
such
pride
in
my
father
s
voice
sure
tomjanovich
be
in
a
hospital
fight
for
his
life
and
sure
his
facial
bone
be
float
around
his
head
but
buck
knight
s
logo
be
in
the
national
spotlight
that
might
have
be
the
night
the
swoosh
become
real
to
my
father
respectable
he
didn
t
actually
use
the
word
proud
but
i
hung
up
the
phone
feel
as
if
he
have
it
almost
make
this
all
worthwhile
i
told
myself
almost
sale
have
be
climb
geometrically
year
after
year
ever
since
the
first
few
hundred
pair
i
sell
out
of
my
valiant
but
as
we
close
out
sale
be
go
berserk
nearly
million
so
penny
and
i
decide
to
buy
a
big
house
it
be
a
strange
thing
to
do
in
the
midst
of
an
apocalyptic
fight
with
the
government
but
i
like
the
idea
of
act
as
if
thing
be
go
to
work
out
fortune
favor
the
brave
that
sort
of
thing
i
also
like
the
idea
of
a
change
of
scenery
maybe
i
thought
it
will
initiate
a
change
of
luck
we
be
sad
to
leave
the
old
house
of
course
both
boy
have
take
their
first
step
there
and
matthew
have
live
for
that
swim
pool
he
be
never
so
at
peace
as
when
frolic
in
the
water
i
recall
penny
shake
her
head
and
say
one
thing
s
for
certain
that
boy
will
never
drown
but
both
boy
be
get
so
big
they
desperately
need
more
room
and
the
new
place
have
plenty
it
sat
on
five
acre
high
above
hillsboro
and
every
room
felt
spacious
and
airy
from
the
first
night
we
knew
we
d
found
our
home
there
be
even
a
built
in
niche
for
my
recliner
to
honor
our
new
address
our
new
start
i
try
to
keep
a
new
schedule
unless
i
be
out
of
town
i
try
to
attend
all
the
youth
basketball
game
and
youth
soccer
game
and
little
league
game
i
spent
whole
weekend
teach
matthew
to
swing
a
bat
though
both
of
us
wonder
why
he
refuse
to
keep
his
back
foot
still
he
refuse
to
listen
he
argue
with
me
constantly
the
ball
s
move
he
say
why
shouldn
t
i
because
it
s
harder
to
hit
that
way
that
be
never
a
good
enough
reason
for
him
matthew
be
more
than
a
rebel
he
be
i
discover
more
than
a
contrarian
he
positively
couldn
t
abide
authority
and
he
perceive
authority
lurk
in
every
shadow
any
opposition
to
his
will
be
oppression
and
thus
a
call
to
arm
in
soccer
for
instance
he
played
like
an
anarchist
he
didn
t
compete
against
the
opponent
so
much
as
against
the
rule
the
structure
if
the
other
team
s
best
player
be
come
toward
him
on
a
breakaway
matthew
would
forget
the
game
forget
the
ball
and
just
go
for
the
kid
s
shin
down
go
the
kid
out
come
the
parent
and
pandemonium
would
ensue
during
one
matthew
spark
melee
i
look
at
him
and
realize
he
didn
t
want
to
be
there
any
more
than
i
do
he
didn
t
like
soccer
for
that
matter
he
didn
t
care
for
sport
he
be
play
and
i
be
watch
him
play
out
of
some
sense
of
obligation
over
time
his
behavior
have
a
suppressive
effect
on
his
young
brother
though
travis
be
a
gift
athlete
and
love
sport
matthew
have
turn
him
off
one
day
little
travis
simply
retire
he
would
no
longer
go
out
for
any
team
i
ask
him
to
reconsider
but
the
only
thing
he
have
in
common
with
matthew
and
maybe
his
father
be
a
stubborn
streak
of
all
the
negotiation
in
my
life
those
with
my
son
have
be
the
most
difficult
on
new
year
s
eve
i
go
around
my
new
house
put
out
the
light
and
i
felt
a
kind
of
fissure
deep
within
the
bedrock
of
my
existence
my
life
be
about
sport
my
business
be
about
sport
my
bond
with
my
father
be
about
sport
and
neither
of
my
two
son
want
anything
to
do
with
sport
like
the
american
sell
price
it
all
seem
so
unjust

strasser
be
our
five
star
general
and
i
be
ready
to
follow
him
into
any
fray
any
fusillade
in
our
fight
with
onitsuka
his
outrage
have
comfort
and
sustain
me
and
his
mind
have
be
a
formidable
weapon
in
this
new
fight
with
the
fed
he
be
doubly
outrage
good
i
thought
he
stomp
around
the
office
like
a
piss
off
viking
and
his
stomp
be
music
to
my
ear
we
both
knew
however
that
rage
wasn
t
go
to
be
enough
nor
be
strasser
alone
we
be
take
on
the
united
state
of
america
we
need
a
few
good
men
so
strasser
reach
out
to
a
young
portland
lawyer
a
friend
of
his
name
richard
werschkul
i
don
t
remember
ever
be
introduce
to
werschkul
i
don
t
remember
anyone
ask
me
to
meet
him
or
hire
him
i
just
remember
suddenly
be
aware
of
werschkul
extremely
conscious
of
his
presence
all
the
time
the
way
you
re
aware
of
a
big
woodpecker
in
your
front
yard
or
on
your
head
for
the
most
part
werschkul
s
presence
be
welcome
he
have
the
kind
of
go
go
motor
we
like
and
the
credential
we
always
look
for
stanford
undergrad
university
of
oregon
law
he
also
have
a
compelling
personality
a
presence
dark
wiry
sarcastic
bespectacled
he
possess
an
uncommonly
deep
plummy
baritone
like
darth
vader
with
a
head
cold
overall
he
give
the
impression
of
a
man
with
a
plan
and
the
plan
didn
t
include
surrender
or
sleep
on
the
other
hand
he
also
have
an
eccentric
streak
we
all
do
but
werschkul
have
what
mom
hatfield
might
have
call
a
wild
hair
there
be
always
something
about
him
that
didn
t
quite
fit
for
instance
though
he
be
a
native
oregonian
he
have
a
baffling
east
coast
air
blue
blazer
pink
shirt
bow
tie
sometimes
his
accent
suggest
summer
in
newport
row
for
yale
a
string
of
polo
pony
surpass
strange
in
a
man
who
knew
his
way
around
the
willamette
valley
and
while
he
could
be
very
witty
even
silly
he
could
change
on
a
dime
and
become
scary
serious
nothing
make
him
more
serious
than
the
topic
of
nike
v
u
s
custom
some
inside
nike
worried
about
werschkul
s
seriousness
fear
it
border
on
obsession
fine
by
me
i
thought
obsessive
be
the
only
one
for
the
job
the
only
one
for
me
some
question
his
stability
but
when
it
come
to
stability
i
ask
who
among
us
will
throw
the
first
stone
besides
strasser
like
him
and
i
trust
strasser
so
when
strasser
suggest
that
we
promote
werschkul
and
move
him
to
washington
d
c
where
he
d
be
closer
to
the
politician
we
d
need
on
our
side
i
didn
t
hesitate
neither
of
course
do
werschkul
about
the
same
time
we
dispatch
werschkul
to
washington
i
sent
hayes
to
exeter
to
check
on
thing
at
the
factory
and
to
see
how
woodell
and
johnson
be
get
along
also
on
his
agenda
be
the
purchase
of
something
call
a
rubber
mill
allegedly
it
would
help
us
do
a
well
job
of
dictate
the
quality
of
our
outer
sol
and
midsoles
more
bowerman
want
it
for
his
experiment
and
my
policy
be
still
wbw
whatever
bowerman
want
if
bowerman
requisition
a
sherman
tank
i
told
woodell
don
t
ask
question
just
dial
the
pentagon
but
when
hayes
ask
woodell
about
these
rubber
mill
gizmo
and
where
to
find
one
woodell
shrug
never
heard
of
them
woodell
refer
hayes
to
giampietro
who
knew
everything
worth
know
about
rubber
mill
of
course
and
day
later
hayes
found
himself
trek
with
giampietro
into
the
backwoods
of
maine
to
the
little
town
of
saco
and
an
auction
of
industrial
equipment
hayes
wasn
t
able
to
find
a
rubber
mill
at
the
auction
but
he
do
fall
in
love
with
the
auction
site
an
old
redbrick
factory
on
an
island
in
the
saco
river
the
factory
be
something
out
of
stephen
king
but
that
didn
t
spook
hayes
it
spoke
to
him
i
guess
it
be
to
be
expect
that
a
man
with
a
bulldozer
fetish
would
become
enamor
of
a
rust
out
factory
the
surprising
part
be
the
factory
happen
to
be
for
sale
price
hayes
offer
the
factory
owner
and
they
settle
on
congratulation
hayes
and
woodell
say
when
they
phone
that
afternoon
for
what
for
only
slightly
more
than
the
cost
of
a
rubber
mill
you
be
the
proud
owner
of
a
whole
damn
factory
they
say
the
heck
be
you
talk
about
they
fill
me
in
like
jack
tell
his
mother
about
the
magic
bean
they
mumble
when
they
get
to
the
part
about
the
price
and
about
the
factory
need
ten
of
thousand
of
dollar
in
repair
i
could
tell
they
d
be
drinking
and
later
woodell
would
confess
that
after
stop
at
a
huge
discount
liquor
outlet
in
new
hampshire
hayes
whoop
at
price
like
this
a
man
can
t
afford
not
to
drink
i
rise
from
my
chair
and
yell
into
the
phone
you
dummy
what
do
i
need
with
a
nonworking
factory
in
saco
maine
storage
they
say
and
one
day
it
could
be
a
complement
to
our
factory
in
exeter
in
my
best
john
mcenroe
i
scream
you
cannot
be
serious
don
t
you
dare
too
late
we
already
bought
it
dial
tone
i
sat
down
i
didn
t
even
feel
mad
i
be
too
upset
to
be
mad
the
fed
be
dun
me
for
million
i
didn
t
have
and
my
men
be
run
around
the
country
write
check
for
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
more
without
even
ask
me
suddenly
i
become
calm
quasi
comatose
i
told
myself
who
care
when
the
government
come
in
when
they
repossess
everything
lock
stock
and
barrel
let
them
figure
out
what
to
do
with
a
nonworking
factory
in
saco
maine
later
hayes
and
woodell
call
back
and
say
they
d
only
be
kid
about
buying
the
factory
pull
your
chain
they
say
but
you
do
need
to
buy
it
you
must
okay
i
say
wearily
okay
whatever
you
dummy
think
best
we
be
on
track
in
for
sale
of
million
well
yet
our
quality
be
rise
apace
people
in
the
trade
industry
insider
be
write
article
praise
us
for
finally
put
out
a
well
shoe
than
adidas
personally
i
thought
the
insider
be
late
to
the
party
other
than
a
few
early
stumble
our
quality
have
be
top
for
year
and
we
d
never
lag
in
innovation
plus
we
have
rudy
s
air
sol
in
the
pipeline
aside
from
our
war
with
the
government
we
be
in
great
shape
which
seem
like
say
aside
from
be
on
death
row
life
be
grand
another
good
sign
we
kept
outgrow
our
headquarters
we
move
again
that
year
to
a
forty
thousand
square
foot
building
all
our
own
in
beaverton
my
private
office
be
sleek
and
huge
big
than
our
entire
first
headquarters
next
to
the
pink
bucket
and
utterly
empty
the
interior
decorator
decide
to
go
japanese
minimalist
with
one
touch
of
the
absurd
that
everyone
found
hilarious
she
thought
it
would
be
a
hoot
to
set
beside
my
desk
a
leather
chair
that
be
a
giant
baseball
mitt
now
she
say
you
can
sit
there
every
day
and
think
about
your
sport
thing
i
sat
in
the
mitt
like
a
foul
ball
and
look
out
the
window
i
should
have
revel
in
that
moment
savor
the
humor
and
the
irony
get
cut
from
my
high
school
baseball
team
have
be
one
of
the
great
hurt
of
my
life
and
now
i
be
sit
in
a
giant
mitt
in
a
swank
new
office
preside
over
a
company
that
sell
sport
thing
to
professional
baseball
player
but
instead
of
cherish
how
far
we
d
come
i
saw
only
how
far
we
have
to
go
my
window
look
onto
a
beautiful
stand
of
pine
and
i
definitely
couldn
t
see
the
forest
for
the
tree
i
didn
t
understand
what
be
happen
in
the
moment
but
now
i
do
the
year
of
stress
be
take
their
toll
when
you
see
only
problem
you
re
not
see
clearly
at
just
the
moment
i
need
to
be
my
sharpest
i
be
approach
burnout
i
open
the
final
buttface
of
with
a
rah
rah
speech
try
to
fire
up
the
troop
but
especially
myself
gentleman
i
say
our
industry
be
make
up
of
snow
white
and
the
seven
dwarf
and
next
year
finally
one
of
the
dwarf
be
go
to
get
into
snow
white
s
pant
as
if
the
metaphor
need
far
explanation
i
explain
that
adidas
be
snow
white
and
our
time
i
thunder
be
come
but
first
we
need
to
start
sell
clothes
aside
from
the
plain
numerical
fact
that
adidas
sell
more
apparel
than
shoe
apparel
give
them
a
psychological
edge
apparel
help
them
lure
big
athlete
into
sweeter
endorsement
deal
look
at
all
we
can
give
you
adidas
would
say
to
an
athlete
point
to
their
shirt
and
pant
and
other
gear
and
they
could
say
the
same
thing
when
they
sat
down
with
sport
good
store
besides
if
we
ever
resolve
our
fight
with
the
fed
and
if
we
ever
want
to
go
public
wall
street
wouldn
t
give
us
the
respect
we
deserve
if
we
be
just
a
shoe
company
we
need
to
be
diverse
which
meant
develop
a
solid
line
of
apparel
which
meant
find
someone
darn
good
to
put
in
charge
of
it
at
the
buttface
i
announce
that
someone
would
be
ron
nelson
why
him
hayes
ask
uh
well
i
say
for
starter
he
s
a
cpa
hayes
wave
his
arm
over
his
head
just
what
we
need
he
say
another
accountant
he
have
me
there
i
do
seem
to
hire
nothing
but
accountant
and
lawyer
it
wasn
t
that
i
have
some
bizarre
affection
for
accountant
and
lawyer
i
just
didn
t
know
where
else
to
look
for
talent
i
remind
hayes
not
for
the
first
time
that
there
s
no
shoe
school
no
university
of
footwear
from
which
we
could
recruit
we
need
to
hire
people
with
sharp
mind
that
be
our
priority
and
accountant
and
lawyer
have
at
least
prove
that
they
could
master
a
difficult
subject
and
pas
a
big
test
most
have
also
demonstrate
basic
competence
when
you
hire
an
accountant
you
knew
he
or
she
could
count
when
you
hire
a
lawyer
you
knew
he
or
she
could
talk
when
you
hire
a
marketing
expert
or
product
developer
what
do
you
know
nothing
you
couldn
t
predict
what
he
or
she
could
do
or
if
he
or
she
could
do
anything
and
the
typical
business
school
graduate
he
or
she
didn
t
want
to
start
out
with
a
bag
sell
shoe
plus
they
all
have
zero
experience
so
you
be
simply
roll
the
dice
base
on
how
well
they
do
in
an
interview
we
didn
t
have
enough
margin
for
error
to
roll
the
dice
on
anyone
besides
as
accountant
go
nelson
be
a
standout
he
d
become
a
manager
in
just
five
year
which
be
ridiculously
fast
and
he
d
be
valedictorian
at
his
high
school
ala
we
didn
t
find
out
until
later
that
he
go
to
high
school
in
eastern
montana
his
class
have
five
people
on
the
minus
side
of
the
ledger
because
he
d
become
an
accountant
so
fast
nelson
be
young
maybe
too
young
to
handle
something
as
big
as
the
launch
of
an
apparel
line
but
i
told
myself
that
his
youth
wouldn
t
be
a
critical
factor
because
start
an
apparel
line
be
relatively
easy
after
all
there
wasn
t
any
technology
or
physic
involve
as
strasser
have
once
quipped
there
s
no
such
thing
as
air
short
then
during
one
of
my
first
meeting
with
nelson
right
after
i
d
hire
him
i
notice
he
have
absolutely
no
sense
of
style
the
more
i
look
him
over
up
and
down
side
to
side
the
more
i
realize
that
he
might
have
be
the
bad
dresser
i
d
ever
met
bad
than
strasser
even
nelson
s
car
i
notice
one
day
in
the
parking
lot
be
a
hideous
shade
of
brown
when
i
mention
this
to
nelson
he
laugh
he
have
the
nerve
to
brag
that
every
car
he
d
ever
own
have
be
the
same
brown
i
might
have
make
a
mistake
with
nelson
i
confide
to
hayes
i
be
no
fashion
plate
but
i
knew
how
to
wear
a
decent
suit
and
because
my
company
be
launch
an
apparel
line
i
now
start
pay
closer
attention
to
what
i
wore
and
what
those
around
me
wore
on
the
second
front
i
be
appalled
banker
and
investor
rep
from
nissho
all
kind
of
people
we
need
to
impress
be
passing
through
our
new
hall
and
whenever
they
saw
strasser
in
his
hawaiian
shirt
or
hayes
in
his
bulldozer
drive
outfit
they
do
triple
take
sometimes
our
eccentricity
be
funny
a
top
executive
at
foot
locker
say
we
think
of
you
guy
as
god
until
we
see
your
car
but
most
time
it
be
embarrass
and
potentially
damage
thus
around
thanksgiving
i
institute
a
strict
company
dress
code
the
reaction
wasn
t
terribly
enthusiastic
corporate
bullshit
many
grumble
i
be
mocked
mostly
i
be
ignore
to
even
a
casual
observer
it
become
clear
that
strasser
start
dress
bad
when
he
show
up
to
work
one
day
in
baggy
seat
bermuda
short
as
if
he
be
walk
a
geiger
counter
down
the
beach
i
couldn
t
stand
by
this
be
rank
insubordination
i
intercept
him
in
the
hall
and
call
him
out
you
need
to
wear
a
coat
and
tie
i
say
we
re
not
a
coat
and
tie
company
he
shot
back
we
be
now
he
walk
away
from
me
in
the
come
day
strasser
continued
to
dress
with
a
study
confrontational
casualness
so
i
fin
him
i
instruct
the
bookkeeper
to
deduct
seventy
five
dollar
from
strasser
s
next
paycheck
he
threw
a
fit
of
course
and
he
plot
day
later
he
and
hayes
come
to
work
in
coat
and
tie
but

come
a
few
week
later
nelson
stood
before
us
and
make
his
formal
presentation
of
the
first
ever
line
of
nike

beam
with
pride
grin
with
excitement
he
laid
all
the

on

from
a

the
topper
nelson
pull
each
item
from
a
dirty
brown
paper
bag
which
look
as
if
it
also
contain
his
lunch
at
first
we
be
in
shock
none
of
us
knew
what
to
say
finally
someone
chuckle
strasser
probably
then
someone
haw
haw
woodell
maybe
then
the
dam
burst
everyone
be
laugh
rock
back
and
forth
fall
out
of
their
chair
nelson
saw
that
he
d
goofed
and
in
a
panic
he
start
stuff
the
clothes
back
into
the
paper
bag
which
ripped
apart
which
make
everyone
laugh
harder
i
be
laugh
too
harder
than
anyone
but
at
any
moment
i
felt
as
if
i
might
start
sob
shortly
after
that
day
i
transfer
nelson
to
the
newly
form
production
department
where
his
considerable
accounting
talent
help
him
do
a
great
job
then
i
quietly
shift
woodell
to
apparel
he
do
his
typically
flawless
job
assemble
a
line
that
gain
immediate
attention
and
respect
in
the
industry
i
ask
myself
why
i
didn
t
just
let
woodell
do
everything
include
my
job
maybe
he
could
fly
back
east
and
get
the
fed
off
my
back
amid
all
this
turmoil
amid
all
this
uncertainty
about

we
need

be
just

t
you

realize
he
shout
that

seem
like
the
old
strasser
when
he

d
c
take
on
this

no
other
way
and
maybe
it
would
cure
my
burnout
maybe
the
cure
for
any
burnout
i
thought
be
to
just
work
harder

he
occupy
a
teeny
office
at
the
treasury
department
a
space
about
the
size
of
my
mother
s
linen
closet
there
be
barely
room
for
his
government
issue
gunmetal
gray
desk
let
alone
the
match
chair
for
infrequent
visitor
he
point
to
this
chair
sit
he
say
i
sat
i
look
around
in
disbelief
this
be
the
home
base
of
the
man
who
kept
send
us
those
bill
for
million
i
look
now
at
him
this
beady
eyed
bureaucrat
what
creature
do
he
remind
me
of
not
a
worm
no
he
be
big
than
that
not
a
snake
he
be
less
simple
than
that
then
i
have
it
johnson
s
pet
octopus
i
recall
stretch
drag
the
helpless
crab
back
to
its
lair
yes
this
bureaucrat
be
a
kraken
a
micro
kraken
a
bureau
kraken
smother
these
thought
bury
all
my
hostility
and
fear
i
screw
a
fake
smile
onto
my
face
and
try
in
a
friendly
tone
to
explain
that
this
whole
thing
be
a
gigantic
misunderstand
even
the
bureau
kraken
s
colleague
within
the
treasury
department
side
with
our
position
i
hand
him
a
document
you
have
right
here
i
say
a
memo
state
that
the
american
sell
price
do
not
apply
to
nike
shoe
the
memo
come
from
treasury
hmm
the
bureau
kraken
say
he
look
it
over
push
it
back
at
me
that
s
not
binding
on
custom
not
binding
i
grit
my
teeth
but
this
whole
case
i
say
be
nothing
but
the
result
of
a
dirty
trick
played
by
our
competitor
we
re
be
penalize
for
our
success
we
don
t
see
it
that
way
by
we
who
do
you
mean
the
u
s
government
i
found
it
hard
to
believe
this
man
be
speak
for
the
u
s
government
but
i
didn
t
say
that
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
u
s
government
would
want
to
stifle
free
enterprise
i
say
that
the
u
s
government
would
want
to
be
a
party
to
this
kind
of
deceit
and
trickery
that
the
u
s
government
my
government
would
want
to
bully
a
little
company
in
oregon
sir
with
all
respect
i
ve
be
all
over
the
world
i
ve
see
corrupt
government
in
undeveloped
country
act
this
way
i
ve
see
thug
push
around
business
with
arrogance
with
impunity
and
i
can
t
believe
my
own
government
would
behave
in
such
a
fashion
the
bureau
kraken
say
nothing
a
faint
smirk
flicker
across
his
thin
lip
it
struck
me
all
at
once
that
he
be
grotesquely
unhappy
as
all
functionary
be
when
i
start
to
speak
again
his
unhappiness
manifest
itself
in
a
restless
manic
energy
he
jumped
up
and
pace
back
and
forth
he
dance
behind
his
desk
then
he
sat
down
then
he
do
it
again
it
wasn
t
the
pace
of
a
thinker
but
the
agitation
of
a
cage

all
the
time
i
look
around

then
i
release

i
look
up
at
that

fa
ade
at
all
the
column
and
all
the
shiny
marble
and
the
big
flag
overhead
and
i
have
to
pause
i
thought
of
the
parthenon
the
temple
of
nike
i
knew
that
this
too
would
be
one
of
the
seminal
moment
of
my
life
no
matter
how
it
turn
out
i
didn
t
want
to
let
it
pas
without
embrace
it
acknowledge
it
so
i
star
at
the
column
i
admire
the
sunlight
bounce
off
the
marble
i
stood
there
for
the
long
time
you
come

a
blazing
summer
day

with
sweat

go
to
meet
a
u

this
condition
how

to
shake
his

outer
office
and
one
of
his
aide
lead
us
into
a
wait
room

bullpen
i
thought
of
the
birth
of
my
two
son

thought
of
penny
i
thought
of
my
parent

thought
of
bowerman

thought
of
grelle
i
thought
of

third
cousin

rightness
of
our
cause

ready
for
the
possibility
of
success
we
lean
into
each
other
in
half
whisper
we
talk
about
different
way

should
write
a
letter

behind
in
the
fall
of
i
flew
to
washington
for
a
second
meeting
with
the
bureau
kraken
this
time
he
wasn
t
so
feisty
hatfield
have
be
in
touch
as
have
oregon
s
other

bob
packwood
chairman

well
but
the
bureau
kraken
would
never
retire
in
year
to
come
through
republican
and
democratic
administration
he
d
remain
on
and
on
like
death
and
tax
in
fact
one
day
in
the
distant
future
he
d
be
among
the
small
coterie
of
bureaucrat
to
give
the
disastrous
green
light
that
would
send
federal
agent
storm
the
compound
at
waco
with
the
bureau
kraken
rattle
i
be
momentarily
able
to
turn
my
attention
back

our
other
existential
threat
production
the
same
condition
that
brought
down
japan

go
to
get

would
follow
the
question
be
how
to
get
in
first
the
first
to
get
in

have
a
competitive
advantage
that
could
last
decade
not
only
in
china
s
production
sector
but
in
its
market
and
with
its
political
leader

a
coup
that
would
be
in
our

you
bureaucracy
doesn
t
begin
to
describe
it
i
close
my
eye
and
picture
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
a
chinese
version
of
the
bureau

i
also
thought
of
the
ex
gi
who
d
explain
japanese
business
practice
to
me
when
i
be
twenty
four
i
d
follow
their
advice
to
the
letter
and
never
regret
it
so
under
chang
s
direction
we
put
together
a
write
presentation
it
be
long
it
be
almost
as
long
as
werschkul
on
american
sell
price
volume
i
we
too
have
it
bound
often
we
ask
each
other
be
anyone
actually
go
to
read
this
thing
oh
well
we
say
this
be
how
chang
say
it
s
do
we
sent
it
off
to
beijing
without
hope
at
the
first
buttface
of
i
announce
that
though
we
d
gain
the
upper
hand
with
the
fed
it
might
go
on
forever
if
we
didn
t
do
something
bold
something
outrageous
i
ve
give
this
a
lot
of
thought
i
say
and
i
think
what
we
need
to
do
be
american
sell
price
ourselves
the
buttfaces
laugh
then
they
stop
laugh
and
look
at
each
other
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
weekend
kick
it
around
be
it
possible
nah
it
couldn
t
be
could
we
oh
no
way
but
maybe
we
decide
to
give
it
a
try
we
launch
a
new
shoe
a
run
shoe
with
nylon
upper
and
call
it
one
line
it
be
a
knockoff
dirt
cheap
with
a
simple
logo
and
we
manufacture
it
in
saco
at
hayes
s
ancient
factory
we
price
it
low
just
above
cost
now
custom
official
would
have
to
use
this
competitor
shoe
as
a
new
reference
point
in
decide
our
import
duty
that
be
the
jab
that
be
just
to
get
their
attention
then
we
threw
the
left
hook
we
produce
a
tv
commercial
tell
the
story
of
a
little
company
in
oregon
fight
the
big
bad
government
it
open
on
a
runner
do
his
lonely
road
work
as
a
deep
voice
extol
the
ideal
of
patriotism
liberty
the
american
way
and
fight
tyranny
it
get
people
pretty
fire
up
then
we
threw
the
haymaker
on
february
we
file
a
million
antitrust
suit
in
the
u
s
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
allege
that
our
competitor
and
assort
rubber
company
through
underhanded
business
practice
have
conspire
to
take
us
out
we
sat
back
wait
we
knew
it
wouldn
t
take
long
and
indeed
it
didn
t
the
bureau
kraken
crack
up
he
threaten
to
go
nuclear
whatever
that
meant
it
didn
t
matter
he
didn
t
matter
his
boss
and
his
boss
boss
didn
t
want
this
fight
anymore
our
competitor
and
their
accomplice
in
the
government
realize
that
they
d
underestimated
our
will
immediately
they
initiate
settlement
talk
day
in
day
out
our
lawyer
would
phone
from
some
government
office
some
blue
chip
law
firm
some
conference
room
on
the
east
coast
meeting
with
the
other
side
they
d
tell
me
the
late
settlement
offer
be
float
and
i
d
reject
it
out
of
hand
one
day
the
lawyer
say
we
could
settle
the
whole
thing
with
no
fuss
no
courtroom
drama
for
the
tidy
sum
of
million
not
a
chance
i
say
another
day
they
phone
and
say
we
could
settle
for
million
don
t
make
me
laugh
i
say
as
the
number
crept
low
i
have
several
heat
conversation
with
hayes
and
strasser
and
my
father
they
want
me
to
settle
be
do
with
this
what
s
your
ideal
number
they
d
ask
zero
i
d
say
i
didn
t
want
to
pay
one
penny
even
one
penny
would
be
unfair
but
jaqua
and
cousin
houser
and
chuck
who
be
all
consult
on
the
case
sat
me
down
one
day
and
explain
that
the
government
need
something
to
save
face
they
couldn
t
walk
away
from
this
fight
with
nothing
as
negotiation
ground
to
a
halt
i
met
one
on
one
with
chuck
he
remind
me
that
until
this
fight
be
behind
us
we
couldn
t
think
about
go
public
and
if
we
didn
t
go
public
we
continued
to
risk
lose
everything
i
become
petulant
i
moan
about
fairness
i
talk
about
hold
out
i
say
maybe
i
didn
t
want
to
go
public
ever
yet
again
i
express
my
fear
that
go
public
would
change
nike
ruin
it
by
turn
over
control
to
others
what
would
happen
to
the
culture
of
oregon
track
for
instance
if
it
be
subject
to
shareholder
vote
or
corporate
raider
demand
we
d
gotten
a
little
taste
of
that
scenario
with
the
small
group
of
debenture
holder
scale
up
and
let
in
thousand
of
shareholder
it
would
be
a
thousand
time
bad
above
all
i
couldn
t
bear
the
thought
of
one
titan
buying
up
share
become
a
behemoth
on
the
board
i
don
t
want
to
lose
control
i
say
to
chuck
that
s
my
great
fear
well
there
might
be
a
way
to
go
public
without
lose
any
control
he
say
what
you
could
issue
two
class
of
stock
class
a
and
class
b
the
public
would
get
class
b
which
would
carry
one
vote
per
share
the
founder
and
inner
circle
and
your
convertible
debenture
holder
would
get
class
as
which
would
entitle
them
to
name
three
quarter
of
the
board
of
director
in
other
word
you
raise
enormous
sum
of
money
turbocharge
your
growth
but
ensure
that
you
keep
control
i
look
at
him
dumbstruck
can
we
really
do
that
it
s
not
easy
but
the
new
york
time
and
the
washington
post
and
a
couple
of
others
have
do
it
i
think
you
can
do
it
maybe
it
wasn
t
satori
or
kensho
but
it
be
instant
enlightenment
in
a
flash
the
breakthrough
i
d
be
seek
for
year
chuck
i
say
that
sound
like
the
answer
at
the
next
buttface
i
explain
the
concept
of
class
a
and
class
b
and
everyone
have
the
same
reaction
at
long
last
but
i
caution
the
buttfaces
whether
or
not
this
be
the
solution
we
need
to
do
something
right
now
fix
our
cash
flow
problem
once
and
for
all
because
our
window
be
closing
i
could
suddenly
see
a
recession
on
the
horizon
six
month
a
year
at
the
max
if
we
wait
try
to
go
public
then
the
market
would
give
us
far
less
than
we
be
worth
i
ask
for
a
show
of
hand
go
public
all
in
favor
it
be
unanimous
the
moment
we
resolve
our
longstanding
cold
war
with
our
competitor
and
the
fed
we
would
initiate
a
public
offering
the
spring
flower
be
up
by
the
time
our
lawyer
and
government
official
have
settle
on
a
number
million
it
still
sound
way
too
high
but
everyone
told
me
to
pay
it
take
the
deal
they
kept
say
i
spent
an
hour
star
out
my
window
mull
the
flower
and
the
calendar
say
it
be
spring
but
that
day
the
cloud
be
eye
level
dishwater
gray
and
the
wind
be
cold
i
groan
i
grabbed
the
phone
and
dial
werschkul
who
have
take
the
role
of
lead
negotiator
let
s
do
it
i
told
carole
field
to
cut
the
check
she
brought
it
to
me
for
my
signature
we
look
at
each
other
and
of
course
we
be
both
think
about
the
time
i
d
write
that
check
for
million
which
i
couldn
t
cover
now
i
be
write
a
check
for
million
and
there
be
no
way
it
be
go
to
bounce
i
look
at
the
signature
line
nine
million
i
whisper
i
could
still
remember
sell
my
mg
with
race
tire
and
a
twin
cam
for
eleven
hundred
dollar
like
yesterday
lead
me
from
the
unreal
to
the
real
the
letter
arrive
at
the
start
of
summer
the
chinese
government
request
the
pleasure
of
a
visit
i
spent
a
month
decide
who
would
go
it
have
to
be
the
a
team
i
thought
so
i
sat
with
a
yellow
legal
pad
in
my
lap
make
list
of
name
scratch
them
out
make
new
list
chang
of
course
strasser
naturally
hayes
surely
i
notify
everyone
who
be
go
on
the
trip
to
get
their
paper
and
passport
and
affair
in
order
then
i
spent
the
day
lead
up
to
our
departure
reading
cram
on
chinese
history
the
boxer
rebellion
the
great
wall
opium
war
ming
dynasty
confucius
mao
and
darn
if
i
be
go
to
be
the
only
student
i
make
a
syllabus
for
all
member
of
our
travel
party
in
july
we
board
a
plane
beijing
here
we
come
but
first
tokyo
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
stop
there
along
the
way
just
to
check
in
sale
be
start
to
grow
again
in
the
japanese
market
also
japan
would
be
a
nice
way
to
ease
everyone
into
china
which
be
go
to
be
a
challenge
for
all
of
us
baby
step
penny
and
gorman
i
d
learn
my
lesson
twelve
hour
later
walk
the
street
of
tokyo
alone
my
mind
kept
spin
back
to
my
crazy
idea
now
i
be
back
on
the
verge
of
take
that
idea
into
a
mammoth
new
market
i
thought
of
marco
polo
i
thought
of
confucius
but
i
also
thought
of
all
the
game
i
d
see
through
the
year
football
basketball
baseball
when
one
team
have
a
big
lead
in
the
final
second
or
inning
and
relaxed
or
tighten
and
therefore
lose
i
told
myself
to
stop
look
back
keep
my
gaze
forward
we
ate
a
few
wonderful
japanese
dinner
and
visit
a
few
old
friend

after
two
or
three

be
all
set
to
go
our
flight
to
beijing
be
the
next
morning

have
one
last
meal
together
in
the
ginza
wash
down
with
several
cocktail
and
everyone
turn
in
early
i
take
a
hot
shower
phone
home
and
pour
myself
into
bed
a
few
hour
later

excruciatingly
uncomfortable
with
all
our

stop
i
look
around
and
saw
hundred
of
people
in

reluctantly
agree
they
take
us
by

to
remote
town
far
from

where
we
saw
vast
and
terrify
industrial
complex
small
metropolis
of
factory
each
one
more
outdated
than
the
last
old
rust
decrepit

of
grime
and
nothing

no
real
quality
control
when
we
point
out
a
defective

the
official
run
the
factory
would
shrug
and
say
perfectly
functional
never
mind
aesthetic
the
chinese
didn
t
see
why
the
nylon

need
to
be
the
same
shade
in
the
left
shoe
and
the
right
it
be
common
practice
for
a
left
shoe
to
be
light
blue
and
a

shoe
to
be
dark
blue

our
visit
we
take
a
nineteen
hour
train
ride
to
shanghai
we
could
ve
flown
but
i
insist
on
the
train
i
want
to
see
to
experience
the
countryside
within
the
first
hour
the

be
not

condition
there
be
one
old
fan
in
the
corner
of
our
train
car
the
blade
barely
move
the
hot
dust
around
to
get
cool
chinese
passenger
thought
nothing
of
strip
down
to
their
underwear
and
hayes
and
strasser
thought
this
give
them
license
to
do
the
same
if
i
live
to
be
two
hundred
year
old
i
won
t
forget
the
sight
of
those
leviathan
walk
up
and
down
the
train
car
in
their
t
shirt
and
bvd
nor
will
any
chinese
man
or

that

in
shanghai
the
first
be
to
secure
a
deal
with
the
chinese
track
and
field
federation
this
meant
secure
a
deal
with
the
government
s
ministry
of
sport
unlike
the
western
world
where
every
athlete
make
his
own
deal
china
itself
negotiate
endorsement
deal
for
all
its
athlete
so
in
an
old
shanghai
schoolhouse
in
a
classroom
with
seventy
five
year
old
furniture
and
a
huge
portrait
of

then
the
lecture
abruptly
stop
the
representative
lean
forward
and
in
a
low
voice
that
struck
me
as
a
chinese
version
of
uber
agent
leigh
steinberg
he
ask
how
much
you
offering
within
two
hour

and
warm
ups
nike

and
warm
ups
our
final
meeting
be
with
the
ministry
of
foreign
trade
as
with
all
previous
meeting
there
be
several
round
of
long
speech
mainly
by
official
hayes
be
bore
during
the
first
round
by
the
third
round
he
be
suicidal
he
start
play
with
the
loose
thread
on
the
front
of
his
polyester
dress
shirt
suddenly
he
become
annoyed
with
the
thread
he
take
out
his
lighter
as
the
deputy
minister
of
foreign
trade
be
hail
us
as
worthy
partner
he
stop
and
look
up
to
see
that
hayes
have
set
himself
on
fire
hayes
beat
on
the
flame
with
his
hand
and
manage
to
put
it
out
but
only
after
ruin
the
moment
and
the
speaker
s
mojo
it
didn
t
matter
just
before
get
on
the
plane
home
we
sign
deal
with
two
chinese
factory
and
officially
become
the
first
american
shoemaker
in
twenty
five
year
to
be
allow
to
do
business
in
china
it
seem
wrong
to
call
it
business
it
seem
wrong
to
throw
all
those
hectic
day
and
sleepless
night
all
those
magnificent
triumph
and
desperate
struggle
under
that
bland
generic
banner
business
what
we
be
do
felt
like
so
much
more
each
new
day
brought
fifty
new
problem
fifty
tough
decision
that
need
to
be
make
right
now
and
we
be
always
acutely
aware
that
one
rash
move
one
wrong
decision
could
be
the
end
the
margin
for
error
be
forever
get
narrower
while
the
stake
be
forever
creep
high
and
none
of
us
waver
in
the
belief
that
stake
didn
t
mean
money
for
some
i
realize
business
be
the
all
out
pursuit
of
profit
period
full
stop
but
for
us
business
be
no
more
about
make
money
than
be
human
be
about
make
blood
yes
the
human
body
need
blood
it
need
to
manufacture
red
and
white
cell
and
platelet
and
redistribute
them
evenly
smoothly
to
all
the
right
place
on
time
or
else
but
that
day
to
day
business
of
the
human
body
isn
t
our
mission
as
human
being
it
s
a
basic
process
that
enables
our
high
aim
and
life
always
strives
to
transcend
the
basic
process
of
living
and
at
some
point
in
the
late
s
i
do
too
i
redefine
win
expand
it
beyond
my
original
definition
of
not
lose
of
merely
stay
alive
that
be
no
longer
enough
to
sustain
me
or
my
company
we
want
as
all
great
business
do
to
create
to
contribute
and
we
dare
to
say
so
aloud
when
you
make
something
when
you
improve
something
when
you
deliver
something
when
you
add
some
new
thing
or
service
to
the
life
of
stranger
make
them
happier
or
healthier
or
safer
or
well
and
when
you
do
it
all
crisply
and
efficiently
smartly
the
way
everything
should
be
do
but
so
seldom
be
you
re
participate
more
fully
in
the
whole
grand
human
drama
more
than
simply
alive
you
re
help
others
to
live
more
fully
and
if
that
s
business
all
right
call
me
a
businessman
maybe
it
will
grow
on
me
there
be
no
time
to
unpack
there
be
no
time
to
get
over
our
post
china
jet
lag
which
be
profound
as
we
return
to
oregon
the
process
of
go
public
be
in
full
swing
big
choice
need
to
be
make
especially
who
be
go
to
manage
the
offering
public
offering
don
t
always
succeed
on
the
contrary
when
mismanage
they
turn
into
train
wreck
so
this
be
a
critical
decision
right
out
of
the
block
chuck
have
work
at
kuhn
loeb
still
have
strong
relationship
with
their
people
and
thought
they
d
be
best
we
interviewed
four
or
five
other
firm
but
in
the
end
decide
to
go
with
chuck
s
instinct
he
hadn
t
steer
us
wrong
yet
next
we
have
to
create
a
prospectus
it
take
fifty
draft
at
least
to
get
it
look
and
sound
the
way
we
want
finally
at
the
tail
end
of
summer
we
hand
all
our
paperwork
to
the
security
and
exchange
commission
and
at
the
start
of
september
we
release
the
formal
announcement
nike
will
be
create
million
share
of
class
a
stock
and
million
share
of
class
b
the
price
of
the
stock
we
told
the
world
would
be
somewhere
between
eighteen
and
twenty
two
dollar
a
share
tbd
of
million
share
total
almost
million
would
be
held
in
reserve
and
about
million
class
b
would
be
sell
to
the
public
of
the
roughly
million
remain

bowerman
the
debenture
holder
and
the
buttfaces
would
own
percent
i
personally
would
own
about
percent
it
need
to
be
that
much
we
all
agree
because
the
company
need
to
be
run
by
one
person
to
speak
with
one
firm
and
steady
voice
come
what
may
there
could
be
no
chance
of
alliance
or
breakaway
faction
no
existential
struggle
for
control
to
the
outsider
the
division
of
share
might
have
seem
disproportionate
unbalanced
unfair
to
the
butt
face
it
be
a
necessity
there
wasn
t
a
word
of
dissent

before

our
brand
ourselves
after
china
we
weren
t
in
any
mood

there

out
to
be
anything
but
a
comedy
it
s
a
movie
about
mortality

men
nicholson
and
freeman
both
terminally
ill
with
cancer
decide
to
spend
their
remain
day
do
all
the
fun
thing
the
crazy
thing
they
ve
always
want
to
do
to
make
the
most
of
their
time
before
they
kick
the
bucket
an
hour
into
the
movie
there
s
not
a
chuckle
to
be
have
there
be
also
many
strange
unsettle
parallel
between
the
movie
and
my
life
first
nicholson
always
make
me
think
of
one
flew
over
the
cuckoo
s
nest
which
make
me
think
of
kesey
which
take
me
back
to
my
day
at
the
university
of
oregon
second
high
on
the
bucket
list
of

scruffy
goatee
when

movie
end
when
the
light
come
up
penny
and
i
be
both
relieve
to
stand
and
return
to
the
bright
glare
of
real
life
the
theater
be
a
new
sixteen
screen
colossus
in
the
heart
of
cathedral
city
just
outside

spend
much
of
the
winter
there
hiding
from
the
chilly
oregon
rain
walk
through
the
lobby
wait
for
our
eye
to
adjust
we
spot
two
familiar
face
at
first
we
can
t
place
them
we
re
still
see
nicholson
and
freeman
in
our
mind
but
these
face
be
equally
familiar
equally
famous
now

realize
it
s
bill
and
warren
gate
and
buffett

stroll
over
neither
man
be
what
you

call
a
close
friend
but
we
ve
met
them
several
time
at
social
event
and
conference
and
we
have
common
cause
common
interest
a
few
mutual
acquaintance
fancy
meeting
you
here
i
say
then
i
cringe
do
i
really
just
say
that
be
it
possible
that
i
m
still
shy
and
awkward
in
the
presence
of
celebrity
i
be
just
think
about
you
one
of
them
say
we
shake
hand
all
around
and
talk
mostly
about
palm

other
guy

smile
as
it
should
be
in
my
head
i
can
t
help
do
some
quick
math
at
the
moment
i
m
worth
billion
and
each
of
these
men
be
worth
five
or
six
time
more
lead
me
from
the
unreal
to
the

penny
asks
if
they
enjoy
the
movie
yes
they
both
say
look
down
at
their
shoe
though
it
be
a
bit
depress
what
s
on
your
bucket
list
i
nearly
ask
but
i
don
t
gate
and
buffett
seem
to
have
do
everything
they
ve
ever
want
in
this
life
they
have
no
bucket
list
surely
which
make
me
ask
myself
have
i
at
home
penny
pick
up
her
needlepoint
and
i
pour
myself
a
glass
of
wine
i
pull
out
a
yellow
legal
pad
to
look
at
my
note
and
list
for
tomorrow
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
it
s
blank
we
sit
in
front
of
the
eleven
o
clock
news
but
my
mind
be
far
far
away
drift
float
time
travel
a
familiar
feel
of
late
i
m
apt
to
spend
long
stretch
of
the
day
walk
around
in
my
childhood
for
some
reason
i
think
a
lot
about
my
grandfather
bump
knight
he
have
nothing
less
than
nothing
and
yet
he
manage
to
scrimp
and
save
and
buy
a
brand
new
model
t
in
which
he
move
his
wife
and
five
kid
from
winnebago
minnesota
all
the
way
to
colorado
then
on
to
oregon
he
told
me
that
he
didn
t
bother
to
get
his
driver
s
license
he
just
up
and
go
descend
the
rockies
in
that
rattle
shudder
piece
of
tin
he
repeatedly
scold
it
whoa
whoa
you
son
of
a
bitch
i
heard
this
story
so
many
time
from
him
and
from
aunt
and
uncle
and
cousin
i
feel
as
though
i
be
there
in
a
way
i
be
bump
later
bought
a
pickup
and
he
love
put
us
grandkids
in
the
back
of
it
drive
us
into
town
on
errand
along
the
way
he
d
always
stop
by
sutherlin
bakery
and
buy
us
a
dozen
glaze
doughnut
each
i
need
only
look
up
at
the
blue
sky
or
the
white
ceiling
any
blank
screen
will
do
and
i
see
myself
dangle
my
bare
foot
over
his
truck
bed
feel
the
fresh
green
wind
on
my
face
lick
glaze
off
a
warm
doughnut
could
i
have
risk
as
much
dare
as
much
walk
the
razor
s
edge
of
entrepreneurship
between
safety
and
catastrophe
without
the
early
foundation
of
that
feel
that
bliss
of
safety
and
contentment
i
don
t
think
so
after
forty
year
i
ve
step
down
as
nike
ceo
leave
the
company
in
good
hand
i
think
and
good
shape
i
trust
sale
last
year
be
billion
adidas
be
billion
but
who
s
counting
our
shoe
and
clothes
be
in
five
thousand
store
worldwide
and
we
have
ten
thousand
employee
our
chinese
operation
in
shanghai
alone
have
seven
hundred
and
china
our
second
large
market
be
now
our
large
producer
of
shoe
i
guess
that
trip
paid
off
the
five
thousand
employee
at
the
world
headquarters
in
beaverton
be
house
on
an
edenic
collegiate
campus
with
two
hundred
acre
of
wooded
wilderness
lace
by
roll
stream
dot
by
pristine
ball
field
the
building
be
name
after
the
men
and
woman
who
have
give
us
more
than
their

and

hamm
tiger

dan
fouts
jerry
rice
steve
prefontaine
they
ve
give
us
our
identity
as
chairman
i
still
go
most
day
to
my
office
i
look
around
at
all
those
building
and
i
don
t
see
building
i
see
temple
any
building
be
a
temple
if
you
make
it
so
i
think
often
of
that
momentous
trip
when
i
be
twenty
four
i
think
of
myself
stand
high
above
athens
gaze
at
the
parthenon
and
i
never
fail
to
experience
the
sensation
of
time
fold
in
on
itself
amid
the
campus
building
along
the
campus
walkway
there
be
enormous
banner
action
photo
of
the
super
athlete
the
legend
and
giant
and
titan
who
ve
elevate
nike
to
something
more
than
a
brand
jordan
kobe
tiger
again
i
can
t
help
but
think
of
my
trip
around
the
world
the
river
jordan
mystical
kobe
japan
that
first
meeting
at
onitsuka
plead
with
the
executive
for
the
right
to
sell
tiger
can
this
all
be
a
coincidence
i
think
of
the
countless
nike
office
around
the
world
at
each
one
no
matter
the
country
the
phone
number
end
in
which
spell
out
nike
on
the
keypad
but
by
pure
chance
from
right
to
left
it
also
spell
out
pre
s
best
time
in
the
mile
to
the
tenth
of
a
second
i
say
by
pure
chance
but
be
it
really
be
i
allow
to
think
that
some
coincidence
be
more
than
coincidental
can
i
be
forgiven
for
think
or
hop
that
the
universe
or
some
guide
daemon
have
be
nudge
me
whisper
to
me
or
else
just
play
with
me
can
it
really
be
nothing
but
a
fluke
of
geography
that
the
old
shoe
ever
discover
be
a
pair
of
nine
thousand
year
old
sandal
salvage
from
a
cave
in
oregon
be
there
nothing
to
the
fact
that
the
sandal
be
discover
in
the
year
i
be
born
i
always
feel
a
thrill
a
shot
of
adrenaline
when
i
drive
through
the
intersection
of
the
campus
s
two
main
street
each
name
after
a
nike
found
father
all
day
every
day
the
security
guard
at
the
front
gate
give
visitor
the
same
direction
what
you
wanna
do
be
take
bowerman
drive
all
the
way
up
to
del
hayes
way
i
also
take
great
pleasure
in
stroll
past
the
oasis
at
the
center
of
campus
the
nissho
iwai
japanese
garden
in
one
sense
our
campus
be
a
topographical
map
of
nike
s
history
and
growth
in
another
it
s
a
diorama
of
my
life
in
yet
another
sense
it
s
a
living
breathing
expression
of
that
vital
human
emotion
maybe
the
most
vital
of
all
after
love
gratitude
the
young
employee
at
nike
seem
to
have
it
in
abundance
they
care
deeply
about
the
name
on
the
street
and
building
and
about
the
bygone
day
like
matthew
beg
for
his
bedtime
story
they
clamor
for
the
old
tale
they
crowd
the
conference
room
whenever
woodell
or
johnson
visit
they
ve
even
form
a
discussion
group
an
informal
think
tank
to
preserve
that
original
sense
of
innovation
they
call
themselves
the
spirit
of
which
fill
my
heart
but
it
s
not
just
the
young
people
within
the
company
who
honor
the
history
i
think
back
to
july
in
the
middle
of
some
event
i
can
t
recall
which
lebron
james
asks
for
a
private
word
phil
can
i
see
you
a
moment
of
course
when
i
first
sign
with
you
he
say
i
didn
t
know
all
that
much
about
the
history
of

ve
be
study
up
oh

a
lot
of
people
and
nike
be
born
in
well

i
suppose

so
i
go
to
my
jeweler
and
have
them
find
a
rolex
watch
from
he
hand
me
the
watch
it
s
engrave
with
thanks
for
take
a
chance
on
me
as
usual
i
say
nothing
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
it
wasn
t
much
of
a
chance
he
be
pretty
close
to
a
sure
thing
but
take
a
chance
on
people
he
s
right
you
could
argue
that
s
what
it
s
all
be
about
i
go
out
to
the
kitchen
pour
another
glass
of
wine
return
to
my
recliner
i
watch
penny
needlepoint
for
a
while
and
the
mental
image
come
tumble
faster
and
faster
as
if
i
m
needlepointing
memory
i
watch
pete
sampras
crush
every
opponent
at
one
of

many
wimbledon
after
the
final

he
toss
his
racket
into
the
stand
to
me
he
overshoot
and
hit
the
man
behind
me
who
sue
of
course
i
see
pete
s
archrival
andre
agassi
win
the
u

open
unseeded
and
come
to
my
box
after
the
final
shot
in
tear
we
do
it
phil

hug
me
and
hold
on
for
many
second
longer
than
i
expect
i
roll
my
mind
back
over
the
many
private
intimate
moment

share
with
him
and
with

and
with

in
chicago
i
pick
up
the
phone
next
to
the
bed
in
the
guestroom
and
discover
that
there
s
a
voice
on
the
line

open
they
re
all
like

and

no
less
when

i
fly
to
north
carolina
for

and
discover
with
a
shock
that
a
seat
be
reserve
for
me
in
the
front
row
all
of
which
lead
me
back
of
course
to
matthew
i
think
of
his
long
difficult
search
for
meaning
for
identity
for
me
his
search
often
look
so
familiar
even
though
matthew
didn
t
have
my
luck
or
my
focus
nor
my
insecurity
maybe
if
he
d
have
a
little
more
insecurity
in
his
quest
to
find
himself
he
drop
out
of
college
he
experiment
dabble
rebel
argue
ran
away
nothing
work
then
at
last
in
he
seem
to
enjoy
be
a
husband
a
father
a
philanthropist
he
get
involve
in
mi
casa
su
casa
a
charity
building
an
orphanage
in
el
salvador
on
one
of
his
visit
there
after
a
few
day
of
hard
satisfy
work
he
take
a
break
he
drove
with
two
friend
to
ilopango
a
deep
water
lake
to
go
scuba
dive
for
some
reason
he
decide
to
see
how
deep
he
could
go
he
decide
to
take
a
risk
that
even
his
risk
addict
father
would
never
take
something
go
wrong
at
foot
my
son
lose
consciousness
if
i
be
to
think
about
matthew
in
his
final
moment
fight
for
air
i
believe
my
imagination
could
get
me
very
close
to
how
he
must
have
felt
after
the
thousand
of
mile
i
ve
log
as
a
runner
i
know
that
feel
of
fight
for
that
next
breath
but
i
won
t
let
my
imagination
go
there
ever
still
i
ve
talk
to
the
two
friend
who
be
with
him
i
ve
read
everything
i
ve
be
able
to
get
my
hand
on
about
dive
accident
when
thing
go
wrong
i
ve
learn
a
diver
often
feel
something
call
the
martini
effect
he
think
everything
be
okay
well
than
okay
he
feel
euphoric
that
must
have
happen
to
matthew
i
tell
myself
because
at
the
last
second
he
pull
out
his
mouthpiece
i
choose
to
believe
this
euphoria
scenario
to
believe
that
my
son
didn
t
suffer
at
the
end
that
my
son
be
happy
i
choose
because
it
s
the
only
way
i
can
go
on
penny
and
i
be
at
the
movie
when
we
found
out
we
d
go
to
the
five
o

the
middle
of

up

to

as
we
emerge
he

to
the
floor
travis

he
put
his
arm
around
his
mother
and
i
stagger
away
to
the
end
of
the
hallway
tear
stream
i
recall
seven
strange
unbidden
word
run
through
my
head
over
and
over
like
a
fragment
of
some
poem

him
that
i
be
proud
of
him

pain
of
his
impatience
his
hostility

my
crazy

into
the
lobby
of
st
vincent
s
i
be
overcome
with
vision
of
both
my
parent
i
felt
them
at
my
elbow
at
my
ear
theirs
be
a
strain
relationship
i
believe
but
as
with
an
iceberg
everything
be
below
the
surface
in
their
house
on
claybourne
street
the
tension
be
conceal
and
calm
and
reason
almost
always
prevail
because
of
their
love
for

or

other
and
from
us

their
legacy
that

their
last
victory
i
walk
to
the
cardiac

the
familiar
sign
on
the
door

i
sail
past
the
sign
through
the
door
down
the
hall
and
found

lift
his
head
off
the
pillow
manage
a
pain
smile
i
pat
his
arm

a
good
talk
then
i
saw
that

out
and
grabbed
mine

barely
hearing
the
beep
machine
the
laugh
nurse
the
patient
groan
down
the
hall

never
will
be

yourself
by
the
people
who

themselves

so
true
so
very
true
and
it
transport
me
to
tokyo
to
the
office
of
nissho
i
be
there
not

shabu
toast
each
other
with
cup
after
cup
of
sake
we
laugh
cheer
clinked
glass
and
something
pass
between
us
the
same
thing
that
pass
between
me
and
most
of
the
athlete
i
work
with
a
transference
a
camaraderie
a
sort
of
connection
it
s
brief
but
it
nearly
always
happens
and
i
know
it
s
part
of
what
i
be
search
for
when
i
go
around
the
world
in
to
study
the
self
be
to
forget
the
self
mi
casa
su
casa
oneness
in
some
way
shape
or
form
it
s
what
every
person
i
ve
ever
met
have
be
seek
i
think
of
others
who
didn
t
make
it
this
far
bowerman
die
on
christmas
eve
in
fossil
he
d
go
back
to
his
hometown
as
we
always
suspect
he
would
he
still
own
his
house
on
the
mountaintop
above
campus
but
he
chose
to
quit
it
to
move
with
mr
bowerman
to
a
fossil
retirement
home
he
need
to
be
where
he
start
do
he
tell
someone
that
or
be
i
imagine
him
mutter
it
to
himself
i
remember
when
i
be
a
sophomore
we
have
a
dual
meet
with
washington
state
in
pullman
and
bowerman
make
the
bus
driver
go
through
fossil
so
he
could
show
us
i
immediately
thought
of
that
sentimental
detour
when
i
heard
that
he
d
lain
down
on
the
bed
and
never
get
up
it
be
jaqua
who
phone
i
be
reading
the
paper
the
christmas
tree
blinking
blinking
blinking
you
always
remember
the
strangest
detail
from
such
moment
i
choked
into
the
phone
i
ll
have
to
call
you
back
then
walk
upstairs
to
my
den
i
turn
out
all
the
light
eye
shut
i
replayed
a
million
different
moment
include
that
long
ago
lunch
at
the
cosmopolitan
hotel
deal
deal
an
hour
pass
before
i
could
go
back
downstairs
at
some
point
that
night
i
give
up
the
kleenex
and
just
draped
a
towel
over
my
shoulder
a
move
i
learn
from
another
beloved
coach
john
thompson
strasser
pass
suddenly
too
heart
attack
he
be
so
young
it
be
a
tragedy
all
the
more
so
because
it
come
after
we
d
have
a
fall
out
strasser
have
be
instrumental
in
signing
jordan
in
building
up
the
jordan
brand
and
wrap
it
around
rudy
s
air
sol
air
jordan
change
nike
take
us
to
the
next
level
and
the
next
but
it
change
strasser
too
he
felt
that
he
should
no
longer
be
take
order
from
anyone
include
me
especially
me
we
clashed
too
many
time
and
he
quit
it
might
have
be
okay
if
he
d
just
quit
but
he
go
to
work
for
adidas
an
intolerable
betrayal
i
never
forgave
him
though
i
do
recently
happily
proudly
hire
his
daughter
avery
twenty
two
year
old
she
work
in
special
event
and
she
s
say
to
be
thrive
it
s
a
blessing
and
a
joy
to
see
her
name
in
the
company
directory
i
wish
strasser
and
i
have
patch
thing
up
before
he
die
but
i
don
t
know
that
it
be
possible
we
be
both
born
to
compete
and
we
be
both
bad
at
forgive
for
both
of
us
betrayal
be
extra
potent
kryptonite
i
felt
that
same
sense
of
betrayal
when
nike
come
under
attack
for
condition
in
our
overseas
factory
the
so
call
sweatshop
controversy
whenever
reporter
say
a
factory
be
unsatisfactory
they
never
say
how
much
well
it
be
than
the
day
we
first
go
in
they
never
say
how
hard
we
d
work
with
our
factory
partner
to
upgrade
condition
to
make
them
safer
and
cleaner
they
never
say
these
factory
weren
t
ours
that
we
be
renter
one
among
many
tenant
they
simply
search
until
they
found
a
worker
with
complaint
about
condition
and
they
use
that
worker
to
vilify
us
and
only
us
know
our
name
would
generate
maximum
publicity
of
course
my
handle
of
the
crisis
only
make
it
bad
angry
hurt
i
often
react
with
self
righteousness
petulance
anger
on
some
level
i
knew
my
reaction
be
toxic
counterproductive
but
i
couldn
t
stop
myself
it
s
just
not
easy
to
remain
even
keel
when
you
wake
up
one
day
think
you
re
create
job
and
help
poor
country
modernize
and
enable
athlete
to
achieve
greatness
only
to
find
yourself
be
burn
in
effigy
outside
the
flagship
retail
store
in
your
own
hometown
the
company
react
as
i
do
emotionally
everyone
be
reel
many
late
night
in
beaverton
you
d
find
all
the
light
on
and
soul
search
conversation
take
place
in
various
conference
room
and
office
though
we
knew
that
much
of
the
criticism
be
unjust
that
nike
be
a
symbol
a
scapegoat
more
than
the
true
culprit
all
of
that
be
beside
the
point
we
have
to
admit
we
could
do
well
we
told
ourselves
we
must
do
well
then
we
told
the
world
just
watch
we
ll
make
our
factory
shin
example
and
we
do
in
the
ten
year
since
the
bad
headline
and
lurid
expo
s
we
ve
use
the
crisis
to
reinvent
the
entire
company
for
instance
one
of
the
bad
thing
about
a
shoe
factory
use
to
be
the
rubber
room
where
upper
and
sol
be
bond
the
fume
be
choke
toxic
cancer
cause
so
we
invent
a
water
base
bonding
agent
that
give
off
no
fume
thereby
eliminate
percent
of
the
carcinogen
in
the
air
then
we
give
this
invention
to
our
competitor
hand
it
over
to
anyone
who
want
it
they
all
do
nearly
all
of
them
now
use
it
one
of
many
many
example
we
ve
go
from
a
target
of
reformer
to
a
dominant
player
in
the
factory
reform
movement
today
the
factory
that
make
our
product
be
among
the
best
in
the
world
an
official
at
the
united
nation
recently
say
so
nike
be
the
gold
standard
by
which
we
measure
all
apparel
factory
out
of
the
sweatshop
crisis
also
come
the
girl
effect
a
massive
nike
effort
to
break
the
generational
cycle
of
poverty
in
the
bleakest
corner
of
the
world
along
with
the
united
nation
and
other
corporate
and
government
partner
the
girl
effect
be
spending
ten
of
million
of
dollar
in
a
smart
tough
global
campaign
to
educate
and
connect
and
lift
up
young
girl
economist
sociologist
not
to
mention
our
own
heart
tell
us
that
in
many
society
young
girl
be
the
most
economically
vulnerable
and
vital
demographic
so
help
them
help
all
whether
strive
to
end
child
marriage
in
ethiopia
or
building
safe
space
for
teenage
girl
in
nigeria
or
launch
a
magazine
and
radio
show
that
deliver
powerful
inspire
message
to
young
rwandan
the
girl
effect
be
change
million
of
life
and
the
best
day
of
my
week
month
year
be
those
when
i
receive
the
glow
report
from
its
front
line
i
d
do
anything
to
go
back
to
make
so
many
different
decision
which
might
or
might
not
have
avert
the
sweatshop
crisis
but
i
can
t
deny
that
the
crisis
have
lead
to
miraculous
change
inside
and
outside
nike
for
that
i
must
be
grateful
of
course
there
will
always
be
the
question
of
wage
the
salary
of
a
third
world
factory
worker
seem
impossibly
low
to
american
and
i
understand
still
we
have
to
operate
within
the
limit
and
structure
of
each
country
each
economy
we
can
t
simply
pay
whatever
we
wish
to
pay
in
one
country
which
shall
be
nameless
when
we
try
to
raise
wage
we
found
ourselves
call
on
the
carpet
summon
to
the
office
of
a
top
government
official
and
order
to
stop
we
be
disrupt
the
nation
s
entire
economic
system
he
say
it
s
simply
not
right
he
insist
or
feasible
that
a

as
fast

i
think
constantly
of
the
poverty
i
saw
while
travel
the
world
in
the
s
i
knew
then
that
the
only
answer
to
such
poverty
be
entry
level
job
lot
of
them
i
didn
t
form
this
theory
on
my
own
i
heard
it
from
every
economics
professor
i
ever
have
at
both
oregon
and
stanford
and
everything
i
saw
and
read
thereafter
back
it
up

always
always
benefit
both

i
often
heard
from
those

old
maxim

i
ve
be
know
to
call
business

without
bullet
it
s
actually
a
wonderful
bulwark
against
war

be
the
path
of
coexistence
cooperation

feed
on
prosperity
that
s
why
haunt
as
i
be
by
the
vietnam
war
i
always
vowed
that
someday
nike
would
have
a
factory
in
or
near
saigon
by
we
have
four
i
be
very
proud
and
when
i
learn
that
we
be
to
be
honor
and
celebrate
by
the
vietnamese
government
as
one
of
the
nation
s
top
five
generator
of
foreign
currency
i
felt
that
i
simply
have
to
visit
what
a
wrench
trip
i
don
t
know
if
i
d
appreciate
the
full
depth
of
my
hatred
for
the
war
in
vietnam
until
i
return
twenty
five
year
after
the
peace
until
i
join
hand
with
our
former
antagonist
at
one
point
my
host
graciously
ask
what
they
could
do
for
me
what
would
make
my
trip
special
or
memorable
i
get
a
lump
in
my
throat
i
didn
t
want
them
to
go
to
any
trouble
i
say
but
they
insist
okay
i
say
okay
i
d
like
to
meet
eighty
six
year
old
general
v
nguy
n
gi
p
the
vietnamese
macarthur
the
man
who
single
handedly
defeat
the
japanese
the
french
the
american
and
the
chinese
my
host
star
in
amaze
silence
slowly
they
rise
and
excuse
themselves
and
stood
off
in
a
corner
converse
in
frantic
vietnamese
after
five
minute
they
come
back
tomorrow
they
say
one
hour
i
bow
deeply
then
count
the
minute
until
the
big
meeting
the
first
thing
i
notice
as
general
gi
p
enter
the
room
be
his
size
this
brilliant
fighter
this
genius
tactician
who
d
organize
the
tet
offensive
who
d
plan
those
mile
and
mile
of
underground
tunnel
this
giant
of

come
up
to
my
shoulder
he
be
maybe
five
foot
four
and
humble
no
corncob
pipe
for

p
i
remember
that
he
wore
a
dark
business
suit
like
mine
i
remember
that
he
smile
as
i
do
shyly
uncertainly
but
there
be
an
intensity
about
him
i
d
see
that
kind
of
glittery
confidence
in
great
coach
and
great
business
leader
the
elite
of
the
elite
i
never
saw
it
in
a
mirror
he
knew
i
have
question
he
wait
for
me
to
ask
them
i
say
simply
how
do
you
do
it
i
thought
i
saw
the
corner
of
his
mouth
flicker
a
smile
maybe
he
thought
and
thought
i
be
he
say
a
professor
of
the
jungle
thought
of
asia
always
lead
back
to

where
on

s
former
ceo
masuro
hayami
i
get
to
know
him
well
after
nike
go
public
we
couldn
t
help
but
bond
i
be
his
most
profitable
client
and
his
most
avid
pupil
and
he
be
perhaps
the
wise
man
i
ever
knew
unlike
many
other
wise
men
he
drew
great
peace
from
his
wisdom
i
fed
off
that
peace
in
the
s
whenever
i
go
to
tokyo
hayami
would
invite
me
for
the
weekend
to
his
beach
house
near
atami
the
japanese
riviera
we
d
always
leave
tokyo
late
friday
by
rail
and
have
a
cognac
along
the
way
within
an
hour
we
d
be
at
the
izu
peninsula
where
we
d

at
some
marvelous
restaurant
for
dinner
the
next
morning
we
d
play
golf
and
saturday
night
we
d
have
a
japanese
style
barbecue
in
his
backyard
we
d
solve
all
the

problem
or
i
d
give
him
my
problem
and
he
d
solve
them
on
one
trip
we
end
the
even
in
hayami
s
hot
tub
i
recall
above
the
foam
water
the
sound
of
the
distant
ocean
slap
the
shore
i
recall
the
cool
smell
of
the
wind
through
the
tree
thousand
and
thousand
of
coastal
tree
dozen
of
specie
not
found
in
any
oregon
forest
i
recall
the
jungle
crow
caw
in
the
distance
as
we
discuss
the
infinite
then
the
finite
i
complain
about
my
business
even
after
go
public
there
be
so
many
problem
we
have
so
much
opportunity
but
we
re
have
a
terrible
time
get
manager
who
can
seize
those
opportunity
we
try
people
from
the
outside
but
they
fail
because
our
culture
be
so
different
mr
hayami
nod
see
those
bamboo
tree
up
there
he
ask
yes
next
year
when
you
come
they
will
be
one
foot
high
i
star
i
understood
when
i
return
to
oregon
i
try
hard
to
cultivate
and
grow
the
management
team
we
have
slowly
with
more
patience
with
an
eye
toward
more
training
and
more
long

planning
i
take
the
wider
longer
view
it
work
the
next
time
i
saw
hayami
i
told
him
he
merely
nod
once

take
part
in

continue
to
learn
it
s
always
a
happy
occasion
to
be
walk
a
campus
but
also
bracing
because
while
i
find
student
today
much
smarter
and
more
competent
than
in
my
time
i
also
find
them
far
more
pessimistic
occasionally
they
ask
in
dismay
where
be
the
u
s
go
where
be
the
world
go
or
where
be
the
new

future
for

about
the
devastate
japan
i

tell
them
about
the
rubble
and
ruin
that
somehow
give
birth
to
wise
men
like
hayami
and
ito
and
sumeragi
i
tell
them
about
the
untapped
resource
natural
and
human
that
the
world
have
at
its
disposal
the
abundant
way
and
mean
to
solve
its
many
crisis
all
we
have
to
do
i
tell
the
student
be
work
and
study
study
and
work
hard
as
we

put
another

out
if
my
mother
hadn
t
stop
the
podiatrist
from
surgically
remove
that
wart
and
hobble
me
for
an
entire
track
season
or
if
she
hadn
t
told
me
i
could
run
fast
or
if
she
hadn
t
bought
that
first
pair
of
limber
ups
put
my
father
in
his
place
whenever
i
go
back
to
eugene
and
walk
the
campus
i
think
of
her
whenever
i
stand
outside
hayward
field
i
think
of
the
silent
race
she
ran
i
think
of
all
the
many
race
that
each
of
us
have
run
i
lean
against
the
fence
and
look
at
the
track
and
listen
to
the
wind
think
of
bowerman
with
his
string
tie
blowing
behind
him
i
think
of
pre
god
love
him
turn
look
over
my
shoulder
my
heart
leap
across
the
street
stand
the
william
knight
law
school
a
very
serious
look
edifice
no
one
ever
jackass
around
in
there
i
can
t
sleep
i
can
t
stop
think
about
that
blast
movie
the
bucket
list
lie
in
the
dark
i
ask
myself
again
and
again
what
s
on
yours
pyramid
check
himalaya
check
ganges
check
so
nothing
i
think
about
the
few
thing
i
want
to
do
help
a
couple
of
university
change
the
world
help
find
a
cure
for
cancer
besides
that
it
s
not
so
much
thing
i
want
to
do
as
thing
i
d
like
to
say
and
maybe
unsay
it
might
be
nice
to
tell
the
story
of
nike
everyone
else
have
told
the
story
or
try
to
but
they
always
get
half
the
fact
if
that
and
none
of
the
spirit
or
vice
versa
i
might
start
the
story
or
end
it
with
regret
the
hundred
maybe
thousand
of
bad
decision
i
m
the
guy
who
say
magic
johnson
be
a
player
without
a
position
who
ll
never
make
it
in
the
nba
i
m
the
guy
who
tabbed
ryan
leaf
as
a
well
nfl
quarterback
than
peyton
man
it
s
easy
to
laugh
those
off
other
regret
go
deeper
not
phone
hiraku
iwano
after
he
quit
not
get
bo
jackson
renew
in
joe
paterno
not
be
a
good
enough
manager
to
avoid
layoff
three
time
in
ten
year
a
total
of
fifteen
hundred
people
it
still
haunt
of
course
above
all
i
regret
not
spending
more
time
with
my
son
maybe
if
i
have
i
could
ve
solve
the
encrypt
code
of
matthew
knight
and
yet
i
know
that
this
regret
clash
with
my
secret
regret
that
i
can
t
do
it
all
over
again
god
how
i
wish
i
could
relive
the
whole
thing
short
of
that
i
d
like
to
share
the
experience
the
ups
and
down
so
that
some
young
man
or
woman
somewhere
go
through
the
same
trial
and
ordeal
might
be
inspire
or
comfort
or
warn
some
young
entrepreneur
maybe
some
athlete
or
painter
or
novelist
might
press
on
it
s
all
the
same
drive
the
same
dream
it
would
be
nice
to
help
them
avoid
the
typical
discouragement
i
d
tell
them
to
hit
pause
think
long
and
hard
about
how
they
want
to
spend
their
time
and
with
whom
they
want
to
spend
it
for
the
next
forty
year
i
d
tell
men
and
woman
in
their
midtwenties
not
to
settle
for
a
job
or
a
profession
or
even
a
career
seek
a
call
even
if
you
don
t
know
what
that
mean
seek
it
if
you
re
follow
your
call
the
fatigue
will
be
easy
to
bear
the
disappointment
will
be
fuel
the
high
will
be
like
nothing
you
ve
ever
felt
i
d
like
to
warn
the
best
of
them
the
iconoclast
the
innovator
the
rebel
that
they
will
always
have
a
bull
s
eye
on
their
back
the
well
they
get
the
big
the
bull
s
eye
it
s
not
one
man
s
opinion
it
s
a
law
of
nature
i
d
like
to
remind
them
that
america
isn
t
the
entrepreneurial
shangri
la
people
think
free
enterprise
always
irritates
the
kind
of
troll
who
live
to
block
to
thwart
to
say
no
sorry
no
and
it
s
always
be
this
way
entrepreneur
have
always
be
outgunned
outnumber
they
ve
always
fought
uphill
and
the
hill
have
never
be
steeper
america
be
become
less
entrepreneurial
not
more
a
harvard
business
school
study
recently
ranked
all
the
country
of
the
world
in
term
of
their
entrepreneurial
spirit
america
ranked
behind
peru
and
those
who
urge
entrepreneur
to
never
give
up
charlatan
sometimes
you
have
to
give
up
sometimes
know
when
to
give
up
when
to
try
something
else
be
genius
give
up
doesn
t
mean
stop
don
t
ever
stop
luck
play
a
big
role
yes
i
d
like
to
publicly
acknowledge
the
power
of
luck
athlete
get
lucky
poet
get
lucky
business
get
lucky
hard
work
be
critical
a
good
team
be
essential
brain
and
determination
be
invaluable
but
luck
may
decide
the
outcome
some
people
might
not
call
it
luck
they
might
call
it
tao
or
logo
or
j
na
or
dharma
or
spirit
or
god
put
it
this
way
the
harder
you
work
the
well
your
tao
and
since
no
one
have
ever
adequately
define
tao
i
now
try
to
go
regularly
to
mass
i
would
tell
them
have
faith
in
yourself
but
also
have
faith
in
faith
not
faith
as
others
define
it
faith
as
you
define
it
faith
as
faith
defines
itself
in
your
heart
in
what
format
do
i
want
to
say
all
this
a
memoir
no
not
a
memoir
i
can
t
imagine
how
it
could
all
fit
into
one
unified
narrative
maybe
a
novel
or
a
speech
or
a
series
of
speech
maybe
just
a
letter
to
my
grandkids
i
peer
into
the
dark
so
maybe
there
be
something
on
my
bucket
list
after
all
another
crazy
idea
suddenly
my
mind
be
race
people
i
need
to
call
thing
i
need
to
read
i
ll
have
to
get
in
touch
with
woodell
i
should
see
if
we
have
any
copy
of
those
letter
from
johnson
there
be
so
many
somewhere
in
my
parent
house
where
my
sister
joanne
still
life
there
must
be
a
box
with
my
slide
from
my
trip
around
the
world
so
much
to
do
so
much
to
learn
so
much
i
don
t
know
about
my
own
life
now
i
really
can
t
sleep
i
get
up
grab
a
yellow
legal
pad
from
my
desk
i
go
to
the
living
room
and
sit
in
my
recliner
a
feel
of
stillness
of
immense
peace
come
over
me
i
squint
at
the
moon
shin
outside
my
window
the
same
moon
that
inspire
the
ancient
zen
master
to
worry
about
nothing
in
the
timeless
clarify
light
of
that
moon
i
begin
to
make
a
list
