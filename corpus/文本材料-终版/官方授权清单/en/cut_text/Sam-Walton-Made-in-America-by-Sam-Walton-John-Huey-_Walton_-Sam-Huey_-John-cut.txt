my
story

learn
to
value
a
dollar
i
be
awake
one
night
and
turn
on
my
radio
and
i
heard
them
announce
that
sam
walton
be
the
richest
man
in
america
and
i
thought
sam
walton
why
he
be
in
my
class
and
i
get
so
excite
helen
williams
former
history
and
speech
teacher
at
hickman
high
school
in
columbia
missouri
success
have
always
have
its
price
i
guess
and
i
learn
that
lesson
the
hard
way
in
october
of
when
forbes
magazine
name
me
the
so
call
richest
man
in
america
well
it
be
not
too
hard
to
imagine
all
those
newspaper
and
tv
folk
up
in
new
york
say
who
and
he
life
where
the
next
thing
we
knew
reporter
and
photographer
start
flock
down
here
to
bentonville
i
guess
to
take
picture
of
me
dive
into
some
swim
pool
full
of
money
they
imagine
i
have
or
to
watch
me
light
big
fat
cigar
with
bill
while
the
hootchy
kootchy
girl
dance
by
the
lake
i
really
do
not
know
what
they
thought
but
i
be
not
about
to
cooperate
with
them
so
they
found
out
all
these
excite
thing
about
me
like
i
drove
an
old
pickup
truck
with
cage
in
the
back
for
my
bird
dog
or
i
wore
a
wal
mart
ball
cap
or
i
get
my
hair
cut
at
the
barbershop
just
off
the
town
square
somebody
with
a
telephoto
lens
even
snuck
up
and
take
a
picture
of
me
in
the
barber
chair
and
it
be
in
newspaper
all
over
the
country
then
folk
we
would
never
heard
of
start
call
us
and
write
us
from
all
over
the
world
and
come
here
to
ask
us
for
money
many
of
them
represent
worthy
cause
i
be
sure
but
we
also
heard
from
just
about
every
harebrained
cockamamy
schemer
in
the
world
i
remember
one
letter
from
a
woman
who
just
come
right
out
and
say
i
have
never
be
able
to
afford
the
house
i
have
always
want
will
you
give
me
the
money
they
still
do
it
to
this
day
write
or
call
ask
for
a
new
car
or
money
to
go
on
a
vacation
or
to
get
some
dental
work
whatever
come
into
their
mind
now
i
be
a
friendly
fellow
by
nature
i
always
speak
to
folk
in
the
street
and
such
and
my
wife
helen
be
as
genial
and
outgo
as
she
can
be
involve
in
all
sort
of
community
activity
and
we
have
always
live
very
much
out
in
the
open
but
we
really
thought
there
for
a
while
that
this
richest
thing
be
go
to
ruin
our
whole
lifestyle
we
have
always
try
to
do
our
share
but
all
of
a
sudden
everybody
expect
us
to
pay
their
way
too
and
nosy
people
from
the
medium
would
call
our
house
at
all
hour
and
get
downright
rude
when
we
would
tell
them
no
you
ca
not
bring
a
tv
crew
out
to
the
house
or
no
we
do
not
want
your
magazine
to
spend
a
week
photograph
the
life
of
the
walton
or
no
i
do
not
have
time
to
share
my
life
story
with
you
it
make
me
mad
anyway
that
all
they
want
to
talk
about
be
my
family
personal
finance
they
be
not
even
interested
in
wal
mart
which
be
probably
one
of
the
best
business
story
go
on
anywhere
in
the
world
at
the
time
but
it
never
even
occur
to
them
to
ask
about
the
company
the
impression
i
get
be
that
most
medium
folk
and
some
wall
street
type
too
either
thought
we
be
just
a
bunch
of
bumpkin
sell
sock
off
the
back
of
a
truck
or
that
we
be
some
kind
of
fast
buck
artist
or
stock
scammer
and
when
they
do
write
about
the
company
they
either
get
it
wrong
or
just
make
fun
of
us
so
the
walton
family
almost
instinctively
put
a
pretty
tight
lid
on
personal
publicity
for
any
of
us
although
we
kept
living
out
in
the
open
and
go
around
visit
folk
in
the
store
all
the
time
fortunately
here
in
bentonville
our
friend
and
neighbor
protect
us
from
a
lot
of
these
scavenger
but
i
do
get
ambush
by
the
lifestyle
of
the
rich
and
famous
guy
at
a
tennis
tournament
i
be
play
in
and
helen
talk
to
one
of
the
woman
magazine
for
an
article
the
medium
usually
portrayed
me
as
a
really
cheap
eccentric
recluse
sort
of
a
hillbilly
who
more
or
less
slept
with
his
dog
in
spite
of
have
billion
of
dollar
stash
away
in
a
cave
then
when
the
stock
market
crashed
in
and
wal
mart
stock
drop
along
with
everything
else
in
the
market
everybody
write
that
i
would
lose
a
half
billion
dollar
when
they
ask
me
about
it
i
say
it
be
only
paper
and
they
have
a
good
time
with
that
but
now
i
would
like
to
explain
some
of
my
attitude
about
money
up
to
a
point
after
that
our
finance
like
those
of
any
other
normal
think
american
family
be
nobody
business
but
our
own
no
question
about
it
a
lot
of
my
attitude
toward
money
stem
from
grow
up
during
a
pretty
hardscrabble
time
in
our
country
history
the
great
depression
and
this
heartland
area
we
come
from
out
here
missouri
oklahoma
kansa
arkansas
be
hard
hit
during
that
dust
bowl
era
i
be
born
in
kingfisher
oklahoma
in
and
live
there
until
i
be
about
five
but
my
early
memory
be
of
springfield
missouri
where
i
start
school
and
later
of
the
little
missouri
town
of
marshall
after
that
we
live
in
shelbina
missouri
where
i
start
high
school
and
still
later
columbia
where
i
finish
high
school
and
go
on
to
college
my
dad
thomas
gibson
walton
be
an
awfully
hard
worker
who
get
up
early
put
in
long
hour
and
be
honest
completely
totally
honest
remember
by
most
people
for
his
integrity
he
be
also
a
bit
of
a
character
who
love
to
trade
love
to
make
a
deal
for
just
about
anything
horse
mule
cattle
house
farm
car
anything
once
he
trade
our
farm
in
kingfisher
for
another
one
near
omega
oklahoma
another
time
he
trade
his
wristwatch
for
a
hog
so
we
would
have
meat
on
the
table
and
he
be
the
best
negotiator
i
ever
ran
into
my
dad
have
that
unusual
instinct
to
know
how
far
he
could
go
with
someone
and
do
it
in
a
way
that
he
and
the
guy
always
part
friend
but
he
would
embarrass
me
with
some
of
the
offer
he
would
make
they
be
so
low
that
be
one
reason
i
be
probably
not
the
best
negotiator
in
the
world
i
lack
the
ability
to
squeeze
that
last
dollar
fortunately
my
brother
bud
who
have
be
my
partner
from
early
on
inherit
my
dad
ability
to
negotiate
dad
never
have
the
kind
of
ambition
or
confidence
to
build
much
of
a
business
on
his
own
and
he
do
not
believe
in
take
on
debt
when
i
be
grow
up
he
have
all
sort
of
job
he
be
a
banker
and
a
farmer
and
a
farm
loan
appraiser
and
an
agent
for
both
insurance
and
real
estate
for
a
few
month
early
in
the
depression
he
be
out
of
work
altogether
and
eventually
he
go
to
work
for
his
brother
walton
mortgage
co
which
be
an
agent
for
metropolitan
life
insurance
dad
become
the
guy
who
have
to
service
metropolitan
old
farm
loan
most
of
which
be
in
default
in
twenty
nine
and
thirty
and
thirty
one
he
have
to
repossess
hundred
of
farm
from
wonderful
people
whose
family
have
own
the
land
forever
i
travel
with
him
some
and
it
be
tragic
and
really
hard
on
dad
too
but
he
try
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
left
those
farmer
with
as
much
of
their
self
respect
as
he
could
all
of
this
must
have
make
an
impression
on
me
as
a
kid
although
i
do
not
ever
remember
say
anything
to
myself
like
i
will
never
be
poor
we
never
thought
of
ourselves
as
poor
although
we
certainly
do
not
have
much
of
what
you
would
call
disposable
income
lie
around
and
we
do
what
we
could
to
raise
a
dollar
here
and
there
for
example
my
mother
nan
walton
get
the
idea
during
the
depression
to
start
a
little
milk
business
i
would
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
milk
the
cow
mother
would
prepare
and
bottle
the
milk
and
i
would
deliver
it
after
football
practice
in
the
afternoon
we
have
ten
or
twelve
customer
who
paid
ten
cent
a
gallon
best
of
all
mother
would
skim
the
cream
and
make
ice
cream
and
it
be
a
wonder
i
be
not
know
as
fat
sam
walton
in
those
day
from
all
the
ice
cream
i
ate
i
also
start
sell
magazine
subscription
probably
as
young
as
seven
or
eight
year
old
and
i
have
paper
route
from
the
seventh
grade
all
the
way
through
college
i
raise
and
sell
rabbit
and
pigeon
too
nothing
really
unusual
for
country
boy
of
that
era
i
learn
from
a
very
early
age
that
it
be
important
for
us
kid
to
help
provide
for
the
home
to
be
contributor
rather
than
just
taker
in
the
process
of
course
we
learn
how
much
hard
work
it
take
to
get
your
hand
on
a
dollar
and
that
when
you
do
it
be
worth
something
one
thing
my
mother
and
dad
share
completely
be
their
approach
to
money
they
just
do
not
spend
it
bud
walton
people
ca
not
understand
why
we
be
still
so
conservative
they
make
a
big
deal
about
sam
be
a
billionaire
and
drive
an
old
pickup
truck
or
buying
his
clothes
at
wal
mart
or
refuse
to
fly
first
class
it
be
just
the
way
we
be
brought
up
when
a
penny
be
lie
out
there
on
the
street
how
many
people
would
go
out
there
and
pick
it
up
i
will
bet
i
would
and
i
know
sam
would
stephen
pumphrey
photographer
once
i
be
set
up
to
photograph
sam
out
on
the
tarmac
of
some
little
airport
in
missouri
he
be
over
filing
a
flight
plan
and
i
threw
a
nickel
down
on
the
pavement
try
to
be
cute
and
say
to
my
assistant
let
see
if
he
pick
it
up
plane
be
land
and
take
off
and
sam
come
walk
over
in
a
big
hurry
a
little
put
out
that
he
have
to
pose
for
another
picture
okay
he
say
where
do
you
want
me
to
stand
on
that
nickel
by
the
time
i
get
out
in
the
world
ready
to
make
something
of
myself
i
already
have
a
strongly
ingrain
respect
for
the
value
of
a
dollar
but
my
knowledge
about
money
and
finance
probably
be
not
all
that
sophisticated
in
spite
of
the
business
degree
i
have
then
i
get
to
know
helen
family
and
listen
to
her
father
l
s
robson
be
an
education
in
itself
he
influence
me
a
great
deal
he
be
a
great
salesman
one
of
the
most
persuasive
individual
i
have
ever
met
and
i
be
sure
his
success
as
a
trader
and
a
businessman
his
knowledge
of
finance
and
the
law
and
his
philosophy
have
a
big
effect
on
me
my
competitive
nature
be
such
that
i
saw
his
success
and
admire
it
i
do
not
envy
it
i
admire
it
i
say
to
myself
maybe
i
will
be
as
successful
as
he
be
someday
the
robsons
be
very
smart
about
the
way
they
handle
their
finance
helen
father
organize
his
ranch
and
family
business
as
a
partnership
and
helen
and
her
brother
be
all
partner
they
all
take
turn
do
the
ranch
book
and
thing
like
that
helen
have
a
b
s
degree
in
finance
which
back
then
be
really
unusual
for
a
woman
anyway
mr
robson
advise
us
to
do
the
same
thing
with
our
family
and
we
do
way
back
in
what
little
we
have
at
the
time
we
put
into
a
partnership
with
our
kid
which
be
later
incorporate
into
walton
enterprise
over
the
year
our
wal
mart
stock
have
go
into
that
partnership
then
the
board
of
walton
enterprise
which
be
us
the
family
make
decision
on
a
consensus
basis
sometimes
we
argue
and
sometimes
we
do
not
but
we
control
the
amount
we
pay
out
to
each
of
us
and
everybody
get
the
same
the
kid
get
as
much
over
the
year
as
helen
and
i
do
except
i
get
a
salary
which
my
son
jim
now
draw
as
head
of
walton
enterprise
that
way
we
accumulate
fund
in
enterprise
rather
than
throw
it
all
over
the
place
to
live
high
and
we
certainly
drew
all
we
need
probably
more
in
my
opinion
the
partnership
work
in
a
number
of
different
way
first
it
enables
us
to
control
wal
mart
through
the
family
and
keep
it
together
rather
than
have
it
sell
off
in
piece
haphazardly
we
still
own
percent
of
the
company
stock
today
which
be
an
unusually
large
stake
for
anyone
to
hold
in
an
outfit
the
size
of
wal
mart
and
that
be
the
best
protection
there
be
against
the
takeover
raider
it
be
something
that
any
family
who
have
faith
in
its
strength
as
a
unit
and
in
the
growth
potential
of
its
business
can
do
the
transfer
of
ownership
be
make
so
long
ago
that
we
do
not
have
to
pay
substantial
gift
or
inheritance
tax
on
it
the
principle
behind
this
be
simple
the
best
way
to
reduce
pay
estate
tax
be
to
give
your
asset
away
before
they
appreciate
it
turn
out
to
be
a
great
philosophy
and
a
great
strategy
and
i
certainly
would
not
have
figure
it
out
way
back
then
without
the
advice
of
helen
father
it
be
not
lavish
or
exorbitant
and
that
be
part
of
the
plan
to
keep
the
family
together
as
well
as
maintain
a
sense
of
balance
in
our
standard
helen
walton
it
be
great
moneywise
but
there
be
another
aspect
to
it
the
relationship
that
be
establish
among
the
child
and
with
the
family
it
developed
their
sense
of
responsibility
toward
one
another
you
just
ca
not
beat
that
so
along
come
forbes
in
and
say
i
be
the
richest
man
in
america
well
there
be
no
question
that
if
you
multiply
the
wal
mart
stock
price
by
how
much
we
own
then
maybe
we
be
worth
or
billion
or
whatever
they
say
the
family
may
have
those
kind
of
asset
but
i
have
never
see
that
myself
for
one
thing
helen
and
i
only
own
percent
of
our
family
total
interest
in
wal
mart
for
another
as
long
as
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
and
i
be
confident
this
attitude
will
last
at
least
another
generation
most
of
that
wal
mart
stock
be
stay
right
where
it
be
we
do
not
need
the
money
we
do
not
need
to
buy
a
yacht
and
thank
goodness
we
never
thought
we
have
to
go
out
and
buy
anything
like
an
island
we
just
do
not
have
those
kind
of
need
or
ambition
which
wreck
a
lot
of
company
when
they
get
along
in
year
some
family
sell
their
stock
off
a
little
at
a
time
to
live
high
and
then
boom
somebody
take
them
over
and
it
all
go
down
the
drain
one
of
the
real
reason
i
be
write
this
book
be
so
my
grandchild
and
great
grandchild
will
read
it
year
from
now
and
know
this
if
you
start
any
of
that
foolishness
i
will
come
back
and
haunt
you
so
do
not
even
think
about
it
not
that
i
be
try
to
poor
mouth
here
we
certainly
have
have
more
than
adequate
fund
in
this
family
for
a
long
time
even
before
we
get
wal
mart
cranked
up
here
be
the
thing
money
never
have
meant
that
much
to
me
not
even
in
the
sense
of
keep
score
if
we
have
enough
grocery
and
a
nice
place
to
live
plenty
of
room
to
keep
and
feed
my
bird
dog
a
place
to
hunt
a
place
to
play
tennis
and
the
mean
to
get
the
kid
good
education
that
be
rich
no
question
about
it
and
we
have
it
we
be
not
crazy
we
do
not
live
like
pauper
the
way
some
people
depict
us
we
all
love
to
fly
and
we
have
nice
airplane
but
i
have
own
about
eighteen
airplane
over
the
year
and
i
never
bought
one
of
them
new
we
have
our
family
meeting
at
fine
place
like
the
ritz
carlton
in
naples
florida
or
the
del
coronado
in
san
diego
this
house
we
live
in
be
design
by
e
fay
jones
who
life
down
the
road
in
fayetteville
and
be
a
world
famous
disciple
of
frank
lloyd
wright
and
even
though
i
think
it
cost
too
much
i
have
to
admit
that
it
be
beautiful
but
in
a
real
simple
natural
kind
of
way
we
be
not
ashamed
of
have
money
but
i
just
do
not
believe
a
big
showy
lifestyle
be
appropriate
for
anywhere
least
of
all
here
in
bentonville
where
folk
work
hard
for
their
money
and
where
we
all
know
that
everyone
put
on
their
trouser
one
leg
at
a
time
i
be
not
sure
i
ever
really
figure
out
this
celebrity
business
why
in
the
world
for
example
would
i
get
an
invitation
to
elizabeth
taylor
wedding
out
in
hollywood
i
still
ca
not
believe
it
be
news
that
i
get
my
hair
cut
at
the
barbershop
where
else
would
i
get
it
cut
why
do
i
drive
a
pickup
truck
what
be
i
suppose
to
haul
my
dog
around
in
a
roll
royce
nowadays
i
be
willing
to
concede
that
some
good
may
have
come
from
that
magazine
article
and
all
the
hubbub
it
create
as
much
as
i
hat
it
for
year
at
first
i
thought
it
be
go
to
be
bad
for
my
relationship
with
the
associate
in
the
store
but
i
found
out
that
gosh
they
almost
look
at
it
like
look
we
help
him
get
there
good
for
him
i
think
my
come
by
to
visit
the
store
somehow
mean
more
to
them
now
i
notice
a
big
difference
in
their
reaction
since
that
list
make
me
into
sort
of
a
public
figure
and
of
course
our
customer
seem
to
get
a
kick
out
of
it
too
ask
me
to
autograph
dollar
bill
and
other
stuff
charlie
baum
early
wal
mart
partner
i
have
know
sam
since
his
first
store
in
newport
arkansas
and
i
believe
that
money
be
in
some
respect
almost
immaterial
to
him
what
motivates
the
man
be
the
desire
to
absolutely
be
on
top
of
the
heap
it
be
not
money
money
drive
him
crazy
now
his
question
to
me
at
a
m
not
long
ago
be
how
do
you
inspire
a
grandchild
to
go
to
work
if
they
know
they
will
never
have
a
poor
day
in
their
life
david
glass
ceo
wal
mart
do
sam
have
money
i
have
be
travel
with
him
for
thirty
year
and
you
could
never
tell
it
by
me
in
fact
if
i
do
not
read
the
proxy
statement
every
year
i
would
swear
he
be
broke
i
remember
one
time
we
be
fly
out
of
new
york
on
a
commercial
flight
go
to
see
our
friend
at
the
limited
in
columbus
ohio
and
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
airport
sam
sort
of
look
startle
and
say
david
i
do
not
have
any
money
with
me
do
you
i
reach
in
my
wallet
and
pull
out
two
twenty
he
look
at
them
and
say
you
wo
not
need
both
of
those
let
me
borrow
one
now
when
it
come
to
wal
mart
there
be
no
two
way
about
it
i
be
cheap
i
think
it
be
a
real
statement
that
wal
mart
never
bought
a
jet
until
after
we
be
approach
billion
in
sale
and
expand
as
far
away
as
california
and
maine
and
even
then
they
have
to
practically
tie
me
up
and
hold
me
down
to
do
it
on
the
road
we
sleep
two
to
a
room
although
as
i
have
gotten
old
i
have
finally
start
stay
in
my
own
room
we
stay
in
holiday
inn
and
ramada
inn
and
day
inn
and
we
eat
a
lot
at
family
restaurant
when
we
have
time
to
eat
a
lot
of
what
go
on
these
day
with
high
fly
company
and
these
overpaid
ceo
who
be
really
just
loot
from
the
top
and
be
not
watch
out
for
anybody
but
themselves
really
upset
me
it
be
one
of
the
main
thing
wrong
with
american
business
today
gary
reinboth
early
store
manager
wal
mart
in
those
day
we
would
go
on
these
buying
trip
with
sam
and
we
would
all
stay
as
much
as
we
could
in
one
room
or
two
i
remember
one
time
in
chicago
when
we
stayed
eight
of
us
to
a
room
and
the
room
be
not
very
big
to
begin
with
you
might
say
we
be
on
a
pretty
restrict
budget
but
sometimes
i
be
ask
why
today
when
wal
mart
have
be
so
successful
when
we
be
a
billion
plus
company
should
we
stay
so
cheap
that
be
simple
because
we
believe
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
we
exist
to
provide
value
to
our
customer
which
mean
that
in
addition
to
quality
and
service
we
have
to
save
them
money
every
time
wal
mart
spends
one
dollar
foolishly
it
come
right
out
of
our
customer
pocket
every
time
we
save
them
a
dollar
that
put
us
one
more
step
ahead
of
the
competition
which
be
where
we
always
plan
to
be

start
on
a
dime
from
the
time
we
be
kid
sam
could
excel
at
anything
he
set
his
mind
to
i
guess
it
be
just
the
way
he
be
born
back
when
he
carry
newspaper
they
have
a
contest
i
have
forgotten
what
the
prize
be
maybe
who
know
he
won
that
contest
go
out
sell
new
subscription
door
to
door
and
he
knew
he
be
go
to
win
it
be
just
the
makeup
of
the
man
my
only
explanation
be
that
sam
have
a
lot
of
our
mother
characteristic
bud
walton
i
do
not
know
what
cause
a
person
to
be
ambitious
but
it
be
a
fact
that
i
have
be
overblessed
with
drive
and
ambition
from
the
time
i
hit
the
ground
and
i
expect
my
brother
probably
right
our
mother
be
extremely
ambitious
for
her
kid
she
read
a
lot
and
love
education
although
she
do
not
have
too
much
herself
she
go
to
college
for
a
year
before
she
quit
to
get
married
and
maybe
to
compensate
for
that
she
just
ordain
from
the
begin
that
i
would
go
to
college
and
make
something
of
myself
one
of
the
great
sadness
in
my
life
be
that
she
die
young
of
cancer
just
as
we
be
begin
to
do
well
in
business
mother
must
have
be
a
pretty
special
motivator
because
i
take
her
seriously
when
she
told
me
i
should
always
try
to
be
the
best
i
could
at
whatever
i
take
on
so
i
have
always
pursue
everything
i
be
interested
in
with
a
true
passion
some
would
say
obsession
to
win
i
have
always
held
the
bar
pretty
high
for
myself
i
have
set
extremely
high
personal
goal
even
when
i
be
a
little
kid
in
marshall
missouri
i
remember
be
ambitious
i
be
a
class
officer
several
year
i
played
football
and
baseball
and
basketball
with
the
other
kid
and
i
swam
in
the
summer
i
be
so
competitive
that
when
i
start
boy
scout
in
marshall
i
make
a
bet
with
the
other
guy
about
which
one
of
us
would
be
the
first
to
reach
the
rank
of
eagle
before
i
make
eagle
in
marshall
we
have
move
to
the
little
town
of
shelbina
missouri
population
maybe
but
i
won
the
bet
i
get
my
eagle
at
age
thirteen
the
young
eagle
scout
in
the
history
of
the
state
of
missouri
at
that
time
from
the
shelbina
democrat
summer
because
of
his
training
in
boy

newspaper
tend
to
exaggerate
these
thing
but
at
least
i
get
him
out
of
the
water
look
back
on
such
boyhood
episode
help
me
to
realize
now
that
i
have
always
have
a
strong
bias
toward
action
a
trait
that
have
be
a
big
part
of
the
wal
mart
story
truthfully
though
talk
about
this
embarrasses
me
a
good
bit
because
i
worry
that
it
seem
like
i
be
bragging
or
try
to
make
myself
out
to
be
some
big
hero
it
particularly
bother
me
because
i
learn
a
long
time
ago
that
exercise
your
ego
in
public
be
definitely
not
the
way
to
build
an
effective
organization
one
person
seek
glory
do
not
accomplish
much
at
wal
mart
everything
we
have
do
have
be
the
result
of
people
pull
together
to
meet
one
common
goal
teamwork
something
i
also
picked
up
at
an
early
age
team
play
begin
for
me
when
i
be
in
the
fifth
grade
and
a
friend
of
mine
dad
organize
a
bunch
of
us
into
a
peewee
football
team
we
compete
against
other
town
like
odessa
and
sedalia
and
richmond
i
played
end
but
i
want
to
throw
the
ball
or
be
a
run
back
even
though
i
be
a
little
guy
and
could
not
squeeze
my
way
in
yet
team
athletics
remain
a
big
part
of
my
life
all
through
high
school
and
at
the
intramural
level
in
college
too
by
the
time
we
move
to
shelbina
i
have
more
football
experience
than
most
of
the
other
kid
in
the
ninth
grade
so
i
be
able
to
make
the
team
as
a
second
string
quarterback
i
be
still
small
only
about
pound
but
i
knew
a
lot
about
block
and
tackle
and
throw
the
ball
and
by
be
extremely
competitive
i
get
my
letter
then
we
move
on
again
this
time
to
columbia
missouri
there
at
hickman
high
school
i
get
involve
in
just
about
everything
i
be
not
what
you
would
call
a
gift
student
but
i
work
really
hard
and
make
the
honor
roll
i
be
president
of
the
student
body
and
active
in
a
lot
of
club
i
remember
the
speech
club
in
particular
and
i
be
vote
most
versatile
boy
i
be
really
a
gym
rat
i
love
hang
around
that
gym
play
basketball
but
i
do
not
go
out
for
the
team
maybe
because
i
be
only
five
nine
when
i
be
a
senior
though
they
draft
me
for
the
team
and
i
become
a
guard
sometimes
a
starter
i
be
not
a
great
shot
but
i
be
a
pretty
good
ball
handler
and
a
real
good
floor
leader
i
like
run
the
team
i
guess
we
go
undefeated
and
in
one
of
my
big
thrill
won
the
state
championship
my
high
school
athletic
experience
be
really
unbelievable
because
i
be
also
the
quarterback
on
the
football
team
which
go
undefeated
too
and
won
the
state
championship
as
well
i
do
not
throw
particularly
well
but
we
be
mostly
a
run
team
and
i
be
fairly
slow
for
a
back
but
i
be
shifty
sometimes
so
shifty
that
i
would
fall
down
with
a
bunch
of
daylight
in
front
of
me
on
defense
my
favorite
thing
be
when
the
coach
would
slip
me
in
and
let
me
play
linebacker
i
have
a
good
sense
for
where
the
ball
be
go
to
go
and
i
really
love
to
hit
i
guess
i
be
just
totally
competitive
as
an
athlete
and
my
main
talent
be
probably
the
same
as
my
best
talent
as
a
retailer
i
be
a
good
motivator
this
be
hard
to
believe
but
it
be
true
in
my
whole
life
i
never
played
in
a
lose
football
game
i
certainly
ca
not
take
much
of
the
credit
for
that
and
in
fact
there
be
definitely
some
luck
involve
i
be
sick
or
injured
for
a
couple
of
game
that
we
would
not
have
won
with
or
without
me
so
i
dodge
the
bullet
on
a
few
loss
that
i
could
have
played
in
but
i
think
that
record
have
an
important
effect
on
me
it
taught
me
to
expect
to
win
to
go
into
tough
challenge
always
planning
to
come
out
victorious
later
on
in
life
i
think
kmart
or
whatever
competition
we
be
face
just
become
jeff
city
high
school
the
team
we
played
for
the
state
championship
in
it
never
occur
to
me
that
i
might
lose
to
me
it
be
almost
as
if
i
have
a
right
to
win
think
like
that
often
seem
to
turn
into
sort
of
a
self
fulfil
prophecy
have
be
the
quarterback
for
the
hickman
kewpies
the
undefeated
state
champion
i
be
already
pretty
well
know
around
columbia
where
the
university
of
missouri
be
locate
so
my
high
school
career
just
merge
right
on
into
college
most
of
the
fraternity
be
really
for
the
more
well
to
do
kid
and
i
ordinarily
would
not
have
qualify
for
membership
but
they
rush
me
even
as
a
town
boy
and
i
have
my
pick
of
the
best
i
chose
beta
theta
pi
because
they
be
the
top
scholastic
fraternity
and
have
lead
the
intramural
athletic
league
for
a
number
of
year
when
i
be
a
sophomore
the
beta
make
me
rush
captain
so
i
bought
a
real
old
ford
and
i
travel
the
whole
state

summer
interview
potential
beta
candidate
with
all
this
competitive
spirit
and
ambition
i
have
back

even
entertain
thought
of
one
day
become
president
of
the
united
state
closer
at
hand
i
have
decide

i
do
that
in
college
i
do
it
when
i

the
person
come
toward
me
if
i
knew
them
i
would
call
them

but
even
if
i
do
not
i
would
still
speak
to
them
before
long
i
probably
knew
more
student
than
anybody
in
the
university
and
they
recognize
me
and
consider
me
their

as
i
ever

i
have
always
have

of
energy

would
have
be
glad
to

if
they

have
but
it
be
the
depression
and
they
have
no
extra
money
at
all
i
have
continued
to
throw
a
newspaper
route
all
through
high
school
and
in
college
i
add
a
few
more
route
hire
a
few
helper
and
turn
it
into
a
pretty
good
business
i
make
about
to
a
year
which
at
the
end
of
the
depression
be
fairly
serious
money
ezra
entrekin
former
circulation
manager
of
the
columbia
missourian
we
hire
sam
to
deliver
newspaper
and
he
really
become
our
chief
salesman
when
school
start
we
have
a
drive
to
get
the
kid
in
the
fraternity
and
sorority
to
subscribe
and
sam
be
the
boy
we
have
do
that
because
he
could
sell
more
than
anybody
else
he
be
good
he

really
good
and
dedicate
and
he

a
lot
of
other
thing
besides
deliver
newspaper
in
fact
he
be
a
little
bit
scatterbrained
at
time
he
would
have
so
many
thing
go
he
would
almost
forget
one
but
boy
when
he
focus
on
something
that
be
it
in
addition
to
the
newspaper
i
wait
table
in
exchange
for
meal
and
i
be
also
the
head
lifeguard
in
charge
of
the
swim
pool
you
can
see
that
i
be
a
pretty
busy
fellow
and
you
can
see
why
my
notorious
respect
for
the
value
of
a
dollar
continued
but
now
that
i
be
about
to
become
a
college
graduate
i
be
ready
to
give
up
this
routine
really
eager
to
get
out
in
the
world
and
make
something
of
myself
in
a
real
job
my
first
exposure
to
the
possibility
of
retail
have
come
in
when
our
family
happen
to
move
next
door
to
a
guy
name
hugh
mattingly
he
have
be
a
barber
in
odessa
missouri
before
he
and
his
brother
start
a
variety
store
chain
which
have
grown
to
around
sixty
store
by
that
time
i
would
talk
with
him
about
merchandising
how
to
do
it
and
how
well
it
be
work
out
for
him
he
take
an
interest
in
me
and
later
even
offer
me
a
job
but
i
never
seriously
consider
retail
in
those
day
in
fact
i
be
sure
i
be
go
to
be
an
insurance
salesman
i
have
a
high
school
girlfriend
whose
father
be
a
very
successful
salesman
for
general
american
life
insurance
company
and
i
have
talk
to
him
about
his
business
it
appear
to
me
that
he
be
make
all
the
money
in
the
world
insurance
seem
like
a
natural
for
me
because
i
thought
i
could
sell
i
have
always
sell
thing
as
a
little
kid
i
sell
liberty
magazine
for
a
nickel
and
then
switch
to
woman
home
companion
when
it
come
along
for
a
dime
figure
i
could
make
twice
as
much
money
the
girl
and
i
broke
up
but
i
still
have
big
plan
i
figure
i
would
get
my
degree
and
go
on
to
the
wharton
school
of
finance
in
pennsylvania
but
as
college
wound
down
i
realize
that
even
if
i
kept
up
the
same
kind
of
work
routine
i
would
have
all
through
college
i
still
would
not
have
the
money
to
go
to
wharton
so
i
decide
to
cash
in
what
chip
i
already
have
and
i
visit
with
two
company
recruiter
who
have
come

accepted
the

from
jc
penney
i
turn
down
the

from
sears
roebuck
now
i
realize
the
simple
truth
i
get
into
retailing
because
i
be
tire
and
i
want
a
real
job

begin
work
as
a
management
trainee
salary
a
month
that
be
the

except
for
a
little
time
out
as
an
army
officer
that
be
where
i
have
stayed
for
the
last
fifty
two
year
maybe
i
be
born
to
be
a
merchant
maybe
it
be
fate
i
do
not
know
about
that
kind
of
stuff
but
i
know
this
for
sure
i
love
retail
from
the
very
begin
and
i
still
love
it
today
not
that
it
go
all
that
smooth
right
off
the
bat
like
i
say
i
could
sell
and
i
love
that
part
unfortunately
i
never
learn
handwrite
all
that
well
helen
say
there
be
only
about
five
people
in
the
world
who
can
read
my
chicken
scratch
she
be
not
one
of
them
and
this
begin
to
cause
some
problem
for
me
at
my
new
job
penney
have
a
fellow
out
of
new
york
name
blake
who
travel
around
the
country
audit
store
and
evaluate
personnel
and
whatnot
and
he
would
come
to
see
us
pretty
regularly
i
remember
him
as
a
big
fellow
over
six
foot
who
always
dress
to
the
nine
you
know
penney
best
suit
and
shirt
and
tie
anyway
he
would
get
all
upset
at
the
way
i
would
screw
up
the
sale
slip
and
generally
mishandle
the
cash
register
part
of
thing
i
could
not
stand
to
leave
a
new
customer
wait
while
i
fiddle
with
paperwork
on
a
sale
i
would
already
make
and
i
have
to
admit
it
do
create
some
confusion
walton
blake
would
say
to
me
when
he
come
to
de
moines
i
would
fire
you
if
you
be
not
such
a
good
salesman
maybe
you
be
just
not
cut
out
for
retail
fortunately
i
found
a
champion
in
my
store
manager
duncan
major
a
great
motivator
who
be
proudest
of
have
train
more
penney
manager
than
anybody
else
in
the
country
he
have
his
own
technique
and
be
a
very
successful
manager
his
secret
be
that
he
work
us
from
six
thirty
in
the
morning
until
seven
or
eight
o
clock
at
night
all
of
us
want
to
become
manager
like
him
on
sunday
when
we
be
not
work
we
would
go
out
to
his
house
there
be
about
eight
of
us
all
men
and
we
would
talk
about
retailing
of
course
but
we
also
played
ping
pong
or
card
it
be
a
seven
day
job
i
remember
one
sunday
duncan
major
have
just
gotten
his
annual
bonus
check
from
penney
and
be
wave
it
around
all
over
the
place
it
be
for
which
impressed
the
heck
out
of
us
boy
watch
this
guy
be
what
get
me
excite
about
retail
he
be
really
good
then
of
course
the
ice
on
the
cake
be
when
james
cash
penney
himself
visit
the
store
one
day
he
do
not
get
around
to
his
store
as
often
as
i
would
later
on
but
he
do
get
around
i
still
remember
him
show
me
how
to
tie
and
package
merchandise
how
to
wrap
it
with
very
little
twine
and
very
little
paper
but
still
make
it
look
nice
i
work
for
penney
about
eighteen
month
and
they
really
be
the
cadillac
of
the
industry
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
but
even
back
then
i
be
check
out
the
competition
the
intersection
where
i
work
in
de
moines
have
three
store
so
at
lunch
i
would
always
go
wander
around
the
sears
and
the
yonkers
store
to
see
what
they
be
up
to
by
early
though
the
war
be
on
and
as
an
rotc
graduate
i
be
gung
ho
to
go
ready
to
ship
out
overseas
and
see
my
share
of
the
action
but
the
army
have
a
big
surprise
for
me
because
of
a
minor
heart
irregularity
i
flunk
the
physical
for
combat
duty
and
be
classify
for
limited
duty
this
kind
of
get
me
down
in
the
dump
and
since
i
be
just
wait
around
to
be
call
up
anyway
i
quit
my
penney
job
and
wander
south
toward
tulsa
with
some
vague
idea
of
see
what
the
oil
business
be
like
instead
i
get
a
job
at
a
big
du
pont
gunpowder
plant
in
the
town
of
pryor
outside
tulsa
the
only
room
i
could
find
to
stay
in
be
nearby
over
in
claremore
that
be
where
i
met
helen
robson
one
april
night
in
a
bowling
alley
helen
walton
i
be
out
on
a
date
with
another
fellow
and
it
be
the
first
time
i
would
ever
be
bowling
i
have
just
roll
the
ball
and
when
i
come
back
to
the
seat
they
be
those
old
wooden
theater
chair
sam
have
his
leg
up
over
the
armrest
of
one
of
them
and
he
smile
at
me
and
say
corny
as
it
be
have
not
i
met
you
somewhere
before
we
discover
that
he
have
date
a
girl
i
knew
in
college
later
on
he
call
me
and
ask
me
for
her
number
and
i
think
maybe
he
even
go
out
with
her
but
pretty
soon
he
and
i
be
go
out
together
my
whole
family
just
fell
in
love
with
him
and
i
always
say
he
fell
in
love
as
much
with
my
family
as
he
do
with
me
when
helen
and
i
met
and
i
start
court
her
i
just
fell
right
in
love
she
be
pretty
and
smart
and
educate
ambitious
and
opinionated
and
strong
will
with
idea
and
plan
of
her
own
also
like
me
she
be
an
athlete
who
love
the
outdoors
and
she
have
lot
of
energy
helen
walton
i
always
told
my
mother
and
dad
that
i
be
go
to
marry
someone
who
have
that
special
energy
and
drive
that
desire
to
be
a
success
i
certainly
found
what
i
be
look
for
but
now
i
laugh
sometimes
and
say
maybe
i
overshot
a
little
at
the
same
time
helen
and
i
fell
for
each
other
i
be
finally
call
up
to
the
army
for
active
duty
because
of
my
heart
irregularity
i
could
not
see
combat
but
i
be
still
able
to
accept
my
rotc
commission
as
a
second
lieutenant
by
the
time
i
go
into
the
army
i
have
two
thing
settle
i
knew
who
i
want
to
marry
and
i
knew
what
i
want
to
do
for
a
living
retailing
about
a
year
after
i
go
into
the
army
helen
and
i
be
married
on
valentine
day
in
her
hometown
of
claremore
oklahoma
i
wish
i
could
recount
a
valiant
military
career
like
my
brother
bud
who
be
a
navy
bomber
pilot
on
a
carrier
in
the
pacific
but
my
service
stint
be
really
fairly
ordinary
time
spent
as
a
lieutenant
and
then
as
a
captain
do
thing
like
supervise
security
at
aircraft
plant
and
pow
camp
in
california
and
around
the
country
helen
and
i
spent
two
year
living
the
army
life
and
when
i
get
out
in
i
not
only
knew
i
want
to
go
into
retailing
i
also
knew
i
want
to
go
into
business
for
myself
my
only
experience
be
the
penney
job
but
i
have
a
lot
of
confidence
that
i
could
be
successful
on
my
own
our
last
army
post
be
in
salt
lake
city
and
i
go
to
the
library
there
and
checked
out
every
book
on
retailing
i
also
spent
a
lot
of
my
off
duty
time
study
zcmi
the
mormon
church
department
store
out
there
just
figure
that
when
i
get
back
to
civilian
life
i
would
somehow
go
into
the
department
store
business
the
only
question
left
be
where
we
be
go
to
set
up
housekeep
helen
walton
my
father
want
us
to
move
to
claremore
but
i
told
him
dad
i
want
my
husband
to
be
himself
i
do
not
want
him
to
be
l
s
robson
son
in
law
i
want
him
to
be
sam
walton
as
i
mention
helen
father
be
a
very
prominent
lawyer
banker
and
rancher
and
she
felt
we
should
be
independent
i
agree
with
her
and
i
thought
our
best
opportunity
might
be
in
st
louis
as
it
turn
out
an
old
friend
of
mine
tom
bates
also
want
to
go
into
the
department
store
business
i
would
know
tom
when
we
be
kid
in
shelbina
his
father
own
the
big
department
store
in
town
and
tom
and
i
be
roommate
in
the
beta
theta
pi
fraternity
house
at
missouri
when
i
get
out
of
the
army
i
caught
up
with
tom
in
st
louis
he
be
work
in
the
shoe
department
of
butler
brother
butler
brother
be
a
regional
retailer
with
two
franchise
operation
federate
store
a
chain
of
small
department
store
and
ben
franklin
a
chain
of
variety
store
what
we
use
to
call
five
and
dime
or
dime
store
tom
have
a
great
idea
i
thought
he
and
i
would
become
partner
each
put
up
and
buy
a
federate
department
store
on
del
mar
avenue
in
st
louis
helen
and
i
have
or
so
and
i
knew
we
could
borrow
the
rest
from
her
father
who
always
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
me
and
be
very
supportive
man
i
be
all
set
to
become
a
big
city
department
store
owner
that
be
when
helen
spoke
up
and
laid
down
the
law
helen
walton
sam
we
have
be
married
two
year
and
we
have
move
sixteen
time
now
i
will
go
with
you
any
place
you
want
so
long
as
you
do
not
ask
me
to
live
in
a
big
city
ten
thousand
people
be
enough
for
me
so
any
town
with
a
population
over
be
off
limit
to
the
walton
if
you
know
anything
at
all
about
the
initial
small
town
strategy
that
get
wal
mart
go
almost
two
decade
later
you
can
see
that
this
pretty
much
set
the
course
for
what
be
to
come
she
also
say
no
partnership
they
be
too
risky
her
family
have
see
some
partnership
go
sour
and
she
be
dead
set
in
the
notion
that
the
only
way
to
go
be
to
work
for
yourself
so
i
go
back
to
butler
brother
to
see
what
else
they
might
have
for
me
what
they
have
be
a
ben
franklin
variety
store
in
newport
arkansas
a
cotton
and
railroad
town
of
about
people
in
the
mississippi
river
delta
country
of
eastern
arkansas
i
remember
rid
down
there
on
the
train
from
st
louis
still
wear
my
army
uniform
with
the
sam
browne
belt
and
walk
down
front
street
to
give
this
store
my
dream
the
once
over
a
guy
from
st
louis
own
it
and
thing
be
not
work
out
at
all
for
him
he
be
lose
money
and
he
want
to
unload
the
store
as
fast
as
he
could
i
realize
now
that
i
be
the
sucker
butler
brother
sent
to
save
him
i
be
twenty
seven
year
old
and
full
of
confidence
but
i
do
not
know
the
first
thing
about
how
to
evaluate
a
proposition
like
this
so
i
jumped
right
in
with
both
foot
i
bought
it
for
of
our
own
money
and
borrow
from
helen
father
my
naivet
about
contract
and
such
would
later
come
back
to
haunt
me
in
a
big
way
but
at
the
time
i
be
sure
newport
and
the
ben
franklin
have
great
potential
and
i
have
always
believe
in
goal
so
i
set
myself
one
i
want
my
little
newport
store
to
be
the
best
most
profitable
variety
store
in
arkansas
within
five
year
i
felt
i
have
the
talent
to
do
it
that
it
could
be
do
and
why
not
go
for
it
set
that
as
a
goal
and
see
if
you
ca
not
achieve
it
if
it
do
not
work
you
have
have
fun
try
only
after
we
close
the
deal
of
course
do
i
learn
that
the
store
be
a
real
dog
it
have
sale
of
about
a
year
but
its
rent
be
percent
of
sale
which
i
thought
sound
fine
but
which
it
turn
out
be
the
high
rent
anybody
would
ever
heard
of
in
the
variety
store
business
no
one
paid
percent
of
sale
for
rent
and
it
have
a
strong
competitor
a
sterling
store
across
the
street
whose
excellent
manager
john
dunham
be
do
more
than
a
year
in
sale
double
mine
for
all
my
confidence
i
have
not
have
a
day
experience
in
run
a
variety
store
so
butler
brother
sent
me
for
two
week
training
to
the
ben
franklin
in
arkadelphia
arkansas
after
that
i
be
on
my
own
and
we
open
for
business
on
september
our
store
be
a
typical
old
variety
store
foot
wide
and
foot
deep
face
front
street
in
the
heart
of
town
look
out
on
the
railroad
track
back
then
those
store
have
cash
register
and
clerk
aisle
behind
each
counter
throughout
the
store
and
the
clerk
would
wait
on
the
customer
self
service
have
not
be
thought
of
yet
it
be
a
real
blessing
for
me
to
be
so
green
and
ignorant
because
it
be
from
that
experience
that
i
learn
a
lesson
which
have
stuck
with
me
all
through
the
year
you
can
learn
from
everybody
i
do
not
just
learn
from
reading
every
retail
publication
i
could
get
my
hand
on
i
probably
learn
the
most
from
study
what
john
dunham
be
do
across
the
street
helen
walton
it
turn
out
there
be
a
lot
to
learn
about
run
a
store
and
of
course
what
really
drove
sam
be
that
competition
across
the
street
john
dunham
over
at
the
sterling
store
sam
be
always
over
there
check
on
john
always
look
at
his
price
look
at
his
display
look
at
what
be
go
on
he
be
always
look
for
a
way
to
do
a
well
job
i
do
not
remember
the
detail
but
i
remember
some
kind
of
panty
price
war
they
get
into
later
on
long
after
we
have
left
newport
and
john
have
retire
we
would
see
him
and
he
would
laugh
about
sam
always
be
in
his
store
but
i
be
sure
it
aggravate
him
quite
a
bit
early
on
john
have
never
have
good
competition
before
sam
i
learn
a
tremendous
amount
from
run
a
store
in
the
ben
franklin
franchise
program
they
have
an
excellent
operating
program
for
their
independent
store
sort
of
a
can
course
in
how
to
run
a
store
it
be
an
education
in
itself
they
have
their
own
accounting
system
with
manual
tell
you
what
to
do
when
and
how
they
have
merchandise
statement
they
have
account
payable
sheet
they
have
profit
and
loss
sheet
they
have
little
ledger
book
call
beat
yesterday
book
in
which
you
could
compare
this
year
sale
with
last
year
on
a
day
by
day
basis
they
have
all
the
tool
that
an
independent
merchant
need
to
run
a
control
operation
i
have
no
previous
experience
in
accounting
and
i
be
not
all
that
great
at
accounting
in
college
so
i
just
do
it
accord
to
their
book
in
fact
i
use
their
accounting
system
long
after
i
would
start
break
their
rule
on
everything
else
i
even
use
it
for
the
first
five
or
six
wal
mart
as
helpful
as
that
franchise
program
be
to
an
eager
to
learn
twenty
seven
year
old
kid
butler
brother
want
us
to
do
thing
literally
by
the
book
their
book
they
really
do
not
allow
their
franchisees
much
discretion
the
merchandise
be
assemble
in
chicago
st
louis
or
kansa
city
they
told
me
what
merchandise
to
sell
how
much
to
sell
it
for
and
how
much
they
would
sell
it
to
me
for
they
told
me
that
their
selection
of
merchandise
be
what
the
customer
expect
they
also
told
me
i
have
to
buy
at
least
percent
of
my
merchandise
from
them
and
if
i
do
i
would
get
a
rebate
at
year
end
if
i
want
to
make
a
or
percent
net
profit
they
told
me
i
would
have
to
hire
so
much
help
and
do
so
much
advertising
this
be
how
most
franchise
work
at
the
very
begin
i
go
along
and
ran
my
store
by
their
book
because
i
really
do
not
know
any
well
but
it
do
not
take
me
long
to
start
experiment
that
be
just
the
way
i
be
and
always
have
be
pretty
soon
i
be
lay
on
promotional
program
of
my
own
and
then
i
start
buying
merchandise
directly
from
manufacturer
i
have
lot
of
argument
with
manufacturer
i
would
say
i
want
to
buy
these
ribbon
and
bow
direct
i
do
not
want
you
to
sell
them
to
butler
brother
and
then
i
have
to
pay
butler
brother
percent
more
for
them
i
want
it
direct
most
of
the
time
they
do
not
want
to
make
butler
brother
mad
so
they
turn
me
down
every
now
and
then
though
i
would
find
one
who
would
cross
over
and
do
it
my
way
that
be
the
start
of
a
lot
of
the
practice
and
philosophy
that
still
prevail
at
wal
mart
today
i
be
always
look
for
offbeat
supplier
or
source
i
start
drive
over
to
tennessee
to
some
fellow
i
found
who
would
give
me
special
buy
at
price
way
below
what
ben
franklin
be
charge
me
one
i
remember
be
wright
merchandising
co
in
union
city
which
would
sell
to
small
business
like
mine
at
good
wholesale
price
i
would
work
in
the
store
all
day
then
take
off
around
closing
and
drive
that
windy
road
over
to
the
mississippi
river
ferry
at
cottonwood
point
missouri
and
then
into
tennessee
with
an
old
homemade
trailer
hitch
to
my
car
i
would
stuff
that
car
and
trailer
with
whatever
i
could
get
good
deal
on
usually
on
softlines
lady
panty
and
nylon
men
shirt
and
i
would
bring
them
back
price
them
low
and
just
blow
that
stuff
out
the
store
i
have
get
to
tell
you
it
drove
the
ben
franklin
folk
crazy
not
only
be
they
not
get
their
percentage
they
could
not
compete
with
the
price
i
be
buying
at
then
i
start
branching
out
far
than
tennessee
somehow
or
another
i
get
in
touch
by
letter
with
a
manufacturer
agent
out
of
new
york
name
harry
weiner
he
ran
weiner
buying
service
at
seventh
avenue
that
guy
ran
a
very
simple
business
he
would
go
to
all
these
different
manufacturer
and
then
list
what
they
have
for
sale
when
somebody
like
me
sent
him
an
order
he
would
take
maybe
percent
for
himself
and
then
send
the
order
on
to
the
factory
which
would
ship
it
to
us
that
percent
seem
like
a
pretty
reasonable
cut
to
me
compare
to
percent
for
ben
franklin
i
will
never
forget
one
of
harry
deal
one
of
the
best
item
i
ever
have
and
an
early
lesson
in
pricing
it
first
get
me
think
in
the
direction
of
what
eventually
become
the
foundation
of
wal
mart
philosophy
if
you
be
interested
in
how
wal
mart
do
it
this
be
one
story
you
have
get
to
sit
up
and
pay
close
attention
to
harry
be
sell
lady
panty
two
bar
tricot
satin
panty
with
an
elastic
waist
for
a
dozen
we
would
be
buying
similar
panty
from
ben
franklin
for
a
dozen
and
sell
them
at
three
pair
for
well
at
harry
price
of
we
could
put
them
out
at
four
for
and
make
a
great
promotion
for
our
store
here
be
the
simple
lesson
we
learn
which
others
be
learn
at
the
same
time
and
which
eventually
change
the
way
retailer
sell
and
customer
buy
all
across
america
say
i
bought
an
item
for
cent
i
found
that
by
pricing
it
at
i
could
sell
three
time
more
of
it
than
by
pricing
it
at
i
might
make
only
half
the
profit
per
item
but
because
i
be
sell
three
time
as
many
the
overall
profit
be
much
great
simple
enough
but
this
be
really
the
essence
of
discounting
by
cut
your
price
you
can
boost
your
sale
to
a
point
where
you
earn
far
more
at
the
cheaper
retail
price
than
you
would
have
by
sell
the
item
at
the
high
price
in
retailer
language
you
can
low
your
markup
but
earn
more
because
of
the
increase
volume
i
begin
to
mull
this
idea
in
newport
but
it
would
be
another
ten
year
before
i
take
it
seriously
i
could
not
follow
up
on
it
in
newport
because
the
ben
franklin
program
be
too
cut
and
dry
to
permit
it
and
despite
my
dealing
with
the
like
of
harry
weiner
i
still
have
that
contract
say
i
be
suppose
to
buy
at
least
percent
of
my
merchandise
from
ben
franklin
if
i
miss
that
target
i
do
not
get
my
year
end
rebate
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
i
stretch
that
contract
every
way
i
could
i
would
buy
as
much
as
i
could
on
the
outside
and
still
try
to
meet
the
percent
charlie
baum
who
be
then
one
of
the
field
men
for
ben
franklin
would
say
we
be
only
at
percent
and
i
would
foam
at
the
mouth
and
rant
and
rave
about
it
i
guess
the
only
reason
butler
brother
do
not
give
me
a
harder
time
about
it
all
be
that
our
store
have
quickly
go
from
be
a
laggard
to
one
of
the
top
performer
in
our
district
thing
begin
to
clip
along
pretty
good
in
newport
in
a
very
short
time
after
only
two
and
a
half
year
we
have
paid
back
the
helen
father
loan
us
and
i
felt
mighty
good
about
that
it
meant
the
business
have
take
off
on
its
own
and
i
figure
we
be
really
on
our
way
now
we
try
a
lot
of
promotional
thing
that
work
really
well
first
we
put
a
popcorn
machine
out
on
the
sidewalk
and
we
sell
that
stuff
like
crazy
so
i
thought
and
thought
about
it
and
finally
decide
what
we
need
be
a
soft
ice
cream
machine
out
there
too
i
screw
my
courage
up
and
go
down
to
the
bank
and
borrow
what
at
the
time
seem
like
the
astronomical
sum
of
to
buy
that
thing
that
be
the
first
money
i
ever
borrow
from
a
bank
then
we
roll
the
ice
cream
machine
out
there
on
the
sidewalk
next
to
the
popcorn
machine
and
i
mean
we
attract
some
attention
with
those
two
it
be
new
and
different
another
experiment
and
we
really
turn
a
profit
on
it
i
paid
off
that
note
in
two
or
three
year
and
i
felt
great
about
it
i
really
do
not
want
to
be
remember
as
the
guy
who
lose
his
shirt
on
some
crazy
ice
cream
machine
charlie
baum
everybody
want
to
go
see
sam
walton
store
we
never
have
another
store
that
have
a
ding
dong
ice
cream
bar
in
it
one
of
those
ice
cream
make
machine
people
go
there
for
that
and
it
be
fantastic
but
one
saturday
night
for
some
reason
they
forgot
to
clean
that
machine
up
when
they
close
and
i
go
by
there
the
next
day
with
some
of
my
client
to
show
them
sam
front
window
and
i
want
to
tell
you
the
fly
in
that
window
be
just
out
of
this
world
as
good
as
business
be
i
never
could
leave
well
enough
alone
and
in
fact
i
think
my
constant
fiddle
and
meddling
with
the
status
quo
may
have
be
one
of
my
big
contribution
to
the
later
success
of
wal
mart
as
i
mention
we
face
front
street
and
our
big
competitor
john
dunham
sterling
store
be
across
hazel
street
on
the
other
corner
his
store
be
slightly
small
than
ours
but
he
still
manage
to
do
twice
as
much
business
as
our
store
do
before
we
bought
it
we
be
come
on
strong
though
in
our
first
year
the
ben
franklin
do
in
sale
compare
to
under
the
old
owner
then
the
next
year
and
then
finally
we
caught
and
then
pass
old
john
over
there
across
hazel
street
but
next
door
to
him
on
the
other
side
from
us
be
a
kroger
grocery
store
by
now
i
be
real
involve
in
the
community
and
kept
my
ear
to
the
ground
pretty
good
and
i
heard
that
sterling
be
go
to
buy
kroger
lease
and
expand
john
store
into
that
space
make
their
store
much
big
than
mine
so
i
hustle
down
to
hot
spring
to
find
the
landlady
of
that
kroger
building
somehow
i
convince
her
to
give
me
the
lease
instead
of
give
it
to
sterling
i
do
not
have
any
idea
what
i
be
go
to
do
with
it
but
i
sure
knew
i
do
not
want
sterling
to
have
it
well
i
decide
to
put
in
a
small
department
store
now
newport
already
have
several
department
store
one
of
which
happen
to
be
own
by
my
store
landlord
p
k
holmes
that
may
or
may
not
have
have
something
to
do
with
the
trouble
which
be
go
to
come
soon
but
we
do
not
think
anything
about
it
i
drew
up
a
plan
bought
a
sign
bought
new
fixture
from
a
company
up
in
nebraska
and
bought
the
merchandise
dress
pant
shirt
jacket
whatever
i
thought
i
could
sell
the
fixture
arrive
on
wednesday
by
train
and
charlie
baum
who
be
suppose
to
be
supervise
my
merchandising
for
butler
brother
offer
to
help
me
put
everything
together
he
be
the
most
efficient
store
layer
outer
i
have
ever
know
we
go
over
to
the
railroad
track
and
unloaded
the
fixture
put
them
together
laid
out
the
store
put
the
merchandise
together
and
open
six
day
later
on
monday
we
call
it
the
eagle
store
so
now
we
have
two
store
on
front
street
in
newport
i
would
run
up
and
down
the
alley
with
merchandise
if
it
do
not
sell
in
one
store
i
would
try
it
in
the
other
i
guess
they
compete
with
each
other
but
not
much
by
now
the
ben
franklin
be
do
really
well
the
eagle
never
make
much
money
but
i
figure
i
would
rather
have
a
small
profit
than
have
my
competitor
over
there
in
a
big
store
i
have
to
hire
my
first
assistant
manager
to
help
out
in
the
ben
franklin
while
i
be
run
back
and
forth
and
my
brother
bud
have
come
home
from
the
war
and
be
work
with
me
too
bud
walton
that
newport
store
be
really
the
begin
of
where

mart

everything

would
wash

be
where

start
year
ago
our
money
be
make
by
control
expense
that
and
sam
always
be
ingenious
he
never
stop
try
to
do
something
different
one
thing
though
i
never
forgave
him
for
make
me

damn
ice
cream
machine
he
knew
i
would
hat

product
ever
since
we
be
kid
he
use
to
squirt
me
when
he
milked
the
cow
i
always
thought

me
that
job
because
he
knew
i

not
have
felt
well
about
our

kind
of

well

that

kid
would
benefit
from
a
church
upbringing
church
be
an
important
part
of
society

of
tie

from
new
york
name

come
to
town
to
audit
that

store
and
he
be
the
president
of

chamber
of

and
when
the
manager
told
him
it
be
sam
walton
old
blake
almost
fell
over
it
ca
not
be
the
same
one
i
knew
in
de
moines
he
say
that
fellow
could
not
have
amount
to
anything
he
come
next
door

we
both
have
a
big
laugh
about
it
when
he
saw
that
i
really
be
that
kid
who
could
not
write
so
you
could
read
it
by
now
my
five
year
in
newport
be
about
up
and
i
have
met
my
goal
that
little
ben
franklin
store
be
do
in
sale
a
year
and
turn
to
a
year
in
profit
it
be
the
number
one
ben
franklin
store
for
sale
or
profit
not
only
in
arkansas
but
in
the
whole
six
state
region
it
be
the
large
variety
store
of
any
sort
in
arkansas
and
i
do
not
believe
there
be
a
big
one
in
the
three
or
four
neighbor
state
every
crazy
thing
we
try
have
not
turn
out
as
well
as
the
ice
cream
machine
of
course
but
we
have
not
make
any
mistake
we
could
not
correct
quickly
none
so
big
that
they
threaten
the
business
except
it
turn
out
for
one
little
legal
error
we
make
right
at
the
begin
in
all
my
excitement
at
become
sam
walton
merchant
i
have
neglect
to
include
a
clause
in
my
lease
which
give
me
an
option
to
renew
after
the
first
five
year
and
our
success
it
turn
out
have
attract
a
lot
of
attention
my
landlord
the
department
store
owner
be
so
impressed
with
our
ben
franklin
success
that
he
decide
not
to
renew
our
lease
at
any
price
know
full
well
that
we
have
nowhere
else
in
town
to
move
the
store
he
do
offer
to
buy
the
franchise
fixture
and
inventory
at
a
fair
price
he
want
to
give
the
store
to
his
son
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
give
it
up
but
i
sell
the
eagle
store
lease
to
sterling
so
that
john
dunham
my
worthy
competitor
and
mentor
could
finally
have
that
expansion
he
would
want
it
be
the
low
point
of
my
business
life
i
felt
sick
to
my
stomach
i
could
not
believe
it
be
happen
to
me
it
really
be
like
a
nightmare
i
have
built
the
best
variety
store
in
the
whole
region
and
work
hard
in
the
community
do
everything
right
and
now
i
be
be
kick
out
of
town
it
do
not
seem
fair
i
blame
myself
for
ever
get
suckered
into
such
an
awful
lease
and
i
be
furious
at
the
landlord
helen
just
settle
in
with
a
brand
new
family
of
four
be
heartsick
at
the
prospect
of
leave
newport
but
that
be
what
we
be
go
to
do
i
have
never
be
one
to
dwell
on
revers
and
i
do
not
do
so
then
it
be
not
just
a
corny
say
that
you
can
make
a
positive
out
of
most
any
negative
if
you
work
at
it
hard
enough
i
have
always
thought
of
problem
as
challenge
and
this
one
be
not
any
different
i
do
not
know
if
that
experience
change
me
or
not
i
know
i
read
my
lease
a
lot
more
carefully
after
that
and
maybe
i
become
a
little
more
wary
of
just
how
tough
the
world
can
be
also
it
may
have
be
about
then
that
i
begin
encourage
our
old
boy
six
year
old
rob
to
become
a
lawyer
but
i
do
not
dwell
on
my
disappointment
the
challenge
at
hand
be
simple
enough
to
figure
out
i
have
to
pick
myself
up
and
get
on
with
it
do
it
all
over
again
only
even
well
this
time
helen
and
i
start
look
for
a
new
town

bounce
back
when
we
left
newport
it
be
a
thrive
cotton
town
and
i
hat
to
leave
we
have
built
a
life
there
and
it
be
so
disturb
to
have
to
walk
away
from
it
i
have
say
that
time
and
time
again
i
still
have
good
friend
there
from
those
day
helen
walton
i
come
out
of
that
newport
experience
with
my
pride
a
little
damage
but
i
have
make
money
on
the
sale
of
the
ben
franklin
more
than
the
whole
thing
be
probably
a
blessing
i
have
a
chance
for
a
brand
new
start
and
this
time
i
knew
what
i
be
do
now
at
the
age
of
thirty
two
i
be
a
full
fledge
merchant
all
i
need
be
a
store
helen
and
the
kid
and
i
start
drive
around
in
the
spring
of
hunt
in
earnest
for
one
and
northwest
arkansas
appeal
to
us
for
several
reason
first
for
helen
it
be
a
whole
lot
closer
to
her
folk
in
claremore
than
newport
have
be
and
it
be
good
for
me
because
i
want
to
get
closer
to
good
quail
hunt
and
with
oklahoma
kansa
arkansas
and
missouri
all
come
together
right
there
it
give
me
easy
access
to
four
quail
season
in
four
state
we
try
to
buy
a
store
in
siloam
spring
on
the
oklahoma
border
but
we
could
not
come
to
term
with
the
owner
jim
dodson
who
later
become
a
friend
of
ours
so
one
day
helen
father
and
i
drove
into
bentonville
and
have
a
look
around
the
square
it
be
the
small
of
the
town
we
consider
and
it
already
have
three
variety
store
when
one
would
have
be
enough
still
i
love
competition
and
it
just
struck
me
as
the
right
place
to
prove
i
could
do
it
all
over
again
we
found
an
old
store
willing
to
sell
harrison
variety
store
but
we
need
to
double
its
size
and
to
do
that
we
have
to
get
a
ninety
nine
year
lease
on
the
barbershop
next
door
no
more
five
year
lease
for
me
these
two
old
widow
from
kansa
city
who
own
it
would
not
budge
and
frankly
if
helen
father
have
not
go
up
there
unbeknownst
to
me
and
negotiate
a
deal
i
be
not
sure
where
the
walton
would
have
end
up
helen
walton
bentonville
really
be
just
a
sad
look
country
town
even
though
it
have
a
railroad
track
to
it
it
be
mostly
know
for
apple
but
at
the
time
chicken
be
begin
to
come
on
i
remember
i
could
not
believe
this
be
where
we
be
go
to
live
it
only
have
people
compare
to
newport
which
be
a
thrive
cotton
and
railroad
town
of
people
the
store
be
a
small
old
country
town
store
with
can
of
lace
box
of
hat
sew
pattern
everything
you
can
imagine
just
store
around
everywhere
but
i
knew
right
after
we
get
here
that
it
be
go
to
work
out
now
i
have
a
store
to
run
again
and
even
though
it
do
not
do
but
the
year
before
i
bought
it
compare
to
at
newport
it
do
not
matter
that
much
because
i
have
big
plan
we
tore
the
wall
out
between
the
barbershop
and

which
i
drove
over
to
bentonville
from

we
have
to
get
on
an
old
dirt
road
to
bypass
a
weigh

article
about

two
ben
franklin
store
up
in
minnesota
that
have
go
to
self
service
a
brand
new
concept
at
the
time
i
rode
the
bus
all
night
long
to
two
little
town
up
there
pipestone
and
worthington
they
have
shelf
on
the
side
and
two
island
counter
all
the
way
back
no
clerk
with
cash
register
around
the
store
just
checkout
register
up
front
i
like
it
so
i
do
that
too
charlie
baum
as
soon
as
sam
move
the
store
from
newport
to
bentonville
he
have
a
nice
big
sale
and
we
put
barrel
full
of
stuff
all
around
the
floor
those
elderly
lady
would
come
in
and
bend
way
down
over
into
those
barrel
i
will
never
forget
this
sam
take
a
look
frown
and
say
one
thing
we
gotta
do
charlie
we
gotta
be
real
strong
in
lingerie
time
have
be
hard
and
some
of
those
underthings
be
pretty
rag
so
when
charlie
and
i
laid
out
that
store
in
bentonville
it
become
only
the
third
self
service
variety
store
in
the
whole
country
and
the
first
in
our
eight
state
area
maybe
nobody
here
knew
it
but
it
be
a
big
deal
we
have
get
our
first
ad
from
the
july
benton
county
democrat
on
display
today
down
at
our
wal
mart
visitor
center
it
be
for
the
grand
remodel
sale
of
walton
five
and
dime
promising
a
whole
bunch
of
good
stuff
free
balloon
for
the
kid
a
dozen
clothespin
for
nine
cent
iced
tea
glass
for
ten
cent
apiece
the
folk
turn
out
and
they
kept
come
although
we
call
it
walton
five
and
dime
it
be
a
ben
franklin
franchise
and
that
store
take
off
just
like
newport
have
and
turn
into
a
good
business
right
away
it
really
be
an
a
l
store
for
these
part
back
then
inez
threet
clerk
walton
five
and
dime
bentonville
i
guess
mr
walton
just
have
a
personality
that
drew
people
in
he
would
yell
at
you
from
a
block
away
you
know
he
would
just
yell
at
everybody
he
saw
and
that
be
the
reason
so
many
like
him
and
do
business
in
the
store
it
be
like
he
brought
in
business
by
his
be
so
friendly
he
be
always
think
up
new
thing
to
try
in
the
store
i
remember
one
time
he
make
a
trip
to
new
york
and
he
come
back
a
few
day
later
and
say
come
here
i
want
to
show
you
something
this
be
go
to
be
the
item
of
the
year
i
go
over
and
look
at
a
bin
full
of
i
think
they
call
them
zori
sandal
they
call
them
thong
now
and
i
just
laugh
and
say
no
way
will
those
thing
sell
they
will
just
blister
your
toe
well
he
take
them
and
tie
them
together
in
pair
and
dumped
them
all
on
a
table
at
the
end
of
an
aisle
for
nineteen
cent
a
pair
and
they
just
sell
like
you
would
not
believe
i
have
never
see
an
item
sell
as
fast
one
after
another
just
pile
of
them
everybody
in
town
have
a
pair
right
away
i
start
look
around
for
store
opportunity
in
other
town
maybe
it
be
just
my
itch
to
do
more
business
and
maybe
too
i
do
not
want
all
my
egg
in
one
basket
again
by
i
have
driven
down
to
fayetteville
and
found
an
old
grocery
store
that
kroger
be
abandon
because
it
be
fall
apart
it
be
right
on
the
square
only
foot
wide
and
foot
deep
our
main
competitor
be
a
woolworth
on
one
side
of
the
square
and
a
scott
store
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
so
here
we
be
challenge
two
popular
store
with
a
little
old
foot
independent
variety
store
it
be
not
a
ben
franklin
franchise
we
just
call
it
walton
five
and
dime
like
the
store
in
bentonville
i
remember
sit
on
the
square
right
after
i
bought
it
listen
to
a
couple
of
the
local
codger
say
well
we
will
give
that
guy
sixty
day
maybe
ninety
he
wo
not
be
there
long
but
this
store
be
ahead
of
its
time
too
self
service
all
the
way
unlike
the
competition
this
be
the
begin
of
our
way
of
operating
for
a
long
while
to
come
we
be
innovate
experiment
and
expand
somehow
over
the
year
folk
have
gotten
the
impression
that
wal
mart
be
something
i
dream
up
out
of
the
blue
as
a
middle
age
man
and
that
it
be
just
this
great
idea
that
turn
into
an
overnight
success
it
be
true
that
i
be
forty
four
when
we
open
our
first
wal
mart
in
but
the
store
be
totally
an
outgrowth
of
everything
we
would
be
do
since
newport
another
case
of
me
be
unable
to
leave
well
enough
alone
another
experiment
and
like
most
other
overnight
success
it
be
about
twenty
year
in
the
make
of
course
i
need
somebody
to
run
my
new
store
and
i
do
not
have
much
money
so
i
do
something
i
would
do
for
the
rest
of
my
run
in
the
retail
business
without
any
shame
or
embarrassment
whatsoever
nose
around
other
people
store
search
for
good
talent
that
be
when
i
make
my
first
real
hire
the
first
manager
willard
walker
willard
walker
first
manager
walton
five
and
dime
fayetteville
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
sam
walton
be
when
he
and
his
brother
in
law
nick
robson
drop
into
a
tg
y
dime
store
i
be
manage
in
tulsa
he
visit
with
me
for
about
an
hour
ask
a
lot
of
question
and
left
and
i
never
thought
anything
about
it
later
on
he
call
me
and
say
he
be
opening
a
new
store
in
fayetteville
and
wonder
if
id
be
interested
in
interview
for
the
manager
job
i
have
to
move
myself
over
there
work
half
day
for
free
until
the
store
open
and
i
remember
sleep
on
a
cot
in
the
storeroom
but
he
say
i
would
get
a
percentage
of
the
profit
and
that
appeal
to
me
when
i
go
to
quit
tg
y
the
vice
president
say
remember
willard
a
percentage
of
nothing
be
still
nothing
but
i
go
ahead
and
take
the
job
sam
be
down
there
every
day
from
the
time
we
start
until
the
time
we
left
he
roll
up
his
sleeve
and
work
every
day
until
we
built
that
store
from
scratch
sam
would
haul
in
all
kind
of
merchandise
that
he
bought
from
these
friend
of
his
over
in
tennessee
haul
it
in
by
station
wagon
it
work
real
good
the
first
year
that
store
be
open
i
believe
bentonville
do
and
we
do
well
later
on
when
we
have
wal
mart
and
go
public
i
go
out
and
borrow
what
seem
like
an
awful
lot
of
money
at
the
time
and
bought
stock
with
it
bud
and
sam
come
down
to
the
store
one
day
and
bud
say
willard
i
sure
hope
you
know
what
you
be
do
he
told
me
i
have
more
faith
than
he
do
i
always
knew
it
be
go
to
be
successful
the
philosophy
make
sense
and
you
could
not
help
but
believe
in
the
man
in
the
year
to
come
that
lure
of
partnership
help
us
attract
a
lot
of
good
manager
but
i
do
not
believe
we
ever
have
one
who
bought
more
stock
than
willard
and
of
course
he
feel
pretty
good
about
it
today
i
remember
those
day
mostly
as
a
time
of
always
look
around
for
idea
and
item
that
would
make
our
store
stand
out
sometime
in
there
the
hula
hoop
fad
hit
real
big
and
they
be
flood
the
big
city
store
but
the
genuine
article
which
be
make
of
plastic
hose
be
pricey
and
hard
for
us
to
get
jim
dodson
the
fellow
who
would
not
sell
me
the
siloam
spring
store
call
me
and
say
he
knew
a
manufacturer
who
could
make
hose
the
same
size
as
the
hula
hoop
he
thought
we
should
go
in
fifty
fifty
and
make
our
own
hula
hoop
we
do
we
make

at
his

ben
franklin
franchise
be
for
little
independent
operator
who
want
to
fit
a
store
or
two
somewhere
in
the
crack
between
those
guy
of
course
sam
change
all
that
border
do
not
mean
much
to
my
brother
he
thought
nothing
of
do
business
in
four
state
all
in
one
day
if
i
ever
have
any
doubt
about
the
potential
of
the
business
we
be
in
ruskin
height
end
them
that
thing
take
off
like
a
house
afire
the
first
year
we
make
about
profit
on
sale
of
which
go
up
to
in
no
time
when
i
saw
that
shopping
center
catch
on
the
way
it
do
i
thought
man
this
be
the
forerunner
of
many
many
thing
to
come
and
i
decide
with
no
money
to
amount
to
anything
to
go
into
the
shopping
center
development
business
myself
back
in
arkansas
i
go
down
to
little
rock
just
on
fire
with
the
idea
of
be
the
pioneer
shopping
center
developer
there
i
try
to
get
one
real
good
corner
but
a
big
wheeler
dealer
with
sterling
store
bought
it
out
from
under
me
and
put
in
what
become
the
town
first
shopping
center
which
feature
a
sterling
store
and
an
oklahoma
tire
and
supply
i
kept
at
it
i
probably
spent
two
year
go
around
try
to
sell
people
on
the
idea
of
shopping
center
in
arkansas
in
the
middle
fifty
which
be
about
ten
year
too
early
i
finally
get
an
option
on
one
piece
of
property
and
talk
kroger
and
woolworth
into
signing
lease
base
on
us
get
this
one
street
pave
i
start
raise
money
for
the
pavement
but
it
get
real
complicate
and
in
the
end
i
decide
i
have
well
take
my
whip
so
i
back
out
of
the
whole
deal
and
go
back
to
concentrate
on
the
retail
business
i
probably
lose
and
that
be
at
a
time
when
helen
and
i
be
counting
every
dollar
it
be
probably
the
big
mistake
of
my
business
career
i
do
learn
a
heck
of
a
lot
about
the
real
estate
business
from
the
experience
and
maybe
it
paid
off
somewhere
down
the
line
though
i
would
rather
have
learn
it
some
cheaper
way
incidentally
after
i
drop
my
option
on
that
last
piece
of
land
a
well
know
young
fellow
name
jack
stephen
who
have
a
whole
lot
more
money
than
i
do
go
on
to
develop
a
successful
shopping
center
that
be
still
there
david
glass
two
thing
about
sam
walton
distinguish
him
from
almost
everyone
else
i
know
first
he
get
up
every
day
bound
and
determine
to
improve
something
second
he
be
less
afraid
of
be
wrong
than
anyone
i
have
ever
know
and
once
he
see
he
be
wrong
he
just
shake
it
off
and
head
in
another
direction
all
during
that
real
estate
fiasco
i
be
of
course
still
try
to
run
these
variety
store
and
everything
be
go
along
great
until
may
i
will
never
forget
the
day
bud
call
me
from
versailles
and
say
a
tornado
have
hit
the
ruskin
store
ah
it
probably
shook
up
a
little
glass
i
say
but
later
i
get
to
worry
about
it
and
i
could
not
get
through
to
anybody
up
there
so
i
go
on
up
to
kansa
city
to
see
for
myself
i
get
there
about
two
in
the
morning
and
saw
that
the
whole
shopping
center
be
practically
level
none
of
our
people
be
seriously
hurt
but
the
store
be
about
go
and
even
though
the
merchandise
and
the
fixture
be
insured
it
be
still
a
big
blow
to
bud
and
me
this
be
our
best
store
the
one
we
be
really
excite
about
it
be
there
one
minute
and
go
the
next
we
just
rebuilt
it
and
get
back
at
it
by
now
though
with
all
the
place
i
have
to
visit
i
be
drive
too
much
to
have
time
for
anything
else
so
i
begin
to
wonder
if
maybe
fly
would
not
be
the
way
to
go
bud
walton
one
day
i
get
a
call
from
sam
and
he
say
meet
me
in
kansa
city
i
want
to
buy
an
airplane
boy
it
take
me
by
such
surprise
i
always
thought
he
be
the
world
bad
driver
and
even
my
father
would
not
ever
let
sam
drive
him
i
thought
he
will
kill
himself
the
first
year
so
i
do
everything
in
the
world
to
try
and
talk
him
out
of
that
first
airplane
he
just
say
whether
you
meet
me
or
not
i
be
go
to
look
at
this
airplane
and
i
do
not
go
because
i
knew
he
would
kill
himself
in
that
plane
he
call
me
later
and
say
he
have
not
bought
that
particular
plane
but
he
would
go
to
oklahoma
city
and
bought
this
air
coupe
for
and
i
have
to
come
see
it
i
will
never
forget
go
out
to
the
bentonville
airport
and
see
what
he
call
an
airplane
it
have
a
wash
machine
motor
in
it
and
it
would
putt
putt
and
then
miss
a
lick
then
putt
putt
again
it
do
not
even
look
like
an
airplane
and
i
would
not
go
near
it
for
at
least
two
year
but
then
we
be
put
some
more
store
in
around
little
rock
and
one
day
he
say
let
go
to
little
rock
i
have
not
flown
since
the
navy
in
the
pacific
and
i
be
always
use
to
water
here
we
be
with
sam
at
the
stick
go
over
all
these
tree
and
mountain
it
be
the
long
trip
i
ever
take
that
be
the
start
of
the
wal
mart
aviation
era
in
spite
of
what
bud
say
i
love
that
little
two
seat
plane
because
it
would
go
mile
an
hour
if
you
do
not
have
the
wind
against
you
and
i
could
get
to
place
in
a
straight
line
in
all
the
year
and
thousand
of
hour
i
have
be
fly
i
have
only
have
one
engine
failure
and
it
come
in
that
air
coupe
i
be
take
off
from
fort
smith
and
be
just
over
the
river
when
an
exhaust
stack
blew
it
sound
like
the
end
of
the
world
the
motor
have
not
quite
quit
but
i
have
to
cut
it
off
for
a
minute
there
i
thought
that
might
be
it
for
me
but
i
be
able
to
circle
back
and
land
with
a
dead
engine
once
i
take
to
the
air
i
caught
store
fever
we
open
variety
store
many
of
them
ben
franklin
franchise
in
little
rock
springdale
and
siloam
spring
arkansas
and
we
have
a
couple
more
in
neodesha
and
coffeyville
kansa
all
these
store
be
organize
as
separate
partnership
between
bud
and
me
along
with
other
partner
include
my
dad
helen
two
brother
nick
and
frank
and
even
the
kid
who
invest
their
paper
route
money
john
walton
second
son
of
sam
and
helen
this
be
hard
to
believe
but
between
my
paper
route
money
and
the
money
i
make
in
the
army
both
of
which
i
invest
in
those
store
that
investment
be
worth
about
million
today
whatever
money
we
make
in
one
store
we
would
put
it
in
another
new
one
and
just
keep
on
go
also
from
willard
walker
on
we
would
offer
to
bring
the
manager
we
hire
in
as
limited
partner
if
you
have
say
a
investment
in
a
store
and
the
manager
put
in
he
would
own
percent
gary
reinboth
he
would
never
let
us
buy
more
than
per
store
i
think
of
it
be
a
loan
and
of
it
be
four
share
of
privately
own
stock
at
a
share
all
he
would
guarantee
be
that
he
would
pay
us
interest
every
year
which
at
that
time
be
percent
i
remember
one
guy
who
ran
a
store
would
call
and
say
be
you
go
to
buy
into
store
so
and
so
and
i
would
say
i
think
so
later
he
would
say
i
be
not
go
to
loan
it
to
sam
and
let
him
expand
on
my
money
then
i
would
pick
up
the
phone
and
call
mr
walton
and
say
so
and
so
be
not
go
to
buy
his
share
of
that
store
can
i
buy
his
share
he
would
say
sure
so
i
would
get
a
double
share
that
whole
period
which
scarcely
get
any
attention
from
most
people
study
us
be
really
very
very
successful
in
fifteen
year
time
we
have
become
the
large
independent
variety
store
operator
in
the
united
state
but
the
business
itself
seem
a
little
limited
the
volume
be
so
little
per
store
that
it
really
do
not
amount
to
that
much
i
mean
after
fifteen
year
in
we
be
only
do
million
in
fifteen
store
by
now
you
know
me
i
begin
look
around
hard
for
whatever
new
idea
would
break
us
over
into
something
with
a
little
well
payoff
for
all
our
effort
our
first
big
clue
come
in
saint
robert
missouri
near
fort
leonard
wood
where
we
learn
that
by
building
large
store
which
we
call
family
center
we
could
do
unheard
of
amount
of
business
for
variety
store
over
million
a
year
in
sale
per
store
just
unthinkable
for
small
town
the
same
thing
prove
true
to
a
lesser
degree
in
berryville
arkansas
and
right
here
in
bentonville
too
i
begin
to
hear
talk
of
the
early
discounter
company
like
ann
hope
whose
founder
marty
chase
be
generally
consider
the
father
of
discounting
spartan
and
mammoth
mart
and
two
guy
from
harrison
and
zayre
and
arlan
be
all
start
up
in
the
northeast
and
i
remember
that
lesson
i
would
learn
a
long
time
ago
in
newport
with
the
panty
sell
in
such
huge
volume
when
they
be
price
at
instead
of
so
i
start
run
all
over
the
country
study
the
concept
from
the
mill
store
in
the
east
to
california
where
sol
price
start
his
fed
mart
in
then
closer
to
home
herb
gibson
a
barber
from
over
at
berryville
start
his
store
with
a
simple
philosophy
buy
it
low
stack
it
high
sell
it
cheap
he
sell
it
cheaper
than
anybody
ever
have
before
and
he
sell
more
of
it
he
do
it
in
abilene
he
do
it
in
amarillo
and
he
surround
dallas
with
store
then
in
he
come
to
northwest
arkansas
with
a
franchiser
name
howard
and
do
so
well
in
fort
smith
that
he
branch
out
to
the
square
in
fayetteville
and
start
compete
with
our
variety
store
we
knew
we
have
to
act
he
be
the
only
one
discounting
out
this
way
and
because
i
have
make
all
those
trip
back
east
i
be
probably
one
of
the
few
out
here
who
understood
what
he
be
up
to
by
then
i
knew
the
discount
idea
be
the
future
but
i
be
use
to
franchise
and
i
like
the
mind
set
i
generally
like
my
experience
with
ben
franklin
and
i
do
not
want
to
get
involve
in
have
to
build
a
company
with
all
that
support
apparatus
so
first
i
go
up
to
butler
brother
in
chicago
arm
with
my
usual
yellow
legal
pad
full
of
note
and
make
a
big
pitch
for
them
to
back
me
in
a
discounting
venture
i
want
them
to
be
our
wholesale
arm
our
merchandiser
if
they
have
agree
our
family
could
have
continued
our
fairly
normal
lifestyle
in
those
day
i
be
not
as
fully
commit
with
my
time
to
the
business
and
it
would
not
have
be
all
that
difficult
to
put
together
an
organization
with
them
but
they
be
not
interested
then
i
approach
gibson
but
he
already
have
his
franchiser
so
we
could
not
get
together
either
we
really
have
only
two
choice
left
stay
in
the
variety
store
business
which
i
knew
be
go
to
be
hit
hard
by
the
discounting
wave
of
the
future
or
open
a
discount
store
of
course
i
be
not
about
to
sit
there
and
become
a
target
now
right
down
the
road
from
bentonville
sits
rogers
arkansas
which
be
a
good
bit
big
town
but
i
never
could
operate
there
because
max
russell
own
the
ben
franklin
franchise
i
try
to
talk
him
into
go
in
with
me
as
a
partner
and
building
a
big
store
there
but
he
be
not
interested
i
go
ahead
and
start
building
a
store
in
rogers
it
be
a
big
commitment
on
the
family
part
we
could
not
use
ben
franklin
at
all
for
that
store
so
i
have
make
some
arrangement
with
a
distributor
in
springfield
missouri
nobody
want
to
gamble
on
that
first
wal
mart
i
think
bud
put
in
percent
and
don
whitaker
whom
i
have
hire
to
manage
the
store
from
a
tg
y
store
out
in
abilene
texas
put
in
percent
and
i
have
to
put
up
percent
of
the
dollar
helen
have
to
sign
all
the
note
along
with
me
and
her
statement
allow
us
to
borrow
more
than
i
could
have
alone
we
pledge
house
and
property
everything
we
have
but
in
those
day
we
be
always
borrow
to
the
hilt
we
be
about
to
go
into
the
discount
business
for
real
now
and
from
the
time
those
doggone
wal
mart
open
until
almost
today
it
have
be
a
little
challenge
bob
bogle
first
manager
walton
five
and
dime
bentonville
now
retire
from
wal
mart
we
be
fly
to
fort
smith
in
the
spring
of
and
sam
be
pilot
the
plane
over
the
boston
mountain
it
be
that
tri
pacer
by
then
not
the
original
plane
that
we
have
make
a
lot
of
trip
in
sam
pull
this
card
out
of
his
pocket
on
which
he
have
write
down
three
or
four
name
and
he
hand
it
to
me
and
ask
me
which
one
i
like
best
they
all
have
three
or
four
word
in
the
title
and
i
say
well
you
know
scotch
as
i
be
i
would
just
keep
the
walton
name
and
make
it
a
place
to
shop
i
scribble
w
a
l
m
a
r
t
on
the
bottom
of
the
card
and
say
to
begin
with
there
be
not
as
many
letter
to
buy
i
have
bought
the
letter
that
say
ben
franklin
and
i
knew
how
much
it
cost
to
put
them
up
and
to
light
them
and
repair
the
neon
so
i
say
this
be
just
seven
letter
he
do
not
say
anything
and
i
drop
the
subject
a
few
day
later
i
go
by
to
see
when
we
could
start
set
the
fixture
in
the
building
and
i
saw
that
our
sign
maker
rayburn
jacob
already
have
the
w
a
l
up
there
and
be
head
up
the
ladder
with
an
m
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
genius
to
figure
out
what
the
name
be
go
to
be
i
just
smile
and
go
on
something
else
about
that
sign
that
be
worth
mention
on
one
side
of
it
i
have
rayburn
put
we
sell
for
less
and
on
the
other
satisfaction
guaranteed
two
of
the
cornerstone
philosophy
that
still
guide
the
company
after
year
and
year
of
study
the
discount
business
and
experiment
with
it
sort
of
halfheartedly
we
be
finally
get
ready
to
jump
into
it
whole
hog
on
july
we
finally
open
wal
mart
no
and
not
everybody
be
happy
about
it
lee
smith
early
wal
mart
associate
because
there
be
a
ben
franklin
store
in
rogers
run
by
somebody
else
we
really
stir
up
a
hornet
nest
when
we
open
that
first
store
i
vividly
remember
opening
day
along
with
the
crowd
of
shopper
a
group
of
official
from
ben
franklin
in
chicago
all
dress
in
pin
strip
suit
show
up
they
march
in
like
a
military
delegation
and
in
the
front
of
the
store
ask
me
just
as
cold
as
they
could
be
where
be
mr
walton
they
march
on
back
to
sam
office
without
a
word
they
be
back
there
about
a
half
hour
and
then
they
march
out
without
so
much
as
a
goodbye
a
few
minute
later
sam
come
down
and
told
whitaker
and
me
that
they
have
issue
an
ultimatum
do
not
build
any
more
of
these
wal
mart
store
we
knew
he
felt
threaten
because
he
have
all
those
ben
franklin
franchise
but
we
also
knew
sam
walton
be
not
the
kind
of
guy
you
issue
ultimatum
to
to
tell
the
truth
though
that
first
wal
mart
in
rogers
be
not
all
that
great
we
do
a
million
dollar
in
a
year
a
lot
more
than
most
of
our
variety
store
which
do
to
a
year
but
remember
saint
robert
up
there
in
that
army
town
be
do
million
in
sale
once
we
open
rogers
we
sat
there
and
held
our
breath
for
two
year
then
we
put
store
up
in
springdale
a
big
town
near
rogers
and
harrison
a
small
town
here
of
course
i
have
to
let
david
glass
tell
his
now
famous
story
about
come
to
harrison
to
see
what
a
wal
mart
be
and
be
so
horrify
at
the
sight
david
glass
in
those
day
word
be
start
to
get
out
that
a
guy
name
sam
walton
have
some
interest
retailing
idea
so
i
drove
down
from
springfield
where
i
be
with
crank
drug
at
the
time
to
see
a
wal
mart
opening
it
be
the
bad
retail
store
i
have
ever
see
sam
have
brought
a
couple
of
truck
of
watermelon
in
and
stack
them
on
the
sidewalk
he
have
a
donkey
ride
out
in
the
parking
lot
it
be
about
degree
and
the
watermelon
begin
to
pop
and
the
donkey
begin
to
do
what
donkey
do
and
it
all
mixed
together
and
ran
all
over
the
parking
lot
and
when
you
go
inside
the
store
the
mess
just
continued
have
be
tracked
in
all
over
the
floor
he
be
a
nice
fellow
but
i
write
him
off
it
be
just
terrible
i
guess
it
really
be
about
as
bad
as
david
describes
it
but
he
just
happen
to
hit
it
on
its
bad
day
the
store
be
only
square
foot
and
have
an
foot
ceiling
and
a
concrete
floor
with
bare
bone
wooden
plank
fixture
sterling
have
a
huge
variety
store
in
downtown
harrison
with
tile
on
the
floor
nice
light
really
good
fixture
and
good
presentation
ours
be
just
barely
put
together
highly
promotional
truly
ugly
heavy
with
merchandise
but
for
percent
less
than
the
competition
we
be
try
to
find
out
if
customer
in
a
town
of
people
would
come
to
our
kind
of
a
barn
and
buy
the
same
merchandise
strictly
because
of
price
the
answer
be
yes
we
found
out
they
do
and
they
want
it
today
we
have
a
square
foot
store
in
harrison
down
the
road
in
springdale
we
be
try
to
learn
something
else
would
a
really
big
nice
store
work
in
a
large
town
we
open
a
square
foot
wal
mart
there
and
it
quickly
become
our
number
one
store
in
sale
just
to
give
you
some
idea
of
how
the
whole
concept
have
change
over
the
year
we
recently
open
a
gigantic
square
foot
store
in
springdale
and
the
store
in
rogers
today
be
square
foot
compare
to
for
the
original
old
number
one
maybe
a
lot
of
people
saw
the
same
thing
david
glass
observe
that
day
out
there
in
harrison
but
i
be
feel
pretty
good
after
we
get
those
first
three
store
up
and
run
i
knew
it
would
work
wal
mart
be
off
to
a
good
start
and
we
saw
lot
of
potential
but
now
gibson
and
other
folk
be
begin
to
look
at
the
small
town
and
say
hey
maybe
there
be
something
out
there
that
we
ought
to
look
into
we
figure
we
would
well
roll
the
store
out
just
as
quickly
as
we
could

swim
upstream
from
day
one
of
wal
mart
mr
walton
make
it
clear
that
this
be
not
just
ben
franklin
with
low
price
on
some
item
he
want
real
discounting
he
say
we
want
to
discount
everything
we
carry
when
the
other
chain
around
us
be
not
discounting
he
say
we
advertise
that
we
sell
for
less
and
we
mean
it
so
whatever
else
we
do
we
always
have
to
sell
for
less
if
an
item
come
in
and
everybody
else
in
town
be
sell
it
for
twenty
five
cent
we
would
go
with
twenty
one
cent
charlie
cate
store
manager
as
i
say
earlier
once
we
open
that
wal
mart
in
springdale
i
knew
we
be
on
to
something
i
knew
in
my
bone
it
be
go
to
work
but
at
the
time
most
folk
include
my
own
brother
bud
be
pretty
skeptical
of
the
whole
concept
they
thought
wal
mart
be
just
another
one
of
sam
walton
crazy
idea
it
be
totally
unproven
at
the
time
but
it
be
really
what
we
would
be
do
all
along
experiment
try
to
do
something
different
educate
ourselves
as
to
what
be
go
on
in
the
retail
industry
and
try
to
stay
ahead
of
those
trend
this
be
a
big
contradiction
in
my
makeup
that
i
do
not
completely
understand
to
this
day
in
many
of
my
core
value
thing
like
church
and
family
and
civic
leadership
and
even
politics
i
be
a
pretty
conservative
guy
but
for
some
reason
in
business
i
have
always
be
driven
to
buck
the
system
to
innovate
to
take
thing
beyond
where
they
have
be
on
the
one
hand
in
the
community
i
really
be
an
establishment
kind
of
guy
on
the
other
hand
in
the
marketplace
i
have
always
be
a
maverick
who
enjoys
shake
thing
up
and
create
a
little
anarchy
and
sometimes
the
establishment
have
make
me
mad
the
truth
be
when
those
butler
brother
folk
turn
down
my
discounting
idea
i
get
a
little
angry
and
maybe
that
help
me
decide
to
swim
upstream
on
my
own
don
soderquist
former
president
of
ben
franklin
now
vice
chairman
and
chief
operating
officer
wal
mart
i
first
met
sam
in
when
i
be
in
charge
of
data
processing
at
ben
franklin
and
he
be
our
big
franchisee
he
have
already
open
the
rogers
wal
mart
and
he
be
up
in
chicago
try
to
convince
our
officer
to
franchise
his
discount
store
in
small
town
they
give
him
a
flat
no
after
the
meeting
he
come
back
to
see
me
and
move
right
on
to
the
subject
of
computer
he
want
to
know
all
about
how
we
be
use
them
and
how
we
be
planning
to
use
them
and
he
take
everything
i
say
down
on
this
yellow
legal
pad
the
next
day
be
saturday
and
i
go
shopping
dress
in
a
pair
of
mangy
cutoff
jean
at
the
kmart
near
my
house
i
walk
over
into
the
apparel
section
and
saw
this
guy
talk
to
one
of
the
clerk
i
thought

like
that
guy
i
met
yesterday
what
the
heck
be
he
do
way

well
how
frequently
do
you
order
uh
huh
how
much
do
you
order
and
if

on
a
tuesday
when

the
merchandise
come
in
he
be
write
everything
she
say
down
in
a
little
blue
spiral
notebook
then
sam
get
down
on
his
hand
and
knee
and
he
be
look
under
this
stack
table
and
he
open
the
slide
door
and
say
how

know
how
much
you
have
get

when
you
be

order
finally
i
say
sam
walton
be
that
you
and
he
look
up
from
the
floor
and
say
oh

be

here
i
say
i
be
shopping

and
he
say
oh

be
just
part
of
the
educational
process
that
be
all
of
course
he
be
still
do
the
same
thing
today
except
he
us
his
little
tape
recorder
i
guess
everybody
who
knew
i
be
go
ahead
with
the
discounting
idea
on
my
own
really
do
think
i
would
completely
lose
my
mind
i
laugh
now
when
i
look
back
on
wal
mart
begin
in
the
discount
industry
be
fairly
young
and
full
of
high
living
big
spending
promoter
drive
around
in
cadillacs
guy
like
herb
gibson
who
have
the
world
by
the
tail
but
it
have
very
few
of
what
you
would
call
good
operator
until
the
year
which
turn
out
to
be
the
big
one
for
discounting
in
that
year
four
company
that
i
know
of
start
discount
chain
s
s
kresge
a
big
store
variety
chain
open
a
discount
store
in
garden
city
michigan
and
call
it
kmart
f
w
woolworth
the
granddaddy
of
them
all
start
its
woolco
chain
dayton
hudson
out
of
minneapolis
open
its
first
target
store
and
some
independent
down
in
rogers
arkansas
open
something
call
a
wal
mart
at
the
time
and
for
quite
a
while
after
that
i
can
guarantee
you
that
hardly
anybody
notice
that
last
guy
heck
within
five
year
kmart
have
store
to
our
and
sale
of
more
than
million
to
our
million
here
be
what
make
me
laugh
today
it
would
have
be
absolutely
impossible
to
convince
anybody
back
then
that
in
thirty
year
most
all
of
the
early
discounter
would
be
go
that
three
of
these
four
new
chain
would
be
the
big
best
run
operator
in
the
business
that
the
one
to
fold
up
would
be
woolco
and
that
the
big
most
profitable
one
would
be
the
one
down
in
arkansas
sometimes
even
i
have
trouble
believe
it
i
can
tell
you
this
though
after
a
lifetime
of
swim
upstream
i
be
convince
that
one
of
the
real
secret
to
wal
mart
phenomenal
success
have
be
that
very
tendency
many
of
our
best
opportunity
be
create
out
of
necessity
the
thing
that
we
be
force
to
learn
and
do
because
we
start
out
underfinanced
and
undercapitalized
in
these
remote
small
community
contribute
mightily
to
the
way
we
have
grown
as
a
company
have
we
be
capitalize
or
have
we
be
the
offshoot
of
a
large
corporation
the
way
i
want
to
be
we
might
not
ever
have
try
the
harrison
or
the
rogers
or
the
springdales
and
all
those
other
little
town
we
go
into
in
the
early
day
it
turn
out
that
the
first
big
lesson
we
learn
be
that
there
be
much
much
more
business
out
there
in
small
town
america
than
anybody
include
me
have
ever
dream
of
clarence
lei
second
manager
wal
mart
no
when
we
open
wal
mart
no
in
springdale
sam
want
a
red
hot
price
on
antifreeze
so
he
get
two
or
three
truckloads
of
prestone
and
price
it
at
a
gallon
then
he
price
crest
toothpaste
at
cent
a
tube
well
we
have
people
come
from
as
far
as
tulsa
to
buy
toothpaste
and
antifreeze
the
crowd
be
so
big
that
the
fire
department
make
us
open
the
door
for
five
minute
then
lock
them
until
shopper
left
sam
grabbed
a
tackle
box
and
start
use
it
as
a
cash
register
check
people
out
as
fast
as
he
could
we
stuck
with
what
we
have
learn
in
the
variety
store
business
about
customer
service
and
satisfaction
guaranteed
but
i
have
to
admit
that
in
those
day
we
do
not
have
anywhere
near
the
emphasis
on
quality
that
we
have
today
what
we
be
obsess
with
be
keep
our
price
below
everybody
else
our
dedication
to
that
idea
be
total
everybody
work
like
crazy
to
keep
the
expense
down
we
try
to
build
decent
building
but
we
have
to
keep
the
rent
down
we
never
like
to
pay
more
than
a
square
foot
our
store
really
do
not
look
that
good
they
be
not
professional
at
all
we
open
one
store
number
in
morrilton
arkansas
that
be
really
a
sight
we
rent
this
old
coca
cola
bottle
plant
it
be
all
broken
up
into
five
room
and
we
bought
some
old
fixture
from
a
fail
gibson
store
for
we
hung
them
by
baling
wire
from
the
ceiling
we
have
clothes
hang
in
layer
on
conduit
pipe
all
the
way
to
the
ceiling
and
shelf
wire
into
the
wall
but
this
be
really
a
small
small
town
so
number
be
another
experiment
we
do
not
have
system
we
do
not
have
order
program
we
do
not
have
a
basic
merchandise
assortment
we
certainly
do
not
have
any
sort
of
computer
in
fact
when
i
look
at
it
today
i
realize
that
so
much
of
what
we
do
in
the
begin
be
really
poorly
do
but
we
manage
to
sell
our
merchandise
as
low
as
we
possibly
could
and
that
kept
us
right
side
up
for
the
first
ten
year
that
and
consistently
improve
our
sale
in
these
small
market
by
building
up
our
relationship
with
the
customer
the
idea
be
simple
when
customer
thought
of
wal
mart
they
should
think
of
low
price
and
satisfaction
guaranteed
they
could
be
pretty
sure
they
would
not
find
it
cheaper
anywhere
else
and
if
they
do
not
like
it
they
could
bring
it
back
clarence
lei
rogers
have
be
open
about
a
year
and
everything
be
just
pile
up
on
table
with
no
rhyme
or
reason
whatsoever
sam
ask
me
to
kind
of
group
the
stuff
by
category
or
department
and
that
be
when
we
begin
our
department
system
the
thing
i
remember
most
though
be
the
way
we
price
good
merchandise
would
come
in
and
we
would
just
lay
it
down
on
the
floor
and
get
out
the
invoice
sam
would
not
let
us
hedge
on
a
price
at
all
say
the
list
price
be
but
we
have
only
paid
cent
initially
i
would
say
well
it
be
originally
so
why
do
not
we
sell
it
for
and
he
would
say
no
we
paid
cent
for
it
mark
it
up
percent
and
that
be
it
no
matter
what
you
pay
for
it
if
we
get
a
great
deal
pas
it
on
to
the
customer
and
of
course
that
be
what
we
do
it
be
a
little
frustrate
there
for
a
while
be
out
on
our
own
in
addition
to
no
basic
merchandise
assortment
we
have
no
real
replenishment
system
we
do
not
even
have
inventory
book
like
we
have
with
the
ben
franklin
store
where
if
necessary
you
could
simply
look
over
what
you
need
and
order
it
from
butler
brother
then
price
it
accordingly
we
have
no
establish
distributor
no
credit
salesman
would
just
show
up
at
our
door
and
we
would
try
to
get
the
best
deal
we
could
sometimes
it
be
difficult
get
the
big
company
the
procter
gamble
eastman
kodaks
whoever
to
call
on
us
at
all
and
when
they
do
they
would
dictate
to
us
how
much
they
would
sell
us
and
at
what
price
p
g
give
a
percent
discount
if
you
paid
within
ten
day
and
if
you
do
not
man
they
take
that
discount
right
off
i
do
not
mind
say
that
we
be
the
victim
of
a
good
bit
of
arrogance
from
a
lot
of
vendor
in
those
day
they
do
not
need
us
and
they
act
that
way
i
never
could
understand
it
to
me
it
always
seem
like
a
customer
be
a
customer
and
you
ought
to
try
to
sell
them
what
you
could
the
big
challenge
be
buying
health
and
beauty
aid
at
low
cost
and
stay
stock
up
on
them
because
those
item
be
really
at
the
heart
of
almost
every
early
discounter
strategy
i
figure
that
out
after
i
go
into
the
first
gibson
store
his
whole
concept
be
to
buy
direct
at
a
low
cost
than
individual
store
could
buy
then
charge
a
month
to
run
one
of
his
franchise
and
he
would
act
as
the
store
buying
agent
the
basic
discounter
idea
be
to
attract
customer
into
the
store
by
pricing
these
item
toothpaste
mouthwash
headache
remedy
soap
shampoo
right
down
at
cost
those
be
what
the
early
discounter
call
your
image
item
that
be
what
you
push
in
your
newspaper
advertising
like
the
twenty
seven
cent
crest
at
springdale
and
you
stack
it
high
in
the
store
to
call
attention
to
what
a
great
deal
it
be
word
would
get
around
that
you
have
really
low
price
everything
else
in
the
store
be
price
low
too
but
it
have
a
percent
margin
health
and
beauty
aid
be
price
to
give
away
as
far
as
building
the
company
up
we
simply
have
no
time
for
it
we
be
too
busy
concentrate
on
day
to
day
operation
i
have
move
my
office
from
the
ben
franklin
on
the
bentonville
square
to
an
old
garage
nearby
where
i
work
with
three
lady
who
help
out
with
the
bookkeeping
by
the
early
sixty
we
have
eighteen
variety
store
and
a
handful
of
wal
mart
for
a
time
in
there
we
own
a
mix
of
several
different
type
of
store
we
have
variety
store
under
both
the
ben
franklin
and
walton
name
as
well
as
our
wal
mart
discount
store
for
year
while
we
be
building
wal
mart
we
continued
to
run
our
various
ben
franklin
and
walton
variety
store
but
we
gradually
phase
them
out
usually
replace
them
with
wal
mart
we
kept
a
little
pigeonhole
on
the
wall
for
the
cash
receipt
and
paperwork
of
each
store
i
have
a
blue
binder
ledger
book
for
each
store
when
we
add
a
store
we
add
a
pigeonhole
i
know
we
do
that
at
least
up
to
twenty
store
then
once
a
month
wanda
wiseman
and
i
would
close
those
book
enter
the
merchandise
enter
the
sale
enter
the
cash
balance
it
and
close
them
nowadays
you
hear
a
lot
about
fancy
accounting
method
like
lifo
and
fifo
but
back
then
we
be
use
the
esp
method
which
really
speed
thing
along
when
it
come
time
to
close
those
book
it
be
a
pretty
basic
method
if
you
ca
not
make
your
book
balance
you
take
however
much
they
be
off
by
and
enter
it
under
the
head
esp
which
stand
for
error
some
place
then
we
would
come
up
with
a
profit
and
loss
sheet
a
p
l
for
each
store
and
get
it
out
to
that
store
manager
as
quickly
as
we
could
something
we
still
do
today
if
there
be
a
problem
i
would
get
with
that
manager
immediately
but
most
of
them
own
a
piece
of
their
store
so
they
be
likely
to
be
as
concerned
as
i
be
i
have
a
big
ledger
sheet
paste
together
to
make
room
for
everything
i
want
on
it
probably
fifteen
different
column
for
every
store
it
have
column
for
sale
expense
net
profit
markdowns
everything
utility
postage
insurance
tax
i
enter
the
number
myself
each
month
with
a
pen
which
help
me
remember
them
well
it
become
a
habit
with
me
and
i
carry
this
ledger
sheet
in
my
pocket
when
i
go
to
the
store
so
everybody
always
knew
exactly
where
they
stood
for
several
year
the
company
be
just
me
and
the
manager
in
the
store
most
of
them
come
to
us
from
variety
store
and
they
turn
into
the
great
bunch
of
discount
merchant
anybody
ever
saw
we
all
work
together
but
each
of
them
have
lot
of
freedom
to
try
all
kind
of
crazy
thing
themselves
the
closest
thing
we
have
to
an
operation
manager
be
don
whitaker
the
guy
i
hire
from
tg
y
out
in
abilene
to
be
our
first
wal
mart
manager
after
that
he
become
our
first
regional
manager
don
have
barely
finish
high
school
if
that
and
he
have
terrible
grammar
he
threw
people
off
sometimes
because
he
only
have
one
eye
and
he
look
at
you
sort
of
funny
but
he
be
one
of
the
fine
people
i
have
ever
know
in
my
life
everybody
call
him
whitaker
and
he
be
a
hard
work
practical
smart
fellow
he
have
a
great
big
heart
but
he
be
gruff
and
he
scar
all
the
young
folk
to
death
there
be
never
any
question
that
he

the
bos

when
he
want
something
do
believe
me
it
get
do
i
single
him
out
here
because
don
whitaker
be
very
very
important
in
the
early
development
of
the
company
establish
the
philosophy
of
let
be
out
front
let
do
it
right
let
get
it
do
now
and
get
on
with
it
claude
harris
wal
mart
first
buyer
sam
be
very
sharp
on
be
able
to
read
people
and
their
personality
and
their
integrity
and
he
do
not
make
any
mistake
back
there
pick
people
if
i
do
say
so
myself
really
back
early
one
bad
manager
could
have
pull
us
under
when
you
be
only
make
or
maybe
a
year
net
in
a
store
it
would
have
only
take
one
or
two
manager
who
be
dishonest
to
lose
the
whole
company
sam
would
meet
them
in
the
store
where
they
work
and
invite
them
down
to
look
at
his
store
you
know
he
be
a
very
persuasive
man
he
could
charm
a
bird
out
of
a
tree
and
he
and
helen
would
have
you
out
to
the
house
and
serve
ice
cream
and
they
would
always
ask
if
you
and
your
family
go
to
church
he
be
so
good
at
evaluate
and
select
these
fellow
he
be
not
just
look
for
store
manager
i
think
he
be
select
people
he
thought
he
could
go
forward
with
he
be
progressive
he
knew
that
he
need
something
and
he
be
look
for
it
and
he
be
get
it
every
step
of
the
way
we
found
claude
over
in
memphis
run
a
woolworth
store
he
be
from
muskogee
oklahoma
and
about
one
quarter
indian
and
he
have
start
with
woolworth
out
of
high
school
none
of
these
fellow
like
don
or
claude
have
any
college
and
they
do
not
want
me
hire
any
college
men
they
have
the
idea
that
college
graduate
would
not
get
down
and
scrub
floor
and
wash
window
the
classic
training
in
those
day
be
to
put
a
two
wheeler
you
know
a
cart
that
you
carry
merchandise
on
into
a
guy
hand
within
the
first
thirty
minute
he
come
to
work
and
get
him
push
freight
out
of
the
back
room
they
all
come
out
of
these
variety
store
with
the
same
background
and
the
same
kind
of
philosophy
and
education
and
we
look
for
the
action
orient
do
it
now
go
type
of
folk
claude
have
four
or
five
kid
and
be
probably
make
a
year
maybe
i
haul
up
in
front
of
his
soda
fountain
one
day
and
start
talk
to
him
i
found
out
that
he
have
be
able
to
save
on
his
salary
and
i
usually
felt
that
if
a
fellow
could
manage
his
own
finance
he
would
be
more
successful
manage
one
of
our
store
we
put
him
into
our
variety
store
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
in
fayetteville
so
he
have
to
compete
against
our
other
store
on
the
west
side
of
the
square
which
be
run
by
charlie
cate
and
supervise
by
charlie
baum
at
the
time
that
be
a
real
test
because
nobody
be
more
competitive
than
charlie
baum
he
would
compete
with
a
buzzsaw
but
claude
be
so
skillful
and
nice
that
charlie
have
to
get
along
with
him
to
some
degree
claude
harris
my
store
be
not
make
much
money
and
we
be
start
to
get
competition
from
gibson
which
also
have
a
little
store
on
the
square
down
there
it
be
obvious
that
their
discounting
thing
be
work
and
they
be
pull
everybody
in
with
their
health
and
beauty
aid
hba
we
call
it
so
i
thought
well
why
do
not
i
try
that
in
my
variety
store
i
change
the
whole
store
around
and
get
mckesson
robbins
down
in
price
and
put
in
a
bunch
of
over
the
counter
drug
it
be
the
first
discount
department
in
our
company
the
health
and
beauty
aid
department
at
the
east
side
of
the
square
in
fayetteville
but
i
like
to
have
lose
my
best
friend
over
that
one
charlie
baum
like
to
have
have
a
heart
attack
he
thought
i
be
try
to
undercut
him
you
get
to
understand
that
charlie
be
one
of
the
most
competitive
people
who
ever
live
he
will
fight
you
tooth
and
toenail
at
bridge
or
anything
i
be
just
try
to
see
where
it
might
lead
us
anyway
sam
knew
all
about
it
and
he
say
go
ahead
and
try
it
he
would
always
try
thing
like
that
he
be
always
open
to
suggestion
and
that
be
one
reason
he
be
be
such
a
success
he
be
still
that
way
when
i
start
buying
for
wal
mart
i
would
often
take
claude
along
with
me
pretty
soon
we
make
him
wal
mart
general
merchandise
manager
he
do
not
have
any
more
experience
at
be
a
general
merchandise
manager
than
the
guy
off
the
street
he
be
a
store
manager
but
we
do
not
have
anybody
else
so
he
become
general
merchandise
manager
i
do
not
even
know
when
we
finally
brought
our
first
professional
buyer
or
even
someone
who
have
ever
have
any
buying
experience
into
the
company
but
it
be
year
later
i
guess
the
thing
those
early
manager
and
i
all
have
the
most
in
common
be
that
we
all
love
merchandising
do
not
get
me
wrong
our
early
store
be
not
all
that
well
merchandise
by
that
i
mean
we
do
not
necessarily
have
the
best
assortment
of
merchandise
available
all
displayed
seductively
because
remember
we
do
not
have
any
real
distribution
system
and
we
have
to
buy
where
we
could
but
we
all
love
to
find
unusual
item
and
the
store
manager
have
a
lot
of
freedom
to
try
different
thing
charlie
cate
sam
have
us
send
our
sale
report
in
every
week
and
along
with
it
we
have
to
send
in
a
best
sell
item
i
mean
we
have
to
what
he
be
do
be
teach
us
to
look
for
what
sell
all
the
time
you
have
to
look
because
you
have
to
send
in
this
report
every
week
and
if
you
report
that
nothing
be
sell
well
mr
walton
would
not
be
happy
he
would
think
you
be
not
study
your
merchandise
and
in
that
case
he
would
come
study
it
for
you
he
be
be
that
way
ever
since
i
first
met
him
in
it
be
almost
embarrass
to
admit
this
but
it
be
true
there
have
not
be
a
day
in
my
adult
life
when
i
have
not
spent
some
time
think
about
merchandising
i
suspect
i
have
emphasize
item
merchandising
and
the
importance
of
promote
item
to
a
great
degree
than
most
any
other
retail
management
person
in
this
country
it
have
be
an
absolute
passion
of
mine
it
be
what
i
enjoy
do
as
much
as
anything
in
the
business
i
really
love
to
pick
an
item
maybe
the
most
basic
merchandise
and
then
call
attention
to
it
we
use
to
say
you
could
sell
anything
if
you
hung
it
from
the
ceiling
so
we
would
buy
huge
quantity
of
something
and
dramatize
it
we
would
blow
it
out
of
there
when
everybody
knew
we
would
have
only
sell
a
few
have
we
just
left
it
in
the
normal
store
position
it
be
one
of
the
thing
that
have
set
our
company
apart
from
the
very
begin
and
really
make
us
difficult
to
compete
with
and
man
in
the
early
day
of
wal
mart
it
really
get
crazy
sometimes
phil
green
early
wal
mart
manager
me
and
sam
use
to
have
a
big
time
pick
item
we
would
go
buy
a
dallas
newspaper
and
a
little
rock
newspaper
and
a
fort
smith
newspaper
and
he
would
say
well
now
phil
let
make
us
up
some
kind
of
an
ad
for
this
weekend
so
we
would
look
around
the
store
and
find
a
big
display
of
sock
or
a
big
display
of
panty
or
a
wastebasket
or
a
broom
or
a
big
old
stack
of
motor
oil
we
would
pick
out
say
twenty
item
and
then
we
would
sit
down
on
the
floor
with
a
pair
of
scissors
and
go
through
those
newspaper
until
we
found
some
store
that
have
run
oil
and
we
would
just
cut
out
the
oil
can
and
paste
it
on
there
and
write
pennzoil
w
and
stick
our
price
on
it
and
we
would
do
the
same
thing
for
the
sock
and
the
panty
and
the
wastebasket
just
make
up
our
own
ad
out
of
everybody
else
ad
in
those
newspaper
but
it
work
because
we
make
real
hot
price
he
would
say
there
be
no
use
run
an
ad
everybody
else
be
run
for
the
same
price
or
why
would
they
come
in
sam
be
a
dime
store
man
so
at
first
he
want
to
make
a
certain
percentage
of
profit
on
everything
but
he
come
around
to
the
idea
that
a
real
hot
item
would
really
bring
them
in
the
store
so
we
finally
start
run
thing
like
toothpaste
for
sixteen
cent
a
tube
then
we
would
have
to
worry
about
get
enough
of
it
in
stock
a
little
later
on
phil
ran
what
become
one
of
the
most
famous
item
promotion
in
our
history
we
sent
him
down
to
open
store
number
in
hot
spring
arkansas
the
first
store
we
ever
open
in
a
town
that
already
have
a
kmart
phil
get
there
and
decide
kmart
have
be
get
away
with
some
pretty
high
price
in
the
absence
of
any
discounting
competition
so
he
work
up
a
detergent
promotion
that
turn
into
the
world
large
display
ever
of
tide
or
maybe
cheer
some
detergent
he
work
out
a
deal
to
get
about
off
a
case
if
he
would
buy
some
absolutely
ridiculous
amount
of
detergent
something
like
case
of
the
giant
size
box
then
he
ran
it
as
an
ad
promotion
for
say
a
box
off
from
the
usual
well
when
all
of
us
in
the
bentonville
office
saw
how
much
he
would
bought
we
really
thought
old
phil
have
completely
go
over
the
dam
this
be
an
unbelievable
amount
of
soap
it
make
up
a
pyramid
of
detergent
box
that
ran
twelve
to
eighteen
case
high
all
the
way
to
the
ceiling
and
it
be
or
foot
long
which
take
up
the
whole
aisle
across
the
back
of
the
store
and
then
it
be
about
foot
wide
so
you
could
hardly
get
past
it
i
think
a
lot
of
company
would
have
fire
phil
for
that
one
but
we
always
felt
we
have
to
try
some
of
this
crazy
stuff
phil
green
mr
sam
usually
let
me
do
whatever
i
want
on
these
promotion
because
he
figure
i
be
not
go
to
screw
it
up
but
on
this
one
he
come
down
and
say
why
do
you
buy
so
much
you
ca
not
sell
all
of
this
but
the
thing
be
so
big
it
make
the
news
and
everybody
come
to
look
at
it
and
it
be
all
go
in
a
week
i
have
another
one
that
scar
them
up
in
bentonville
too
this
guy
from
murray
of
ohio
call
one
day
and
say
he
have
murray
horsepower
rid
mower
available
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
he
could
let
us
have
them
for
do
we
want
any
and
i
say
yeah
i
will
take
and
he
say
two
hundred
we
would
be
sell
them
for
i
think
so
when
they
come
in
we
unpacked
every
one
of
them
and
line
them
all
up
out
in
front
of
the
store
twenty
five
in
a
row
eight
row
deep
ran
a
chain
through
them
and
put
a
big
sign
up
that
say
h
p
murray
tractor
sell
every
one
of
them
i
guess
i
be
just
always
a
promoter
and
be
an
early
wal
mart
manager
be
as
good
a
place
to
promote
as
there
ever
be
i
will
tell
you
phil
not
only
like
to
swim
upstream
he
like
to
do
it
with
weight
strap
on
just
to
show
he
could
do
it
thing
may
not
be
quite
as
wild
today
as
they
once
be
but
be
a
wal
mart
manager
be
still
a
great
place
to
promote
item
because
it
be
such
a
part
of
our
heritage
and
it
be
a
part
we
have
well
always
hold
on
to
over
the
year
i
have
have
so
much
fun
with
this
and
it
really
be
amaze
how
much
merchandise
you
can
move
with
just
a
little
promotion
folk
always
ask
me
what
be
some
of
the
big
moment
i
remember
in
the
history
of
wal
mart
and
i
usually
say
oh
when
we
pass
a
billion
dollar
in
sale
or
billion
or
whatever
but
the
truth
be
some
of
my
fond
memory
be
of
plain
old
everyday
item
that
we
sell
a
ton
of
by
present
nicely
on
endcaps
display
at
the
end
of
aisle
or
on
table
out
in
action
alley
the
big
horizontal
aisle
run
across
a
store
just
behind
the
checkout
counter
i
guess
real
merchant
be
like
real
fisherman
we
have
a
special
place
in
our
memory
for
a
few
of
the
big
one
i
realize
this
may
sound
boring
to
most
of
you
but
one
of
my
best
item
ever
be
a
mattress
pad
call
a
bedmate
i
think
i
picked
this
one
up
one
day
by
go
out
and
talk
to
one
of
those
salesman
wait
in
the
lobby
which
be
something
i
like
to
do
from
time
to
time
just
to
keep
in
touch
at
the
time
i
do
not
think
we
even
carry
mattress
pad
but
somehow
or
another
i
felt
it
be
an
unexplored
item
or
an
item
we
should
have
so
we
bought
a
bunch
of
the
pad
lower
the
price
and
the
margin
a
little
bit
displayed
them
prominently
and
it
have
become
one
of
the
most
fantastic
item
we
have
ever
have
in
our
store
i
have
somebody
check
for
me
the
other
day
and
since
we
introduce
the
bedmate
in
we
have
sell
over
five
and
a
half
million
of
those
doggoned
thing
another
day
i
walk
out
into
the
lobby
and
begin
talk
with
this
salesman
from
the
aladdin
company
the
folk
who
make
thermos
bottle
he
have
his
sample
with
him
and
i
ask
him
the
usual
question
what
do
you
have
that
be
real
hot
that
we
could
promote
successfully
and
he
have
a
half
gallon
red
and
blue
thermos
bottle
that
look
real
handsome
and
he
say
this
will
make
a
great
special
we
will
give
you
this
kind
of
price
and
you
can
sell
it
for
such
and
such
i
say
let
talk
about
it
so
i
get
him
down
a
little
more
ran
it
at
an
even
low
price
and
we
go
crazy
with
that
thing
we
sell
carload
of
that
thermos
by
shoot
it
into
the
store
for
a
while
there
i
get
to
think
that
maybe
i
be
just
a
genius
at
pick
these
item
they
all
do
so
well
but
i
finally
realize
that
because
i
be
the
chairman
and
because
they
knew
i
would
be
come
into
their
store
sooner
or
later
our
associate
would
get
at
it
on
those
item
i
chose
and
move
those
thing
right
on
out
i
learn
i
have
to
be
careful
the
time
we
promote
the
moon
pie
these
gooey
marshmallow
snack
which
be
real
popular
in
the
south
be
another
one
of
my
great
item
i
get
on
to
them
in
tennessee
where
i
ran
into
a
department
head
a
woman
who
have
be
sell
moon
pie
in
an
unbelievable
way
just
by
put
them
out
where
folk
would
notice
them
well
i
knew
they
be
not
be
push
across
wal
mart
because
i
hardly
ever
saw
them
around
in
the
store
so
i
take
her
idea
come
back
get
with
the
buyer
call
the
company
and
say
hey
what
if
i
make
the
moon
pie
my
item
ship
it
to
all
our
store
and
sell
it
five
for
instead
of
cent
apiece
they
go
for
it
and
come
down
in
their
price
to
cent
apiece
we
charge
cent
and
sell
moon
pie
or
worth
in
one
week
company
wide
it
be
a
real
winner
the
problem
be
everybody
get
carry
away
with
my
item
and
we
ship
them
to
wisconsin
those
people
up
there
never
heard
of
moon
pie
before
and
they
be
not
too
interested
in
learn
about
them
it
be
the
kind
of
mistake
we
have
to
watch
out
for
once
we
get
so
big
david
glass
we
have
this
executive
vpi
volume
produce
item
contest
you
know
but
it
be
really
hard
to
compete
with
sam
on
it
because
it
be
just
unbelievable
the
compliance
he
get
i
think
the
chattanooga
bakery
which
make
moon
pie
make
him
their
man
of
the
year
if
they
do
not
they
should
have
no
one
in
history
have
ever
even
dream
you
could
sell
moon
pie
like
that
but
see
if
he
pick
an
item
he
will
say
he
want
a
table
in
front
of
the
check
stand
and
he
want
fifteen
case
of
moon
pie
there
broken
down
into
vanilla
chocolate
and
caramel
in
whatever
ratio
he
decides
they
be
go
to
sell
that
bedmate
thing
be
ordinarily
a
side
counter
item
maybe
you
stock
four
on
a
side
counter
and
they
sell
a
few
a
month
well
sam
take
a
table
in
action
alley
design
the
sign
himself
and
make
a
rule
that
you
have
to
keep
the
thing
full
of
bedmates
of
course
it
just
explode
ask
him
about
his
minnow
bucket
though
that
be
his
bad
item
ever
that
be
the
same
year
i
won
the
contest
with
seneca
apple
juice
it
be
just
sensational
it
sell
ton
so
i
would
go
to
the
store
and
get
them
to
take
that
minnow
bucket
up
front
to
the
people
greeter
at
the
door
put
ice
in
it
ice
down
the
apple
juice
and
give
away
sample
out
of
his
minnow
bucket
i
particularly
do
it
in
store
i
knew
he
be
go
to
visit
it
drove
him
crazy
and
he
get
off
that
minnow
bucket
pretty
quick
we
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
all
this
item
promotion
but
here
be
what
it
be
really
all
about
the
philosophy
it
teach
which
rub
off
on
all
the
associate
and
the
store
manager
and
the
department
head
be
that
your
store
be
full
of
item
that
can
explode
into
big
volume
and
big
profit
if
you
be
just
smart
enough
to
identify
them
and
take
the
trouble
to
promote
them
it
have
be
a
real
key
to
help
this
company
dramatically
increase
its
sale
per
square
foot
if
you
be
go
to
show
the
kind
of
double
digit
comparable
store
sale
increase
that
we
show
every
year
and
grow
a
company
the
way
we
have
grown
ours
you
have
to
be
merchandise
driven
otherwise
you
become
like
everybody
else
i
can
name
you
a
lot
of
retailer
who
be
originally
merchandise
driven
but
somehow
lose
it
over
the
year
in
retail
you
be
either
operation
driven
where
your
main
thrust
be
toward
reduce
expense
and
improve
efficiency
or
you
be
merchandise
driven
the
one
that
be
truly
merchandise
driven
can
always
work
on
improve
operation
but
the
one
that
be
operation
driven
tend
to
level
off
and
begin
to
deteriorate
so
sam
item
promotion
mania
be
a
great
game
and
we
all
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
it
but
it
be
also
at
the
heart
of
what
creates
our
extraordinary
high
sale
per
square
foot
which
enable
us
to
dominate
our
competition
by
the
way
i
be
promote
an
item
in
the
store
this
year
that
i
think
be
a
real
winner
a
halogen
car
headlight
for
only
i
team
up
on
it
with
jack
welch
the
ceo
of
general
electric
it
be
a
good
example
of
how
we
be
cooperate
with
our
big
vendor
these
day
at
the
high
level
in
the
early
day
of
wal
mart
this
period
we
have
be
talk
about
i
really
believe
our
emphasis
on
item
promotion
help
us
to
make
up
for
a
lot
of
shortcoming
we
have
an
unsophisticated
buying
program
a
less
than
ideal
merchandise
assortment
and
practically
no
back
office
support
it
be
another
way
of
swim
upstream
we
make
up
for
what
we
do
not
have
by
be
merchant
the
only
other
reason
the
thing
held
together
back
then
be
that
from
the
very
start
we
would
get
all
our
manager
together
once
a
week
and
critique
ourselves
that
be
really
our
buying
organization
a
bunch
of
store
manager
get
together
early
saturday
morning
maybe
in
bentonville
or
maybe
in
some
motel
room
somewhere
we
would
review
what
we
have
bought
and
see
how
many
dollar
we
have
commit
to
it
we
would
plan
promotion
and
plan
the
item
we
intend
to
buy
really
we
be
planning
our
merchandising
program
and
it
work
so
well
that
over
the
year
as
we
grow
and
built
the
company
it
just
become
part
of
our
culture
i
guess
that
be
the
forerunner
of
our
saturday
morning
meeting
we
want
everybody
to
know
what
be
go
on
and
everybody
to
be
aware
of
the
mistake
we
make
when
somebody
make
a
bad
mistake
whether
it
be
myself
or
anybody
else
we
talk
about
it
admit
it
try
to
figure
out
how
to
correct
it
and
then
move
on
to
the
next
day
work
another
way
we
try
hard
to
make
up
for
our
lack
of
experience
and
sophistication
be
to
spend
as
much
time
as
we
could
check
out
the
competition
it
be
something
i
do
from
the
begin
and
it
be
something
i
insist
all
our
manager
do
charlie
cate
i
remember
him
say
over
and
over
again
go
in
and
check
our
competition
check
everyone
who
be
our
competition
and
do
not
look
for
the
bad
look
for
the
good
if
you
get
one
good
idea
that
be
one
more
than
you
go
into
the
store
with
and
we
must
try
to
incorporate
it
into
our
company
we
be
really
not
concerned
with
what
they
be
do
wrong
we
be
concerned
with
what
they
be
do
right
and
everyone
be
do
something
right
clarence
lei
when
gibson
first
come
into
rogers
we
practically
live
between
the
two
store
my
assistant
john
jacob
and
larry
english
would
go
over
there
and
walk
through
their
store
try
to
memorize
price
then
they
would
come
out
and
write
them
all
down
but
there
be
a
great
big
open
trash
bin
out
behind
that
store
and
at
night
after
both
store
be
close
john
and
larry
would
go
over
to
gibson
and
get
down
in
their
trash
and
check
as
many
price
as
they
could
find
i
guess
we
have
very
little
capacity
for
embarrassment
back
in
those
day
we
paid
absolutely
no
attention
whatsoever
to
the
way
thing
be
suppose
to
be
do
you
know
the
way
the
rule
of
retail
say
it
have
to
be
do
you
should
have
see
us
on
some
of
those
early
buying
trip
to
new
york
we
have
hire
this
wholesaler
from
springfield
missouri
a
guy
name
jim
haik
to
work
with
us
as
sort
of
an
agent
we
have
bought
good
from
him
so
we
say
we
need
someone
to
hold
our
hand
and
take
us
around
new
york
to
get
some
merchandise
jim
be
a
good
guy
a
straight
guy
he
take
don
whitaker
and
me
around
and
introduce
us
to
his
source
he
would
say
these
be
guy
from
a
little
chain
down
in
arkansas
and
they
be
good
people
we
bought
dress
and
blouse
and
girl
and
infant
and
again
we
be
mostly
item
buyer
we
do
not
buy
like
other
chain
where
a
buyer
specializes
in
one
line
of
merchandise
and
just
buy
that
one
line
i
do
not
think
any
of
those
guy
in
new
york
really
understood
our
think
but
we
be
a
store
whose
profit
and
volume
have
to
be
driven
by
find
real
bargain
on
thing
we
could
promote
out
in
the
stick
and
we
do
i
usually
found
my
best
buy
in
men
shirt
from
a
guy
name
harry
criss
at
colonial
manufacturing
he
would
give
us
special
treatment

extra
time
to
work

street
i
always
appreciate
that
and
i
bought
a
lot
of

budget
and
we
knew
we
could
spend
x
amount
of
dollar
whatever
it
be
we
would
have
for
this
department
or
for
that
one
right
on
down
the
line
so
here
we
be
a
bunch
of
guy
from
arkansas
wander
around
new
york
city
it
be
all
new
to
me
i
have
never
be
to
new
york
city
sam
would
split
us
up
into
pair
some
would
buy
domestic
others
lady
top
and
bottom
whatever
so
one
day
he
say
bud
you
and
don
whitaker
go
buy
men
department
well
neither
one
of
us
have
ever
bought
men
before
we
be
mostly
hardlines
merchant
who
do
not
know
much
about
clothes
we
go
down
to
the
empire
state
building
where
all
the
men
clothes
manufacturer
be
and
i
will
never
forget
that
day
as
long
as
i
live
i
have
never
see
anything
like
it
we
get
real
carry
away
and
just
bought
sweater
pant
all
kind
of
stuff
then
at
night
we
would
get
together
back
at
our
hotel
room
and
see
what
we
would
spent
most
of
the
time
we
would
have
overbought
and
somebody
would
have
to
go
back
the
next
day
and
cancel
a
few
order
gary
reinboth
from
the
very
begin
sam
be
always
try
to
instill
in
us
that
you
just
do
not
go
to
new
york
and
roll
with
the
flow
we
always
walk
everywhere
we
never
take
cab
and
sam
have
an
equation
for
the
trip
our
expense
should
never
exceed
percent
of
our
purchase
so
we
would
all
crowd
in
these
little
hotel
room
somewhere
down
around
madison
square
garden
he
be
always
try
to
get
somebody
to
work
with
us
early
in
the
morning
or
late
at
night
to
get
new
yorkers
to
do
that
be
something
really
difficult
you
know
because
they
all
catch
the
train
and
they
have
get
their
rule
about
everything
but
sam
would
always
find
somebody
to
visit
with
us
at
night
for
one
thing
he
want
the
trip
to
be
as
short
as
possible
for
another
he
want
to
make
sure
we
be
work
all
the
time
anyway
we
would
split
up
and
go
to
all
these
different
showroom
we
would
walk
in
and
they
would
say
who
be
you
with
and
we
would
say
we
be
with
walton
oh
yeah
where
be
you
locate
arkansas
what
town
bentonville
arkansas
then
they
would
always
say
where
in
the
world
be
bentonville
arkansas
and
don
whitaker
with
a
straight
face
would
always
say
next
to
rogers
then
the
guy
would
say
excuse
me
i
need
to
get
something
out
of
the
back
room
and
old
whitaker
would
say
you
do
not
need
to
check
us
out
with
dun
and
bradstreet
we
be
the
same
as
general
motor
then
the
guy
would
come
back
and
say
well
i
found
you
in
there
and
you
do
have
good
credit
so
what
can
i
show
you
we
never
finish
up
until
about
twelve
thirty
at
night
and
we
would
all
go
out
for
a
beer
except
mr
walton
he
would
say
i
will
meet
you
for
breakfast
at
six
o
clock
and
we
would
say
mr
walton
there
be
no
reason
to
meet
that
early
we
ca
not
even
get
into
the
building
that
early
and
he
would
just
say
we
will
find
something
to
do
the
next
morning
he
would
talk
some
janitor
or
somebody
into
let
us
in
the
building
and
we
would
be
sit
there
outside
the
showroom
when
those
folk
start
come
in
to
work
like
i
say
i
think
he
be
try
to
make
a
point
just
because
we
be
in
new
york
do
not
mean
we
have
to
start
do
thing
their
way
i
expect
gary
right
about
my
try
to
make
a
point
because
wherever
we
have
be
we
have
always
try
to
instill
in
our
folk
the
idea
that
we
at
wal
mart
have
our
own
way
of
do
thing
it
may
be
different
and
it
may
take
some
folk
a
while
to
adjust
to
it
at
first
but
it
be
straight
and
honest
and
basically
pretty
simple
to
figure
out
if
you
want
to
and
whether
or
not
other
folk
want
to
accommodate
us
we
pretty
much
stick
to
what
we
believe
in
because
it
be
proven
to
be
very
very
successful
we
start
out
swim
upstream
and
it
be
make
us
strong
and
lean
and
alert
and
we
have
enjoy
the
trip
we
sure
do
not
see
any
reason
now
to
turn
around
and
join
the
rest
of
the
pack
head
downcurrent

raise
a
family
as
kid
we
all
work
for
the
company
in
one
way
or
another
i
get
to
work
behind
the
candy
counter
or
run
the
popcorn
stand
when
i
be
five
year
old
the
business
be
part
of
life
and
it
be
always
include
in
the
dinner
conversation
we
heard
a
lot
about
the
debt
it
take
to
open
new
store
and
i
worried
about
it
i
remember
confide
to
my
girlfriend
one
time
cry
and
say
i
do
not
know
what
we
be
go
to
do
my
daddy
owes
so
much
money
and
he
wo
not
quit
opening
store
alice
walton
in
the
early
year
before
wal
mart
i
do
not
think
our
family
be
much
different
from
most
other
family
of
that
era
helen
and
i
have
make
pretty
deliberate
plan
we
want
four
kid
and
helen
say
she
would
like
to
have
them
all
by
the
time
she
be
thirty
so
she
could
enjoy
her
grown
child
and
her
grandkids
sure
enough
by
the
time
we
left
newport
we
have
four
kid
three
boy
rob
john
and
jim
and
a
baby
girl
alice
one
of
the
reason
helen
insist
all
along
on
our
living
in
a
small
town
i
be
sure
be
so
we
could
raise
the
kid
with
the
same
value
she
and
i
have
be
expose
to
in
our
youth
and
we
do
except
it
be
not
the
depression
and
we
never
have
to
worry
about
have
enough
to
go
around
at
the
dinner
table
another
goal
of
ours
be
to
create
the
kind
of
family
togetherness
helen
have
grown
up
with
i
have
already
told
you
how
much
the
robsons
influence
helen
and
me
in
the
organization
of
our
finance
but
really
i
think
their
successful
happy
prosperous
family
be
just
an
all
round
inspiration
for
the
kind
of
family
i
want
as
a
young
man
and
of
course
it
be
the
only
kind
of
family
helen
ever
consider
i
have
fond
memory
of
my
own
boyhood
yet
it
pain
me
to
talk
about
one
part
of
it
but
because
helen
think
it
have
an
important
influence
on
me
i
will
mention
it
briefly
the
simple
truth
be
that
mother
and
dad
be
two
of
the
most
quarrelsome
people
who
ever
live
together
i
love
them
both
dearly
and
they
be
two
wonderful
individual
but
they
be
always
at
odds
and
they
really
only
stayed
together
because
of
bud
and
me
after
we
be
grown
they
even
split
up
and
go
their
separate
way
for
a
while
during
the
war
for
example
mother
move
to
california
to
work
in
the
defense
plant
but
grow
up
as
the
old
child
i
felt
like
i
take
a
lot
of
the
brunt
of
this
domestic
discord
i
be
not
exactly
sure
how
this
situation
affected
my
personality
unless
it
be
partly
a
motivation
to
stay
so
busy
all
the
time
but
i
swore
early
on
that
if
i
ever
have
a
family
i
would
never
expose
it
to
that
kind
of
squabble
so
helen
and
i
do
the
best
we
could
to
promote
a
sense
of
togetherness
in
the
family
and
we
make
sure
our
child
have
a
chance
to
participate
in
the
same
sort
of
thing
we
do
as
kid
they
be
in
scout
and
for
a
time
i
be
a
scoutmaster
all
the
boy
played
football
and
do
well
in
fact
they
each
make
the
all
state
team
and
when
jim
be
about
to
graduate
i
remember
the
coach
be
quote
around
town
to
the
effect
that
he
could
not
face
the
prospect
of
a
team
without
a
walton
so
he
be
try
to
talk
alice
into
go
out
for
football
she
probably
would
not
have
be
half
bad
either
i
always
try
to
be
home
on
friday
night
so
i
would
miss
very
few
of
their
game
they
threw
paper
route
you
know
how
strongly
i
felt
about
that
experience
as
training
alice
be
involve
with
horse
show
at
a
very
early
age
and
of
course
we
all
go
to
church
and
sunday
school
i
be
a
sunday
school
teacher
there
for
a
while
too
helen
walton
sam
do
teach
sunday
school
for
a
while
but
even
then
he
have
unusual
work
habit
during
one
period
in
newport
he
would
work
until
ten
on
saturday
night
and
then
he
would
get
up
and
go
right
back
in
sunday
morning
we
be
suppose
to
be
take
turn
about
get
the
kid
to
sunday
school
and
to
get
four
little
kid
dress
for
church
with
nobody
to
help
me
be
a
little
unreal
it
be
true
that
we
have
less
time
with
sam
after
wal
mart
but
do
not
get
the
idea
that
he
be
not
work
most
of
the
time
before
that
through
our
combine
effort
the
kid
receive
your
everyday
heartland
upbringing
base
on
the
same
old
bedrock
value
a
belief
in
the
importance
of
hard
work
honesty
neighborliness
and
thrift
helen
bore
more
than
her
share
of
raise
the
kid
and
i
work
long
hour
at
least
six
day
a
week
saturday
be
our
big
store
day
and
i
work
all
day
saturday
and
saturday
night
too
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
our
value
really
take
the
only
thing
that
might
have
make
our
family
different
be
that
as
alice
say
everybody
be
involve
in
work
around
the
store
rob
walton
we
always
work
in
the
store
i
would
sweep
the
floor
and
carry
box
after
school
and
even
more
in
the
summer
i
remember
just
barely
have
a
driver
license
and
drive
a
truckload
of
merchandise
one
night
up
to
that
ben
franklin
in
saint
robert
which
we
all
knew
to
be
the
best
ben
franklin
in
the
world
in
those
day
we
all
get
an
allowance
too
and
it
be
less
than
some
of
our
friend
i
do
not
know
that
we
particularly
felt
deprive
but
we
do
not
have
a
lot
of
money
dad
be
always
frugal
be
probably
a
good
word
for
it
but
he
always
let
us
invest
in
those
store
and
i
have
an
investment
in
that
saint
robert
store
so
i
come
out
real
well
on
that
it
paid
for
my
house
and
various
other
dad
would
call
them
extravagance
i
guess
the
kid
thought
of
themselves
as
slave
labor
back
then
but
we
do
not
work
them
that
hard
we
just
taught
them
the
value
of
work
and
besides
i
need
the
help
at
the
store
and
at
home
i
do
not
have
time
to
mow
the
lawn
and
why
should
i
anyway
with
three
strap
boy
and
a
healthy
girl
available
for
chore
and
it
be
not
all
work
helen
and
i
make
it
a
point
to
take
the
whole
family
out
and
spend
time
travel
or
camp
together
sometimes
the
kid
thought
of
these
trip
as
force
march
but
i
think
that
time
we
spent
together
have
have
a
lot
to
do
with
our
close
relationship
as
a
family
today
we
have
a
lot
of
good
memory
of
travel
all
over
the
country
especially
in
this
one
fine
old
desoto
station
wagon
jim
walton
dad
always
say
you
have
get
to
stay
flexible
we
never
go
on
a
family
trip
nor
have
we
ever
heard
of
a
business
trip
in
which
the
schedule
be
not
change
at
least
once
after
the
trip
be
underway
later
we
all
snicker
at
some
writer
who
view
dad
as
a
grand
strategist
who
intuitively
developed
complex
plan
and
implement
them
with
precision
dad
thrive
on
change
and
no
decision
be
ever
sacred
helen
walton
sam
be
not
so
tie
up
year
round
until
wal
mart
start
during
the
ben
franklin
day
we
take
a
month
off
every
year
in
fifty
six
i
remember
we
do
the
whole
state
of
arkansas
we
go
to
the
park
camped
out
and
we
all
fell
in
love
with
this
state
because
we
really
get
to
know
it
that
be
a
marvelous
wonderful
time
then
one
year
we
take
a
long
trip
to
yellowstone
another
year
we
go
to
mesa
verde
and
the
grand
canyon
and
another
time
we
take
a
long
journey
up
the
east
coast
we
take
a
car
full
of
kid
and
all
our
camp
equipment
strap
on
everywhere
and
i
love
it
camp
be
really
important
in
our
life
of
course
we
always
have
to
stop
and
look
at
store
any
kind
of
store
on
the
way
to
wherever
we
be
head
you
know
we
would
go
through
a
good
town
and
he
knew
about
some
store
there
i
would
sit
in
the
car
with
the
kid
who
of
course
would
say
oh
no
daddy
not
another
store
we
just
get
use
to
it
later
on
sam
never
go
by
a
kmart
that
he
do
not
stop
and
look
at
it
alice
walton
it
be
great
we
would
get
in
the
station
wagon
four
brat
and
the
dog
strap
the
canoe
on
top
and
hitch
up
a
homemade
trailer
behind
and
take
off
for
a
different
part
of
the
country
every
summer
we
would
always
do
it
as
long
as
dad
could
stop
and
see
his
store
along
the
way
he
would
usually
get
us
situate
set
up
camp
and
then
mother
would
stay
at
camp
with
us
while
he
take
off
to
look
at
store
we
learn
to
work
together
and
everybody
have
their
chore
and
at
night
we
prayed
together
you
know
it
be
interest
i
know
dad
work
incredible
hour
and
i
know
he
travel
a
lot
but
i
never
really
felt
like
he
be
go
much
he
go
out
of
his
way
to
spend
time
with
us
and
he
be
fun
to
be
with
he
love
to
play
baseball
with
us
i
tag
along
with
him
on
his
trip
a
good
bit
and
i
still
visit
store
because
of
it
when
i
get
into
junior
high
and
high
school
he
would
take
me
to
my
horse
show
mother
thought
he
be
stay
and
watch
but
dad
and
i
have
a
pact
he
would
drop
me
off
and
i
would
show
my
horse
while
he
would
go
look
at
store
the
store
thing
be
always
a
part
of
it
it
be
not
that
he
be
not
supportive
or
fair
it
be
just
something
he
have
to
do
and
we
understood
it
rob
walton
i
remember
dad
visit
store
but
i
do
not
remember
the
store
visit
as
impose
or
interfere
with
the
trip
because
mostly
i
remember
the
trip
as
be
really
good
time
on
the
trip
to
the
grand
teton
we
have
an
opportunity
to
take
what
be
a
very
expensive
for
that
time
pack
trip
up
into
the
mountain
to
a
fishing
camp
and
stay
there
for
a
few
day
but
that
be
go
to
use
up
all
our
money
and
we
have
to
take
a
family
vote
to
decide
whether
to
do
that
or
not
we
decide
to
do
it
and
it
be
fun
but
after
we
have
spent
all
our
money
on
the
big
trip
we
make
a
quick
stop
in
the
black
hill
and
hike
it
on
home
in
a
hurry
i
especially
remember
the
trip
east
we
go
through
the
carolina
and
head
up
the
coast
it
be
mother
and
dad
and
all
four
kid
and
one
scroungy
dog
name
tiny
we
roll
into
new
york
city
in
a
station
wagon
with
a
canoe
on
top
and
a
camp
trailer
on
the
back
that
be
the
first
time
any
of
us
kid
have
ever
be
there
i
have
one
really
special
memory
of
that
trip
we
go
to
see
camelot
with
the
original
cast
julie
andrew
richard
burton
roddy
mcdowall
and
robert
goulet
and
we
be
all
wear
bermuda
short
of
course
what
they
say
be
true
i
be
visit
store
all
the
time
and
i
still
do
it
today
in
foot
we
have
visit
them
all
over
the
world
and
gotten
some
great
idea
that
way
as
well
as
a
few
that
do
not
work
out
so
well
like
work
weekend
it
be
just
something
you
have
to
do
if
you
want
to
be
successful
in
the
retail
business
i
be
glad
my
kid
remember
the
good
time
and
do
not
seem
to
resent
me
too
much
for
my
absence
and
distraction
over
the
year
i
think
maybe
one
reason
they
do
not
have
too
much
resentment
be
that
helen
and
i
always
involve
them
in
the
business
and
kept
them
inform
right
from
the
start
i
have
no
idea
incidentally
that
alice
be
so
frighten
of
debt
as
a
little
girl
but
there
be
certainly
more
irrational
thing
she
could
have
fear
they
may
not
have
want
to
go
visit
all
those
store
while
we
be
on
vacation
but
they
have
some
idea
why
i
be
do
it
they
work
in
the
store
invest
in
the
store
and
shop
in
the
store
helen
walton
at
that
first
bentonville
store
i
be
part
of
the
shrinkage
unaccounted
for
inventory
loss
usually
cause
by
theft
if
i
need
something
i
just
get
it
and
take
it
home
with
me
i
do
not
even
think
about
pay
for
it
it
be
not
good
business
at
all
i
mean
people
would
see
me
pick
up
thing
and
they
probably
thought
well
i
will
pick
up
some
too
i
remember
it
be
difficult
for
me
when
we
go
into
the
wal
mart
business
from
the
five
and
dime
i
have
to
start
pay
for
thing
and
it
be
a
real
shock
also
at
christmastime
we
would
get
a
list
from
the
welfare
office
of
some
child
who
be
not
go
to
have
santa
claus
we
would
get
the
age
and
size
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
remember
one
night
we
take
our
child
into
the
store
after
it
be
close
and
give
them
that
list
and
told
them
to
go
around
and
pick
out
thing
for
them
because
we
want
them
to
have
some
sense
of
what
be
go
on
outside
our
privileged
little
family
it
be
a
small
town
and
we
be
a
real
small
town
kind
of
operation
one
thing
i
never
do
which
i
be
really
proud
of
be
to
push
any
of
my
kid
too
hard
i
knew
i
be
a
fairly
overactive
fellow
and
i
do
not
expect
them
to
try
to
be
just
like
me
also
i
let
them
know
they
be
welcome
to
come
into
our
business
but
that
they
would
have
to
work
as
hard
as
i
do
they
would
have
to
commit
to
be
merchant
rob
go
to
law
school
and
become
our
first
company
lawyer
he
do
most
of
the
work
to
take
us
public
and
have
be
involve
with
the
senior
management
of
the
company
ever
since
as
an
officer
and
board
member
jim
learn
a
lot
about
real
estate
and
the
art
of
negotiation
from
his
uncle
bud
after
bud
sort
of
step
back
from
his
involvement
with
locate
and
buying
store
site
jim
take
over
he
be
really
good
at
it
and
they
still
tell
story
about
him
fly
into
some
small
town
unfold
his
bicycle
and
pedal
around
look
for
a
good
site
he
never
told
anybody
who
he
be
and
he
get
some
great
deal
now
he
be
run
walton
enterprise
the
family
partnership
and
i
think
he
be
almost
as
tight
with
a
dollar
as
i
be
among
other
thing
walton
enterprise
own
bank
in
several
town
around
here
jim
and
a
partner
own
the
local
newspaper
the
daily
record
the
story
of
buying
the
record
show
just
how
far
we
have
come
from
those
day
when
helen
could
just
sashay
through
the
store
and
pick
up
what
she
want
a
practice
by
the
way
that
i
always
frown
on
back
before
we
go
public
with
wal
mart
i
bought
the
newspaper
figure
that
we
would
have
a
cheap
place
to
print
our
circular
i
think
i
only
paid
for
that
old
paper
when
we
go
public
though
some
new
york
lawyer
come
down
and
told
us
we
have
to
sell
the
paper
to
wal
mart
because
otherwise
we
would
be
take
advantage
of
the
public
company
if
we
continued
to
print
the
circular
so
we
sell
it
to
wal
mart
at
cost
about
by
then
well
year
later
jim
decides
he
want
to
buy
the
paper
so
we
have
an
outside
consultant
come
in
and
tell
wal
mart
what
it
be
worth
jim
and
his
partner
paid
million
for
that
darn
paper
it
be
be
marginally
profitable
at
best
and
it
quit
printing
wal
mart
circular
year
ago
the
point
i
be
try
to
make
be
that
we
as
a
family
have
bent
over
backward
not
to
take
advantage
of
wal
mart
not
to
press
our
ownership
position
unfairly
and
everybody
in
the
company
know
it
alice
and
john
work
for
a
little
while
at
wal
mart
but
have
both
branch
out
into
independent
business
of
their
own
alice
try
her
hand
as
a
buyer
but
do
not
care
for
it
too
much
and
now
she
be
get
her
own
investment
company
the
llama
company
down
in
fayetteville
in
some
way
i
believe
she
be
the
most
like
me
a
maverick
but
even
more
volatile
than
i
be
john
who
be
a
green
beret
medic
in
vietnam
become
our
second
company
pilot
i
be
the
first
he
be
the
most
independent
of
the
bunch
and
the
only
one
who
do
not
live
here
in
arkansas
and
he
be
a
tremendous
individual
he
and
his
family
live
out
west
where
he
design
and
build
sailboat
and
he
also
run
a
large
crop
dust
business
which
be
own
by
walton
enterprise
we
be
all
pilot
so
it
be
real
easy
for
us
to
get
together
on
a
moment
notice
helen
walton
one
way
in
which
sam
and
my
dad
be
really
different
my
dad
be
always
talk
to
me
about
how
i
should
live
how
i
should
work
and
challenge
me
to
do
this
and
that
i
do
not
know
that
sam
do
that
very
much
with
our
child
i
probably
do
it
and
they
get
enough
from
me
he
probably
saw
that
and
kept
his
mouth
shut
alice
walton
when
we
be
grow
up
dad
be
really
very
accept
if
you
make
a
and
b
mother
be
the
one
who
would
press
us
with
i
make
all
a
and
i
know
you
can
do
it
dad
be
more
well
this
be
what
i
make
a
and
b
be
pretty
good
john
walton
i
remember
ask
dad
for
permission
to
climb
a
bluff
overlook
the
buffalo
river
he
say
do
anything
you
be
big
enough
to
do
what
an
exhilarate
challenge
of
judgment
and
confidence
booster
for
a
twelve
year
old
later
when
i
be
a
young
man
try
to
find
my
way
in
the
world
he
give
me
an
open
invitation
to
join
the
wal
mart
team
but
never
a
hint
of
pressure
what
a
wonderful
way
to
grow
up
now
as
i
say
one
of
the
reason
i
fell
for
helen
in
the
first
place
be
that
she
be
her
own
woman
and
she
have
not
prove
a
disappointment
in
that
category
for
example
one
of
the
thing
i
be
famous
for
around
our
company
be
absolutely
insist
that
all
our
executive
and
manager
here
in
bentonville
attend
our
saturday
morning
meeting
one
of
the
reason
i
like
it
be
that
if
all
our
folk
out
there
in
the
store
have
to
work
on
saturday
i
think
those
of
us
back
here
in
the
general
office
should
show
up
on
saturday
too
plus
as
i
have
say
if
you
do
not
want
to
work
weekend
you
should
not
be
in
retail
but
helen
will
tell
anybody
who
asks
her
what
she
think
of
the
saturday
morning
meeting
helen
walton
i
think
it
be
a
shame
that
a
lot
of
those
father
and
mother
who
have
child
involve
in
thing
like
athletic
program
ca
not
be
there
to
support
them
because
they
have
to
go
to
the
saturday
morning
meeting
i
do
not
blame
people
at
all
for
complain
about
them
as
a
merchant
i
have
always
try
to
stay
fairly
neutral
publicly
on
controversial
political
issue
even
though
i
obviously
have
opinion
but
helen
be
one
who
go
to
answer
bluntly
about
what
she
believe
in
if
question
really
she
be
a
bit
of
a
feminist
i
think
not
unlike
my
mother
and
i
guess
we
have
caught
a
little
heat
from
time
to
time
some
of
her
cause
be
not
all
that
popular
with
some
of
these
fairly
extreme
group
but
i
will
tell
you
this
she
do
not
ask
me
what
she
should
think
and
i
would
be
the
last
person
on
earth
to
try
to
tell
her
we
have
one
really
ugly
fight
in
our
marriage
early
on
over
what
kind
of
car
to
buy
i
be
a
chevy
man
and
she
be
from
a
ford
family
nobody
won
that
one
but
we
both
learn
how
stubborn
we
could
be
and
we
have
not
gotten
into
anything
like
that
since
we
have
be
happy
together
but
we
have
stayed
independent
to
pursue
our
own
interest
as
well
one
big
strain
on
the
family
that
i
have
already
talk
about
be
this
whole
richest
man
in
america
business
i
do
not
know
if
helen
ever
really
forgave
me
for
put
us
in
the
position
to
be
drag
into
that
helen
walton
what
i
hate
be
be
the
object
of
curiosity
people
be
so
curious
about
everything
and
so
we
be
just
public
conversation
the
whole
thing
still
make
me
mad
when
i
think
about
it
i
mean
i
hate
it
helen
right
of
course
but
i
think
we
have
mostly
come
to
term
with
all
the
commotion
cause
by
our
unwillingly
become
a
semipublic
family
and
we
have
enjoy
a
few
of
the
thing
it
be
enable
us
to
do
our
kid
just
shrug
it
off
i
do
not
think
it
have
affected
our
kid
too
much
because
it
all
happen
gradually
to
them
and
they
be
raise
so
basically
with
good
fundamental
value
i
do
admit
to
worry
sometimes
about
future
generation
of
the
walton
i
know
it
be
unrealistic
of
me
to
expect
them
all
to
get
up
and
throw
paper
route
and
i
know
it
be
something
i
ca
not
control
but
i
would
hate
to
see
any
descendant
of
mine
fall
into
the
category
of
what
i
would
call
idle
rich
a
group
i
have
never
have
much
use
for
i
really
hope
that
somehow
the
value
both
helen
and
i
and
our
kid
have
always
embrace
can
be
pass
on
down
through
the
generation
and
even
if
these
little
future
walton
do
not
feel
the
need
to
work
from
dawn
on
into
the
night
to
stay
ahead
of
the
bill
collector
i
hope
they
will
feel
compel
to
do
something
productive
and
useful
and
challenge
with
their
life
maybe
it
be
time
for
a
walton
to
start
think
about
go
into
medical
research
and
work
on
cure
for
cancer
or
figure
out
new
way
to
bring
culture
and
education
to
the
underprivileged
or
become
missionary
for
free
enterprise
in
the
third
world
or
maybe
and
this
be
strictly
my
idea
there
be
another
walton
merchant
lurk
in
the
wing
somewhere
down
the
line

recruiting
the
team
i
kept
say
sam
we
be
make
a
good
living
why
go
out
why
expand
so
much
more
the
store
be
get
farther
and
farther
away
after
the
seventeenth
store
though
i
realize
there
be
not
go
to
be
any
stop
it
helen
walton
as
much
as
we
must
have
look
like
promoter
in
the
early
go
with
our
donkey
ride
and
rid
mower
out
in
the
parking
lot
and
mountain
of
tide
or
whatever
pile
up
inside
the
store
what
nobody
realize
include
a
few
of
our
own
manager
at
the
time
be
that
we
be
really
try
from
the
begin
to
become
the
very
best
operator
the
most
professional
manager
that
we
could
there
be
no
question
that
i
have
the
personality
of
a
promoter
that
personality
and
our
somewhat
unorthodox
style
at
wal
mart
probably
confuse
people
at
the
outset
in
fact
i
have
occasionally
heard
myself
compare
to
p
t
barnum
because
of
the
way
i
love
to
get
in
front
of
a
crowd
and
talk
something
up
an
idea
a
store
a
product
the
whole
company
whatever
i
happen
to
be
focus
on
right
then
but
underneath
that
personality
i
have
always
have
the
soul
of
an
operator
somebody
who
want
to
make
thing
work
well
then
well
then
the
best
they
possibly
can
so
i
guess
when
folk
saw
me
walk
around
scribble
note
on
my
coffee
stain
yellow
legal
pad
or
haul
box
of
lady
lingerie
into
the
store
out
of
my
station
wagon
maybe
they
do
not
take
me
that
seriously
they
assume
we
could
not
be
in
it
for
the
long
haul
some
folk
no
doubt
figure
we
be
a
little
fly
by
night
you
know
in
the
discount
business
today
but
out
sell
car
or
swampland
tomorrow
i
think
that
misunderstand
work
to
our
advantage
for
a
long
time
and
enable
wal
mart
to
fly
under
everybody
radar
until
we
be
too
far
along
to
catch
truth
be
told
discounting
attract
mostly
promoter
in
the
begin
people
who
have
be
in
the
distribution
center
business
or
who
be
real
estate
promoter
guy
who
be
not
really
even
aspire
merchant
but
who
saw
a
huge
opportunity
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
genius
to
see
discounting
as
a
new
trend
that
be
go
to
sweep
the
country
and
all
kind
of
folk
come
jumping
into
it
with
all
four
foot
wherever
they
could
arrive
first
cedar
rapid
iowa
or
springfield
missouri
it
do
not
matter
they
would
take
a
carbon
copy
of
somebody
store
in
connecticut
or
boston
hire
some
buyer
and
some
supervisor
who
be
suppose
to
know
the
business
and
start
opening
up
store
from
about
until
around
it
be
phenomenally
successful
anybody
who
have
ever
know
anything
about
me
know
i
be
never
in
anything
for
the
short
haul
i
always
want
to
build
as
fine
a
retailing
organization
as
i
could
but
in
those
early
day
before
and
just
after
we
open
the
first
wal
mart
i
get
to
know
a
lot
of
those
promoter
as
i
told
you
i
ran
the
country
study
the
discounting
concept
visit
every
store
and
company
headquarters
i
could
find
the
first
one
i
saw
be
the
mill
store
in
the
east
where
the
whole
thing
start
ann
hope
be
in
providence
rhode
island
and
there
be
others
in
massachusetts
and
across
new
england
i
go
all
over
up
there
look
at
giant
store
and
mammoth
mart
and
arlan
another
one
i
learn
a
lot
from
be
sol
price
a
great
operator
who
have
start
fed
mart
out
in
southern
california
in
i
make
friend
with
sol
son
in
law
who
be
run
a
distribution
center
in
houston
and
talk
with
him
help
me
sort
out
some
of
my
think
on
distribution
which
would
eventually
become
another
key
to
wal
mart
success
i
guess
i
have
steal
i
actually
prefer
the
word
borrow
as
many
idea
from
sol
price
as
from
anybody
else
in
the
business
for
example
it
be
true
that
bob
bogle
come
up
with
the
name
wal
mart
in
the
airplane
that
day
but
the
reason
i
go
for
it
right
away
be
not
that
the
sign
be
cheaper
i
really
like
sol
fed
mart
name
so
i
latch
right
on
to
wal
mart
i
do
not
believe
kmart
exist
at
that
time
i
read
in
some
trade
publication
not
long
ago
that
of
the
top
discounter
who
be
in
business
in
of
them
have
disappear
many
of
these
start
with
more
capital
and
visibility
than
we
do
in
large
city
with
much
great
opportunity
they
be
bright
star
for
a
moment
and
then
they
fade
i
start
think
about
what
really
brought
them
down
and
why
we
kept
go
it
all
boil
down
to
not
take
care
of
their
customer
not
mind
their
store
not
have
folk
in
their
store
with
good
attitude
and
that
be
because
they
never
really
even
try
to
take
care
of
their
own
people
if
you
want
the
people
in
the
store
to
take
care
of
the
customer
you
have
to
make
sure
you
be
take
care
of
the
people
in
the
store
that
be
the
most
important
single
ingredient
of
wal
mart
success
most
of
these
early
guy
be
very
egotistical
people
who
love
to
drive
big
cadillacs
and
fly
around
in
their
jet
and
vacation
on
their
yacht
and
some
of
them
live
in
house
like
i
would
never
even
thought
about
before
i
remember
go
to
dinner
at
one
of
their
house
and
we
get
picked
up
by
this
limousine
that
must
have
have
room
for
fourteen
people
man
they
be
living
high
and
they
could
afford
to
back
then
because
this
discounting
thing
be
work
so
well
customer
just
flock
to
their
store
and
these
fellow
be
cover
up
in
cash
most
of
them
could
still
be
around
today
if
they
have
follow
some
basic
principle
about
run
good
store
there
be
a
lot
of
way
to
build
strong
company
they
do
not
have
to
be
do
the
wal
mart
way
or
my
way
or
anybody
else
way
but
you
do
have
to
work
at
it
and
somewhere
along
the
line
these
folk
stop
short
of
set
the
goal
and
pay
the
price
that
need
to
be
paid
maybe
it
be
not
the
cadillacs
and
the
yacht
maybe
they
just
decide
it
be
not
worth
it
but
whatever
it
be
they
just
do
not
stay
close
enough
to
their
business
they
sort
of
chose
to
get
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
they
expand
quickly
without
building
the
organization
and
the
support
such
as
distribution
center
need
to
expand
those
company
they
do
not
get
out
into
their
store
to
see
what
be
go
on
then
kmart
get
their
machine
in
gear
and
begin
to
do
it
well
and
well
i
remember
go
in
their
store
i
will
bet
i
have
be
in
more
kmarts
than
anybody
and
i
would
really
envy
their
merchandise
mix
and
the
way
they
present
it
so
much
about
their
store
be
superior
to
ours
back
then
that
sometimes
i
felt
like
we
could
not
compete
of
course
that
do
not
stop
us
from
try
and
target
come
along
and
do
a
fine
job
take
the
whole
idea
a
little
more
upscale
as
these
big
operator
become
more
organize
the
competition
grow
a
lot
more
difficult
that
be
when
all
those
guy
who
be
fail
to
meet
their
customer
need
and
who
do
not
build
strong
organization
all
those
promoter
start
to
fall
apart
and
eventually
fall
out
actually
during
this
whole
early
period
wal
mart
be
too
small
and
insignificant
for
any
of
the
big
boy
to
notice
and
most
of
the
promoter
be
not
out
in
our
area
so
we
be
not
competitive
that
help
me
get
access
to
a
lot
of
information
about
how
they
be
do
thing
i
probably
visit
more
headquarters
office
of
more
discounter
than
anybody
else
ever
i
would
just
show
up
and
say
hi
i
be
sam
walton
from
bentonville
arkansas

kurt

executive
vice
president
of
the
discounter

association
work
in
my
new
york

one
day
in
my
secretary

a
man
out

who
want
to

our
group
i

give
him
ten
minute
so
in
come
this
short
wiry
man
with
a
deep
tan
and
a
tennis
racket
under
his
arm
he
introduce
himself
as
sam

from
arkansas
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
when
he
meet
you
he
look
at
you
head
cocked
to
one
side
forehead
slightly
crease
and
he
proceeds
to
extract
every
piece
of
information
in
your
possession
he
always
make
little
note
and
he
push
on
and
on
after
two
and
a
half
hour
he
left
and
i
be
totally
drain
i
be
not
sure
what
i
have
just
met
but
i
be
sure
we
would
hear
more
from
him
look
at
everybody
else
company
make
me
feel
we
be
definitely
head
in
the
right
direction
but
as
we
developed
we
begin
to
feel
a
little
out
of
control
in
the
late
sixty
we
have
more
than
a
dozen
wal
mart
and
fourteen
or
fifteen
variety
store
which
be
a
pretty
good
size
company
to
be
run
with
three
lady
myself
and
don
whitaker
in
the
office
and
a
manager
in
each
store
i
already
told
you
what
scrubby
buyer
we
be
we
have
a
lot
of
people
with
little
or
no
experience
or
not
enough
knowledge
of
how
big
operation
actually
work
i
make
up
my
mind
that
we
have
to
get
somebody
with
management
under
his
belt
i
have
hire
gary
reinboth
from
j
j
newberry
a
big
variety
chain
that
be
have
some
problem
at
the
time
so
i
ask
him
if
he
knew
anybody
and
he
told
me
about
this
guy
up
in
omaha
name
ferold
arend
he
be
newberry
district
manager
and
head
of
merchandise
for
the
whole
midwest
so
bud
and
i
flew
out
to
see
him
we
talk
him
and
his
wife
into
come
down
and
look
at
our
operation
ferold
arend
wal
mart
first
vice
president
of
operation
and
later
its
president
in
the
middle
of
wal
mart
no
be
under
construction
in
conway
arkansas
and
sam
be
all
excite
and
say
i
have
get
to
show
you
these
plan
so
he
load
my
wife
and
me
in
his
plane
and
we
flew
down
there
the
store
have
a
cotton
mill
on
one
side
and
a
stockyard
on
the
other
and
it
be
in
a
terrible
neighborhood
my
first
thought
be
this
be
not
a
very
good
place
for
a
store
i
also
thought
the
bentonville
store
do
not
seem
to
have
any
organization
to
the
way
it
be
run
let
just
say
i
be
not
very
impressed
with
the
whole
sam
walton
operation
at
that
time
i
told
him
i
be
not
interested
later
on
after
that
conway
wal
mart
open
up
sam
call
me
and
told
me
what
the
sale
be
i
thought
my
gosh
that
store
do
as
much
in
one
day
as
some
of
our
big
store
do
in
a
month
and
then
he
told
me
he
be
only
pay
ninety
cent
a
square
foot
and
i
thought
he
must
have
something
there
about
that
time
newberry
decide
to
reorganize
and
i
be
go
to
have
to
move
to
a
new
division
so
i
thought
well
if
i
be
go
to
have
to
start
over
in
a
company
where
i
have
work
for
twenty
one
year
why
not
look
at
something
i
be
really
interested
in
and
that
be
discounting
and
sam
walton
here
i
be
come
in
as
vice
president
and
it
take
some
get
use
to
the
office
be
still
up
on
the
square
in
bentonville
and
sam
have
just
get
through
remodel
them
which
i
be
sure
be
a
great
improvement
but
in
my
opinion
they
be
not
much
the
office
be
in
an
old
narrow
hallway
upstairs
some
be
over
the
barbershop
and
others
be
over
an
attorney
office
the
floor
sag
up
there
about
four
inch
from
the
wall
to
the
center
and
they
have
some
partition
and
some
wood
panel
and
they
be
real
little
office
it
be
very
close
knit
up
there
even
if
he
could
not
tell
it
by
the
office
we
give
him
bring
ferold
in
be
an
important
step
for
our
company
i
knew
we
have
to
get
well
organize
than
we
be
we
still
have
to
build
a
basic
merchandise
assortment
and
a
real
replenishment
system
we
have
list
of
item
we
be
suppose
to
carry
and
we
be
dependent
on
the
people
in
the
store
to
keep
good
record
of
everything
manually
this
be
at
a
time
when
quite
a
few
people
be
begin
to
go
into
computerization
i
have
read
a
lot
about
that
and
i
be
curious
i
make
up
my
mind
i
be
go
to
learn
something
about
ibm
computer
so
i
enrol
in
an
ibm
school
for
retailer
in
poughkeepsie
new
york
one
of
the
speaker
be

arkansas
and
i
be
in
the
retail
business
i
say
you
will

every
speech
i
have
ever

in
there

be

accountant

be
i
do
wrong
i
look
at
these
number
this
be
in
and
i
do
not
believe
what
i
be
see
he
be
get
a
handful
of
store
and
he
be
do
about
million
a
year
with
some
incredible
margin
an
unbelievable
performance
so
i
look
at
it
and
i
say

wrong
sam
if

close
his
attach
case
and
i
say
to
him
be
here
be
wrong
sam
do
not
unpack
your
bag
go
down
catch
a
cab
go
back
to
the
airport
and
go
back
to
where
you
come
from
and
keep
do
exactly
what
you
be
do
there
be
nothing
that
can
possibly
improve
what
you
be
do
you
be
a
genius
that
be
how
i
met
sam
walton
abe
invite
me
to
join
the
nmri
and
it
turn
out
to
be
quite
a
valuable
association
for
me
i
be
on
the
board
for
about
fifteen
year
and
make
some
terrific
contact
and
generous
friend
i
visit
with
abe
a
number
of
time
at
his
new
york
office
and
he
be
a
very
open
guy
he
share
with
me
how
he
use
computer
to
control
his
merchandise
abe
mark
our
system
be
rudimentary
by
today
standard
but
it
be
very
advanced
for
the
s
very
few
company
control
their
merchandise
the
way
we
do
sam
spent
a
lot
of
time
review
these
operation
and
he
brought
some
of
his
people
up
to
review
them
he
have
just
be
a
master
of
take
the
best
out
of
everything
and
adapt
it
to
his
own
need
what
we
help
him
with
in
the
early
day
be
really
logistics
it
be
like
in
the
army
you
can
move
troop
all
over
the
world
but
unless
you
have
the
capacity
to
supply
them
with
ammunition
and
food
there
be
no
sense
put
them
out
there
sam
understood
that
he
knew
that
he
be
already
in
what
the
trade
call
an
absentee
ownership
situation
that
just
mean
you
be
put
your
store
out
where
you
as
management
be
not
if
he
want
to
grow
he
have
to
learn
to
control
it
so
to
service
these
store
you
have
get
to
have
timely
information
how
much
merchandise
be
in
the
store
what
be
it
what
sell
and
what
not
what
be
to
be
order
marked
down
replace
to
get
more
technical
that
help
you
control
what
we
call
turn
or
inventory
turnover
the
ratio
of
sale
to
inventory
that
be
a
key
the
more
you
turn
your
inventory
the
less
capital
be
require
and
all
this
involves
get
the
merchandise
to
the
store
at
the
right
time
communicate
how
it
be
be
price
and
how
it
be
be
marked
down
whatever
logistics
anyway
the
man
a
genius
he
realize
even
at
the
rudimentary
level
he
be
on
in
operating
those
few
store
that
he
have
that
he
could
not
expand
beyond
that
horizon
unless
he
have
the
ability
to
capture
this
information
on
paper
so
that
he
could
control
his
operation
no
matter
where
they
might
be
he
become
really
the
best
utilizer
of
information
to
control
absentee
ownership
that
there
be
ever
be
which
give
him
the
ability
to
open
as
many
store
as
he
open
and
run
them
as
well
as
he
run
them
and
to
be
as
profitable
as
he
make
them
you
have
get
to
realize
this
too
by
be
at
that
conference
he
be
absolutely
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
there
be
no
such
thing
in
those
day
as
minicomputer
and
microcomputer
he
be
really
ten
year
away
from
the
computer
world
come
but
he
be
prepare
himself
and
this
be
a
very
important
point
without
the
computer
sam
walton
could
not
have
do
what
he
be
do
he
could
not
have
built
a
retailing
empire
the
size
of
what
he
be
built
the
way
he
built
it
he
be
do
a
lot
of
other
thing
right
too
but
he
could
not
have
do
it
without
the
computer
it
would
have
be
impossible
much
as
i
hate
to
admit
to
something
like
that
i
expect
abe
be
probably
right
his
memory
pretty
good
about
why
i
be
at
that
conference
too
i
want
to
show
him
my
book
and
i
want
to
ask
him
about
merchandise
control
but
i
knew
i
would
never
be
any
whizbang
computer
guy
myself
so
i
have
another
reason
for
go
to
that
school
i
be
look
to
hire
a
good
bright
system
person
and
i
figure
i
might
find
one
there
as
it
happen
there
be
all
sort
of
bright
people
in
that
school
dale
worman
a
very
astute
retailer
from
the
fred
meyer
company
out
in
portland
and
now
a
good
friend
be
there
as
be
arlie
lazarus
who
become
president
of
herb
fisher
jamesway
corp
and
of
course
that
be
where
i
first
met
ron
mayer
then
the
smart
young
chief
financial
officer
at
duckwall
store
in
abilene
kansa
i
target
him
as
the
guy
we
need
at
wal
mart
and
start
woo
him
right
there
like
so
many
of
them
he
be
not
interested
just
then
in
move
to
bentonville
arkansas
to
work
for
somebody
he
knew
next
to
nothing
about
later
on
we
change
his
mind
but
i
have
another
problem
on
my
mind
when
i
go
up
there
distribution
all
these
other
guy
like
abe
mark
be
in
large
urban
market
and
their
store
be
be
supply
by
big
distributor
kmart
and
woolco
be
use
the
same
distribution
system
that
be
supply
their
thousand
of
variety
store
so
here
we
be
out
in
the
stick
with
nobody
to
distribute
to
our
store
which
meant
basically
that
our
manager
would
order
from
salesman
and
then
some
day
or
other
a
truck
from
somewhere
would
come
along
and
drop
off
the
merchandise
even
at
the
stage
we
be
in
this
be
totally
unworkable
a
lot
of
our
store
be
not
big
enough
to
order
whole
pallet
of
merchandise
so
we
have
rent
that
old
garage
in
downtown
bentonville
as
our
warehouse
we
would
have
big
shipment
deliver
there
then
unpack
them
and
repack
them
into
small
quantity
then
we
would
call
the
trucklines
to
come
get
them
and
take
them
to
the
store
it
be
expensive
and
inefficient
somewhere
in
that
period
ferold
and
i
have
hire
another
fellow
from
newberry
bob
thornton
who
have
be
run
a
distribution
center
for
them
in
omaha
with
the
promise
that
we
be
go
to
build
a
distribution
center
for
him
to
run
bob
thornton
he
hire
me
with
the
full
understand
that
i
be
go
to
put
together
a
warehouse
and
distribution
system
i
accepted
the
job
move
down
here
and
start
draw
some
plan
then
one
day
he
proceeds
to
tell
me
he
do
not
know
for
sure
whether
we
really
need
a
warehouse
yet
or
not
it
upset
me
to
no
end
because
that
be
really
the
only
field
i
want
to
be
into
i
say
gee
sam
i
want
to
run
a
warehouse
for
about
six
month
to
a
year
there
i
just
work
do
various
thing
around
the
company
and
in
my
spare
time
i
drew
up
plan
for
a
distribution
center
there
be
not
room
for
me
in
the
office
so
they
knock
a
hole
through
the
wall
and
go
into
the
upstairs
of
the
shoe
store
next
door
it
be
kind
of
like
an
attic
my
office
with
no
heat
or
air
conditioning
in
it
we
have
one
old
toilet
for
a
rest
room
with
a
screen
door
hook
on
the
door
and
there
be
about
twenty
five
people
work
there
by
now
sam
would
come
by
every
so
often
and
tell
me
to
keep
work
on
draw
those
warehouse
plan
but
i
could
see
he
be
not
sure
about
it
at
all
i
knew
we
need
a
warehouse
i
just
want
to
make
sure
we
get
the
kind
we
need
and
at
this
time
too
remember
we
be
financing
everything
ourselves
we
be
borrowing
heavily
to
open
new
store
but
anyway
there
be
one
guy
at
that
same
ibm
school
a
fellow
up
in
green
bay
wisconsin
who
be
the
only
one
who
have
a
warehouse
a
distribution
center
he
invite
me
to
go
look
at
it
so
when
i
get
home
from
the
school
i
threw
don
whitaker
and
ferold
and
bob
thornton
and
some
other
folk
there
be
six
of
us
i
remember
into
a
beechcraft
baron
i
be
fly
in
those
day
and
haul
us
up
to
green
bay
wisconsin
we
go
through
this
warehouse
saw
how
they
do
it
take
a
lot
of
note
on
everything
it
be
computerize
one
of
the
first
computerize
warehouse
i
know
anything
about
after
that
trip
i
knew
we
have
to
build
one
and
everybody
be
pressure
me
for
a
new
general
office
so
we
bought
fifteen
acre
on
a
farm
right
outside
bentonville
where
we
still
be
today
for
about
bob
be
in
charge
of
building
us
a
new
foot
general
office
which
i
thought
would
last
us
forever
and
a
foot
warehouse
which
i
thought
be
too
big
but
ferold
convince
me
we
need
it
bob
thornton
as
i
recall
my
blueprint
for
the
warehouse
call
for
square
foot
which
to
me
be
very
minimal
then
sam
decide
to
get
an
architect
involve
when
i
get
to
look
at
the
draw
i
thought
well
this
ca
not
be
right
it
be
only
square
foot
so
i
go
to
tell
sam
about
it
and
he
say
well
i
call
the
architect
and
told
him
to
cut
it
back
i
just
do
not
think
we
need
that
square
foot
bob
another
thing
i
have
design
that
distribution
center
around
an
in
floor
towline
system
you
know
a
track
that
move
cart
around
the
floor
sam
say
well
bob
i
just
do
not
think
we
can
do
that
we
ca
not
spend
that
kind
of
money
at
that
point
i
literally
do
not
know
how
to
run
a
warehouse
without
one
so
i
just
say
hey
sam
if
we
do
not
have
a
towline
system
then
you
do
not
need
me
because
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
without
it
so
he
give
in
to
that
the
truth
be
sam
never
do
anything
in
size
or
volume
until
he
actually
have
to
he
always
played
it
close
to
the
belt
it
be
true
enough
that
i
be
nervous
about
spending
any
unnecessary
money
in
those
day
we
be
generate
as
much
financing
for
growth
as
we
could
from
the
profit
of
the
store
but
we
be
also
borrowing
everything
we
could
i
be
take
on
a
lot
of
personal
debt
to
grow
the
company
it
approach
million
which
be
a
lot
of
money
at
the
time
the
debt
be
begin
to
weigh
on
me
by
now
i
no
longer
have
any
doubt
that
we
be
really
on
to
something
we
have
expand
to
missouri
sikeston
be
our
first
store
there
and
we
would
put
store
in
neosho
and
west
plain
we
would
go
to
clare
more
oklahoma
helen
hometown
our
first
seven
or
eight
wal
mart
be
show
spectacular
result
once
we
get
it
go
it
be
hard
to
see
why
we
should
quit
the
thing
be
you
could
see
the
potential
so
clearly
the
profit
and
the
sale
be
there
but
we
need
to
get
well
organize
and
come
up
with
a
more
sensible
way
to
finance
the
growth
i
need
someone
to
help
me
with
system
and
distribution
i
have
stayed
in
touch
with
ron
mayer
and
i
kept
after
him
to
work
for
us
finally
i
talk
him
into
come
down
to
look
over
our
operation
and
then
darn
near
kill
him
before
he
ever
have
a
chance
to
sign
on
we
be
fly
around
in
my
beech
baron
look
at
store
and
we
be
on
our
way
in
to
land
at
carthage
missouri
head
for
store
number
there
be
two
intersect
runway
at
carthage
and
as
i
touch
down
on
one
of
them
all
of
a
sudden
up
ahead
we
saw
this
plane
on
the
other
runway
right
at
the
intersection
and
we
be
head
straight
at
him
i
have
not
see
him
or
heard
him
on
the
radio
i
do
not
know
where
he
come
from
i
give
that
baron
all
the
power
it
have
and
we
just
barely
make
it
over
the
top
of
the
other
plane
then
we
circle
around
and
land
this
be
ron
first
trip
with
me
and
who
know
what
he
must
have
thought
but
somehow
i
talk
him
into
come
to
work
with
us
anyway
he
join
wal
mart
in
as
vice
president
for
finance
and
distribution
even
though
it
may
surprise
some
people
i
have
to
say
that
i
consider
the
time
ron
be
at
the
company
from
until
when
he
left
under
some
fairly
unpleasant
circumstance
for
both
of
us
to
be
the
most
important
period
of
development
in
wal
mart
history
we
have
a
good
thing
go
before
ron
arrive
but
he
and
some
of
the
people
he
brought
on
board
like
royce
chamber
our
first
data
processing
manager
give
the
company
its
first
sophisticated
system
and
those
system
be
the
beginning
of
a
management
method
which
allow
us
to
stay
real
close
to
our
store
even
as
our
growth
explode
we
be
force
to
be
ahead
of
our
time
in
distribution
and
in
communication
because
our
store
be
sit
out
there
in
tiny
little
town
and
we
have
to
stay
in
touch
and
keep
them
supply
ron
start
the
program
that
eventually
improve
our
in
store
communication
system
building
on
the
groundwork
already
laid
by
ferold
arend
ron
also
take
over
distribution
and
begin
to
design
and
build
a
system
that
would
enable
us
to
grow
as
fast
as
we
could
come
up
with
the
money
he
be
the
main
force
that
move
us
away
from
the
old
drop
shipment
method
in
which
a
store
order
directly
from
the
manufacturer
and
have
the
merchandise
deliver
directly
to
the
store
by
common
carrier
he
push
us
in
some
new
direction
such
as
merchandise
assembly
in
which
we
would
order
centrally
for
every
store
and
then
assemble
their
order
at
the
distribution
center
and
also
cross
dock
in
which
preassemble
order
for
individual
store
would
be
receive
on
one
side
of
our
warehouse
and
leave
out
the
other
from
ron
mayer
arrival
on
we
as
a
company
have
be
ahead
of
most
other
retailer
in
invest
in
sophisticated
equipment
and
technology
the
funny
thing
be
everybody
at
wal
mart
know
that
i
have
fought
all
these
technology
expenditure
as
hard
as
i
could
all
these
guy
love
to
talk
about
how
i
never
want
any
of
this
technology
and
how
they
have
to
lay
down
their
life
to
get
it
the
truth
be
i
do
want
it
i
knew
we
need
it
but
i
just
could
not
bring
myself
to
say
okay
sure
spend
what
you
need
i
always
question
everything
it
be
important
to
me
to
make
them
think
that
maybe
the
technology
be
not
as
good
as
they
thought
it
be
or
that
maybe
it
really
be
not
the
end
all
they
promise
it
would
be
it
seem
to
me
they
try
just
a
little
harder
and
check
into
thing
a
little
bit
closer
if
they
think
they
might
have
a
chance
to
prove
me
wrong
if
i
really
have
not
want
the
technology
i
would
not
have
sprung
the
money
loose
to
pay
for
it
by
the
late
sixty
we
be
really
well
position
for
serious
growth
we
have
a
retail
concept
we
believe
in
the
core
of
a
professional
management
team
and
the
foundation
of
system
which
would
support
growth
in
we
have
fourteen
variety
store
and
thirteen
wal
mart
in
we
have
fourteen
variety
store
and
eighteen
wal
mart
and
we
be
raring
to
go
i
could
not
resist
take
that
next
step
to
see
how
far
we
could
go
and
i
always
figure
we
would
slow
down
or
stop
when
we
be
not
as
profitable
as
we
should
be
it
be
around
that
time
that
bud
and
i
very
quietly
begin
to
think
about
take
the
company
public

take
the
company
public
when
we
go
on
the
stock
market
it
do
not
mean
anything
to
some
of
us
country
boy
the
chairman
always
say
i
come
across
the
red
river
barefooted
and
hunt
a
job
which
be
almost
the
way
it
be
i
do
not
even
know
what
stock
be
but
i
bought
some
thank
god
because
phil
green
say
hey
you
buy
some
of
that
stock
boy
i
bought
it
and
i
kept
it
because
i
believe
in
mr
walton
and
i
believe
in
my
store
it
be
real
simple
i
believe
him
when
he
say

could
do

thing
with
the

and

mart
executive
from
the
time
i
take
out
my
first
bank
loan
the
to
buy
that
ice
cream
machine
for
the
ben
franklin
down
in
newport
i
be
never
really
comfortable
with
debt
but
i
recognize
it
as
a
necessity
of
do
business
and
i
have
gotten
pretty
good
at
accumulate
it
for
a
while
i
would
just
go
down
to
the
local
bank
and
borrow
whatever
i
could
to
build
a
store
or
buy
something
we
need
to
grow
the
business
that
practice
have
gotten
me
in
debt
to
practically
every
bank
in
arkansas
and
southern
missouri
they
believe
in
what
we
have
do
up
to
that
point
and
they
believe
we
would
pay
them
off
i
always
do
pay
them
off
on
time
but
sometimes
i
would
borrow
from
one
to
pay
the
other
i
have
bought
a
bank
in
bentonville
for
about
just
a
little
old
bank
with
only
about
million
in
deposit
but
it
really
help
me
learn
a
lot
about
financing
thing
i
make
some
new
acquaintance
and
begin
to
study
more
about
banker
and
how
they
like
to
do
business
i
struck
up
a
relationship
with
a
guy
name
jimmy
jones
at
republic
bank
down
in
dallas
and
he
loan
us
a
million
dollar
and
of
course
i
have
try
all
along
to
attract
some
equity
investment
from
our
store
manager
and
a
few
relative
so
by
we
have
seventy
eight
partner
invest
in
our
company
which
really
be
not
one
company
but
thirty
two
different
store
own
by
a
combination
of
different
folk
my
family
own
the
lion
share
of
every
store
but
helen
and
i
be
also
in
debt
up
to
our
eyeball
several
million
dollar
worth
i
never
dwell
on
the
negative
but
that
debt
weigh
heavy
on
me
if
something
happen
and
everybody
decide
to
call
their
note
i
kept
think
we
would
be
sunk
maybe
that
be
what
be
raise
in
the
depression
do
to
you
but
i
want
out
of
that
debt
in
the
bad
way
i
have
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
idea
of
take
the
company
public
seek
advice
from
people
like
abe
mark
and
some
of
those
other
discounter
in
that
association
we
all
belong
to
but
i
really
have
not
pursue
anything
seriously
one
day
in
we
get
a
call
from
mike
smith
who
say
he
want
to
come
up
and
talk
to
us
mike
work
for
witt
and
jack
stephen
in
little
rock
today
stephen
inc
be
the
large
investment
banking
firm
west
of
the
mississippi
and
one
of
the
most
respect
in
the
country
back
then
it
be
mostly
a
bond
house
jack
by
the
way
be
the
fellow
who
have
come
in
and
successfully
developed
that
little
rock
shopping
center
after
i
fail
so
mike
smith
drove
up
to
bentonville
we
be
still
in
those
old
three
room
of
office
over
the
lawyer
office
and
the
barbershop
on
the
square
i
remember
mike
climb
those
stair
he
be
a
bit
of
a
renegade
himself
he
have
a
lot
of
original
idea
and
during
our
conversation
that
day
he
plant
the
seed
that
maybe
we
really
be
do
well
enough
to
go
public
that
be
to
issue
stock
in
the
company
and
sell
it
to
the
public
mike
smith
stephen
inc
i
go
up
there
to
see
them
in
the
fall
of
and
it
be
really
the
height
of
ambition
we
have
only
do
one
public
offering
and
i
have
do
it
so
i
thought
i
be
an
expert
sam
be
eager
to
talk
because
he
have
borrow
all
the
money
he
possibly
could
i
stop
at
every
wal
mart
between
little
rock
and
bentonville
so
i
would
know
something
about
his
store
of
course
the
first
thing
he
do
be
throw
me
in
that
plane
of
his
and
fly
us
all
over
oklahoma
and
missouri
look
at
store
not
long
after
that
bud
and
i
go
quail
hunt
up
on
the
robson
ranch
in
oklahoma
and
the
hunt
be
really
good
we
spent
most
of
that
day
talk
about
our
option
we
want
to
expand
and
we
realize
we
be
not
generate
enough
profit
both
to
expand
and
to
pay
off
our
debt
in
fact
our
cash
shortage
have
force
us
to
give
up
five
land
site
where
we
have
already
plan
to
build
new
store
so
we
knew
we
have
to
do
something
drive
back
that
night
we
agree
to
seriously
explore
the
possibility
of
go
public
it
be
a
huge
step
for
us
and
we
be
concerned
about
lose
control
of
the
company
my
son
rob
have
graduate
from
columbia
university
law
school
the
year
before
and
have
go
to
work
at
the
big
law
firm
in
tulsa
we
the
walton
family
be
his
first
client
as
our
lawyer
he
also
kept
track
of
the
various
wal
mart
store
partnership
agreement
so
i
ask
him
to
start
look
at
all
our
option
we
still
be
not
sure
we
could
take
the
company
public
meanwhile
money
be
get
tight
and
some
of
our
creditor
be
pressure
us
i
flew
to
dallas
and
try
to
borrow
some
more
from
republic
bank
whose
officer
be
get
nervous
about
what
they
would
already
loan
us
they
make
it
clear
we
have
all
of
their
money
we
be
likely
to
see
and
that
end
our
relationship
by
then
jimmy
jones
have
move
to
a
bank
in
new
orleans
first
commerce
so
i
flew
down
there
from
dallas
to
see
if
he
could
help
us
jimmy
come
up
with
a
million
loan
which
help
us
out
in
the
short
term
but
it
really
be
not
the
answer
to
our
long
term
problem
for
various
reason
include
tax
rob
recommend
restructuring
our
debt
consolidate
it
into
one
big
loan
for
the
company
ron
mayer
and
i
have
heard
that
the
prudential
be
make
loan
to
a
lot
of
small
retail
chain
so
we
make
an
appointment
with
one
of
their
loan
officer
and
flew
to
new
york
by
now
we
really
need
the
money
pure
and
simple
i
go
to
prudential
i
have
my
prediction
all
spell
out
on
my
yellow
legal
pad
and
i
be
sure
they
be
go
to
loan
us
the
money
i
go
through
my
five
year
plan
my
sale
profit
number
of
store
and
talk
about
our
strategy
of
go
to
the
small
town
where
there
be
no
competition
and
told
the
loan
officer
how
much
business
we
thought
there
be
out
there
wait
to
be
plucked
he
do
not
buy
it
at
all
told
us
he
do
not
think
a
company
like
the
prudential
could
afford
to
gamble
with
us
i
save
those
projection
for
a
long
time
and
they
be
all
exceed
by
to
percent
in
the
year
to
come
somehow
we
have
a
contact
at
another
insurance
company
mass
mutual
so
we
go
to
see
them
they
agree
to
lend
us
a
million
dollar
and
in
turn
we
agree
to
give
them
our
right
arm
and
our
left
leg
we
do
not
just
pay
interest
we
have
to
give
them
all
sort
of
stock
option
in
case
we
do
go
public
by
now
they
have
us
over
a
barrel
i
have
no
choice
we
have
to
have
the
money
when
we
go
public
they
make
million
and
million
on
that
deal
by
then
i
be
tire
of
owe
money
to
people
i
knew
and
i
be
even
more
tire
of
beg
money
from
stranger
i
make
up
my
mind
for
sure
that
we
be
go
to
take
wal
mart
to
the
stock
market
i
let
mike
smith
and
jack
stephen
know
we
want
to
go
ahead
with
the
idea
but
i
also
let
them
know
they
be
go
to
have
to
compete
for
our
business
just
like
i
have
always
make
everybody
else
compete
for
business
with
us
also
i
let
them
know
i
do
not
feel
comfortable
go
with
a
little
rock
firm
i
thought
we
need
a
wall
street
underwriter
maybe
that
be
right
and
maybe
it
be
not
i
know
mike
and
jack
do
not
feel
too
good
about
it
but
i
go
run
off
to
new
york
to
see
what
i
could
find
out
mike
smith
obviously
we
want
to
handle
the
whole
offering
but
sam
be
always
one
to
shop
around
here
be
what
happen
the
way
i
remember
it
sam
be
up
in
new
york
on
a
buying
trip
and
he
decide
to
go
down
to
wall
street
and
hear
what
some
of
those
guy
have
to
say
just
cold
call
right
off
the
street
he
knew
that
white
weld
have
take
public
a
retail
chain
call
pamida
up
in
omaha
so
he
go
to
visit
them
he
introduce
himself
to
the
receptionist
as
sam
walton
of
wal
mart
store
like
he
always
do
and
say
i
want
to
talk
to
somebody
about
take
my
company
public
she
say
oh
really
where
be
you
from
and
when
he
told
her
bentonville
arkansas
she
say
well
we
have
a
mr
remmel
here
and
he
be
from
arkansas
perhaps
he
could
help
you
and
she
introduce
him
to
buck
remmel
who
be
from
little
rock
i
do
not
really
remember
how
i
met
buck
but
mike
might
have
it
right
i
remember
introduce
myself
to
him
and
say
something
like
what
be
the
chance
that
you
folk
would
be
interested
in
backing
us
on
this
offering
well
he
say
he
would
look
at
it
and
sure
enough
they
decide
they
be
interested
i
still
think
that
be
one
reason
the
offer
be
so
successful
because
at
the
time
white
weld
be
one
of
the
lead
institutional
investment
banking
firm
not
everyone
around
here
agrees
with
me
but
i
be
stick
to
my
opinion
mike
smith
sam
decide
correctly
at
the
time
that
white
weld
knew
more
about
public
offering
than
we
do
so
he
let
them
have
the
business
but
he
told
them
i
hope
you
will
include
the
folk
at
stephen
because
they
be
good
friend
and
they
be
good
people
white
weld
ask
us
if
we
want
to
take
a
third
of
the
deal
to
their
two
third
i
talk
it
over
with
jack
and
he
ask
me
what
i
thought
of
the
company
i
say
i
thought
we
ought
to
do
it
and
we
do
later
on
in
other
offering
we
get
a
fifty
fifty
piece
of
the
deal
along
with
white
weld
so
rob
start
to
work
on
the
plan
which
be
to
consolidate
all
these
partnership
into
one
company
and
then
sell
about
percent
of
it
to
the
public
at
the
time
our
family
own
probably
percent
of
the
company
bud
own
percent
or
so
some
other
relative
own
a
percentage
charlie
baum
own
some
willard
walker
own
some
charlie
cate
own
some
claude
harris
own
some
all
those
early
manager
would
borrow
money
from
our
bank
to
buy
stock
in
the
store
willard
be
the
most
skillful
at
get
money
he
would
cultivate
the
guy
who
ran
the
bank
and
they
would
let
him
have
what
he
want
consequently
he
realize
fabulous
return
on
it
he
have
more
ownership
than
any
of
the
manager
rob
walton
dad
have
a
spread
sheet
listing
all
the
minority
ownership
in
the
various
company
and
the
problem
be
figure
out
on
what
basis
to
value
them
all
for
the
initial
offering
as
i
recall
we
basically
propose
use
book
value
we
do
not
do
any
kind
of
sophisticated
relative
evaluation
of
the
company
which
would
have
take
into
account
earnings
and
growth
projection
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
but
everybody
sign
right
up
and
as
far
as
i
know
everybody
happy
today
with
the
way
it
work
out
we
be
all
ready
to
go
at
the
begin
of
and
ron
mayer
and
i
do
a
dog
and
pony
show
all
over
the
place
los
angeles
san
francisco
chicago
tell
everybody
how
great
we
be
go
to
be
but
before
we
get
the
stock
issue
the
market
fell
out
on
us
and
we
have
to
postpone
the
offering
we
be
already
have
unusual
manager
meeting
in
those
day
we
would
all
go
fishing
together
without
wife
for
four
or
five
day
at
a
time
and
talk
about
the
business
i
remember
we
be
on
one
of
those
trip
to
table
rock
dam
and
i
have
to
tell
everybody
that
we
be
pull
back
on
the
deal
but
the
market
recover
some
and
on
october
wal
mart
become
a
public
company
trade
over
the
counter
our
prospectus
offer
share
at
a
price
of
but
it
sell
for
it
be
well
receive
though
not
widely
held
we
only
have
about
shareholder
most
of
them
either
institution
or
folk
we
knew
those
who
bought
in
that
offering
or
who
own
some
of
those
early
partnership
and
have
them
convert
in
that
offering
make
an
absolute
kill
as
everybody
today
know
wal
mart
stock
performance
and
the
wealth
it
have
create
be
a
story
in
itself
just
fifteen
year
ago
the
market
value
of
the
company
be
around
million
today
it
be
over
billion
but
here
be
a
well
way
to
look
at
it
let
say
you
bought
share
back
in
that
original
public
offering
for
since
then
we
have
have
nine
two
for
one
stock
split
so
you
would
have
share
today
within
the
last
year
it
be
trade
at
right
under
a
share
so
your
investment
would
have
be
worth
right
around
million
at
that
price
obviously
our
stock
have
make
a
lot
of
folk
happy
over
the
year
and
pure
and
simple
that
be
where
the
walton
family
net
worth
have
be
create
it
be
paid
off
beyond
any
of
our
dream
here
be

that
show

one
funny
memory
about
that
public
offering
the
day
it
go
through
ron
and
i
be
leave
new
york
and
at
the
airport
we
met
a
guy
from
t
rowe
price
a
money
management
firm
in
baltimore
we
be
so
full
of
ourselves
that
somehow
we
make
him
believe
we
be
go
to
do
well
he
go
back
to
baltimore
and
bought
a
pretty
large
share
of
that
stock
for
his
firm
they
held
it
for
ten
or
fifteen
year
and
become
the
star
of
their
industry
we
would
split
and
split
and
they
would
sell
and
sell
i
do
not
know
how
many
million
they
make
on
that
stock
helen
walton
i
realize
before
we
go
public
that
i
do
not
want
it
to
happen
i
guess
if
i
be
go
to
be
mad
with
sam
about
anything
it
would
be
over
the
fact
that
i
always
felt
we
could
have
gotten
by
without
go
public
nothing
about
the
company
ever
affected
me
as
deeply
and
it
be
at
that
point
that
i
decide
i
have
to
pursue
my
other
interest
outside
the
company
i
just
hat
the
idea
that
we
be
go
to
put
all
our
financial
interest
out
there
for
everybody
to
see
when
you
go
public
they
can
ask
all
kind
of
question
and
the
family
get
involve
we
just
become
an
open
book
and
i
hat
it
helen
right
of
course
about
the
downside
of
take
the
company
public
it
do
end
up
bring
us
a
lot
of
unwanted
attention
but
come
back
from
new
york
that
day
i
experienced
one
of
the
great
feeling
of
my
life
know
that
all
our
debt
be
paid
off
the
walton
family
only
own
percent
of
wal
mart
after
that
day
but
we
be
able
to
pay
off
all
those
banker
and
from
that
day
on
we
have
not
borrow
one
dime
personally
to
support
wal
mart
the
company
have
roll
along
on
its
own
and
finance
itself
go
public
really
turn
the
company
loose
to
grow
and
it
take
a
huge
load
off
me
we
have
another
offering
later
on
try
to
get
broader
ownership
of
the
stock
so
we
could
be
trade
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
but
as
a
family
we
have
only
sell
very
limited
amount
of
wal
mart
stock
outside
of
those
offering
i
think
that
have
really
set
us
apart
and
as
i
say
that
be
the
source
of
our
net
worth
we
just
kept
that
stock
most
family
somewhere
along
the
line
would
have
say
we
do
not
want
this
rat
race
we
do
not
need
to
do
what
we
be
do
let
somebody
else
have
it
and
then
either
i
would
have
retire
and
back
out
of
the
company
and
sell
it
to
some
dutch
investor
or
to
kmart
or
federate
or
somebody
like
that
but
i
enjoy
do
what
i
be
do
so
much
and
see
the
thing
grow
and
develop
and
see
our
associate
and
partner
do
so
well
that
i
never
could
quit
it
be
always
interest
to
me
that
except
for
those
folk
who
work
in
our
company
our
stock
get
very
little
support
early
on
from
the
folk
right
here
in
northwest
arkansas
i
always
have
the
feel
that
the
people
around
here
who
remember
us
when
we
have
one
store
and
three
store
or
remember
me
when
i
be
president
of
the
rotary
or
the
chamber
of
commerce
somehow
thought
we
be
do
it
with
mirror
they
could
not
help
but
think
we
be
just
lucky
that
we
could
not
continue
long
term
to
do
as
well
as
we
have
do
i
do
not
think
it
be
anything
peculiar
to
this
part
of
the
country
or
me
or
anything
like
that
i
think
it
must
be
human
nature
that
when
somebody
homegrown
get
on
to
something
the
folk
around
them
sometimes
be
the
last
to
recognize
it
like
any
other
company
we
obviously
want
to
keep
our
stock
price
up
and
attract
as
many
new
investor
as
we
could
and
the
way
we
go
at
that
early
on
be
about
as
unorthodox
as
everything
else
we
have
do
most
public
company
hold
annual
stockholder
meeting
and
many
hold
session
for
wall
street
stock
analyst
where
they
tell
their
company
story
and
try
to
drum
up
support
for
their
stock
as
i
told
you
mike
smith
be
an
off
the
wall
guy
with
good
idea
and
suggestion
that
be
somewhat
unorthodox
so
right
after
we
go
public
mike
suggest
that
we
might
want
to
turn
our
stockholder
meeting
into
an
event
and
we
go
along
with
him
most
meeting
be
held
in
some
hotel
ballroom
in
a
big
city
and
be
pretty
quick
formal
affair
with
the
reading
of
the
minute
and
the
passing
of
a
few
shareholder
motion
a
lot
of
them
i
understand
be
held
in
place
like
wilmington
delaware
where
the
company
be
incorporate
in
the
hope
that
a
whole
lot
of
people
wo
not
show
up
we
take
the
opposite
approach
we
figure
we
be
already
out
of
the
way
enough
to
discourage
anybody
from
come
but
since
we
want
to
encourage
folk
to
attend
we
schedule
a
whole
weekend
of
event
for
them
we
invite
folk
down
from
new
york
chicago
or
wherever
they
paid
their
own
way
down
and
back
but
we
really
show
them
a
time
mike
smith
it
be
true
that
i
come
up
with
the
idea
of
make
the
annual
meeting
more
of
an
event
but
sam
do
not
tell
you
the
whole
reason
why
i
will
never
forget
wal
mart
first
annual
meeting
or
i
should
say
meeting
i
go
up
a
day
early
to
help
prepare
for
it
but
this
friend
of
sam
fred
pickens
from
newport
get
confuse
on
the
date
and
show
up
a
day
early
so
sam
decide
to
go
ahead
and
hold
the
meeting
for
fred
right
there
in
his
office
the
next
day
we
have
the
official
annual
meeting
six
of
us
met
around
a
table
of
the
coffee
shop
there
by
the
warehouse
the
next
year
i
say
sam
you
be
a
public
company
and
we
ought
to
have
a
real
meeting
and
try
to
get
some
folk
to
come
let
do
it
in
little
rock
you
be
from
arkansas
and
little
rock
be
the
capital
of
arkansas
and
people
can
get
there
a
lot
easy
than
they
can
to
bentonville
he
do
not
like
it
much
but
he
agree
to
it
so
we
held
the
second
meeting
at
a
motel
the
coachman
inn
in
little
rock
nobody
come
and
he
say
so
much
for
your
idea
mike
well
i
be
get
desperate
to
get
some
analyst
down
to
really
start
follow
the
company
so
i
come
up
with
the
idea
of
bring
them
all
in
for
a
weekend
at
bella
vista
which
be
this
nice
development
in
the
hill
just
north
of
bentonville
with
lot
of
golf
course
tennis
court
and
lake
i
still
remember
sam
response
to
the
idea
when
i
brought
it
up
sound
like
a
big
waste
of
money
to
me
but
he
decide
to
give
it
a
try
it
turn
out
to
be
a
really
good
idea
these
folk
would
come
down
and
we
would
assign
a
manager
from
the
company
to
meet
them
at
the
airport
and
drive
them
around
for
the
weekend
we
want
these
investment
type
from
the
city
include
a
lot
of
the
banker
who
be
lending
money
to
our
company
at
the
time
to
see
firsthand
what
we
do
and
how
we
do
it
we
want
them
to
get
to
know
our
manager
as
individual
and
come
to
understand
our
company
principle
and
we
felt
like
to
do
that
they
really
have
to
come
to
bentonville
and
see
what
kind
of
people
we
be
understand
our
integrity
our
dedication
our
work
ethic
all
the
ingredient
that
be
enable
us
to
outperform
our
competitor
they
could
not
do
that
back
in
new
york
the
value
and
the
approach
of
most
retailer
be
entirely
different
from
what
this
crazy
bunch
in
arkansas
be
do
and
we
want
them
to
see
it
for
themselves
so
they
would
come
down
and
we
would
have
the
stockholder
meeting
on
friday
follow
by
a
big
picnic
that
night
i
remember
one
lady
wore
a
formal
gown
to
one
of
our
dinner
it
get
quite
a
few
curious
look
then
we
would
get
them
up
early
on
saturday
morning
and
have
them
come
to
our
meeting
and
listen
to
us
talk
merchandising
and
finance
and
distribution
or
whatever
we
be
deal
with
at
the
time
in
the
early
day
it
be
not
anything
like
what
it
be
turn
into
now
which
be
the
large
most
raucous
stockholder
meeting
in
the
world
but
it
be
different
after
the
meeting
on
saturday
we
always
have
a
special
event
one
year
it
be
a
golf
tournament
which
be
not
all
that
unusual
i
guess
but
another
year
we
go
fishing
on
bull
shoal
lake
and
another
year
we
take
everybody
on
a
float
trip
down
sugar
creek
the
wild
event
i
remember
be
when
we
all
go
camp
overnight
in
tent
on
the
bank
of
sugar
creek
that
be
a
real
fiasco
remember
now
these
be
a
bunch
of
investment
analyst
from
the
big
city
well
a
coyote
start
howl
and
hoot
owl
hoot
and
half
of
these
analyst
stayed
up
all
night
around
the
campfire
because
they
could
not
sleep
we
decide
it
be
not
the
best
idea
to
try
something
like
this
with
folk
who
be
not
accustom
to
camp
on
the
rock
in
sleep
bag
mike
smith
these
get
togethers
become
a
big
hit
the
wal
mart
folk
would
stay
up
all
night
barbecuing
and
the
analyst
or
other
big
shareholder
would
stay
up
with
them
to
help
but
after
a
while
thing
get
a
little
out
of
hand
for
sam
taste
some
of
those
yankee
get
so
drunk
float
down
sugar
creek
they
could
not
stay
in
the
boat
and
some
of
those
fellow
barbecuing
have
a
few
too
many
beer
well
sam
be
not
a
puritan
or
a
strict
teetotaler
or
anything
but
he
ca
not
stand
for
people
to
get
drunk
so
he
ban
alcohol
completely
from
the
event
and
of
course
they
be
never
quite
the
same
after
that
they
do
get
a
little
wild
for
me
i
guess
but
if
nothing
else
our
meeting
generate
a
lot
of
talk
about
us
back
on
wall
street
not
all
of
it
good
i
be
sure
but
the
one
who
paid
attention
understood
that
we
be
serious
operator
who
be
in
it
for
the
long
haul
that
we
have
a
discipline
financial
philosophy
and
that
we
have
growth
on
our
mind
they
also
knew
we
like
to
have
fun
and
a
few
of
them
probably
thought
maybe
we
be
a
little
nut
those
meeting
be
just
one
example
of
how
in
the
early
day
of
be
a
public
company
we
really
do
have
to
go
to
great
length
than
most
company
to
let
wall
street
get
to
know
us
and
understand
us
partly
that
be
because
we
operate
so
differently
from
everybody
else
and
partly
it
be
because
we
be
so
isolated
from
new
york
where
a
lot
of
folk
seem
to
think
you
have
to
be
to
do
business
on
the
scale
and
size
that
we
be
and
in
the
process
of
woo
wall
street
we
met
all
kind
we
have
be
bless
and
appreciate
by
some
analyst
and
dismiss
by
others
who
have
believe
all
along
that
we
be
just
a
house
of
card
wait
to
fall
down
any
second
one
of
our
most
loyal
follower
have
be
maggie
gilliam
an
analyst
for
first
boston
who
have
believe
in
us
for
year
and
she
be
make
her
client
an
awful
lot
of
money
by
stick
to
those
belief
here
be
an
excerpt
from
a
report
one
of
my
favorite
that
she
write
margaret
gilliam
first
boston
wal
mart
be
the
fine
manage
company
we
have
ever
follow
we
think
it
be
quite
likely
the
fine
manage
company
in
america
and
we
know
of
at
least
one
investor
who
think
it
be
the
fine
manage
company
in
the
world
we
do
not
expect
to
find
another
wal
mart
in
our
lifetime
on
the
other
hand
i
remember
another
analyst
who
come
down
here
in
the
mid
seventy
i
will
never
forget
her
visit
i
have
be
out
hunt
all
day
and
i
be
pretty
grubby
when
i
come
in
to
go
out
to
dinner
with
her
my
son
jim
who
be
head
of
the
real
estate
department
in
those
day
join
us
and
he
be
never
one
for
dress
up
really
he
always
look
pretty
grubby
we
take
her
out
and
we
be
extremely
honest
with
her
we
told
her
what
we
felt
our
weakness
be
at
that
time
and
what
some
of
our
problem
be
but
we
try
to
explain
our
philosophy
too
and
to
get
her
excite
about
all
the
potential
we
felt
we
have
she
go
back
and
write
probably
the
darkest
report
on
wal
mart
that
have
ever
be
write
the
impression
you
get
from
reading
it
be
that
if
you
have
not
already
sell
your
stock
it
be
probably
too
late
over
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
year
most
of
the
analyst
who
have
follow
our
stock
have
be
consistent
in
their
support
although
they
will
go
off
us
temporarily
for
one
reason
or
another
by
and
large
though
they
have
stayed
with
us
i
do
not
subscribe
much
to
any
of
these
fancy
invest
theory
and
most
people
seem
surprised
to
learn
that
i
have
never
do
much
invest
in
anything
except
wal
mart
i
believe
the
folk
who
have
do
the
best
with
wal
mart
stock
be
those
who
have
study
the
company
who
have
understood
our
strength
and
our
management
approach
and
who
like
me
have
just
decide
to
invest
with
us
for
the
long
run
we
have
a
group
of
longtime
investor
in
scotland
who
have
do
it
well
maybe
than
anybody
back
in
the
early
day
of
our
growth
the
stephen
people
take
us
to
london
where
we
first
attract
the
interest
of
these
folk
they
told
us
right
off
that
they
believe
in
invest
for
the
long
term
they
say
that
as
long
as
they
felt
good
about
the
basic
of
the
company
and
have
confidence
in
the
management
they
would
not
be
buying
and
sell
the
way
many
of
these
fund
manager
do
man
they
be
talk
my
language
year
after
that
first
trip
we
visit
with
them
in
edinburgh
and
they
really
laid
it
on
for
us
we
have
a
similar
group
out
in
california
and
we
also
have
an
investor
in
france
his
name
be
pierre
and
he
be
do
exactly
the
same
thing
we
almost
drown
him
that
first
year
we
float
down
sugar
creek
and
i
be
afraid
we
would
never
see
him
again
but
pierre
start
believe
and
he
start
acquire
our
stock
and
recommend
it
to
his
french
fund
member
he
be
be
with
us
for
about
fifteen
year
and
he
be
have
exceptionally
good
success
with
our
company
our
long
term
investor
be
happy
because
we
have
consistently
reward
them
with
one
of
the
high
return
on
equity
in
american
business
from
to
our
average
annual
return
to
investor
be
percent
and
even
in
the
middle
of
the
recession
in
we
report
a
return
on
equity
of
more
than
percent
i
guess
what
annoy
to
executive
to
anybody
who
try
to
spend
their
time
manage
a
company
as
big
as
this
be
these
money
manager
who
be
always
churn
their
investor
account
you
know
the
stock
will
get
to
or
and
they
will
rush
in
there
and
say
hey
let
sell
this
thing
because
it
be
just
too
high
it
be
an
overvalue
stock
well
to
my
mind
that
do
not
make
much
sense
as
long
as
we
be
manage
our
company
well
as
long
as
we
take
care
of
our
people
and
our
customer
keep
our
eye
on
those
fundamental
we
be
go
to
be
successful
of
course
it
take
an
observe
discern
person
to
judge
those
fundamental
for
himself
if
i
be
a
stockholder
of
wal
mart
or
consider
become
one
i
would
go
into
ten
wal
mart
store
and
ask
the
folk
work
there
how
do
you
feel
how
the
company
treat
you
their
answer
would
tell
me
much
of
what
i
need
to
know
on
this
same
subject
i
have
frequently
be
ask
if
be
a
widely
follow
stock
have
force
us
to
manage
differently
to
think
more
short
term
at
the
expense
of
long
term
strategic
planning
the
answer
be
that
we
have
always
have
to
do
a
good
bit
of
both
when
you
be
opening
store
a
year
the
way
we
do
these
day
a
lot
of
your
planning
be
necessarily
short
term
but
to
sustain
that
kind
of
growth
you
constantly
have
to
consider
what
you
be
go
to
be
do
five
year
out
i
think
that
the
stock
market
pressure
have
driven
us
to
plan
far
out
so
that
there
will
be
some
consistency
next
year
and
the
year
after
not
only
to
our
profitability
but
to
our
operating
sale
our
gross
margin
and
those
sort
of
thing
i
have
never
let
myself
fret
too
much
about
that
we
have
have
some
tremendous
fluctuation
of
our
stock
over
time
sometimes
it
will
shoot
up
because
retailing
have
become
a
fashionable
sector
with
the
investment
community
or
it
will
plunge
because
somebody
writes
a
report
say
that
wal
mart
strategy
be
all
wrong
when
we
bought
a
chain
of
store
call
kuhn
big
k
in
which
take
us
east
of
the
mississippi
for
the
first
time
in
a
significant
way
several
report
say
we
be
take
on
more
than
we
could
handle
and
that
we
would
never
make
it
once
we
get
to
atlanta
or
new
orleans
we
have
have
report
predict
that
when
we
get
to
st
louis
or
wherever
and
met
some
real
competition
we
would
never
be
able
to
stay
profitable
our
demise
have
be
predict
ever
since
we
hit
the
stock
market
and
whenever
one
of
these
big
institutional
investor
read
something
like
that
and
decides
he
believe
it
he
unloads
a
million
share
or
share
and
in
the
past
that
have
create
some
fluctuation
in
the
price
of
our
stock
just
a
couple
of
year
ago
we
have
some
retail
analyst
worry
that
we
could
not
sustain
a
percent
annual
growth
rate
because
we
be
get
so
big
at
the
time
i
say
i
would
be
tickle
to
death
with
percent
i
mean
when
we
be
do
billion
a
year
in
sale
percent
be
billion
which
be
big
in
itself
than
most
retailer
but
these
folk
thought
a
billion
increase
would
be
a
disaster
for
us
in
the
meantime
look
what
happen
to
the
industry
nowadays
we
be
hero
because
we
be
still
show
double
digit
growth
if
we
do
percent
it
be
the
lead
item
on
the
national
news
broadcast
because
they
view
it
as
an
economic
indicator
the
point
be
all
those
analyst
may
have
have
perfectly
logical
theory
about
why
a
percent
increase
would
be
a
disaster
for
us
but
they
fail
to
see
that
in
a
big
economic
downturn
when
everybody
be
suffer
wal
mart
fundamental
strength
would
keep
us
go
strong
and
we
would
look
great
compare
to
everybody
else
as
company
get
large
with
a
broader
follow
of
investor
it
becomes
awfully
tempt
to
get
into
that
jet
and
go
up
to
detroit
or
chicago
or
new
york
and
speak
to
the
banker
and
the
people
who
own
your
stock
but
since
we
get
our
stock
jump
start
in
the
begin
i
feel
like
our
time
be
well
spent
with
our
own
people
in
the
store
rather
than
off
sell
the
company
to
outsider
i
do
not
think
any
amount
of
public
relation
expert
or
speech
in
new
york
or
boston
mean
a
darn
thing
to
the
value
of
the
stock
over
the
long
haul
i
think
you
get
what
you
be
worth
not
that
we
do
not
go
out
of
our
way
to
keep
wall
street
up
to
date
on
what
go
on
with
the
company
for
the
last
few
year
in
fact
a
group
call
the
united
shareholder
association
have
vote
us
the
number
one
company
in
the
u
s
base
on
our
responsiveness
to
shareholder
what
really
worried
me
over
the
year
be
not
our
stock
price
but
that
we
might
someday
fail
to
take
care
of
our
customer
or
that
our
manager
might
fail
to
motivate
and
take
care
of
our
associate
i
also
be
worried
that
we
might
lose
the
team
concept
or
fail
to
keep
the
family
concept
viable
and
realistic
and
meaningful
to
our
folk
as
we
grow
those
challenge
be
more
real
than
somebody
theory
that
we
be
head
down
the
wrong
path
as
business
leader
we
absolutely
cannot
afford
to
get
all
caught
up
in
try
to
meet
the
goal
that
some
retail
analyst
or
financial
institution
in
new
york
set
for
us
on
a
ten
year
plan
spit
out
of
a
computer
that
somebody
set
to
compound
at
such
and
such
a
rate
if
we
do
that
we
take
our
eye
off
the
ball
but
if
we
demonstrate
in
our
sale
and
our
earnings
every
day
every
week
every
quarter
that
we
be
do
our
job
in
a
sound
way
we
will
get
the
growth
we
be
entitle
to
and
the
market
will
respect
us
in
a
way
that
we
deserve
our
associate
and
our
customer
many
of
whom
be
now
stockholder
too
will
all
be
well
serve
if
we
perform
consistently
over
the
next
ten
year
whether
it
be
at
a
percent
rate
or
a
percent
rate
or
a
percent
rate
if
we
fail
to
live
up
to
somebody
hypothetical
projection
for
what
we
should
be
do
i
do
not
care
it
may
knock
our
stock
back
a
little
but
we
be
in
it
for
the
long
run
we
could
not
care
less
about
what
be
forecast
or
what
the
market
say
we
ought
to
do
if
we
listen
very
seriously
to
that
sort
of
stuff
we
never
would
have
go
into
small
town
discounting
in
the
first
place

year
i
move
my
family
and
as
the
van
be
unload
the
furniture
into
our
rent
house
they
call
from
the
office
and
say
can
you
go
set
up
this
new
store
in
missouri
my
wife
who
have
three
baby
and
a
move
van
to
deal
with
help
me
find
some
clothes
and
i
left
i
do
not
see
her
again
for
two
week
then
there
be
a
manager
meeting
so
i
do
not
see
her
for
two
more
week
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
in
those
day
we
all
work
a
minimum
of
sixteen
hour
a
day
jack
shewmaker
former
president
and
coo
of
wal
mart
now
that
we
be
out
of
debt
we
could
really
do
something
with
our
key
strategy
which
be
simply
to
put
good
size
discount
store
into
little
one
horse
town
which
everybody
else
be
ignore
in
those
day
kmart
be
not
go
to
town
below
and
even
gibson
would
not
go
to
town
much
small
than
or
we
knew
our
formula
be
work
even
in
town
small
than
people
and
there
be
plenty
of
those
town
out
there
for
us
to
expand
into
when
people
want
to
simplify
the
wal
mart
story
that
be
usually
how
they
sum
up
the
secret
of
our
success
oh
they
go
into
small
town
when
nobody
else
would
and
a
long
time
ago
when
we
be
first
be
notice
a
lot
of
folk
in
the
industry
write
us
off
as
a
bunch
of
country
hick
who
have
stumble
onto
this
idea
by
a
big
accident
maybe
it
be
an
accident
but
that
strategy
would
not
have
work
at
all
if
we
have
not
come
up
with
a
method
for
implement
it
that
method
be
to
saturate
a
market
area
by
spread
out
then
fill
in
in
the
early
growth
year
of
discounting
a
lot
of
national
company
with
distribution
system
already
in
place
kmart
for
example
be
grow
by
stick
store
all
over
the
country
obviously
we
could
not
support
anything
like
that
but
while
the
big
guy
be
leapfrog
from
large
city
to
large
city
they
become
so
spread
out
and
so
involve
in
real
estate
and
zone
law
and
city
politics
that
they
left
huge
pocket
of
business
out
there
for
us
our
growth
strategy
be
born
out
of
necessity
but
at
least
we
recognize
it
as
a
strategy
pretty
early
on
we
figure
we
have
to
build
our
store
so
that
our
distribution
center
or
warehouse
could
take
care
of
them
but
also
so
those
store
could
be
control
we
want
them
within
reach
of
our
district
manager
and
of
ourselves
here
in
bentonville
so
we
could
get
out
there
and
look
after
them
each
store
have
to
be
within
a
day
drive
of
a
distribution
center
so
we
would
go
as
far
as
we
could
from
a
warehouse
and
put
in
a
store
then
we
would
fill
in
the
map
of
that
territory
state
by
state
county
seat
by
county
seat
until
we
have
saturate
that
market
area
we
saturate
northwest
arkansas
we
saturate
oklahoma
we
saturate
missouri
we
go
from
neosho
to
joplin
to
monett
and
aurora
to
nevada
and
belton
to
harrisonville
and
then
on
to
fort
scott
and
olathe
in
kansa
and
so
on
sometimes
we
would
jump
over
an
area
like
when
we
open
store
number
in
ruston
louisiana
and
we
do
not
have
a
thing
in
south
arkansas
which
be
between
us
and
ruston
so
then
we
start
back
fill
south
arkansas
in
those
day
we
do
not
really
plan
for
the
future
we
just
felt
like
we
could
keep
roll
these
store
out
this
way
and
they
would
keep
work
in
tennessee
or
kansa
or
nebraska
wherever
we
decide
to
go
but
we
do
try
to
think
ahead
some
when
it
come
to
the
city
we
never
plan
on
actually
go
into
the
city
what
we
do
instead
be
build
our
store
in
a
ring
around
a
city
pretty
far
out
and
wait
for
the
growth
to
come
to
us
that
strategy
work
practically
everywhere
we
start
early
with
tulsa
put
store
in
broken
arrow
and
sand
spring
around
kansa
city
we
built
in
warrensburg
belton
and
grandview
on
the
missouri
side
of
town
and
in
bonner
spring
and
leavenworth
across
the
river
in
kansa
we
do
the
same
thing
in
dallas
this
saturation
strategy
have
all
sort
of
benefit
beyond
control
and
distribution
from
the
very
begin
we
never
believe
in
spending
much
money
on
advertising
and
saturation
help
us
to
save
a
fortune
in
that
department
when
you
move
like
we
do
from
town
to
town
in
these
mostly
rural
area
word
of
mouth
get
your
message
out
to
customer
pretty
quickly
without
much
advertising
when
we
have
seventy
five
store
in
arkansas
seventy
five
in
missouri
eighty
in
oklahoma
whatever
people
knew
who
we
be
and
everybody
except
the
merchant
who
be
not
discounting
look
forward
to
our
come
to
their
town
by
do
it
this
way
we
usually
could
get
by
with
distribute
just
one
advertising
circular
a
month
instead
of
run
a
whole
lot
of
newspaper
advertising
we
have
never
be
big
advertiser
and
relative
to
our
size
today
we
still
be
not
just
like
today
we
become
our
own
competitor
in
the
springfield
missouri
area
for
example
we
have
forty
store
within
mile
when
kmart
finally
come
in
there
with
three
store
they
have
a
rough
time
go
up
against
our
kind
of
strength
so
for
the
most
part
we
just
start
repeat
what
work
stamp
out
store
cookie
cutter
style
the
only
decision
we
have
to
make
be
what
size
format
to
put
in
what
market
we
have
five
different
store
size
run
from
about
to
square
foot
and
we
would
hardly
ever
pas
up
any
market
because
it
be
too
small
i
have
travel
so
much
myself
look
at
competitor
in
the
variety
store
business
that
i
have
a
good
feel
for
the
kind
of
potential
in
these
community
bud
and
i
knew
what
we
want
in
the
way
of
location
like
so
many
of
the
idea
that
have
make
our
company
work
from
the
begin
we
be
still
more
or
less
follow
this
same
strategy
although
today
we
have
move
into
some
city
outright
but
i
think
our
main
real
estate
effort
should
be
direct
at
get
out
in
front
of
expansion
and
let
the
population
build
out
to
us
just
like
in
the
begin
we
start
around
these
small
town
people
drive
past
our
store
get
to
know
us
and
become
customer
the
amaze
thing
to
me
be
how
quickly
it
work
we
have
create
so
many
new
friend
down
in
florida
yankee
friend
folk
who
live
up
north
who
see
our
store
in
florida
while
they
be
down
there
for
the
winter
and
they
ca
not
wait
for
us
to
get
up
there
believe
it
or
not
i
get
letter
all
the
time
ask
us
to
put
a
store
in
some
place
up
north
because
our
customer
miss
us
when
they
go
back
home
it
be
the
same
way
in
the
rio
grande
valley
all
the
farmer
from
north
dakota
south
dakota
and
minnesota
go
down
there
for
the
winter
and
get
to
know
us
so
we
be
presold
almost
when
we
go
into
some
of
these
area
that
be
new
for
us
we
be
still
spread
out
and
fill
in
and
we
have
get
a
heck
of
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
saturate
territory
which
we
consider
to
be
basically
friendly
to
wal
mart
there
be
no
question
whatsoever
that
we
could
not
have
do
what
we
do
back
then
if
i
have
not
have
my
airplane
i
bought
that
first
plane
for
business
to
travel
between
the
store
and
keep
in
touch
with
what
be
go
on
but
once
we
start
really
roll
out
the
store
the
airplane
turn
into
a
great
tool
for
scout
real
estate
we
be
probably
ten
year
ahead
of
most
other
retailer
in
scout
location
from
the
air
and
we
get
a
lot
of
great
one
that
way
from
up
in
the
air
we
could
check
out
traffic
flow
see
which
way
city
and
town
be
grow
and
evaluate
the
location
of
the
competition
if
there
be
any
then
we
would
develop
our
real
estate
strategy
for
that
market
i
love
do
it
myself
i
would
get
down
low
turn
my
plane
up
on
its
side
and
fly
right
over
a
town
once
we
have
a
spot
picked
out
we
would
land
go
find
out
who
own
the
property
and
try
to
negotiate
the
deal
right
then
that
be
another
good
reason
i
do
not
like
jet
you
ca
not
get
down
low
enough
to
really
tell
what
go
on
the
way
i
could
in
my
little
plane
bud
and
i
picked
almost
all
our
site
that
way
until
we
grow
to
about
or
store
i
be
always
proud
of
our
technique
and
the
result
we
get
i
guarantee
you
not
many
principal
of
retailing
company
be
fly
around
sideways
study
development
pattern
but
it
work
really
well
for
us
until
we
have
store
or
at
least
or
so
i
kept
up
with
every
real
estate
deal
we
make
and
get
to
view
most
location
before
we
sign
any
kind
of
commitment
a
good
location
and
what
we
have
to
pay
for
it
be
so
important
to
the
success
of
a
store
and
it
be
one
area
of
the
company
in
which
we
have
always
have
family
involvement
jim
do
it
for
a
while
and
even
today
rob
go
on
real
estate
trip
and
attends
every
real
estate
meeting
once
we
found
a
good
location
we
just
get
after
it
and
put
up
a
store
there
we
built
our
own
fixture
then
and
we
still
do
today
we
have
what
we
call
a
store
opening
plan
but
basically
we
would
call
in
the
troop
usually
we
call
in
all
the
available
assistant
manager
and
put
together
a
store
i
will
bet
a
guy
like
al
mile
have
put
together
store
and
be
to
over
store
opening
we
have
to
assemble
the
fixture
order
the
merchandise
and
plan
the
advertising
not
to
mention
hire
and
training
the
folk
to
run
the
store
we
just
all
dove
in
and
get
it
do
there
be
all
kind
of
story
about
those
thing
i
remember
one
time
i
do
not
want
to
spend
any
money
on
motel
so
we
all
slept
in
sleep
bag
on
the
floor
of
one
of
our
guy
house
his
furniture
have
not
gotten
there
yet
ferold
arend
make
a
big
difference
in
the
early
rollout
of
wal
mart
he
be
a
very
organize
person
in
a
way
that
i
be
not
i
always
told
him
it
be
because
he
be
german
but
he
be
the
kind
of
fellow
who
if
he
have
ten
thing
to
do
in
a
day
would
write
them
all
down
and
then
work
to
get
them
do
he
would
double
back
to
see
that
people
do
what
he
told
them
to
do
i
never
do
that
as
a
rule
in
those
day
i
just
kept
move
i
think
a
powerful
sense
of
need
to
take
off
to
the
next
town
or
the
next
store
when
i
be
ready
without
waste
any
time
wait
on
somebody
else
be
probably
the
main
reason
i
never
be
able
to
work
real
well
with
pilot
it
seem
like
they
be
never
ready
to
go
when
i
be
anyway
i
love
the
fly
the
challenge
of
find
my
way
all
over
the
country
evaluate
the
weather
and
make
the
instrument
approach
and
do
everything
myself
but
even
more
than
that
i
love
the
independence
of
be
able
to
go
where
i
want
to
when
i
want
to
in
a
hurry
plus
i
always
like
to
see
people
work
and
the
nature
of
a
corporate
pilot
job
include
a
lot
of
downtime
so
when
we
first
get
a
few
pilot
around
here
i
conceive
this
brilliant
idea
okay
guy
i
say
if
you
want
to
fly
airplane
i
want
you
to
go
into
the
store
and
check
on
our
in
stock
position
in
all
our
department
when
you
be
not
fly
it
make
perfect
sense
to
me
they
need
to
learn
more
about
the
business
they
would
be
help
us
and
they
could
have
have
some
fun
with
it
my
idea
last
about
three
month
and
provoke
all
kind
of
grumble
i
heard
every
excuse
in
the
book
we
have
get
to
check
the
weather
and
make
sure
the
plane
be
take
care
of
and
all
that
finally
i
give
in
and
today
our
pilot
stay
in
the
air
about
as
much
as
anybody
in
their
business
jack
shewmaker
the
first
store
we
open
after
i
get
there
be
number
in
saint
robert
missouri
our
store
opening
crew
be
suppose
to
take
possession
of
a
store
after
construction
be
complete
it
do
not
always
work
out
that
way
when
we
take
that
store
the
parking
lot
be
not
do
i
mean
it
be
gravel
and
have
no
strip
no
cord
of
car
or
anything
so
the
store
manager
gary
reinboth
and
i
be
try
to
figure
out
how
to
avoid
chaos
at
the
opening
our
eye
lit
up
when
we
saw
this
snack
bar
vendor
haul
use
cooking
grease
in
these
huge
yellow
barrel
in
the
back
of
his
truck
so
we
make
a
deal
with
him
he
could
buy
all
our
grease
at
a
good
price
if
we
could
have
all
his
grease
barrel
for
the
grand
opening
we
tie
flag
and
rope
on
them
and
make
a
parking
lot
that
be
the
way
we
thought
in
those
day
sam
want
a
job
do
and
he
be
willing
to
accept
creativity
as
long
as
the
job
get
do
our
mind
be
freewheel
we
rush
to
get
thing
do
i
remember
another
opening
we
have
finally
built
a
new
store
in
morrilton
arkansas
out
near
interstate
to
replace
that
incredible
store
sam
be
so
proud
of
in
the
old
coca
cola
plant
my
bos
be
ferold
arend
and
he
told
me
we
be
go
to
set
a
new
record
of
opening
a
store
in
three
week
i
say
okay
but
he
have
make
a
mistake
by
a
week
so
we
really
have
a
target
date
of
two
week
from
the
day
we
begin
we
try
desperately
but
we
do
not
quite
make
it
we
open
on
thanksgiving
day
and
the
store
be
horrible
i
be
stand
out
in
front
when
sam
drove
up
he
saw
the
disaster
but
he
be
smart
enough
to
know
how
hard
we
would
be
work
and
that
if
he
told
the
truth
we
would
have
just
disintegrate
he
say
the
store
look
really
good
guy
and
he
drove
away
and
left
us
obviously
because
i
have
spent
as
much
time
as
i
could
out
where
it
count
in
the
store
see
if
we
be
do
the
job
we
should
be
it
have
put
a
very
heavy
load
on
all
our
executive
especially
since
i
expect
them
to
get
out
in
the
store
too
my
style
have
always
be
to
lay
off
a
lot
of
the
day
to
day
operating
responsibility
to
folk
like
ferold
arend
and
ron
mayer
in
the
early
day
later
on
to
jack
shewmaker
and
eventually
to
david
glass
and
don
soderquist
so
my
role
have
be
to
pick
good
people
and
give
them
the
maximum
authority
and
responsibility
i
have
be
ask
if
i
be
a
hand
on
manager
or
an
arm
length
type
i
think
really
i
be
more
of
a
manager
by
walk
and
fly
around
and
in
the
process
i
stick
my
finger
into
everything
i
can
to
see
how
it
be
come
along
i
have
let
our
executive
make
their
decision
and
their
mistake
but
i
have
critique
and
advise
them
my
appreciation
for
number
have
kept
me
close
to
our
operational
statement
and
to
all
the
other
information
we
have
pour
in
from
so
many
different
place
in
that
sense
i
think
my
style
as
an
executive
have
be
pretty
much
dictate
by
my
talent
i
have
played
to
my
strength
and
rely
on
others
to
make
up
for
my
weakness
as
i
mention
i
found
out
early
that
one
of
my
talent
be
remember
number
i
ca
not
recall
name
and
a
lot
of
other
thing
as
well
as
i
would
like
to
but
number
just
stick
with
me
and
always
have
that
be
why
i
come
in
every
saturday
morning
usually
around
two
or
three
and
go
through
all
the
weekly
number
i
steal
a
march
on
everybody
else
for
the
saturday
morning
meeting
i
can
go
through
those
sheet
and
look
at
a
store
and
even
though
i
have
not
be
there
in
a
while
i
can
remind
myself
of
something
about
it
the
manager
maybe
and
then
i
can
remember
later
that
they
be
do
this
much
business
this
week
and
that
their
wage
cost
be
such
and
such
i
do
this
with
each
store
every
saturday
morning
it
usually
take
about
three
hour
but
when
i
be
do
i
have
as
good
a
feel
for
what
go
on
in
the
company
as
anybody
here
maybe
well
on
some
day
but
if
you
ask
me
be
i
an
organize
person
i
would
have
to
say
flat
out
no
not
at
all
be
organize
would
really
slow
me
down
in
fact
it
would
probably
render
me
helpless
i
try
to
keep
track
of
what
i
be
suppose
to
do
and
where
i
be
suppose
to
be
but
it
be
true
i
do
not
keep
much
of
a
schedule
i
think
my
way
of
operating
have
more
or
less
driven
loretta
bos
and
later
becky
elliott
my
two
secretary
around
the
bend
my
style
be
pretty
haphazard
loretta
bos
parker
personal
secretary
for
twenty
five
year
he
have
always
be
like
this
his
mind
work
ten
time
faster
than
everybody
else
i
mean
he
just
get
go
and
stay
two
or
three
jump
ahead
and
he
be
quick
to
go
with
what
on
his
mind
if
he
get
something
in
his
mind
that
need
to
be
do
regardless
of
what
else
might
have
be
plan
the
new
idea
take
priority
and
it
have
to
be
do
now
everybody
have
their
day
schedule
and
then
bang
he
just
call
a
meeting
on
something
in
the
early
year
this
cause
a
number
of
embarrassment
i
would
make
appointment
for
him
and
then
tell
him
about
them
we
kept
two
calendar
one
on
his
desk
and
one
on
mine
but
he
would
just
totally
forget
i
have
have
people
fly
in
here
from
dallas
all
set
to
see
him
i
would
come
in
at
a
m
to
meet
them
and
find
out
he
have
flown
out
of
town
at
a
m
without
tell
anybody
where
he
be
go
i
would
just
have
to
look
at
this
man
from
dallas
and
say
he
be
go
so
after
a
few
time
like
that
i
finally
say
i
be
not
go
to
make
appointment
for
you
anymore
and
he
say
well
that
be
probably
best
then
he
would
make
his
own
appointment
and
forget
about
them
and
i
be
still
the
one
who
have
to
give
them
the
bad
news
i
could
not
organize
him
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
i
do
not
think
anyone
else
be
ever
go
to
except
for
reading
my
number
on
saturday
morning
and
go
to
our
regular
meeting
i
do
not
have
much
of
a
routine
for
anything
else
i
always
carry
my
little
tape
recorder
on
trip
to
record
idea
that
come
up
in
my
conversation
with
the
associate
i
usually
have
my
yellow
legal
pad
with
me
with
a
list
of
ten
or
fifteen
thing
we
need
to
be
work
on
as
a
company
my
list
drive
the
executive
around
here
crazy
but
it
be
probably
one
of
my
more
important
contribution
david
glass
when
sam
feel
a
certain
way
he
be
relentless
he
will
just
wear
you
out
he
will
bring
up
an
idea
we
will
all
discus
it
and
then
decide
maybe
that
it
be
not
something
we
should
be
do
right
now
or
ever
fine
case
close
but
as
long
as
he
be
convince
that
it
be
the
right
thing
it
just
keep
come
up
week
after
week
after
week
until
finally
everybody
capitulates
and
say
well
it
be
easy
to
do
it
than
to
keep
fight
this
fight
i
guess
it
could
be
call
management
by
wear
you
down
one
way
i
have
manage
to
keep
up
with
everything
on
my
plate
be
by
come
in
to
the
office
really
early
almost
every
day
even
when
i
do
not
have
those
saturday
number
to
look
over
four
thirty
would
not
be
all
that
unusual
a
time
for
me
to
get
start
down
at
the
office
that
early
morning
time
be
tremendously
valuable
it
be
uninterrupted
time
when
i
think
and
plan
and
sort
thing
out
i
write
my
letter
and
my
article
for
wal
mart
world
our
company
newsletter
a
l
johnson
vice
chairman
wal
mart
i
think
one
of
sam
great
strength
be
that
he
be
totally
unpredictable
he
be
always
his
own
person
totally
independent
in
his
think
as
a
result
he
be
not
a
rubber
stamp
manager
he
never
rubber
stamp
anything
for
anyone
back
when
i
be
general
merchandise
manager
we
do
not
have
much
computer
support
so
every
friday
morning
for
six
year
i
would
take
my
columnar
pad
with
all
the
number
on
it
into
sam
office
for
him
to
review
every
morning
that
i
go
through
those
number
sam
would
jot
them
down
on
his
own
pad
and
work
through
all
the
calculation
himself
i
never
felt
that
he
do
not
trust
my
judgment
he
just
felt
that
it
be
his
function
to
make
sure
of
everything
sometimes
he
would
work
the
number
a
little
differently
from
the
way
i
have
or
argue
with
some
of
my
conclusion
which
kept
me
on
my
toe
the
point
be
i
always
knew
i
could
not
just
go
in
there
and
lay
a
sheet
of
number
in
front
of
him
and
expect
him
to
just
accept
it
as
famous
as
sam
be
for
be
a
great
motivator
and
he
deserves
even
more
credit
than
he
be
gotten
for
that
he
be
equally
good
at
check
on
the
people
he
have
motivate
you
might
call
his
style
management
by
look
over
your
shoulder
i
be
always
ask
if
there
ever
come
a
point
once
we
get
roll
when
i
knew
what
lay
ahead
i
do
not
think
that
i
do
all
i
knew
be
that
we
be
roll
and
that
we
be
successful
we
enjoy
it
and
it
look
like
something
we
could
continue
we
have
found
a
concept
certainly
that
the
customer
like
even
back
then
i
always
say
at
the
first
sign
of
it
get
out
of
control
the
first
time
our
number
do
not
come
through
as
they
should
we
will
pull
in
and
put
our
arm
around
what
we
have
built
up
to
this
point
of
course
we
have
not
have
to
do
it
ferold
arend
the
truth
be
we
be
work
with
a
great
idea
it
be
really
easy
to
develop
discounting
in
those
small
community
before
thing
get
competitive
there
be
not
a
lot
of
competition
for
us
in
the
early
day
because
nobody
be
discounting
in
the
small
community
so
when
we
discount
item
it
be
just
an
unheard
of
concept
outside
the
large
town
the
customer
of
course
be
not
dumb
they
have
friend
and
relative
in
the
city
and
they
have
visit
place
where
discounter
be
operating
so
when
they
saw
this
happen
in
their
town
well
shoot
they
just
flock
to
our
store
to
take
advantage
of
it
i
guess
ferold
be
right
about
the
competition
if
you
be
talk
strictly
about
discounter
but
there
be
a
paradox
here
that
i
think
confuse
a
lot
of
folk
about
us
for
a
long
time
for
twenty
year
back
east
they
always
say
wal
mart
never
have
any
competition
and
that
we
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
when
it
hit
us
they
forgot
that
we
have
come
out
of
the
variety
store
business
and
that
the
heartland
be
the
home
ground
for
practically
all
the
regional
variety
chain
that
developed
in
the
u
s
in
our
ben
franklin
day
we
have
all
the
competition
you
could
ever
want
from
sterling
and
tg
y
and
kuhn
and
all
those
other
regionals
so
while
we
may
not
have
have
any
competition
for
discounting
in
those
little
town
we
be
not
stranger
to
competition
we
be
always
look
at
gibson
and
any
other
regionals
that
might
decide
to
come
our
way
and
we
knew
what
to
do
when
they
do
keep
our
price
as
low
as
possible
by
keep
our
cost
as
low
as
possible
manage
that
whole
period
of
growth
be
the
most
excite
time
of
all
for
me
personally
really
there
have
never
be
anything
quite
like
it
in
the
history
of
retailing
it
be
the
retail
equivalent
of
a
real
gusher
the
whole
thing
as
they
say
in
oklahoma
and
texas
just
sort
of
blow
we
be
bring
great
folk
on
board
to
help
make
it
happen
but
at
that
time
i
be
involve
in
every
phase
of
the
business
merchandising
real
estate
construction
study
the
competition
arrange
the
financing
keep
the
book
everything
we
be
all
work
untold
hour
and
we
be
tremendously
excite
about
what
be
go
on
i
be
not
sure
we
even
have
time
to
realize
just
how
phenomenal
our
growth
rate
in
the
seventy
would
look
on
a
chart
year
later
store
sale
million
million
million
million
million
billion
in
the
early
seventy
we
have
form
this
cooperative
research
group
among
some
of
us
discounter
mostly
regionals
who
do
not
compete
with
one
another
compare
note
with
them
make
me
realize
just
what
an
amaze
performance
wal
mart
be
turn
in
i
remember
they
be
just
astonish
they
could
not
believe
we
could
be
establish
the
number
of
store
that
we
be
we
would
be
put
in
fifty
store
a
year
when
most
of
our
group
would
be
try
to
start
three
four
five
or
six
a
year
it
always
confound
them
they
would
always
ask
how
do
you
do
it
there
be
no
way
you
can
be
do
that
but
we
be
do
it
we
just
stayed
on
top
of
it
and
along
with
increase
our
sale
we
increase
our
profitability
from
million
in
to
million
in
on
paper
we
really
have
no
right
to
do
what
we
do
we
be
all
pound
sand
and
stretch
our
people
and
our
talent
to
the
absolute
maximum
and
do
not
get
me
wrong
i
be
not
say
we
do
not
have
our
share
of
grow
pain
ferold
arend
more
than
anything
else
we
have
manpower
problem
find
good
people
and
get
them
train
in
a
hurry
because
we
always
ran
a
real
tight
organization
we
have
no
excess
people
in
the
store
so
they
have
to
get
real
good
real
fast
back
when
i
have
be
at
hested
and
at
newberry
too
a
guy
have
to
have
ten
year
experience
before
we
would
even
consider
him
to
be
what
we
call
a
manager
in
training
down
here
sam
would
take
people
with
hardly
any
retail
experience
give
them
six
month
with
us
and
if
he
thought
they
show
any
real
potential
to
merchandise
a
store
and
manage
people
he
would
give
them
a
chance
he
would
make
them
an
assistant
manager
they
be
the
one
who
would
go
around
and
open
all
the
new
store
and
they
would
be
next
in
line
to
manage
their
own
store
in
my
opinion
most
of
them
be
not
anywhere
near
ready
to
run
store
but
sam
prove
me
wrong
there
he
finally
convince
me
if
you
take
someone
who
lack
the
experience
and
the
know
how
but
have
the
real
desire
and
the
willingness
to
work
his
tail
off
to
get
the
job
do
he
will
make
up
for
what
he
lack
and
that
prove
true
nine
time
out
of
ten
it
be
one
way
we
be
able
to
grow
so
fast
we
be
try
to
put
in
as
many
merchandising
program
as
we
could
and
give
our
store
as
much
support
as
possible
during
all
this
growth
but
in
the
early
seventy
that
wal
mart
manager
be
still
pretty
much
out
there
on
his
own
when
it
come
to
promote
item
and
move
the
merchandise
thomas
jefferson
early
wal
mart
district
manager
hire
from
sterling
store
later
operation
manager
several
time
a
year
most
store
would
have
a
big
sidewalk
promotion
in
those
day
we
sell
about
as
much
merchandise
off
the
sidewalk
on
weekend
as
we
sell
inside
the
store
you
know
we
would
rope
off
part
of
the
parking
lot
get
a
band
and
have
maybe
a
boatload
sale
we
would
take
our
boat
we
sell
these
john
boat
put
them
up
on
sawhorse
and
dump
one
item
into
each
boat
we
would
put
big
sign
up
call
them
boatload
sale
they
still
have
sidewalk
promotion
today
but
not
like
we
once
do
it
do
not
work
that
well
anymore
while
all
this
be
go
on
in
the
early
seventy
ferold
arend
and
ron
mayer
and
bob
thornton
and
myself
be
still
try
to
get
a
handle
on
how
to
distribute
to
a
grow
number
of
store
in
these
small
town
off
the
beaten
path
it
be
one
of
those
thing
that
use
to
drive
me
crazy
i
be
always
walk
through
the
warehouse
in
bentonville
say
where
do
this
go
who
bought
this
we
have
get
too
much
of
that
meanwhile
the
guy
out
in
the
store
would
be
cry
for
this
stuff
and
we
could
not
get
it
out
to
them
i
remember
be
very
nervous
when
everybody
decide
we
need
to
buy
our
own
truck
but
we
do
it
we
have
two
tractor
and
four
trailer
and
the
folk
in
the
warehouse
get
to
where
they
thought
we
need
four
tractor
and
six
trailer
i
thought
that
be
pretty
extreme
so
word
would
get
out
that
i
be
come
out
to
the
warehouse
and
if
they
have
an
extra
tractor
or
trailer
sit
idle
they
would
haul
it
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
building
and
hide
it
so
i
would
not
know
we
have
anything
empty
thomas
jefferson
the
faster
we
grow
the
far
behind
we
fell
we
be
always
behind
with
our
distribution
we
never
open
a
warehouse
soon
enough
and
we
always
have
too
many
store
to
service
before
the
warehouse
would
get
open
nowadays
i
think
they
stay
about
one
and
a
half
distribution
center
out
front
of
demand
but
back
then
we
have
a
terrible
time
get
the
freight
to
the
store
so
we
be
rent
outside
warehouse
which
be
very
expensive
to
operate
and
we
just
have
more
than
we
could
handle
sometimes
we
would
have
five
hundred
trailer
full
of
merchandise
sit
around
one
of
those
warehouse
and
it
take
time
to
deal
with
all
that
we
could
not
get
it
out
then
the
next
day
we
would
get
sixty
boxcar
load
we
would
have
to
unload
the
doggoned
boxcar
and
here
the
merchandise
they
want
in
the
store
would
be
sit
there
sometimes
a
week
or
a
week
and
a
half
it
be
a
big
problem
and
one
that
worried
me
a
lot
which
be
probably
why
as
we
move
along
in
the
seventy
i
just
kept
after
folk
like
david
glass
who
be
still
in
the
discount
drug
business
up
in
missouri
and
don
soderquist
who
be
run
ben
franklin
to
come
to
work
for
us
i
knew
they
be
both
big
talent
and
i
knew
we
be
go
to
need
all
the
help
we
could
get
in
all
area
but
especially
in
the
one
i
be
not
all
that
great
at
such
as
distribution
and
system
like
i
say
before
ron
mayer
have
work
hard
on
that
distribution
system
introduce
all
the
concept
like
merchandise
assembly
cross
dock
and
transshipment
but
i
do
not
think
our
distribution
system
ever
really
get
under
complete
control
until
david
glass
finally
relent
and
come
on
board
in
more
than
anybody
else
he
be
responsible
for
building
the
sophisticated
and
efficient
system
we
use
today
while
ron
and
ferold
be
help
me
run
the
company
and
well
before
david
join
us
in
the
mid
seventy
jack
shewmaker
be
come
on
strong
as
a
big
talent
he
have
do
a
fantastic
job
in
opening
store
jack
have
be
the
manager
of
a
kroger
supercenter
which
be
a
concept
combine
grocery
and
general
merchandise
not
unlike
our
own
supercenters
today
so
he
have
be
a
merchant
but
he
be
not
overly
experienced
when
i
hire
him
he
be
in
that
first
wave
of
college
men
i
have
start
to
hire
and
be
a
graduate
of
georgia
tech
he
have
that
engineer
love
of
system
and
organization
that
we
be
still
badly
in
need
of
by
now
i
be
really
surround
myself
with
guy
who
be
good
at
all
the
thing
i
tend
to
just
sluff
off
like
organize
the
company
to
handle
the
growth
explosion
we
have
start
if
i
have
not
go
after
those
folk
and
kept
on
do
it
we
would
have
come
apart
somewhere
there
in
the
seventy
or
we
certainly
would
not
have
be
able
to
pull
off
our
really
incredible
expansion
in
the
eighty
get
an
early
start
on
all
these
system
building
a
foundation
for
our
distribution
center
development
start
to
put
data
processing
into
the
store
really
save
our
bacon
later
on
jack
shewmaker
sam
and
ferold
call
me
in
one
day
and
say
we
understand
you
have
get
some
experience
in
write
policy
manual
i
have
write
some
for
both
kroger
and
coast
to
coast
hardware
store
out
of
minneapolis
so
they
say
we
want
you
to
come
in
and
write
up
our
policy
and
procedure
for
us
i
say
well
that
be
nice
but
that
be
not
really
what
i
would
like
to
do
i
want
to
work
with
the
merchandising
people
and
sam
say
well
we
would
kind
of
like
you
to
do
it
anyway
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
to
do
it
i
knew
from
experience
it
would
take
six
month
to
a
year
to
properly
do
this
job
but
i
say
i
will
do
it
in
ninety
day
sam
reply
you
have
get
sixty
day
sam
never
want
to
wait
for
anything
he
have
no
patience
that
be
probably
the
meld
between
us
that
bias
toward
action
anyway
we
publish
it
page
of
it
in
fifty
nine
day
as
you
will
see
later
jack
may
have
be
the
most
controversial
guy
we
ever
have
in
senior
management
but
he
dove
right
into
systematize
thing
and
he
become
a
great
merchant
too
thomas
jefferson
that
whole
period
mayer
time
of
duty
and
early
shewmaker
be
when
we
really
saw
the
system
and
computer
begin
to
come
into
our
life
at
the
operation
level
the
store
level
we
have
be
use
class
cash
register
in
all
our
store
old
hand
crank
job
you
know
which
be
very
slow
ron
talk
sam
into
buying
singer
electric
cash
register
for
the
store
which
be
a
great
idea
because
you
could
not
really
have
run
a
business
much
longer
without
electric
register
only
trouble
be
those
singer
register
turn
out
to
be
temperamental
as
hell
al
mile
be
the
only
manager
we
have
who
ever
really
figure
out
how
to
work
one
so
mayer
have
the
right
idea
but
the
wrong
register
as
for
in
store
computer
you
would
have
to
give
shewmaker
the
credit
for
that
not
many
of
us
give
in
store
computer
much
thought
but
shewmaker
study
all
that
stuff
and
we
would
run
with
whatever
he
talk
sam
into
put
in
the
store
it
seem
like
we
try
to
well
ourselves
with
some
new
gadget
every
year
that
be
the
begin
of
what
turn
into
wal
mart
communication
system
i
guess
but
most
of
us
be
too
busy
in
the
store
to
even
think
about
where
it
be
all
lead
as
we
move
along
in
the
seventy
we
have
very
definitely
become
an
effective
retail
entity
and
we
have
set
the
stage
for
the
even
more
phenomenal
growth
that
be
go
to
follow
it
be
amaze
that
our
competitor
do
not
catch
on
to
us
quicker
and
try
harder
to
stop
us
whenever
we
put
a
wal
mart
store
into
a
town
customer
would
just
flock
to
us
from
the
variety
store
it
do
not
take
those
store
long
to
figure
out
that
if
they
be
go
to
stay
in
business
against
this
thing
wal
mart
have
create
they
be
go
to
have
to
go
into
it
themselves
and
most
of
them
do
eventually
convert
to
discounting
kuhn
big
k
become
a
discount
chain
sterling
launch
its
magic
mart
discount
chain
and
duckwall
go
into
discounting
now
most
of
these
guy
already
have
distribution
center
and
system
in
place
while
we
have
to
build
one
from
scratch
so
on
paper
we
really
do
not
stand
a
chance
what
happen
be
that
they
do
not
really
commit
to
discounting
they
held
on
to
their
old
variety
store
concept
too
long
they
be
so
accustom
to
get
their
percent
markup
they
never
let
go
it
be
hard
for
them
to
take
a
blouse
they
would
be
sell
for
and
sell
it
for
and
only
make
percent
with
our
low
cost
our
low
expense
structure
and
our
low
price
we
be
end
an
era
in
the
heartland
we
shut
the
door
on
variety

think

building
the
partnership
what
you
have
create
here
be
well
than
communism
well
than
socialism
could
ever
be
well
even
than

i
like
to
call
what
you
have
get
here
enlighten
consumerism
where
everybody
work
together
as
a

as

real

the
truth
be
that
none
of
that
be
the
real
secret
to
our
unbelievable
prosperity
what
have
carry
this
company
so
far
so
fast
be
the
relationship
that
we
the
manager
have
be
able
to
enjoy
with
our
associate
by
associate
we
mean
those
employee
out
in
the
store
and
in
the
distribution
center
and
on
the
truck
who
generally
earn
an
hourly
wage
for
all
their
hard
work
our
relationship
with
the
associate
be
a
partnership
in
the
truest
sense
it
be
the
only
reason
our
company
have
be
able
to
consistently
outperform
the
competition
and
even
our
own
expectation
now
i
would
love
to
tell
you
that
this
partnership
be
all
part
of
my
master
plan
from
the
begin
that
as
a
young
man
i
have
some
sort
of
vision
of
a
great
retailing
company
in
which
all
the
employee
would
be
award
a
stake
in
the
business
that
i
saw
them
have
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
many
of
the
decision
that
would
determine
the
profitability
of
that
business
i
would
love
to
tell
you
that
from
the
very
begin
we
always
paid
our
employee
well
than
anyone
else
paid
theirs
and
treat
them
as
equal
i
would
love
to
tell
you
all
that
but
unfortunately
none
of
it
would
be
true
in
the
begin
i
be
so
chintzy
i
really
do
not
pay
my
employee
very
well
the
manager
be
fine
from
the
time
we
start
branching
out
into
more
store
we
always
have
a
partnership
with
the
store
manager
those
guy
i
have
already
told
you
about
like
willard
walker
and
charlie
baum
and
charlie
cate
all
have
a
piece
of
their
store
profit
from
the
begin
but
we
really
do
not
do
much
for
the
clerk
except
pay
them
an
hourly
wage
and
i
guess
that
wage
be
as
little
as
we
could
get
by
with
at
the
time
in
fairness
to
myself
though
that
be
pretty
much
the
way
retail
be
in
those
day
especially
in
the
independent
variety
store
part
of
the
business
charlie
baum
when
i
take
over
the
store
in
fayetteville
which
would
have
be
may
of
sam
be
pay
the
girl
fifty
cent
an
hour
after
that
first
paycheck
go
out
i
thought
about
it
and
decide
this
be
for
the
bird
so
the
next
week
i
raise
them
to
seventy
five
cent
an
hour
and
i
get
a
telephone
call
from
sam
he
say
charlie
we
do
not
give
raise
of
a
quarter
an
hour
we
give
them
a
nickel
an
hour
but
i
do
not
cut
back
i
stayed
with
the
seventy
five
cent
because
those
girl
be
earn
it
we
be
a
high
volume
store
for
those
day
make
pretty
good
money
i
do
not
remember
be
that
tight
but
i
guess
charlie
get
it
about
right
we
do
not
pay
much
it
be
not
that
i
be
intentionally
heartless
i
want
everybody
to
do
well
for
themselves
it
be
just
that
in
my
very
early
day
in
the
business
i
be
so
doggoned
competitive
and
so
determine
to
do
well
that
i
be
blind
to
the
most
basic
truth
really
the
principle
that
later
become
the
foundation
of
wal
mart
success
you
see
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
in
the
retail
business
payroll
be
one
of
the
most
important
part
of
overhead
and
overhead
be
one
of
the
most
crucial
thing
you
have
to
fight
to
maintain
your
profit
margin
that
be
true
then
and
it
be
still
true
today
back
then
though
i
be
so
obsess
with
turn
in
a
profit
margin
of
percent
or
high
that
i
ignore
some
of
the
basic
need
of
our
people
and
i
feel
bad
about
it
the
large
truth
that
i
fail
to
see
turn
out
to
be
another
of
those
paradox
like
the
discounter
principle
of
the
less
you
charge
the
more
you
will
earn
and
here
it
be
the
more
you
share
profit
with
your
associate
whether
it
be
in
salary
or
incentive
or
bonus
or
stock
discount
the
more
profit
will
accrue
to
the
company
why
because
the
way
management
treat
the
associate
be
exactly
how
the
associate
will
then
treat
the
customer
and
if
the
associate
treat
the
customer
well
the
customer
will
return
again
and
again
and
that
be
where
the
real
profit
in
this
business
lie
not
in
try
to
drag
stranger
into
your
store
for
one
time
purchase
base
on
splashy
sale
or
expensive
advertising
satisfied
loyal
repeat
customer
be
at
the
heart
of
wal
mart
spectacular
profit
margin
and
those
customer
be
loyal
to
us
because
our
associate
treat
them
well
than
salesperson
in
other
store
do
so
in
the
whole
wal
mart
scheme
of
thing
the
most
important
contact
ever
make
be
between
the
associate
in
the
store
and
the
customer
i
do
not
catch
on
to
that
idea
for
quite
a
while
in
fact
the
big
single
regret
in
my
whole
business
career
be
that
we
do
not
include
our
associate
in
the
initial
manager
only
profit
share
plan
when
we
take
the
company
public
in
but
there
be
nobody
around
preach
that
philosophy
in
those
day
and
i
guess
i
be
just
too
worried
about
my
own
debt
and
in
too
big
a
hurry
to
get
somewhere
fast
today
some
of
our
company
critic
would
like
everybody
to
believe
we
start
our
profit
share
program
and
other
benefit
merely
as
a
way
to
stave
off
union
organize
the
traditional
version
of
what
happen
be
that
the
retail
clerk
union
organize
a
strike
against
us
when
we
open
store
number
in
clinton
missouri
and
another
one
when
we
open
store
number
in
mexico
missouri
and
that
in
response
to
those
trouble
we
start
all
these
program
to
keep
the
union
out
that
story
be
only
partly
true
we
do
have
labor
trouble
in
those
two
store
and
we
do
fight
the
union
legally
and
aboveboard
and
we
won
in
fact
we
have
never
lose
a
union
organize
election
but
the
idea
for
share
profit
and
benefit
have
come
up
even
before
we
go
public
not
from
me
but
from
helen
helen
walton
we
be
on
a
trip
drive
someplace
and
we
be
talk
about
the
high
salary
that
sam
be
earn
and
about
all
the
money
and
benefit
that
he
be
pay
the
officer
of
the
company
in
order
to
keep
his
top
people
he
explain
that
the
people
in
the
store
do
not
get
any
of
those
benefit
and
i
think
it
be
the
first
time
i
realize
how
little
the
company
be
do
for
them
i
suggest
to
him
that
unless
those
people
be
on
board
the
top
people
might
not
last
long
either
i
remember
it
because
he
do
not
really
appreciate
my
point
of
view
at
that
time
later
on
i
could
tell
he
be
think
about
it
and
when
he
bought
it
he
really
bought
it
it
may
be
true
that
our
skirmish
with
the
retail
clerk
and
some
other
union
along
the
way
construction
union
at
our
building
site
and
the
teamster
at
our
distribution
center
help
hurry
along
our
think
in
this
direction
the
union
who
do
not
seem
to
like
our
company
much
maybe
because
they
have
never
have
any
luck
organize
us
want
everyone
to
believe
they
be
the
only
reason
we
have
ever
do
anything
good
for
any
of
our
associate
the
truth
be
once
we
start
experiment
with
this
idea
of
treat
our
associate
as
partner
it
do
not
take
long
to
realize
the
enormous
potential
it
have
for
improve
our
business
and
it
do
not
take
the
associate
long
to
figure
out
how
much
well
off
they
would
be
as
the
company
do
well
i
have
always
believe
strongly
that
we
do
not
need
union
at
wal
mart
theoretically
i
understand
the
argument
that
union
try
to
make
that
the
associate
need
someone
to
represent
them
and
so
on
but
historically
as
union
have
developed
in
this
country
they
have
mostly
just
be
divisive
they
have
put
management
on
one
side
of
the
fence
employee
on
the
other
and
themselves
in
the
middle
as
almost
a
separate
business
one
that
depends
on
division
between
the
other
two
camp
and
divisiveness
by
break
down
direct
communication
make
it
harder
to
take
care
of
customer
to
be
competitive
and
to
gain
market
share
the
partnership
we
have
at
wal
mart
which
include
profit
share
incentive
bonus
discount
stock
purchase
plan
and
a
genuine
effort
to
involve
the
associate
in
the
business
so
we
can
all
pull
together
work
well
for
both
side
than
any
situation
i
know
of
involve
union
i
be
not
say
we
pay
well
than
anybody
though
we
be
certainly
competitive
in
our
industry
and
in
the
region
where
we
be
operating
we
have
to
be
if
we
want
to
attract
and
keep
good
people
but
over
the
long
haul
our
associate
build
value
for
themselves
financially
and
otherwise
by
believe
in
the
company
and
keep
it
head
in
the
right
direction
together
we
have
ridden
this
thing
pretty
darn
far
on
the
other
hand
let
me
say
this
anytime
we
have
ever
have
real
trouble
or
the
serious
possibility
of
a
union
come
into
the
company
it
have
be
because
management
have
fail
because
we
have
not
listen
to
our
associate
or
because
we
have
mistreat
them
i
think
anytime
the
employee
at
a
company
say
they
need
a
union
it
be
because
management
have
do
a
lousy
job
of
manage
and
work
with
their
people
usually
it
be
directly
traceable
to
what
go
on
at
the
line
supervisor
level
something
stupid
that
some
supervisor
do
or
something
good
he
or
she
do
not
do
that
be
our
problem
at
clinton
and
at
mexico
our
manager
do
not
listen
they
be
not
as
open
with
their
folk
as
they
should
have
be
they
do
not
communicate
with
them
they
do
not
share
with
them
and
consequently
we
get
in
trouble
we
fought
those
situation
use
pretty
traditional
method
we
hire
a
good
labor
lawyer
john
tate
who
have
won
a
lot
of
organize
battle
over
the
year
and
who
have
since
join
our
company
his
advice
help
me
become
even
more

to

take
care
of
your
people

john
help
us
conduct
a
management
seminar
down
at
tan
tar
a
resort
in
missouri
and
soon
thereafter
we
launch
a
program
call
we
care
design
to
let
the
associate
know
that
when
they
have
problem
we
want
them
to
come
to
management
and
give
us
a
chance
to
solve
them
our
message
become
sure
we
be
a
nonunion
company
but
we
think
we
be
strong
because
of
it
and
because
you
be
our
partner
we
have
an
open
door
and
we
listen
to
you
and
together
we
can
work
out
our
problem
the
union
of
course
would
argue
more
along
the
line
of
hey
we
can
get
you
a
an
hour
raise
why
do
not
you
strike
there
be
be
all
sort
of
debate
over
why
we
chose
to
call
our
employee
associate
and
everybody
and
his
brother
take
credit
for
it
i
do
not
know
maybe
they
be
right
but
the
way
i
remember
it
be
pretty
simple
first
of
all
in
my
day
james
cash
penney
have
call
his
hourly
employee
associate
and
i
guess
i
always
have
that
idea
in
the
back
of
my
head
but
the
idea
to
try
it
at
wal
mart
actually
occur
to
me
on
a
trip
to
england
helen
walton
we
be
on
a
tennis
vacation
to
england
we
be
there
to
see
wimbledon
one
day
we
be
walk
down
a
street
in
london
and
sam
of
course
stop
to
look
at
a
store
he
always
stop
to
look
in
store
wherever
we
go
anywhere
in
the
world
it
do
not
matter
on
that
same
trip
we
lose
a
lot
of
our
thing
in
italy
when
thief
broke
into
the
car
while
he
be
look
at
a
big
discount
store
anyway
he
stop
at
this
one
english
retailing
company
and
i
remember
him
say
look
at
that
sign
that
be
great
that
be
what
we
should
do
it
be
lewis
company
j
m
lewis
partnership
they
have
a
partnership
with
all
their
associate
list
up
on
the
sign
for
some
reason
that
whole
idea
really
excite
me
a
partnership
with
all
our
associate
as
soon
as
we
get
home
we
start
call
our
store
worker
associate
instead
of
employee
that
may
not
sound
like
any
big
deal
to
some
folk
and
they
be
right
it
would
not
have
meant
a
thing
if
we
have
not
take
other
action
to
make
it
real
to
make
it
something
other
than
window
dress
the
decision
we
reach
around
that
time
to
commit
ourselves
to
give
the
associate
more
equitable
treatment
in
the
company
be
without
a
doubt
the
single
smartest
move
we
ever
make
at
wal
mart
in
we
take
our
first
big
step
we
correct
my
big
error
of
the
year
before
and
start
a
profit
share
plan
for
all
the
associate
i
guess
it
be
the
move
we
make
that
i
be
proudest
of
for
a
number
of
reason
profit
share
have
pretty
much
be
the
carrot
that
be
kept
wal
mart
head
forward
every
associate
of
the
company
who
have
be
with
us
at
least
a
year
and
who
work
at
least
hour
a
year
be
eligible
for
it
use
a
formula
base
on
profit
growth
we
contribute
a
percentage
of
every
eligible
associate
wage
to
his
or
her
plan
which
the
associate
can
take
when
they
leave
the
company
either
in
cash
or
wal
mart
stock
there
be
nothing
that
unusual
about
the
structure
of
the
plan
it
be
the
performance
i
be
so
proud
of
for
the
last
ten
year
the
company
contribute
an
average
of
percent
of
wage
to
the
plan
last
year
for
example
wal
mart
contribution
be
million
now
the
folk
who
administer
profit
share
and
this
include
a
committee
of
associate
have
chosen
year
after
year
to
keep
the
plan
invest
mostly
in
wal
mart
stock
so
the
thing
have
grown
beyond
belief
collectively
and
in
the
individual
account
of
a
lot
of
associate
today
as
i
write
this

around

a
whole

go

there
when
i
be
twenty
year
old
when
i
come

bentonville
there
be
nine
people
in

now
there

one
of
us
my
brother
try
to
talk
me
into
quit
back
in
the
begin
he
say
i
could
go
anywhere
other
than
wal
mart
and
make
more
an
hour
well
in
i
have
in
profit
share
in
i
have
i
told
my
brother
to
show
me
anywhere
else
i
could
go
and
do
that
and
i
would
change
job
if
you
have
faith
in
this
company
it
be
amaze
how
your
loyalty
pay
off
i
be
so
glad
i
stuck
to
it
my
money
be
go
to
send
my
daughter
ashley
to
college
those
be
some
of
my
partner
and
we
have
come
a
long
way
together
about
the
same
time
we
start
profit
share
we
cranked
up
a
lot
of
other
financial
partnership
program
we
have
get
an
employee
stock
purchase
plan
so
associate
can
buy
stock
through
payroll
deduction
at
a
discount
of
percent
off
market
value
today
more
than
percent
of
our
associate
own
wal
mart
stock
either
through
profit
share
or
on
their
own
and
personally
i
figure
most
of
the
other
percent
either
have
not
qualify
for
profit
share
yet
or
have
not
be
with
us
long
enough
to
catch
on
over
the
year
we
have
also
have
a
variety
of
incentive
and
bonus
plan
to
keep
every
associate
involve
in
the
business
as
partner
one
of
the
most
successful
bonus
have
be
our
shrink
incentive
plan
which
demonstrates
the
partnership
principle
as
well
as
any
i
know
beyond
just
straight
profit
share
as
you
may
know
shrinkage
or
unaccounted
for
inventory
loss
theft
in
other
word
be
one
of
the
big
enemy
of
profitability
in
the
retail
business
so
in
we
decide
the
best
way
to
control
the
problem
be
to
share
with
the
associate
any
profitability
the
company
gain
by
reduce
it
if
a
store
hold
shrinkage
below
the
company
goal
every
associate
in
that
store
get
a
bonus
that
could
be
as
much
as
this
be
sort
of
competitive
information
but
i
can
tell
you
that
our
shrinkage
percentage
be
about
half
the
industry
average
not
only
that
it
help
our
associate
feel
well
about
each
other
and
themselves
most
people
do
not
enjoy
steal
even
the
one
who
will
do
it
if
give
the
opportunity
and
most
associate
do
not
want
to
think
that
they
be
work
alongside
anyone
who
do
enjoy
steal
so
under
a
plan
like
this
where
you
be
directly
reward
for
honesty
there
be
a
real
incentive
to
keep
from
ignore
any
customer
who
might
want
to
walk
off
with
something
or
bad
to
allow
any
of
your
fellow
associate
to
fall
into
that
trap
everybody
work
in
that
store
becomes
a
partner
in
try
to
stop
shrinkage
and
when
they
succeed
they
along
with
the
company
in
which
they
already
hold
stock
share
in
the
reward
it
all
sound
simple
enough
and
the
theory
really
be
pretty
basic
none
of
this
lead
to
a
true
partnership
unless
your
manager
understand
the
importance
of
the
associate
to
the
whole
process
and
execute
it
sincerely
lip
service
wo
not
make
a
real
partnership
not
even
with
profit
share
plenty
of
company
offer
some
kind
of
profit
share
but
share
absolutely
no
sense
of
partnership
with
their
employee
because
they
do
not
really
believe
those
employee
be
important
and
they
do
not
work
to
lead
them
these
day
the
real
challenge
for
manager
in
a
business
like
ours
be
to
become
what
we
call
servant
leader
and
when
they
do
the
team
the
manager
and
the
associate
can
accomplish
anything
many
people
have
predict
for
year
that
wal
mart
would
lose
its
way
once
we
get
to
the
tough
challenge
of
real
urban
environment
supposedly
our
approach
just
wo
not
work
in
neighborhood
with
disenfranchise
citizen
and
underprivileged
people
who
have
never
be
winner
the
wal
mart
way
ca
not
reach
folk
who
have
be
thief
and
who
for
the
most
part
have
not
felt
much
pride
in
their
life
but
i
want
to
tell
you
about
a
visit
i
make
to
a
store
near
dallas
a
couple
of
year
ago
store
number
in
irving
texas
the
store
have
a
very
young
and
very
ethnic
work
force
and
customer
base
and
our
manager
there
be
do
a
terrible
job
with
his
people
i
think
maybe
he
just
say
to
himself
well
they
be
young
and
they
be
poor
white
and
black
and
mexican
and
they
be
just
go
to
steal
and
i
ca
not
do
anything
about
it
so
he
be
not
very
definitely
not
be
a
servant
leader
this
store
be
as
bad
off
as
any
wal
mart
i
have
ever
see
it
have
the
high
shrinkage
of
any
wal
mart
ever
around
percent
which
for
us
be
unheard
of
the
store
be
lose
more
than
a
half
million
dollar
a
year
and
we
thought
we
ought
to
close
it
but
we
have
a
real
maverick
name
ed
nagy
who
be
then
a
district
manager
ed
a
fella
who
always
step
on
toe
or
break
one
rule
or
another
he
be
constantly
in
trouble
and
he
like
to
try
new
thing
and
i
have
to
admit
he
reminds
me
a
bit
of
myself
as
a
youngster
he
go
into
that
store
and
he
have
a
talk
with
the
store
manager
and
he
start
training
the
department
head
and
he
set
some
realistic
goal
for
these
folk
and
he
start
give
them
some
motivational
talk
explain
how
we
be
different
from
other
company
and
they
be
really
miss
out
on
something
by
not
participate
then
he
find
out
that
the
associate
be
just
steal
rampant
throughout
the
store
and
let
the
customer
steal
too
because
no
one
have
set
any
control
no
one
be
check
on
the
refund
no
one
be
check
on
the
layaways
no
one
be
even
check
on
the
cash
register
if
you
want
to
steal
you
knew
you
would
not
get
caught
so
they
start
check
on
all
those
thing
and
they
start
talk
about
integrity
and
they
talk
about
improve
sale
within
a
year
and
a
half
this
store
be
turn
around
completely
the
shrink
be
down
to
percent
it
start
turn
a
profit
and
when
i
go
in
there
to
visit
i
think
it
be
one
of
the
proudest
moment
i
have
have
in
forty
year
of
visit
almost
two
thousand
store
it
be
just
an
unbelievable
job
of
an
action
orient
right
think
motivator
step
in
and
save
a
horrible
situation
now
why
do
it
work
well
for
one
thing
nagy
the
district
manager
take
a
lot
of
the
department
manager
out
of
that
store
out
of
that
lose
environment
and
get
them
to
rub
shoulder
with
some
of
the
folk
from
the
successful
store
in
his
district
they
have
a
weekend
meeting
and
they
talk
about
their
department
and
he
make
these
folk
participate
then
he
have
them
set
their
own
goal
and
maybe
while
they
be
have
lunch
with
these
winner
from
the
other
store
maybe
they
start
to
dream
a
little
and
think
a
little
about
how
they
could
improve
the
mess
they
be
in
he
and
the
other
manager
talk
about
the
number
with
them
and
begin
to
show
them
how
their
job
and
decision
related
to
those
number
so
they
would
care
about
whether
their
sale
be
up
and
not
just
stand
there
go
through
the
motion
they
begin
to
learn
a
little
about
merchandising
but
here
be
the
best
part
when
they
put
in
their
control
to
try
and
stop
the
steal
they
start
check
every
empty
box
that
left
the
back
door
well
one
day
they
found
a
big
box
a
baby
buggy
box
that
have
worth
of
tape
in
it
and
they
caught
the
guy
at
the
door
with
it
so
they
have
a
meeting
the
next
morning
and
the
manager
talk
about
the
woman
who
discover
the
box
and
caught
the
thief
and
she
be
a
hero
everybody
give
her
a
big
round
of
applause
the
culture
be
turn
around
there
in
a
short
period
of
time
i
learn
this
early
on
in
the
variety
store
business
you
have
get
to
give
folk
responsibility
you
have
get
to
trust
them
and
then
you
have
get
to
check
on
them
it
be
true
that
we
have
more
difficulty
in
the
city
with
our
approach
we
have
more
trouble
come
up
with
educate
people
who
want
to
work
in
our
industry
or
with
people
of
the
right
moral
character
and
integrity
folk
in
small
town
in
iowa
and
mississippi
be
more
likely
to
want
to
work
for
what
we
can
pay
than
folk
in
houston
or
dallas
or
st
louis
and
yes
they
be
probably
more
likely
to
buy
our
philosophy
in
the
country
than
they
be
in
the
city
but
let
me
tell
you
this
a
smart
motivational
good
manager
can
work
what
some
outsider
call
wal
mart
magic
with
folk
anywhere
it
may
take
more
time
you
may
have
to
sift
through
more
people
and
you
may
have
to
become
more
skilled
with
your
hire
practice
but
i
truly
believe
that
people
anywhere
will
eventually
respond
to
the
same
sort
of
motivational
technique
we
use
if
they
be
treat
right
and
be
give
the
opportunity
to
be
properly
train
if
you
be
good
to
people
and
fair
with
them
and
demand
of
them
they
will
eventually
decide
you
be
on
their
side
and
i
want
to
tell
you
something
else
wal
mart
be
not
a
big
success
merely
because
we
grow
up
out
here
in
the
country
where
people
be
just
naturally
friendly
and
therefore
make
great
retail
employee
it
be
true
that
we
have
many
fine
associate
from
the
country
but
they
have
have
to
enter
our
culture
and
learn
retailing
just
like
anybody
else
and
we
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
teach
many
of
them
to
overcome
their
natural
shyness
and
learn
to
speak
up
and
help
our
customer
so
i
think
some
folk
outside
our
company
may
be
put
a
little
too
much
emphasis
on
the
suppose
low
quality
of
worker
in
the
city
and
not
enough
emphasis
on
the
failure
of
some
manager
to
do
their
job
in
get
those
worker
go
in
the
right
direction
year
ago
if
we
have
not
do
so
well
some
of
these
folk
might
have
say
you
could
never
build
a
retailing
empire
in
small
town
america
because
you
would
not
be
able
to
attract
a
work
force
that
be
sophisticated
enough
another
important
ingredient
that
have
be
in
the
wal
mart
partnership
from
the
very
begin
have
be
our
very
unusual
willingness
to
share
most
of
the
number
of
our
business
with
all
the
associate
it
be
the
only
way
they
can
possibly
do
their
job
to
the
best
of
their
ability
to
know
what
go
on
in
their
business
if
i
be
a
little
slow
to
pick
up
on
share
the
profit
we
be
among
the
first
in
our
industry
and
be
still
way
out
front
of
almost
everybody
with
the
idea
of
empower
our
associate
by
run
the
business
practically
as
an
open
book
i
have
always
told
people
in
the
store
what
be
go
on
with
the
number
but
after
we
decide
to
act
like
a
partnership
we
formalize
the
share
of
information
to
a
much
great
degree
share
information
and
responsibility
be
a
key
to
any
partnership
it
make
people
feel
responsible
and
involve
and
as
we
have
gotten
big
we
have
really
have
to
accept
share
a
lot
of
our
number
with
the
rest
of
the
world
as
a
consequence
of
stick
by
our
philosophy
everything
about
us
get
to
the
outside
in
our
individual
store
we
show
them
their
store
profit
their
store
purchase
their
store
sale
and
their
store
markdowns
we
show
them
all
that
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
be
not
talk
about
just
the
manager
and
the
assistant
manager
we
share
that
information
with
every
associate
every
hourly
every
part
time
employee
in
the
store
obviously
some
of
that
information
flow
to
the
street
but
i
just
believe
the
value
of
share
it
with
our
associate
be
much
great
than
any
downside
there
may
be
to
share
it
with
folk
on
the
outside
it
do
not
seem
to
have
hurt
us
much
so
far
and
in
fact
i
have
be
reading
lately
that
what
we
have
be
do
all
along
be
part
of
one
of
the
late
big
trend
in
business
these
day
share
rather
than
hoard
information
all
i
know
be
that
nothing
ever
make
me
feel
well
than
when
i
visit
a
store
and
some
department
head
come
up
to
me
with
pride
and
show
me
all
her
number
and
tell
me
she
be
number
five
in
the
company
but
she
plan
to
be
number
one
next
year
i
love
meeting
all
these
merchant
we
have
get
on
our
team
out
there
when
they
show
me
an
endcap
display
they
have
get
load
up
with
charcoal
or
baby
oil
or
lunch
box
and
then
tell
me
they
chose
that
item
because
of
its
high
profit
margin
and
then
go
on
to
brag
about
all
the
volume
they
have
do
with
that
item
i
get
so
proud
for
them
i
can
hardly
stand
it
i
really
mean
that
it
be
just
the
proudest
i
get
because
if
we
as
manager
truly
dedicate
ourselves
to
instill
that
thrill
of
merchandising
the
thrill
of
buying
and
sell
something
at
a
profit
into
every
single
one
of
our
associate
partner
nothing
can
ever
stop
us
bernie
marcus
chairman
and
co
founder
home
depot
we
feel
a
great
affinity
for
sam
and
wal
mart
because
of
the
way
they
treat
their
people
he
be
such
a
great
motivator
but
the
financial
incentive
have
make
a
big
difference
too
we
model
our
employee
stock
ownership
plan
after
sam
and
it
work
for
us
as
well
we
look
at
his
operation
with
what
almost
people
and
you
walk
in
there
and
they
be
all
smile
he
prove
that
people
can
be
motivate
the
mountain
be
there
but
somebody
else
have
already
climbed
it
but
if
you
ask
sam
how
business
he
be
never
satisfied
he
say
bernie
thing
be
really
lousy
our
line
be
too
long
at
the
cash
register
our
people
be
not
be
helpful
enough
i
do
not
know
what
we
be
gonna
do
to
get
them
motivate
then
you
ask
some
of
these
ceo
from
other
retail
organization
who
you
know
be
on
the
verge
of
go
out
of
business
and
they
brag
and
tell
you
how
great
everything
be
really
put
on
air
not
sam
he
be
down
to
earth
and
know
who
he
be
without
question
sam
walton
be
one
of
the
great
all
time
merchant
period
keep
so
many
people
motivate
to
do
the
best
job
possible
involves
a
lot
of
the
different
program
and
approach
we
have
developed
at
wal
mart
over
the
year
but
none
of
them
would
work
at
all
without
one
simple
thing
that
put
it
all
together
appreciation
all
of
us
like
praise
so
what
we
try
to
practice
in
our
company
be
to
look
for
thing
to
praise
look
for
thing
that
be
go
right
we
want
to
let
our
folk
know
when
they
be
do
something
outstanding
and
let
them
know
they
be
important
to
us
you
ca
not
praise
something
that
be
not
do
well
you
ca
not
be
insincere
you
have
to
follow
up
on
thing
that
be
not
do
well
there
be
no
substitute
for
be
honest
with
someone
and
let
them
know
they
do
not
do
a
good
job
all
of
us
profit
from
be
correct
if
we
be
correct
in
a
positive
way
but
there
be
no
well
way
to
keep
someone
do
thing
the
right
way
than
by
let
him
or
her
know
how
much
you
appreciate
their
performance
if
you
do
that
one
simple
thing
human
nature
will
take
it
from
there
andy
sims
manager
wal
mart
no
rogers
arkansas
when
i
start
work
at
wal
mart
in
west
texas
we
would
anticipate
a
store
visit
by
the
chairman
with
the
same
sense
you
get
when
you
be
go
to
meet
a
great
athlete
or
a
movie
star
or
a
head
of
state
but
once
he
come
in
the
store
that
feel
of
awe
be
overcome
by
a
sort
of
kinship
he
be
a
master
at
erase
that
large
than
life
feel
that
people
have
for
him
how
many
head
of
state
always
start
the
conversation
by
want
to
know
what
you
think
what
on
your
mind
after
a
visit
everyone
in
the
store
have
no
doubt
that
he
genuinely
appreciates
our
contribution
no
matter
how
insignificant
every
associate
feel
like
he
or
she
do
make
a
difference
it
be
almost
like
have
your
old
friend
come
just
to
see
if
you
be
okay
he
never
let
us
down
there
be
one
more
aspect
to
a
true
partnership
that
be
worth
mention
executive
who
hold
themselves
aloof
from
their
associate
who
wo
not
listen
to
their
associate
when
they
have
a
problem
can
never
be
true
partner
with
them
often
this
be
an
exhaust
and
sometimes
frustrate
part
of
the
management
process
but
folk
who
stand
on
their
foot
all
day
stock
shelf
or
push
cart
of
merchandise
out
of
the
back
room
get
exhaust
and
frustrate
too
and
occasionally
they
dwell
on
problem
that
they
just
ca
not
let
go
of
until
they
have
share
it
with
somebody
who
they
feel
be
in
a
position
to
find
a
solution
so
as
big
as
we
be
we
have
really
try
to
maintain
an
open
door
policy
at
wal
mart
david
glass
if
you
have
ever
spent
any
time
around
wal
mart
you
may
have
notice
that
it
be
not
unusual
for
somebody
in
philadelphia
mississippi
to
get
in
his
pickup
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
drive
to
bentonville
where
you
can
find
him
sit
in
the
lobby
wait
patiently
to
see
the
chairman
now
really
how
many
chairman
of
billion
company
do
you
know
who
be
totally
percent
accessible
to
their
hourly
associate
i
know
lot
of
people
in
big
company
who
have
never
even
see
their
chairman
much
less
visit
with
him
that
be
not
to
suggest
that
they
always
like
what
i
have
to
say
i
do
not
always
solve
their
problem
and
i
ca
not
always
side
with
them
just
because
they
bring
their
situation
to
my
attention
but
if
the
associate
happens
to
be
right
it
be
important
to
overrule
their
manager
or
whoever
they
be
have
the
problem
with
because
otherwise
the
open
door
policy
be
not
any
good
to
anybody
the
associate
would
know
pretty
soon
that
it
be
just
something
we
paid
lip
service
to
but
do
not
really
believe
if
i
be
go
to
fly
around
all
over
the
country
tell
these
folk
they
be
my
partner
i
sure
owe
it
to
them
to
at
least
hear
them
out
when
they
be
upset
about
something
dean
sander
executive
vice
president
operation
wal
mart
i
have
always
felt
that
to
sam
the
people
in
the
store
the
manager
and
the
associate
be
the
king
he
love
them
and
there
be
no
doubt
they
feel
they
have
an
open
door
to
him
he
will
go
out
on
store
visit
and
when
he
get
back
he
will
call
me
and
say
give
this
boy
a
store
to
manage
he
be
ready
then
i
will
express
some
concern
about
the
person
experience
level
or
whatever
and
he
will
say
give
him
one
anyway
let
see
how
he
do
the
other
thing
of
course
be
that
he
have
absolutely
no
tolerance
for
manager
mistreat
the
associate
in
the
store
when
he
find
something
like
that
go
on
he
get
on
us
about
it
instantly
so
you
see
when
we
say
wal
mart
be
a
partnership
we
really
believe
it
partnership
involves
money
which
be
crucial
to
any
business
relationship
but
it
also
involves
basic
human
consideration
such
as
respect
wal
mart
be
a
spectacular
example
of
what
happens
when
people
come
together
as
a
group
with
a
real
feel
of
partnership
and
be
able
for
the
most
part
to
put
the
need
of
their
individual
ego
behind
the
need
of
their
team

to

he
say
it
do
not
do
no
good
but
he
will
yell
all
day
like
that
southpoint
magazine
february
by
the
time
roll
around
i
have
to
admit
we
be
feel
pretty
good
about
our
accomplishment
by
anybody
standard
we
have
built
a
heck
of
a
regional
discount
chain
with
just
under
wal
mart
open
for
business
in
eight
state
we
be
do
nearly
million
in
sale
with
more
than
million
in
profit
the
stock
have
split
twice
and
we
be
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
by
now
everybody
be
share
the
profit
so
the
whole
company
be
pumped
up
wall
street
be
buying
into
our
strategy
and
whatever
reservation
anyone
up
there
might
have
have
about
me
they
seem
to
think
pretty
highly
of
ron
mayer
and
the
rest
of
the
management
team
we
have
in
place
at
fifty
six
i
be
free
and
clear
of
debt
my
net
worth
be
far
great
than
i
have
ever
imagine
it
could
be
when
i
start
out
in
the
retail
business
our
kid
be
out
of
college
and
start
up
their
own
life
i
really
do
not
see
how
i
could
have
reasonably
expect
much
more
out
of
life
if
i
have
give
the
impression
so
far
that
wal
mart
have
occupy
most
of
my
competitive
energy
over
the
year
that
be
not
completely
accurate
i
have
pursue
my
other
passion
all
along
too
mostly
quail
hunt
and
tennis
and
i
pursue
them
both
very
competitively
a
lot
of
businessmen
seem
to
prefer
golf
but
i
always
thought
it
be
a
little
too
country
club
for
me
and
it
take
up
too
much
time
and
be
not
really
competitive
in
the
same
way
that
tennis
be
you
know
in
a
give
and
take
head
to
head
way
helen
walton
when
we
first
met
sam
played
golf
but
he
would
get
terribly
frustrate
when
he
make
mistake
once
when
he
be
in
the
army
he
be
out
play
with
some
of
the
officer
and
i
think
their
colonel
be
along
that
day
sam
have
hit
off
into
the
wood
it
make
him
so
mad
that
he
broke
his
club
on
a
tree
so
he
come
home
that
day
threw
his
club
down
and
say
i
have
have
it
with
golf
after
that
it
be
mostly
tennis
for
him
i
take
my
racket
with
me
whenever
i
be
fly
and
i
have
friend
to
play
with
when
i
hit
their
town
for
some
reason
i
love
to
play
around
noon
when
the
sun
be
hottest
and
i
guess
i
be
pretty
aggressive
i
played
regularly
from
the
time
we
get
to
bentonville
until
about
two
year
ago
when
my
leg
just
could
not
cut
it
anymore
george
billingsley
tennis
partner
for
about
ten
year
sam
and
i
played
tennis
at
high
noon
usually
on
the
court
over
at
his
house
i
think
he
like
to
play
during
lunch
hour
because
he
would
not
dream
of
take
any
of
his
associate
away
from
their
job
to
play
on
the
court
he
be
the
most
competitive
player
he
study
his
opponent
game
and
he
knew
our
strength
and
weakness
as
well
as
his
own
if
you
hit
a
ball
to
sam
forehand
that
point
be
his
he
would
hit
it
crosscourt
and
it
be
over
he
love
the
game
he
never
give
you
a
point
and
he
never
quit
but
he
be
a
fair
man
to
him
the
rule
of
tennis
the
rule
of
business
and
the
rule
of
life
be
all
the
same
and
he
follow
them
as
competitive
as
he
be
he
be
a
wonderful
tennis
opponent
always
gracious
in
lose
and
in
win
if
he
lose
he
would
say
i
just
do
not
have
it
today
but
you
played
marvelously
loretta
bos
parker
popularly
know
as
the
vice
president
for
tennis
if
mr
walton
be
out
on
a
trip
his
idea
of
make
a
tennis
date
would
be
to
radio
our
aviation
department
when
he
be
a
few
minute
out
from
land
and
have
them
phone
me
with
a
time
i
would
get
the
call
at
eleven
find
him
a
partner
and
he
would
be
play
by
noon
so
tennis
become
my
outlet
for
organize
competitive
sport
and
exercise
but
my
real
passion
outside
wal
mart
have
always
be
my
bird
hunt
i
have
to
say
it
be
probably
my
one
self
indulgent
activity
i
love
it
so
much
that
i
just
make
it
part
of
my
way
of
do
business
from
early
on
i
never
do
that
much
quail
hunt
grow
up
not
until
i
met
helen
father
who
be
dead
serious
about
it
anytime
i
be
around
claremore
i
love
to
go
out
there
and
hunt
with
mr
robson
or
helen
brother
frank
and
nick
her
dad
and
i
be
both
much
well
than
average
shot
and
we
get
to
be
pretty
competitive
over
the
hunt
as
i
mention
bentonville
appeal
to
me
because
i
could
hunt
quail
season
in
four
state
so
during
the
season
i
usually
take
off
almost
every
day
around
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
and
go
out
to
do
a
couple
of
hour
hunt
i
have
an
old
hunt
car
i
would
haul
my
dog
in
and
i
would
go
find
a
farm
or
ranch
i
want
to
hunt
i
learn
early
that
the
best
way
to
get
invite
back
be
to
go
ask
permission
and
offer
the
owner
a
box
of
chocolate
cherry
from
the
store
or
if
he
prefer
it
a
take
of
the
game
i
shot
i
have
hunt
all
over
these
hill
and
valley
around
here
john
walton
until
dad
be
in
his
mid
sixty
i
really
have
to
struggle
to
keep
up
with
him
i
thought
i
be
in
pretty
good
shape
but
my
tendency
be
to
kind
of
walk
along
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
the
outdoors
i
would
look
up
and
dad
would
be
out
of
sight
he
hunt
like
sherman
march
through
georgia
when
i
ask
permission
to
hunt
i
always
introduce
myself
as
sam
walton
of
sam
walton
variety
store
down
on
the
square
in
bentonville
and
i
found
that
it
really
help
my
business
when
these
farm
folk
would
come
to
town
to
shop
they
would
naturally
do
business
with
that
fellow
who
hunt
their
land
and
brought
them
candy
i
still
meet
folk
today
who
tell
me
their
father
recall
me
come
out
to
hunt
their
land
in
those
day
as
we
begin
to
expand
and
i
flew
around
more
i
would
throw
the
dog
in
the
plane
with
me
so
i
could
hunt
between
store
visit
i
have
some
crazy
time
with
those
dog
out
on
the
road
usually
i
make
them
sleep
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
but
if
it
be
ol
roy
who
be
really
more
of
a
pet
than
a
bird
dog
i
would
let
him
sleep
in
my
room
with
me
unbeknownst
i
be
afraid
to
the
holiday
inn
folk
once
he
get
in
a
fight
with
a
skunk
and
i
be
ashamed
to
even
think
of
what
the
next
person
to
get
my
rental
car
must
have
thought
happen
in
that
thing
i
held
him
by
his
hind
leg
and
half
drown
him
try
to
wash
him
off
in
this
lake
but
we
found
out
you
cannot
wash
skunk
off
a
dog
very
easily
roy
be
probably
the
most
overrate
bird
dog
in
history
he
be
not
much
of
a
hunter
at
all
he
would
point
rabbit
for
example
but
the
associate
and
the
customer
get
a
kick
out
of
visit
with
him
in
the
store
and
once
we
put
his
name
and
picture
on
our
private
label
dog
food
it
sell
ton
another
thing
about
roy
that
be
very
unusual
he
be
a
great
tennis
dog
he
would
go
with
me
to
the
tennis
court
and
lay
there
and
whenever
the
ball
go
out
of
the
court
over
the
fence
or
whatever
he
would
go
chase
after
it
and
bring
it
back
to
me
what
i
really
love
about
hunt
be
the
coordination
and
the
training
of
the
dog
you
have
to
develop
a
partnership
with
them
you
have
to
motivate
them
and
they
have
to
do
their
work
reasonably
well
from
southpoint
magazine
february
george
cuminheaartuhme
you
be
about
to
get
your
butt
shot
george
sam
say
then
to
a
companion
i
think
george
might
be
a
good
one
he
be
hunt
he
be
get
his
nose
into
the
wind
and
he
be
hunt
back
and
forth
he
act
like
he
know

he
act
like

to
have
some
instinct
i
pride
myself
on

them
and
be
patient
with
them
they
have
get
to
learn
to
find
the
bird
and
then
they
have
get
to
learn
the
discipline
to
hold
them
and
wait
for
the
hunter
i
have
have

nothing
well
than
to

of
my
cast
off

give
it
back

mercedes
as
you
can
see
i
be
not
all
work
i
like
to
play
as
much
as
the
next
guy
and
i
have
to
admit
back
around
i
be
awfully
tempt
to
take
more
time
for
myself
to
step
back
and
let
ron
mayer
and
the
other
guy
run
the
company
while
i
go
off
to
enjoy
life
around
that
same
time
helen
and
i
go
on
some
of
our
overseas
trip
although
i
be
sure
i
spent
most
of
my
time
over
there
nose
around
store
and
do
business
so
for
the
first
time
since
i
have
begin
retailing
in
i
be
begin
to
back
off
from
the
business
i
be
get
slightly
less
involve
in
the
day
to
day
decision
and
lean
a
bit
more
on
ron
mayer
and
ferold
arend
our
two
executive
vice
president
i
be
still
chairman
and
ceo
ferold
at
age
forty
five
ran
merchandising
while
ron
mayer
who
be
only
forty
ran
finance
and
distribution
to
handle
the
explosive
growth
we
be
bring
on
new
people
in
the
general
office
ron
brought
in
a
lot
of
people
to
handle
data
processing
and
finance
and
distribution
what
happen
then
be
the
one
period
in
wal
mart
history
that
i
be
still
the
least
comfortable
talk
about
today
but
everybody
else
have
have
their
say
on
the
subject
so
i
be
go
to
explain
the
event
the
way
i
saw
them
unfold
and
be
do
with
it
as
i
look
back
on
that
period
now
i
realize
i
have
split
the
company
in
half
set
up
two
faction
which
begin
to
compete
fiercely
with
one
another
there
be
the
old
guard
include
many
of
the
store
manager
remain
loyal
to
ferold
and
the
new
guard
many
of
whom
owe
their
job
to
ron
pretty
soon
everybody
begin
to
take
side
line
up
behind
either
ron
or
ferold
who
do
not
get
along
at
all
what
i
do
next
which
seem
totally
out
of
character
for
me
only
compound
the
problem
tenfold
ferold
have
be
valuable
in
organize
the
company
as
we
begin
to
roll
out
store
but
because
of
all
the
technology
and
sophisticated
system
we
be
need
i
really
felt
at
the
time
that
ron
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
company
future
in
addition
to
his
ability
he
have
a
lot
of
ambition
he
make
it
pretty
well
know
that
his
goal
which
i
respect
be
to
run
a
company
preferably
wal
mart
he
told
me
one
day
that
if
he
could
not
run
our
company
he
want
to
get
out
and
run
another
one
so
i
thought
about
that
for
a
few
day
and
i
really
worried
that
we
be
go
to
lose
ron
then
i
say
to
myself
well
i
be
get
pretty
old
and
we
could
probably
work
together
i
will
let
him
be
chairman
and
ceo
and
i
will
just
enjoy
myself
step
back
a
little
and
of
course
continue
to
visit
store
so
i
become
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
ron
become
chairman
and
ceo
of
the
company
ferold
become
president
i
move
out
of
my
office
down
at
the
end
of
what
they
jokingly
call
executive
row
and
let
ron
have
it
i
move
into
his
office
i
make
up
my
mind
to
stay
out
of
his
way
and
let
him
run
the
company
tell
myself
that
i
would
just
check
to
see
how
he
be
get
along
since
i
have
really
be
let
other
people
operate
the
company
day
to
day
all
along
i
thought
thing
would
run
real
well
this
way
well
i
be
no
more
ready
to
retire
in
at
the
age
of
fifty
six
than
the
arkansas
sun
be
ready
to
start
rise
out
of
oklahoma
in
the
morning
but
for
a
while
i
do
step
back
and
take
off
a
little
more
time
i
be
sure
to
ron
mayer
it
must
have
seem
like
i
never
take
off
at
all
the
truth
be
i
fail
at
retirement
bad
than
just
about
anything
else
i
have
ever
try
actually
i
knew
it
be
a
mistake
almost
right
after
i
resign
the
chairmanship
i
try
to
stay
out
of
ron
way
the
problem
be
that
i
actually
just
kept
do
exactly
the
same
thing
i
have
be
do
all
the
time
i
want
to
see
my
idea
keep
flow
around
the
company
but
i
want
ron
to
be
successful
in
operating
the
company
and
building
an
organization
unfortunately
i
just
could
not
quite
stay
away
from
it
to
that
degree
the
situation
be
quite
a
burden
for
ron
and
would
have
be
for
any
forty
year
old
guy
want
to
run
his
own
company
i
think
meanwhile
the
house
be
divide
up
against
itself
a
lot
of
the
newer
young
guy
be
line
up
on
ron
side
and
the
old
bunch
who
ran
the
store
be
backing
ferold
when
i
begin
to
sense
how
deep
this
split
really
be
i
get
real
agitate
about
it
and
then
i
become
even
more
involve
in
second
guess
everybody
al
mile
retire
executive
vice
president
wal
mart
there
be
this
thing
between
ron
and
ferold
i
be
not
too
involve
personally
because
i
be
out
in
the
field
then
but
even
out
there
it
be
very
apparent
that
two
camp
be
building
up
in
the
company
you
know
you
almost
felt
commit
to
say
well
i
be
on
this
team
or
i
be
on
that
team
we
start
see
a
looseness
in
our
organization
that
have
never
be
there
and
thing
none
of
us
like
be
start
to
happen
regularly
the
seriousness
of
run
our
store
and
take
care
of
our
people
be
not
happen
and
most
of
us
district
manager
would
get
together
and
talk
on
the
phone
on
saturday
morning
and
you
know
we
thought
we
be
go
to
hell
in
a
handbasket
i
be
not
exaggerate
i
mean
we
really
do
also
i
remember
that
when
sam
start
spending
more
time
in
the
office
he
be
very
very
intense
i
kept
hop
thing
would
work
out
and
i
should
say
this
wal
mart
show
real
good
number
during
this
whole
period
it
be
never
a
question
of
mismanagement
what
we
have
be
a
semiretired
founder
who
do
not
want
to
go
away
on
top
of
an
old
line
bunch
of
store
manager
at
war
with
an
ambitious
young
guy
with
big
idea
of
his
own
ferold
arend
that
period
right
in
there
be
the
only
negative
i
ever
experienced
in
my
whole
time
at
the
company
which
be
pretty
remarkable
in
itself
sam
always
felt
the
need
for
his
people
to
compete
with
one
another
because
he
thought
it
brought
out
the
best
in
them
and
most
of
the
time
it
do
but
this
be
a
situation
that
just
do
not
work
when
he
step
aside
it
create
a
tough
situation
for
everybody
ron
people
be
loyal
to
him
and
mine
be
loyal
to
me
sam
be
say
i
will
decide
the
thing
that
need
tiebreaker
that
turn
out
to
be
a
lot
more
thing
than
he
have
intend
so
once
he
realize
how
badly
thing
be
really
go
he
do
something
about
it
i
have
always
take
most
of
the
blame
for
this
mess
i
create
but
it
be
also
true
that
i
do
not
think
ron
be
handle
some
thing
as
well
as
he
should
i
worried
about
his
people
skill
and
i
felt
like
the
whole
clique
thing
be
really
hurt
our
management
at
the
store
end
our
most
unusual
strength
and
i
guess
i
be
pretty
unhappy
too
over
some
issue
of
what
you
would
call
personal
style
none
of
them
really
all
that
unusual
in
most
corporate
environment
but
different
from
the
way
we
have
always
do
thing
around
wal
mart
i
agonize
over
all
this
i
rarely
lose
sleep
over
crisis
at
the
office
but
this
time
i
do
i
do
not
want
to
disappoint
ron
do
not
want
to
lose
him
but
the
company
be
head
in
the
wrong
direction
so
finally
i
call
him
in
one
saturday
in
june
of
thirty
month
after
i
have
give
up
the
chairman
job
and
just
say
simply
well
ron
i
thought
i
be
ready
to
step
out
but
i
see
that
really
i
be
not
i
have
be
so
involve
that
in
a
way
it
have
put
you
under
a
real
handicap
i
told
him
i
want
to
come
back
in
as
chairman
and
ceo
and
have
him
assume
another
job
vice
chairman
and
chief
financial
officer
i
believe
my
proposal
be
not
agreeable
to
ron
and
i
can
certainly
understand
why
he
want
to
run
the
company
and
when
he
could
not
he
decide
to
leave
us
nobody
believe
it
at
the
time
but
although
i
be
unhappy
with
some
of
the
thing
go
on
under
ron
chairmanship
real
unhappy
with
a
few
i
try
as
hard
as
i
could
to
convince
him
to
stay
and
be
part
of
our
growth
even
though
he
could
not
be
chairman
and
ceo
anymore
i
say
ron
we
be
go
to
miss
you
we
be
go
to
need
you
and
i
think
we
be
go
to
suffer
a
lot
because
you
be
not
here
i
offer
him
everything
to
stay
but
he
felt
it
be
time
to
go
as
disappointed
and
unhappy
as
he
be
ron
say
sam
i
know
you
be
go
to
think
that
thing
be
fall
apart
and
a
lot
of
other
people
be
go
to
think
they
be
fall
apart
but
you
have
get
such
a
strong
field
organization
here
and
such
loyalty
from
the
associate
and
the
manager
in
those
store
out
there
and
such
loyal
customer
and
the
company
be
so
sound
in
its
operating
philosophy
that
i
think
you
will
just
move
right
down
the
road
i
appreciate
his
express
that
confidence
in
us
i
know
he
meant
it
and
i
will
never
forget
it
in
company
lore
that
incident
become
know
as
the
saturday
night
massacre
what
follow
become
know
as
the
exodus
first
a
whole
group
of
senior
manager
who
have
be
part
of
ron
team
our
financial
officer
our
data
processing
manager
the
guy
who
be
run
our
distribution
center
all
walk
out
behind
him
you
can
imagine
how
wall
street
felt
about
that
a
lot
of
folk
write
us
off
immediately
they
thought
as
they
have
through
the
year
that
we
just
do
not
have
the
management
to
hold
the
place
together
they
assume
that
ron
mayer
and
all
his
folk
be
the
reason
we
would
do
well
and
they
just
ignore
all
the
basic
we
have
in
place
all
our
principle
keep
our
cost
down
teach
our
associate
to
take
care
of
our
customer
and
frankly
just
work
our
tail
off
throughout
all
this
turmoil
jack
shewmaker
one
of
our
brighter
brasher
young
talent
have
be
make
strong
contribution
to
the
company
and
i
thought
he
might
be
just
what
we
need
to
get
us
back
on
track
but
when
i
name
him
to
be
executive
v
p
of
operation
personnel
and
merchandise
passing
over
some
folk
who
be
old
and
have
be
with
us
longer
a
bunch
more
of
our
manager
left
it
be
a
real
bona
fide
exodus
and
by
the
time
it
be
over
i
will
bet
one
third
of
our
senior
management
be
go
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
thing
look
pretty
grim
and
at
that
point
i
have
to
admit
i
be
not
sure
myself
that
we
could
just
keep
on
go
like
before
as
i
say
back
when
we
lose
that
first
lease
in
newport
most
setback
can
be
turn
into
opportunity
and
as
thing
turn
out
this
setback
present
us
with
one
of
the
great
opportunity
in
our
company
history
ever
since
david
glass
and
i
have
met
at
that
awful
wal
mart
opening
in
harrison
arkansas
i
have
be
try
to
somehow
persuade
him
to
work
for
us
he
be
a
big
deal
at
this
discount
drug
chain
up
in
springfield
and
i
be
convince
he
be
one
of
the
fine
retail
talent
i
have
met
for
some
time
i
have
be
after
ron
mayer
to
hire
david
but
he
would
not
do
it
so
when
ron
left
david
be
the
first
person
i
go
to
see
and
i
finally
talk
him
into
come
to
wal
mart
i
be
not
say
that
with
david
and
jack
shewmaker
as
executive
vice
president
david
for
finance
and
distribution
and
jack
for
operation
and
merchandise
we
do
not
still
have
some
turf
fight
left
to
do
between
the
two
side
of
the
company
but
man
we
have
as
much
retail
talent
and
firepower
together
under
one
roof
as
any
company
could
handle
these
two
guy
be
completely
different
in
personality
but
they
be
both
whip
smart
and
with
us
up
against
it
like
we
be
everybody
have
to
head
in
the
same
direction
once
again
wal
mart
prove
everybody
wrong
and
we
just
blew
the
door
off
our
previous
performance
david
make
us
a
strong
company
almost
immediately
ron
mayer
may
have
be
the
architect
of
our
original
distribution
system
but
david
glass
frankly
be
much
well
than
ron
at
distribution
and
that
be
one
of
the
big
area
of
expertise
i
have
be
afraid
of
lose
david
also
be
much
well
at
fine
tune
and
hone
our
accounting
system
he
along
with
jack
be
a
powerful
advocate
for
much
of
the
high
technology
that
keep
us
operating
and
grow
today
and
not
only
do
he
turn
out
to
be
a
great
chief
financial
officer
he
also
prove
to
be
a
fine
talent
with
people
this
new
team
be
even
more
talented
more
suit
for
the
job
at
hand
than
the
previous
one
all
along
the
history
of
wal
mart
have
be
marked
by
have
the
right
people
in
the
right
job
when
we
need
them
most
we
have
whitaker
straight
out
of
the
get
after
it
and
stay
after
it
old
school
to
help
us
get
start
ferold
arend
a
methodical
hardworking
german
to
get
us
organize
ron
mayer
a
whiz
at
computer
to
get
our
system
go
jack
shewmaker
a
brilliant
shoot
from
the
hip
executive
with
a
store
manager
mentality
to
blow
us
out
of
rut
and
push
us
into
new
idea
we
need
to
be
work
with
and
david
glass
who
could
step
up
in
a
crisis
keep
his
cool
and
eventually
get
control
of
a
company
that
become
so
big
it
be
hard
to
comprehend
from
day
one
we
just
always
found
the
folk
who
have
the
quality
that
neither
bud
nor
i
have
and
they
fit
into
the
niche
as
the
company
grow
then
every
so
often
we
need
even
well
talent
than
we
sometimes
have
on
board
and
that
be
when
the
david
glass
would
come
along
but
there
be
a
time
for
all
these
thing
i
try
for
almost
twenty
year
to
hire
don
soderquist
away
from
ben
franklin
i
even
offer
him
the
presidency
one
time
and
he
do
not
come
but
when
we
really
need
him
later
on
he
finally
join
up
and
make
a
great
chief
operating
officer
for
david
team
at
any
company
the
time
come
when
some
people
need
to
move
along
even
if
they
have
make
strong
contribution
i
have
occasionally
be
accuse
of
pit
people
against
one
another
but
i
do
not
really
see
it
that
way
i
have
always
cross
pollinate
folk
and
let
them
assume
different
role
in
the
company
and
that
have
bruise
some
ego
from
time
to
time
but
i
think
everyone
need
as
much
exposure
to
as
many
area
of
the
company
as
they
can
get
and
i
think
the
best
executive
be
those
who
have
touch
all
the
base
and
have
the
best
overall
concept
of
the
corporation
i
hate
to
see
rivalry
develop
within
our
company
when
it
becomes
a
personal
thing
and
our
folk
be
not
work
together
and
support
one
another
philosophically
we
have
always
say
submerge
your
own
ambition
and
help
whoever
you
can
in
the
company
work
together
as
a
team

create
a
culture
sam
establishment
of
the
walton
culture
throughout
the
company
be
the
key
to
the
whole
thing
it
be
just
incomparable
he
be
the
great
businessman
of
this
century
harry
cunningham
found
kmart
store
while
ceo
of
s
s
kresge
co
not
many
company
out
there
gather
several
hundred
of
their
executive
manager
and
associate
together
every
saturday
morning
at
seven
thirty
to
talk
about
business
even
few
would
begin
such
a
meeting
by
have
their
chairman
call
the
hog
that
be
one
of
my
favorite
way
to
wake
everybody
up
by
do
the
university
of
arkansas
razorback
cheer
real
early
on
a
saturday
you
probably
have
to
be
there
to
appreciate
the
full
effect
but
it
go
like
this
whoooooooooooooooooooo
pig
sooey
whooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
pig
sooey
whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
pig
sooey
razorback
and
if
i
be
lead
the
cheer
you
would
well
believe
we
do
it
loud
i
have
another
cheer
i
lead
whenever
i
visit
a
store
our
own
wal
mart
cheer
the
associate
do
it
for
president
and
mr
bush
when
they
be
here
in
bentonville
not
long
ago
and
you
could
see
by
the
look
on
their
face
that
they
be
not
use
to
this
kind
of
enthusiasm
for
those
of
you
who
do
not
know
it
go
like
this
give
me
a
w
give
me
an
a
give
me
an
l
give
me
a

everybody
sort
of
do
the
twist

an
a
give

give
me
a

what
that
spell
wal
mart
who
number
one
the
customer
i
know
most
company
do
not
have
cheer
and
most
board
chairman
probably
would
not
lead
them
even
if
they
do
but
then
most
company
do
not
have
folk
like
mike
possum
johnson
who
entertain
us
one
saturday
morning
back
when
he
be
safety
director
by
take
on
challenger
in
a
no
hold
bar
persimmon
seed
spit
contest
use
robert
rhoads
our
company
general
counsel
as
the
official
target
most
company
also
do
not
have
a
gospel
group
call
the
sing
truck
driver
or
a
management
sing
group
call
jimmy
walker
and
the
accountant
my
feel
be
that
just
because
we
work
so
hard
we
do
not
have
to
go
around
with
long
face
all
the
time
take
ourselves
seriously
pretend
we
be
lose
in
thought
over
weighty
problem
at
wal
mart
if
you
have
some
important
business
problem
on
your
mind
you
should
be
bring
it
out
in
the
open
at
a
friday
morning
session
call
the
merchandising
meeting
or
at
the
saturday
morning
meeting
so
we
can
all
try
to
solve
it
together
but
while
we
be
do
all
this
work
we
like
to
have
a
good
time
it
be
sort
of
a
whistle
while
you
work
philosophy
and
we
not
only
have
a
heck
of
a
good
time
with
it
we
work
well
because
of
it
we
build
spirit
and
excitement
we
capture
the
attention
of
our
folk
and
keep
them
interested
simply
because
they
never
know
what
come
next
we
break
down
barrier
which
help
us
communicate
well
with
one
another
and
we
make
our
people
feel
part
of
a
family
in
which
no
one
be
too
important
or
too
puffed
up
to
lead
a
cheer
or
be
the
butt
of
a
joke
or
the
target
in
a
persimmon
seed
spit
contest
we
do
not
pretend
to
have
invent
the
idea
of
a
strong
corporate
culture
and
we
have
be
aware
of
a
lot
of
the
others
that
have
come
before
us
in
the
early
day
of
ibm
some
of
the
thing
tom
watson
do
with
his
slogan
and
group
activity
be
not
all
that
different
from
the
thing
we
do
and
as
i
have
say
we
have
certainly
borrow
every
good
idea
we
have
come
across
helen
and
i
picked
up
several
idea
on
a
trip
we
take
to
korea
and
japan
in
a
lot
of
the
thing
they
do
over
there
be
very
easy
to
apply
to
do
business
over
here
culturally
thing
seem
so
different
like
sit
on
the
floor
eat
eel
and
snail
but
people
be
people
and
what
motivates
one
group
generally
will
motivate
another
helen
walton
sam
take
me
out
to
see
this
tennis
ball
factory
somewhere
east
of
seoul
the
company
sell
ball
to
wal
mart
i
guess
and
they
treat
us
very
well
it
be
the
dirtiest
place
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
but
sam
be
very
impressed
it
be
the
first
place
he
ever
saw
a
group
of
worker
have
a
company
cheer
and
he
like
the
idea
of
everybody
do
calisthenics
together
at
the
begin
of
the
day
he
could
not
wait
to
get
home
and
try
those
idea
out
in
the
store
and
at
the
saturday
morning
meeting
back
in
people
outside
the
company
begin
to
realize
just
how
different
we
folk
at
wal
mart
be
that
be
the
year
i
lose
a
bet
to
david
glass
and
have
to
pay
up
by
wear
a
grass
skirt
and
do
the
hula
on
wall
street
i
thought
i
would
slip
down
there
and
dance
and
david
would
videotape
it
so
he
could
prove
to
everyone
back
at
the
saturday
morning
meeting
that
i
really
do
it
but
when
we
get
there
it
turn
out
david
have
hire
a
truckload
of
real
hula
dancer
and
ukulele
player
and
he
have
alert
the
newspaper
and
tv
network
we
have
all
kind
of
trouble
with
the
police
about
permit
and
the
dancer
union
would
not
let
them
dance
without
heater
because
it
be
so
cold
and
we
finally
have
to
get
permission
from
the
head
of
merrill
lynch
to
dance
on
his
step
eventually
though
i
slip
on
the
grass
skirt
and
the
hawaiian
shirt
and
the
lei
over
my
suit
and
do
what
i
think
be
a
pretty
fair
hula
it
be
too
good
a
picture
to
pas
up
i
guess
this
crazy
chairman
of
the
board
from
arkansas
in
this
silly
costume
and
it
ran
everywhere
it
be
one
of
the
few
time
one
of
our
company
stunt
really
embarrass
me
but
at
wal
mart
when
you
make
a
bet
like
i
do
that
we
could
not
possibly
produce
a
pretax
profit
of
more
than
percent
you
always
pay
up
do
the
hula
be
nothing
compare
to
wrestling
a
bear
which
be
what
bob
schneider
once
a
warehouse
manager
in
palestine
texas
have
to
do
after
he
lose
a
bet
with
his
crew
that
they
could
not
beat
a
production
record
most
folk
probably
thought
we
just
have
a
wacky
chairman
who
be
pull
a
pretty
primitive
publicity
stunt
what
they
do
not
realize
be
that
this
sort
of
stuff
go
on
all
the
time
at
wal
mart
it
be
part
of
our
culture
and
it
run
through
everything
we
do
whether
it
be
saturday
morning
meeting
or
stockholder
meeting
or
store
opening
or
just
normal
day
we
always
have
try
to
make
life
as
interest
and
as
unpredictable
as
we
can
and
to
make
wal
mart
a
fun
proposition
we
be
constantly
do
crazy
thing
to
capture
the
attention
of
our
folk
and
lead
them
to
think
up
surprise
of
their
own
we
like
to
see
them
do
wild
thing
in
the
store
that
be
fun
for
the
customer
and
fun
for
the
associate
if
you
be
commit
to
the
wal
mart
partnership
and
its
core
value
the
culture
encourages
you
to
think
up
all
sort
of
idea
that
break
the
mold
and
fight
monotony
we
know
that
our
antic
our
company
cheer
or
our
song
or
my
hula
can
sometimes
be
pretty
corny
or
hokey
we
could
not
care
less
sure
it
be
a
little
strange
for
a
vice
president
to
dress
in
pink
tights
and
a
long
blond
wig
and
ride
a
white
horse
around
the
bentonville
town
square
as
charlie
self
do
in
after
he
lose
a
saturday
morning
meeting
bet
that
december
sale
would
not
top
billion
and
it
be
odd
for
a
former
executive
like
ron
loveless
to
come
out
of
retirement
at
every
year
end
meeting
and
present
his
annual
leir
report
the
loveless
economic
indicator
report
base
on
the
number
of
edible
dead
chicken
found
on
the
roadside
with
chart
and
graph
and
the
whole
bit
the
harder
time
be
the
few
edible
you
find
on
the
roadside
maybe
it
be
a
little
hokey
to
surprise
your
president
with
the
gift
of
a
live
pig
but
that
be
what
a
sam
club
crew
do
to
david
glass
at
one
meeting
to
kick
off
a
sale
competition
with
a
football
theme
they
told
him
they
have
plan
to
give
him
a
pigskin
then
decide
what
the
heck
why
not
leave
the
pig
in
it
for
that
matter
how
many
other
billion
company
would
have
their
president
put
on
overall
and
a
straw
hat
and
ride
a
donkey
around
a
parking
lot
that
be
what
we
make
david
do
at
the
harrison
store
to
make
up
for
have
told
fortune
magazine
his
story
about
the
donkey
and
the
watermelon
at
that
store
opening
who
know
what
our
competitor
thought
when
they
get
their
issue
of
discount
store
news
that
week
and
saw
our
president
sit
on
a
jackass
right
there
on
the
front
page
some
of
this
culture
grow
naturally
out
of
our
small
town
beginning
back
then
we
try
literally
to
create
a
carnival
atmosphere
in
our
store
we
be
only
in
small
town
then
and
often
there
be
not
a
whole
lot
else
to
do
for
entertainment
that
could
beat
go
to
the
wal
mart
as
i
told
you
we
would
have
these
huge
sidewalk
sale
and
we
would
have
band
and
little
circus
in
our
parking
lot
to
get
folk
to
those
sale
we
would
have
plate
drop
where
we
would
write
the
name
of
prize
on
paper
plate
and
sail
them
off
the
roof
of
the
store
we
would
have
balloon
drop
we
would
have
moonlight
madness
sale
which
usually
would
begin
after
normal
closing
hour
and
maybe
last
until
midnight
with
some
new
bargain
or
promotion
be
announce
every
few
minute
we
would
play
shopping
cart
bingo
where
each
shopping
cart
have
a
number
and
if
your
number
be
call
you
get
a
discount
on
whatever
you
have
in
the
cart
at
store
opening
we
would
stand
on
the
service
counter
and
give
away
box
of
candy
to
the
customer
who
have
travel
the
farthest
to
get
there
as
long
as
it
be
fun
we
would
try
it
occasionally
it
blew
up
in
our
face
one
year
on
george
washington
birthday
phil
green
remember
the
world
large
tide
display
ran
an
ad
say

a
television
set
for
twenty
two
cent
the

the
only
hitch
be
that
before

you
have
to
find
it
first
phil

the
first

get
it
when
phil
arrive
at
the

that
morning

be
such
a
crowd
out

that
you

of
them
have
be
there
all
night

there
be
a
stampede
like

five

tear
through
that
store
look
for
one
twenty
two
cent
television
set
phil

so
totally
out
of
control
that
even
he
admit
play
hide
and
seek

a
terrible
idea
as
we
have
grown
we
have
gotten
away
from
the
circus
approach
but
we
have
make
it
a
point
to
keep
encourage
the
spirit
of
fun
in
the
store
we
want
the
associate
and
the
management
to
do
thing
together
that
contribute
to
the
community
and
make
them
feel
like

it

an
annual
event
held

godzilla
of
gluttony
corny
how
could
you
get
any
cornier
than
that
but
when
folk
get
together
and
do
this
sort
of
silly
stuff
it
be
really
impossible
to
measure
just
how
good
it
be
for
their
morale
to
know
that
you
be
suppose
to
have
a
good
time
that
there
be
no
place
for
stuffed
shirt
or
at
least
that
they
always
get
their
comeuppance
be
a
very
uplift
thing
for
all
of
us
take
our
saturday
morning
meeting
for
example
without
a
little
entertainment
and
a
sense
of
the
unpredictable
how
in
the
world
could
we
ever
have
gotten
those
hundred
of
people
most
of
our
manager
and
some
associate
from
the
general
office
here
in
bentonville
to
get
up
every
saturday
morning
and
actually
come
in
here
with
smile
on
their
face
if
they
knew
all
they
could
expect
in
that
meeting
be
somebody
drone
on
about
comparative
number
follow
by
a
serious
lecture
on
the
problem
of
our
business
could
we
have
kept
the
meeting
alive
no
way
no
matter
how
strongly
i
felt
about
the
necessity
of
that
meeting
the
folk
would
have
revolt
and
even
if
we
still
held
it
it
would
not
be
any
good
at
all
as
it
be
the
saturday
morning
meeting
be
at
the
very
heart
of
the
wal
mart
culture
do
not
get
me
wrong
we
do
not
get
up
and
go
down
there
just
to
have
fun
that
saturday
morning
meeting
be
very
much
about
business
its
purpose
be
to
let
everyone
know
what
the
rest
of
the
company
be
up
to
if
we
can
we
find
hero
among
our
associate
in
the
store
and
bring
them
in
to
bentonville
where
we
praise
them
in
front
of
the
whole
meeting
everybody
like
praise
and
we
look
for
every
chance
we
can
to
heap
it
on
somebody
but
i
do
not
like
to
go
to
the
meeting
and
hear
about
just
the
good
thing
that
be
happen
i
like
to
hear
what
our
weakness
be
where
we
be
not
do
as
well
as
we
should
and
why
i
like
to
see
a
problem
come
up
and
then
hear
suggestion
as
to
how
it
can
be
correct
if
we
decide
we
be
do
something
wrong
and
the
solution
be
obvious
we
can
order
change
right
then
and
carry
them
out
over
the
weekend
while
most
everybody
else
in
the
retail
business
be
off
the
saturday
morning
meeting
be
where
we
discus
and
debate
much
of
our
philosophy
and
our
management
strategy
it
be
the
focal
point
of
all
our
communication
effort
it
be
where
we
share
idea
we
have
picked
up
from
various
place
and
while
it
be
not
the
most
excite
part
of
the
meeting
sometimes
i
like
to
read
from
management
article
that
pertain
to
our
business
two
of
our
executive
wesley
wright
and
colon
washburn
seem
to
read
just
about
everything
there
be
in
the
way
of
management
literature
and
they
be
constantly
call
useful
article
or
book
to
my
attention
at
the
meeting
we
will
talk
about
competitor
specifically
but
also
in
general
for
example
we
will
spend
ten
minute
talk
about
how
wal
mart
can
compete
successfully
with
all
the
good
specialty
retailer
come
onto
the
scene
it
be
often
the
place
where
we
first
decide
to
try
thing
that
seem
unattainable
and
instead
of
everybody
shout
it
down
right
away
we
try
to
figure
out
how
to
make
it
work
that
be
exactly
how
i
end
up
dance
the
hula
on
wall
street
by
make
that
bet
at
a
saturday
morning
meeting
and
as
embarrass
as
it
be
to
have
to
dance
on
wall
street
believe
me
achieve
a
pretax
profit
of
more
than
percent
when
most
everybody
else
in
the
retail
industry
average
about
half
that
make
it
well
worth
the
red
face
al
mile
the
great
thing
about
the
saturday
morning
meeting
be
how
totally
unpredictable
it
be
sometimes
you
get
your
soul
bar
in
there
by
that
i
mean
somebody
may
not
have
be
do
their
job
so
well
and
they
do
not
get
publicly
castigate
but
they
get
gently
chide
in
front
of
everybody
or
it
can
be
a
form
of
counsel
i
will
never
forget
the
chairman
say
to
me
one
time
in
front
of
everybody
that
i
ought
to
stop
and
think
sometimes
before
i
talk
and
i
have
it
come
i
be
be
really
derogatory
in
my
remark
really
stick
it
to
another
division
of
the
company
pretty
hard
and
it
be
not
the
right
place
to
do
it
i
be
publicly
counsel
in
that
meeting
and
it
stuck
another
time
the
chairman
decide
i
be
go
to
have
to
stand
up
there
and
sing
red
river
valley
at
a
meeting
three
week
away
he
knew
i
could
not
carry
a
tune
in
a
bucket
but
he
make
a
big
and
big
deal
out
of
it
every
week
until
finally
i
have
to
put
a
group
together
to
sing
it
so
nobody
would
hear
only
me
i
always
figure
he
just
want
to
force
me
into
do
something
in
public
that
i
be
not
so
good
at
and
that
way
i
have
to
eat
a
little
humble
pie
anyway
i
believe
those
meeting
be
manage
fun
and
i
think
the
chairman
manages
them
very
discreetly
he
know
when
he
want
it
to
be
serious
and
he
know
when
he
want
it
to
be
fun
sometimes
it
be
very
democratic
and
sometimes
it
be
very
dictatorial
but
he
us
it
for
basically
three
purpose
to
share
information
to
lighten
everybody
load
and
to
rally
the
troop
believe
it
or
not
the
majority
of
our
folk
would
not
miss
a
saturday
morning
meeting
for
anything
for
the
meeting
to
work
it
have
to
be
something
of
a
show
we
do
not
ever
want
to
let
it
become
predictable
one
day
we
might
do
a
few
calisthenics
another
day
we
might
sing
or
maybe
do
the
razorback
cheer
we
do
not
want
to
plan
it
all
out
we
just
want
it
to
unfold
it
be
so
unconventional
that
i
do
not
think
anyone
could
really
duplicate
it
even
if
they
want
to
we
have
lot
of
guest
and
our
folk
never
know
who
go
to
be
there
one
day
we
might
have
an
executive
from
a
company
we
do
business
with
it
might
be
somebody
they
never
heard
of
from
some
small
entrepreneurial
outfit
with
a
good
idea
or
it
might
be
somebody
like
jack
welch
the
ceo
of
ge
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
the
comedian
jonathan
winter
who
start
come
to
promote
hefty
bag
one
of
our
vendor
product
and
have
return
several
time
he
really
crack
everybody
up
one
time
we
have
a
mock
boxing
match
between
sugar
ray
leonard
and
me
we
ask
a
lot
of
athlete
to
join
us
sidney
moncrief
an
nba
star
and
former
razorback
great
be
one
of
my
favorite
and
fran
tarkenton
the
former
nfl
quarterback
who
do
a
lot
of
motivational
talk
have
also
spoken
at
the
meeting
just
recently
garth
brook
the
country
singer
from
oklahoma
drop
by
wal
mart
for
a
visit
with
some
of
our
folk
don
soderquist
one
of
the
real
value
of
our
meeting
be
its
spontaneity
we
never
really
have
an
agenda
of
course
the
chairman
always
have
his
yellow
legal
pad
with
note
scribble
on
it
of
thing
he
want
to
discus
and
some
of
the
rest
of
us
do
the
same
thing
but
one
of
the
thing
sam
will
do
be
just
call
someone
up
at
the
start
and
say
okay
you
conduct
the
whole
meeting
today
and
that
meeting
will
take
on
the
personality
of
whoever
run
it
that
way
there
be
always
a
sense
of
anticipation
something
unusual
may
happen
or
somebody
may
pull
off
something
great
from
the
time
we
start
the
saturday
meeting
with
just
four
or
five
store
manager
get
together
somewhere
to
talk
merchandising
it
have
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
develop
and
there
be
be
a
lot
of
opposition
to
it
include
from
my
own
wife
who
i
have
already
told
you
believe
it
be
unfair
to
take
our
folk
away
from
their
family
on
saturday
morning
there
have
definitely
be
time
when
our
folk
would
have
vote
it
out
if
we
have
give
them
the
opportunity
but
as
i
have
say
i
believe
saturday
work
be
part
of
the
commitment
that
come
with
choose
a
career
in
retail
i
ca
not
see
ask
our
folk
in
the
store
to
make
that
sacrifice
while
our
manager
be
off
play
golf
very
few
outsider
ever
get
to
see
our
saturday
meeting
so
the
event
that
give
people
the
most
insight
into
our
corporate
culture
the
place
where
they
really
get
a
chance
to
see
the
wal
mart
chemistry
in
action
be
our
annual
stockholder
meeting
i
told
you
how
it
begin
as
an
attempt
to
do
something
different
for
the
analyst
take
them
on
float
trip
and
make
them
camp
out
but
since
then
it
be
grown
into
what
be
probably
the
large
corporate
annual
meeting
in
the
world
it
be
gotten
so
big
now
with
over
shareholder
and
guest
that
we
hold
it
down
in
fayetteville
at
barnhill
arena
the
university
of
arkansas
basketball
coliseum
soon
we
will
be
hold
it
in
the
new
bud
walton
arena
they
be
building
down
there
and
i
know
my
brother
will
really
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
that
in
some
way
our
annual
meeting
be
a
big
version
of
the
kind
of
show
we
have
on
saturday
morning
we
have
entertainer
like
reba
mcentire
the
popular
country
singer
and
we
have
guest
speaker
in
other
way
it
be
a
lot
like
the
meeting
of
many
company
only
louder
we
make
presentation
to
the
shareholder
which
focus
on
our
accomplishment
over
the
past
year
and
on
our
goal
and
plan
for
the
come
one
but
what
i
think
really
set
our
meeting
apart
be
the
degree
to
which
we
involve
our
associate
who
after
all
be
some
of
our
most
important
shareholder
we
have
always
include
as
many
store
manager
and
associate
as
possible
in
our
annual
meeting
to
let
them
see
the
scope
of
the
whole
company
and
grasp
the
big
picture
we
start
out
let
every
store
and
every
distribution
center
elect
an
associate
to
represent
them
at
the
meeting
because
we
have
gotten
so
big
now
i
be
sorry
to
say
we
have
have
to
stagger
the
thing
the
distribution
center
and
the
sam
club
still
send
someone
every
year
but
wal
mart
store
only
send
a
delegate
every
other
year
really
the
official
part
of
the
meeting
take
a
backseat
to
everything
else
we
do
and
a
couple
of
time
we
have
be
have
so
much
fun
that
we
have
actually
forgotten
to
convene
the
real
meeting
we
gather
our
associate
early
on
friday
morning
around
seven
o
clock
for
a
real
rouse
warm
up
a
premeeting
meeting
we
do
our
cheer
and
our
song
and
raise
all
sort
of
cain
we
salute
retiree
we
bring
in
all
the
department
manager
whose
department
have
the
high
percentage
of
sale
relative
to
their
store
overall
sale
and
we
recognize
the
department
manager
who
have
the
high
sale
companywide
we
call
up
the
truck
driver
who
have
won
the
safety
award
for
the
best
drive
record
and
we
honor
them
we
applaud
associate
who
have
create
particularly
successful
display
or
who
have
won
one
of
our
vpi
volume
produce
item
contest
and
we
honor
them
the
point
be
that
we
be
not
there
to
honor
our
shareholder
as
much
as
we
be
to
let
them
meet
the
folk
who
be
responsible
for
the
amaze
return
on
their
investment
year
after
year
after
the
meeting
helen
and
i
invite
all
the
associate
who
attend
about
of
them
over
to
our
house
for
a
big
picnic
lunch
cater
by
our
own
wal
mart
cafeteria
it
be
a
lot
of
pressure
on
helen
not
many
wife
would
put
up
with
that
kind
of
crowd
stream
through
the
yard
and
the
house
but
i
think
it
be
one
of
the
best
thing
we
do
and
in
the
end
both
helen
and
i
really
enjoy
it
a
lot
it
give
us
a
chance
to
visit
with
many
of
our
associate
who
we
would
otherwise
never
get
to
see
in
a
social
set
like
that
they
tend
to
be
the
leader
in
their
store
which
be
how
they
get
elect
to
come
and
even
with
that
crush
of
people
there
i
still
have
the
opportunity
to
ask
them
how
be
we
do
at
litchfield
illinois
or
how
your
manager
work
out
in
branson
missouri
and
in
a
very
short
time
i
can
get
a
pretty
good
idea
from
their
level
of
enthusiasm
just
how
thing
be
go
in
a
particular
store
and
if
i
hear
something
i
do
not
like
i
just
might
be
out
there
visit
it
within
the
next
week
or
two
when
the
whole
thing
be
over
the
guest
associate
be
sent
a
videotape
of
the
meeting
and
they
be
suppose
to
share
that
and
their
impression
of
the
meeting
with
their
associate
who
do
not
get
to
go
and
of
course
we
write
a
detailed
account
of
the
meeting
in
our
company
newspaper
wal
mart
world
so
everybody
get
a
chance
to
read
exactly
what
we
do
we
like
to
think
that
this
kind
of
meeting
brings
us
all
closer
together
and
creates
the
feel
that
we
be
a
family
commit
to
one
common
interest
we
want
our
associate
to
know
and
feel
how
much
we
as
manager
and
major
shareholder
appreciate
everything
they
be
do
to
make
wal
mart
the
great
company
that
it
be
a
strong
corporate
culture
with
its
own
unique
personality
on
top
of
the
profit
share
partnership
we
have
create
give
us
a
pretty
sharp
competitive
edge
but
a
culture
like
ours
can
create
some
problem
of
its
own
too
the
main
one
that
come
to
mind
be
a
resistance
to
change
when
folk
buy
into
a
way
of
do
thing
and
really
believe
it
be
the
best
way
they
develop
a
tendency
to
think
that
be
exactly
the
way
thing
should
always
be
do
so
i
have
make
it
my
own
personal
mission
to
ensure
that
constant
change
be
a
vital
part
of
the
wal
mart
culture
itself
i
have
force
change
sometimes
for
change
sake
alone
at
every
turn
in
our
company
development
in
fact
i
think
one
of
the
great
strength
of
wal
mart
ingrain
culture
be
its
ability
to
drop
everything
and
turn
on
a
dime
we
be
great
at
that
kind
of
change
when
it
come
to
operating
challenge
but
sometimes
not
so
great
on
matter
that
have
more
to
do
with
the
culture
of
the
company
in
the
early
day
for
example
all
our
old
variety
store
manager
have
a
tremendous
prejudice
against
us
hire
college
boy
because
they
do
not
think
they
would
work
hard
enough
three
of
the
first
one
we
hire
bill
field
dean
sander
and
colon
wash
burn
be
still
with
us
and
in
fact
be
among
our
brightest
star
but
they
have
a
heck
of
a
time
fitting
in
at
first
and
could
probably
tell
some
real
horror
story
bill
field
executive
vice
president
merchandising
and
sale
wal
mart
i
have
be
with
the
company
about
five
day
and
we
be
opening
a
store
in
idabel
oklahoma
we
have
thirteen
day
to
open
it
which
be
still
a
record
they
work
me
about
hour
or
more
the
first
week
the
second
week
it
be
get
bad
then
sam
who
knew
who
i
be
because
i
be
a
local
bentonville
boy
come
walk
up
to
me
and
say
who
hire
you
i
told
him
that
ferold
arend
have
and
he
say
well
do
you
think
you
will
ever
be
a
merchant
just
the
way
he
say
it
make
me
mad
enough
to
want
to
quit
then
don
whitaker
come
walk
up
to
me
and
look
at
me
almost
like
he
smell
something
bad
and
say
who
in
the
hell
hire
you
at
the
time
it
do
not
seem
like
go
to
college
be
much
of
an
advantage
in
this
company
we
really
have
to
prove
ourselves
to
those
old
guy
obviously
if
we
be
go
to
grow
we
have
to
bring
in
college
educate
folk
but
at
first
the
culture
try
to
reject
them
and
now
that
we
have
even
more
complicate
need
in
technology
finance
marketing
legal
whatever
our
demand
for
a
more
sophisticated
work
force
be
grow
all
the
time
all
this
require
some
basic
change
in
the
way
we
think
about
ourselves
about
who
a
good
wal
mart
hire
for
tomorrow
and
about
what
we
can
do
for
the
folk
already
on
board
that
be
one
reason
helen
and
i
start
the
walton
institute
down
at
the
university
of
arkansas
in
fort
smith
it
be
a
place
where
our
manager
can
go
and
get
exposure
to
some
of
the
educational
opportunity
they
may
not
have
have
earlier
on
also
we
as
a
company
need
to
do
whatever
we
can
to
encourage
and
help
our
associate
earn
their
college
degree
we
need
these
folk
to
get
the
best
training
they
possibly
can
it
open
up
their
career
opportunity
and
it
benefit
us
traditionally
we
have
have
this
attitude
that
if
you
want
to
be
a
manager
at
wal
mart
you
basically
have
to
be
willing
to
move
on
a
moment
notice
you
get
a
call
that
say
you
be
go
to
open
a
new
store
mile
away
you
do
not
ask
question
you
just
pack
and
go
then
sometime
later
you
worry
about
sell
your
house
and
move
your
family
maybe
that
be
necessary
back
in
the
old
day
and
maybe
it
be
more
rigid
than
it
need
to
be
now
though
it
be
not
really
appropriate
anymore
for
several
reason
first
as
the
company
grows
big
we
need
to
find
more
way
to
stay
in
touch
with
the
community
where
we
operate
and
one
of
the
best
way
to
do
that
be
by
hire
locally
develop
manager
locally
and
let
them
have
a
career
in
their
home
community
if
they
perform
second
the
old
way
really
put
good
smart
woman
at
a
disadvantage
in
our
company
because
at
that
time
they
be
not
as
free
to
pick
up
and
move
as
many
men
be
now
i
have
see
the
light
on
the
opportunity
we
miss
out
on
with
woman
i
have
to
admit
that
helen
and
my
daughter
alice
have
help
me
come
around
to
this
way
of
think
in
the
old
day
retailer
felt
the
same
way
about
woman
that
they
do
about
college
boy
only
more
so
in
addition
to
think
woman
be
not
free
to
move
they
do
not
think
woman
could
handle
anything
but
the
clerk
job
because
the
manager
usually
do
so
much
physical
labor
unload
truck
and
haul
merchandise
out
of
the
stockroom
on
a
two
wheeler
mop
the
floor
and
cleaning
the
window
if
necessary
nowadays
the
industry
have
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
woman
make
great
retailer
so
we
at
wal
mart
along
with
everybody
else
have
to
do
everything
we
possibly
can
to
recruit
and
attract
woman
one
other
aspect
of
the
wal
mart
culture
which
have
attract
some
attention
be
simply
a
matter
of
lifestyle
but
it
be
one
that
have
bother
me
ever
since
we
begin
to
be
really
successful
the
fact
be
a
lot
of
folk
in
our
company
have
make
an
awful
lot
of
money
we
have
have
lot
and
lot
of
millionaire
in
our
rank
and
it
just
drive
me
crazy
when
they
flaunt
it
maybe
it
be
none
of
my
business
but
i
have
do
everything
i
can
to
discourage
our
folk
from
get
too
extravagant
with
their
home
and
their
automobile
and
their
lifestyle
as
i
say
earlier
i
just
do
not
believe
the
lifestyle
here
in
bentonville
should
be
much
different
than
what
would
be
high
moderate
income
in
most
other
place
but
from
time
to
time
i
have
have
a
hard
time
hold
back
folk
who
have
never
have
the
opportunity
to
get
their
hand
on
the
kind
of
money
they
have
make
with
their
wal
mart
stock
holding
every
now
and
then
somebody
will
do
something
particularly
showy
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
rant
and
rave
about
it
at
the
saturday
morning
meeting
and
a
lot
of
time
folk
who
just
ca
not
hold
back
will
go
ahead
and
leave
the
company
it
go
back
to
what
i
say
about
learn
to
value
a
dollar
as
a
kid
i
do
not
think
that
big
mansion
and
flashy
car
be
what
the
wal
mart
culture
be
suppose
to
be
about
it
be
great
to
have
the
money
to
fall
back
on
and
i
be
glad
some
of
these
folk
have
be
able
to
take
off
and
go
fishing
at
a
fairly
early
age
that
be
fine
with
me
but
if
you
get
too
caught
up
in
that
good
life
it
be
probably
time
to
move
on
simply
because
you
lose
touch
with
what
your
mind
be
suppose
to
be
concentrate
on
serve
the
customer

make
the
customer
number
one
sam
walton
understands
well
than
anyone
else
that
no
business
can
exist
without
customer
he
life
by
his
credo
which
be
to
make
the
customer
the
centerpiece
of
all
his
effort
and
in
the
process
of
serve
wal
mart
customer
to
perfection
not
quite
perfection
he
would
say
he
also
serf
wal
mart
associate
its
share
owner
its
community
and
the
rest
of
its
stakeholder
in
an
extraordinary
fashion
almost
without
parallel
in
american
business
roberto
c
goizueta
chairman
and
ceo
the
coca
cola
company
for
my
whole
career
in
retail
i
have
stuck
by
one
guide
principle
it
be
a
simple
one
and
i
have
repeat
it
over
and
over
and
over
in
this
book
until
i
be
sure
you
be
sick
to
death
of
it
but
i
be
go
to
say
it
again
anyway
the
secret
of
successful
retailing
be
to
give
your
customer
what
they
want
and
really
if
you
think
about
it
from
your
point
of
view
as
a
customer
you
want
everything
a
wide
assortment
of
good
quality
merchandise
the
low
possible
price
guaranteed
satisfaction
with
what
you
buy
friendly
knowledgeable
service
convenient
hour
free
parking
a
pleasant
shopping
experience
you
love
it
when
you
visit
a
store
that
somehow
exceeds
your
expectation
and
you
hate
it
when
a
store
inconvenience
you
or
give
you
a
hard
time
or
just
pretend
you
be
invisible
i
learn
this
lesson
as
a
merchant
in
small
town
which
be
where
i
have
spent
my
whole
life
for
those
of
you
who
have
be
around
as
long
as
i
have
and
who
spent
your
early
day
in
small
town
too
it
be
not
hard
to
remember
how
different
small
town
life
be
in
the
first
half
of
this
century
newport
be
a
pretty
prosperous
little
town
with
a
fairly
competitive
retail
environment
but
it
be
still
a
good
example
of
how
thing
work
back
then
it
be
a
cotton
town
which
meant
that
a
lot
of
the
folk
who
shop
there
really
live
outside
of
town
on
farm
most
of
the
men
work
long
hour
in
the
field
and
most
of
the
woman
work
at
home
very
few
woman
held
job
in
those
day
although
a
lot
of
them
have
work
during
the
war
and
they
be
begin
to
think
about
go
back
to
work
when
they
get
their
family
pretty
well
underway
the
town
itself
have
several
small
department
store
include
as
i
mention
earlier
a
penney
and
for
a
while
that
little
eagle
store
i
open
up
it
also
have
a
couple
of
good
variety
store
mine
and
john
dunham
sterling
store
there
be
drugstore
hardware
store
tire
and
auto
store
like
firestone
and
western
auto
and
little
family
grocery
store
in
lot
of
little
town
you
do
not
even
have
many
one
stop
grocery
you
might
have
one
shop
that
specialized
in
butchering
meat
another
that
carry
good
fresh
vegetable
and
maybe
another
that
would
wring
a
chicken
neck
and
dress
it
for
you
right
there
behind
the
counter
while
you
wait
folk
back
then
be
not
accustom
to
all
the
variety
and
abundance
of
good
and
service
that
we
have
available
today
during
the
depression
few
of
us
have
enough
money
to
shop
very
often
and
during
world
war
ii
everything
meat
butter
tire
shoe
gasoline
sugar
be
ration
but
by
the
time
i
start
out
the
shortage
be
pretty
much
over
and
the
economy
be
grow
compare
to
the
depression
we
have
be
use
to
boom
time
have
arrive
in
a
farm
to
market
town
like
newport
the
big
shopping
day
be
always
saturday
that
be
when
the
whole
family
would
drive
to
town
and
spend
a
few
hour
maybe
the
whole
day
walk
around
look
for
what
they
need
in
all
the
store
something
have
to
attract
them
to
a
particular
store
maybe
a
combination
of
thing
the
storekeeper
personality
the
freshness
of
the
good
the
price
an
ice
cream
machine
we
thrive
in
that
competitive
environment
when
we
arrive
in
the
much
small
town
of
bentonville
in
we
found
almost
no
spirit
of
competition
a
few
retailer
be
scatter
around
the
square
but
each
of
them
have
sort
of
carve
out
their
niche
and
that
be
that
if
a
store
do
not
have
something
the
customer
want
he
or
she
would
just
have
to
drive
to
rogers
or
springdale
or
very
possibly
on
into
fayetteville
use
some
of
the
thing
we
have
learn
in
newport
i
would
have
to
say
we
change
that
way
of
think
right
off
and
generally
spark
up
the
atmosphere
around
town
alice
walton
saturday
around
the
bentonville
square
be
really
something
special
dad
always
have
something
go
on
out
on
the
sidewalk
or
even
in
the
street
and
there
be
always
a
crowd
that
be
where
santa
claus
would
come
and
that
be
where
we
have
all
the
parade
to
me
as
a
kid
it
seem
like
we
have
a
circus
or
a
carnival
go
on
almost
every
weekend
i
love
saturday
i
have
my
popcorn
machine
out
on
the
sidewalk
and
i
be
cover
up
in
business
everybody
want
some
of
that
popcorn
and
of
course
a
lot
of
my
customer
would
go
on
into
the
store
it
be
a
great
way
to
grow
up
as
you
recall
fayetteville
be
where
we
open
our
second
store
after
bentonville
and
it
be
also
where
we
encounter
our
first
discounter
competition
gibson
we
knew
from
then
on
that
the
retail
business
be
go
to
be
change
in
major
way
for
year
to
come
and
we
want
to
be
part
of
it
we
knew
early
on
that
variety
store
be
not
go
to
be
as
big
a
factor
in
the
future
as
they
have
be
in
the
past
and
we
be
heavily
invest
in
them
the
important
thing
to
recognize
though
be
that
none
of
this
be
take
place
in
a
vacuum
in
the
fifty
and
sixty
everything
about
america
be
change
rapidly
all
the
kid
who
have
grown
up
on
farm
and
in
small
town
have
come
home
from
world
war
ii
or
korea
and
move
to
the
city
where
all
the
job
be
except
they
be
not
really
move
to
the
city
they
be
move
to
the
suburb
and
commute
into
the
city
to
work
it
seem
like
every
family
have
at
least
one
car
and
many
have
two
and
the
country
have
start
building
its
interstate
highway
system
all
of
which
change
a
lot
of
the
traditional
way
american
be
accustom
to
do
business
the
downtown
of
big
city
start
to
lose
population
and
business
to
the
suburb
and
the
big
downtown
department
store
have
to
follow
their
customer
and
build
branch
store
out
in
the
suburban
mall
traditional
diner
and
cafe
suffer
because
of
the
new
car
orient
chain
like
mcdonald
and
burger
king
and
the
old
city
variety
store
like
woolworth
and
mccrory
just
get
smash
by
kmart
and
some
of
the
other
big
discounter
the
oil
company
stuck
service
station
on
practically
every
other
corner
and
pretty
soon
something
call
convenience
store
eleven
and
such
come
along
and
start
fill
up
the
other
corner
it
be
when
all
this
begin
that
bud
and
i
have
open
that
ben
franklin
in
the
shopping
center
at
ruskin
height
that
big
new
subdivision
community
outside
kansa
city
for
the
most
part
up
where
we
be
in
the
small
town
of
northwest
arkansas
missouri
oklahoma
and
kansa
you
do
not
see
much
of
the
mall
construction
and
fast
food
neon
that
you
saw
everywhere
else
mcdonald
do
not
go
into
the
small
town
and
neither
do
kmart
you
saw
the
small
town
commercial
center
start
to
sort
of
shrivel
up
a
lot
of
our
customer
base
have
move
on
and
the
one
who
remain
behind
be
not
stupid
consumer
if
they
have
something
big
to
buy
say
a
rid
lawnmower
they
would
not
hesitate
to
drive
fifty
mile
to
get
it
if
they
thought
they
could
save
not
only
that
but
with
the
introduction
of
tv
and
new
postwar
car
model
be
modern
have
become
a
big
thing
everybody
want
to
feel
up
to
date
and
if
they
knew
kroger
or
somebody
have
a
big
new
grocery
store
in
tulsa
or
somewhere
they
would
drive
in
there
to
shop
it
when
they
saw
that
the
price
be
low
and
the
selection
be
well
they
would
go
back
again
and
again
until
somebody
brought
a
supermarket
to
their
town
it
be
this
kind
of
strong
customer
demand
in
the
small
town
that
make
it
possible
for
wal
mart
to
get
start
in
the
first
place
that
enable
our
store
to
thrive
immediately
and
that
eventually
make
it
possible
to
spread
the
idea
pretty
much
all
over
the
country
for
many
year
we
live
entirely
off
the
principle
that
customer
in
the
country
and
in
small
town
be
just
like
their
relative
who
left
the
farm
and
move
to
the
city
they
want
a
good
deal
as
much
as
anybody
when
we
arrive
in
these
little
town
offering
low
price
every
day
satisfaction
guaranteed
and
hour
that
be
realistic
for
the
way
people
want
to
shop
we
pass
right
by
that
old
variety
store
competition
with
its
percent
markup
limited
selection
and
limited
hour
wal
mart
no
be
as
good
an
example
as
there
be
of
how
it
work
that
store
open
in
and
it
marked
our
return
to
newport
arkansas
nineteen
year
after
we
have
basically
be
run
out
of
town
by
then
i
be
long
over
what
have
happen
to
us
down
there
and
i
do
not
have
revenge
in
mind
it
be
a
logical
town
for
us
to
expand
into
and
i
admit
that
it
do
feel
mighty
good
to
be
back
in
business
down
there
i
knew
it
be
a
town
where
we
would
do
well
as
it
happen
we
do
extraordinarily
well
with
our
newport
wal
mart
and
it
be
not
too
long
before
the
old
ben
franklin
store
i
have
run
on
front
street
have
to
close
its
door
you
ca
not
say
we
ran
that
guy
the
landlord
son
out
of
business
his
customer
be
the
one
who
shut
him
down
they
vote
with
their
foot
quite
a
few
small
store
have
go
out
of
business
during
the
time
of
wal
mart
growth
some
people
have
try
to
turn
it
into
this
big
controversy
sort
of
a
save
the
small
town
merchant
deal
like
they
be
whale
or
whoop
crane
or
something
that
have
the
right
to
be
protect
of
all
the
notion
i
have
heard
about
wal
mart
none
have
ever
baffle
me
more
than
this
idea
that
we
be
somehow
the
enemy
of
small
town
america
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
wal
mart
have
actually
kept
quite
a
number
of
small
town
from
become
practically
extinct
by
offering
low
price
and
save
literally
billion
of
dollar
for
the
people
who
live
there
as
well
as
by
create
hundred
of
thousand
of
job
in
our
store
i
do
not
have
any
trouble
understand
why
some
merchant
who
have
a
hard
time
compete
with
us
would
not
be
too
happy
about
our
be
there
what
i
have
not
be
able
to
figure
at
all
be
these
people
who
have
decide
we
be
somehow
responsible
for
the
decline
of
the
small
town
my
guess
be
that
a
lot
of
these
critic
be
folk
who
grow
up
in
small
town
and
then
desert
them
for
the
big
city
decade
ago
now
when
they
come
home
for
a
visit
it
make
them
sad
that
the
old
town
square
be
not
exactly
like
it
be
when
they
left
it
back
in
it
be
almost
like
they
want
their
hometown
to
be
stuck
in
time
an
old
fashion
place
fill
with
old
fashion
people
do
business
the
old
fashion
way
somehow
small
town
population
be
not
suppose
to
move
out
into
their
own
suburb
and
they
be
not
suppose
to
go
out
to
the
intersection
of
highway
and
build
mall
with
lot
of
free
parking
that
be
just
not
the
way
some
of
these
people
remember
their
old
town
but
folk
who
grow
up
in
big
city
feel
the
same
way
about
what
happen
to
their
city
over
the
last
forty
or
fifty
year
a
lot
of
the
store
and
the
movie
theater
and
the
restaurant
that
they
remember
love
as
kid
have
board
up
and
either
go
out
of
business
or
move
to
the
suburb
too
i
think
what
happen
to
wal
mart
in
all
this
be
that
we
get
to
be
a
certain
size
and
become
so
well
know
as
the
small
town
merchant
that
we
become
an
easy
target
certain
folk
figure
they
could
create
a
niche
for
themselves
a
platform
from
which
to
express
their
view
about
small
town
america
by
zero
in
on
us
the
whole
thing
taught
me
a
lesson
about
the
way
the
national
medium
seem
to
think
when
you
start
out
as
an
unknown
quantity
with
just
a
dream
and
a
commitment
you
could
not
buy
a
mention
of
your
company
in
one
of
these
publication
when
you
become
moderately
successful
they
still
ignore
you
unless
something
bad
happens
to
you
then
the
more
successful
you
become
the
more
suspicious
they
become
of
you
and
if
you
ever
become
a
large
scale
success
it
be
katie
bar
the
door
suddenly
you
make
a
very
convenient
villain
because
everybody
seem
to
love
shoot
at
who
on
top
as
an
old
time
small
town
merchant
i
can
tell
you
that
nobody
have
more
love
for
the
heyday
of
the
smalltown
retailing
era
than
i
do
that
be
one
of
the
reason
we
chose
to
put
our
little
wal
mart
museum
on
the
square
in
bentonville
it
be
in
the
old
walton
five
and
dime
building
and
it
try
to
capture
a
little
bit
of
the
old
dime
store
feel
but
i
can
also
tell
you
this
if
we
have
gotten
smug
about
our
early
success
and
say
well
we
be
the
best
merchant
in
town
and
just
kept
do
everything
exactly
the
way
we
be
do
it
somebody
else
would
have
come
along
and
give
our
customer
what
they
want
and
we
would
be
out
of
business
today
i
do
not
know
who
it
would
have
be
maybe
gibson
or
tg
y
would
have
pull
it
off
but
i
suspect
it
would
have
be
a
combination
of
kmart
and
target
which
like
mcdonald
would
have
roll
out
into
the
small
town
once
they
begin
to
saturate
their
big
city
market
what
happen
be
absolutely
a
necessary
and
inevitable
evolution
in
retailing
as
inevitable
as
the
replacement
of
the
buggy
by
the
car
and
the
disappearance
of
the
buggy
whip
maker
the
small
store
be
just
destine
to
disappear
at
least
in
the
number
they
once
exist
because
the
whole
thing
be
driven
by
the
customer
who
be
free
to
choose
where
to
shop
don
soderquist
we
have
never
be
very
sympathetic
to
this
whole
small
town
argument
what
happen
to
the
small
town
merchant
be
not
any
different
from
what
happen
when
supermarket
first
appear
in
the
fifty
the
whole
point
of
retailing
be
to
serve
the
customer
if
you
be
a
merchant
with
no
competition
you
can
charge
high
price
open
late
close
early
and
shut
down
on
wednesday
and
saturday
afternoon
you
can
do
exactly
what
you
have
always
do
and
probably
be
just
fine
but
when
competition
come
along
do
not
expect
your
customer
to
stick
with
you
for
old
time
sake
there
be
plenty
of
way
to
compete
successfully
with
wal
mart
or
any
other
big
retailer
the
principle
behind
all
those
way
be
pretty
basic
you
have
to
focus
on
something
the
customer
want
and
then
deliver
it
i
do
not
want
to
be
too
critical
of
small
town
merchant
but
the
truth
be
that
a
lot
of
these
folk
just
be
not
do
a
very
good
job
of
take
care
of
their
customer
before
we
or
somebody
else
come
in
and
offer
something
new
and
they
do
not
do
a
very
good
job
of
react
to
our
arrival
either
you
know
there
have
be
article
and
even
one
little
book
write
on
how
to
compete
with
us
and
i
have
get
a
few
suggestion
of
my
own
unless
small
merchant
be
already
do
a
great
job
they
will
probably
have
to
rethink
their
merchandising
and
advertising
and
promotional
program
once
a
discounter
arrives
on
the
scene
they
need
to
avoid
come
at
us
head
on
and
do
their
own
thing
well
than
we
do
ours
it
do
not
make
any
sense
to
try
to
underprice
wal
mart
on
something
like
toothpaste
that
be
not
what
the
customer
be
look
to
a
small
store
for
anyway
most
independent
be
best
off
i
think
do
what
i
pride
myself
on
do
for
so
many
year
as
a
storekeeper
get
out
on
the
floor
and
meeting
every
one
of
the
customer
let
them
know
how
much
you
appreciate
them
and
ring
that
cash
register
yourself
that
little
personal
touch
be
so
important
for
an
independent
merchant
because
no
matter
how
hard
wal
mart
try
to
duplicate
it
and
we
try
awfully
hard
we
ca
not
really
do
it
i
think
in
the
case
of
variety
store
they
have
to
completely
reposition
themselves
something
like
the
way
don
soderquist
do
when
he
be
president
of
ben
franklin
he
saw
that
there
just
be
not
any
future
in
compete
with
wal
mart
and
kmart
so
he
start
convert
a
lot
of
their
variety
store
into
craft
store
they
offer
a
much
big
assortment
of
craft
merchandise
than
any
wal
mart
could
and
they
held
class
in
thing
like
pottery
and
flower
arrange
service
we
could
never
think
about
provide
it
work
they
stayed
in
business
in
the
small
town
and
have
be
quite
successful
with
many
of
those
store
the
same
thing
can
be
do
with
fabric
offer
high
quality
material
and
throw
in
some
sew
class
or
lady
apparel
i
do
not
care
how
many
wal
mart
come
to
town
there
be
always
niche
that
we
ca
not
reach
not
that
we
wo
not
try
just
like
everybody
else
in
order
to
survive
we
need
to
keep
change
the
thing
we
do
now
in
the
case
of
hardware
store
i
do
not
deny
that
we
have
be
hard
on
some
of
them
too
but
if
they
be
in
a
decent
location
they
should
not
have
that
much
trouble
with
wal
mart
it
be
the
one
kind
of
store
for
which
i
have
the
least
sympathy
because
frankly
a
good
smart
hardware
store
operator
can
just
beat
us
to
death
if
he
think
about
what
he
be
do
and
commits
to
put
up
a
fight
if
he
get
his
assortment
right
and
make
sure
his
salesperson
have
excellent
knowledge
of
the
product
and
how
to
use
them
and
go
out
of
his
way
to
take
care
of
his
customer
he
can
keep
plenty
of
business
away
from
us
we
do
not
have
nearly
the
assortment
of
a
hardware
store
plumbing
supply
and
electrical
equipment
and
specialty
tool
and
not
all
of
our
folk
can
explain
how
to
fix
a
leaky
faucet
or
rewire
a
lamp
the
way
folk
in
a
hardware
store
should
be
able
to
our
paint
customer
do
not
get
wait
on
much
either
they
have
to
pick
out
their
own
paint
and
then
walk
around
with
it
look
for
the
rest
of
the
thing
they
want
the
same
be
true
in
sport
good
where
the
customer
ca
not
expect
to
get
nearly
the
same
kind
of
service
from
us
as
from
a
specialty
store
don
soderquist
i
have
personally
compete
with
wal
mart
so
i
know
it
can
be
do
you
develop
a
uniqueness
a
niche
and
then
you
capitalize
on
it
and
let
me
tell
you
not
all
small
merchant
in
these
little
town
hate
us
some
of
them
have
learn
to
feed
off
us
rather
successfully
shortly
after
we
open
a
wal
mart
in
wheat
ridge
colorado
i
have
a
lady
come
up
to
me
and
say
oh
i
just
want
to
thank
you
so
much
for
come
here
this
be
the
best
thing
that
could
have
ever
happen
i
thanked
her
and
ask
her
what
she
do
there
in
town
and
she
say
well
i
run
a
paint
store
right
over
here
just
down
in
this
mall
she
go
on
to
say
that
the
day
our
store
open
turn
out
to
be
the
big
day
she
have
ever
have
since
her
paint
store
open
you
be
pull
all
these
people
into
our
shopping
center
and
the
neat
thing
happen
to
me
saturday
a
man
come
in
look
for
a
particular
kind
of
paint
and
say
he
knew
we
have
it
he
say
he
knew
because
he
would
be
in
the
wal
mart
look
for
it
and
the
paint
department
manager
told
him
we
have
it
and
sent
him
on
over
i
thought
that
be
wonderful
our
guy
sent
the
customer
along
to
the
paint
store
because
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
he
be
take
care
of
the
customer
what
make
me
sad
these
day
and
a
little
angry
too
be
that
some
of
these
store
be
start
to
shut
down
before
we
come
to
a
town
they
hear
we
be
come
and
they
close
up
before
we
ever
even
get
there
we
get
a
bad
rap
for
that
but
to
my
mind
somebody
who
will
close
his
store
just
because
he
hears
competition
come
be
somebody
who
must
know
he
be
not
do
much
of
a
job
somebody
who
probably
should
not
have
be
in
the
retail
business
to
begin
with
for
all
the
press
about
wal
mart
be
at
odds
with
small
town
i
be
positive
that
we
be
most
welcome
in
almost
every
community
where
we
do
business
that
be
partly
because
of
our
economic
contribution
but
it
be
also
because
we
go
out
of
our
way
to
instill
a
sense
of
community
involvement
in
our
store
management
and
associate
so
that
they
will
be
even
well
citizen
we
know
that
some
of
our
store
manager
do
a
well
job
at
this
than
others
and
it
be
a
constant
effort
to
make
everyone
work
on
community
involvement
we
already
have
community
scholarship
program
and
match
charity
grant
program
but
we
be
work
hard
every
day
to
improve
the
way
in
which
we
give
back
to
the
community
we
be
in
if
we
ever
let
our
sense
of
be
hometown
merchant
slip
too
far
we
run
the
risk
of
damage
what
we
think
be
a
unique
relationship
with
our
customer
when
we
meet
opposition
to
a
prospective
store
site
we
try
to
work
with
the
opponent
to
see
if
we
can
reasonably
satisfy
them
occasionally
we
will
change
a
propose
location
or
make
some
concession
if
they
make
sense
to
us
today
though
we
have
almost
adopt
the
position
that
if
some
community
for
whatever
reason
do
not
want
us
in
there
we
be
not
interested
in
go
in
and
create
a
fuss
i
encourage
us
to
walk
away
from
this
kind
of
trouble
because
there
be
just
too
many
other
good
town
out
there
who
do
want
us
for
every
one
that
do
not
i
would
say
we
have
another
two
hundred
beg
us
to
come
to
their
town
wal
mart
want
to
go
where
it
be
want
i
have
always
say
that
the
simplest
test
of
how
right
we
be
on
this
issue
would
be
to
go
into
any
town
where
we
have
be
for
a
couple
of
year
and
let
everyone
vote
on
whether
they
want
us
there
or
not
my
lord
they
would
go
crazy
if
we
left
in
fact
every
now
and
then
we
do
have
to
close
up
a
store
someplace
because
we
just
ca
not
make
it
profitable
and
the
outcry
be
something
awful
it
be
another
part
of
the
price
you
pay
for
success
small
town
merchant
by
the
way
be
not
the
only
group
we
have
gotten
into
controversy
with
by
stick
to
our
philosophy
of
put
the
customer
ahead
of
everything
else
on
the
surface
the
idea
of
serve
the
customer
sound
so
simple
so
logical
and
so
obvious
but
from
the
very
begin
the
way
we
have
practice
it
have
be
so
radical
that
it
have
frequently
gotten
us
into
trouble
with
what
folk
call
the
system
in
the
early
day
the
department
store
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
vendor
to
keep
them
from
sell
to
discounter
like
us
because
they
hat
what
we
be
do
offering
our
customer
price
much
low
than
theirs
in
some
state
the
department
store
use
so
call
fair
trade
law
to
try
and
block
discounter
from
do
business
at
all
our
vendor
resent
us
for
pry
the
low
price
out
of
them
and
some
manufacturer
representative
independent
sale
agent
who
generally
work
on
commission
to
represent
several
different
manufacturer
have
complain
about
some
of
our
practice
we
do
not
have
any
problem
with
the
idea
of
pay
a
middleman
a
commission
on
a
sale
if
his
service
add
value
to
the
purchasing
process
by
make
it
more
efficient
but
from
the
day
when
i
be
haul
that
little
trailer
over
into
tennessee
to
buy
panty
and
shirt
and
avoid
pay
butler
brother
markup
our
philosophy
on
this
have
always
be
simple
we
be
the
agent
for
our
customer
and
to
do
the
best
job
possible
we
have
get
to
become
the
most
efficient
deliverer
of
merchandise
that
we
can
sometimes
that
can
best
be
accomplish
by
purchasing
good
directly
from
the
manufacturer
and
other
time
direct
purchase
simply
do
not
work
in
those
case
we
need
to
use
middleman
to
deal
with
small
manufacturer
and
make
the
process
more
efficient
what
we
believe
in
strongly
be
our
right
to
make
that
decision
whether
to
buy
directly
or
from
a
rep
base
on
what
it
take
to
best
serve
our
customer
this
controversy
be
another
case
i
think
of
a
group
of
people
believe
for
some
reason
that
they
be
just
entitle
to
take
a
piece
of
the
action
no
matter
how
little
they
contribute
to
the
transaction
or
what
it
mean
to
the
customer
the
argument
be
as
simple
as
the
small
town
merchant
controversy
if
american
business
be
go
to
prevail
and
be
competitive
we
be
go
to
have
to
get
accustom
to
the
idea
that
business
condition
change
and
that
survivor
have
to
adapt
to
those
change
condition
business
be
a
competitive
endeavor
and
job
security
last
only
as
long
as
the
customer
be
satisfied
nobody
owes
anybody
else
a
living
to
understand
wal
mart
point
of
view
on
middleman
and
our
relationship
with
our
vendor
you
have
to
look
back
to
our
beginning
in
the
discount
business
in
the
early
day
of
the
industry
most
discounter
be
serve
entirely
by
middleman
jobber
or
distributor
who
come
in
and
say
to
those
old
promoter
we
will
keep
your
shelf
fill
for
percent
of
the
gross
in
other
word
the
price
on
every
item
include
a
percent
commission
to
the
jobber
for
supply
the
merchandise
that
be
how
the
fast
buck
promoter
get
into
the
business
without
even
have
to
think
much
like
merchant
they
take
what
the
jobber
give
them
add
on
the
percent
and
still
under
price
the
department
store
by
a
long
shot
but
as
i
mention
we
could
not
find
anybody
who
want
to
run
their
truck
sixty
or
seventy
mile
out
of
the
way
into
these
little
town
where
we
be
operating
we
be
totally
ignore
by
the
distributor
and
the
jobber
that
be
not
only
how
we
come
to
build
our
own
distribution
system
it
be
also
how
we
get
use
to
beating
the
heck
out
of
everybody
on
price
we
have
a
time
get
good
merchandise
for
our
store
back
then
but
our
cost
of
acquire
the
good
be
rock
bottom
because
we
sat
out
there
with
absolutely
no
help
from
distributor
and
because
we
get
use
to
do
everything
on
our
own
we
have
always
resent
pay
anyone
just
for
the
pleasure
of
do
business
with
him
claude
harris
there
be
a
difference
between
be
tough
and
be
obnoxious
but
every
buyer
have
to
be
tough
that
be
the
job
i
always
told
the
buyer
you
be
not
negotiate
for
wal
mart
you
be
negotiate
for
your
customer
and
your
customer
deserves
the
best
price
you
can
get
do
not
ever
feel
sorry
for
a
vendor
he
know
what
he
can
sell
for
and
we
want
his
bottom
price
and
that
be
what
we
do
and
what
wal
mart
still
do
we
would
tell
the
vendor
do
not
leave
in
any
room
for
a
kickback
because
we
do
not
do
that
here
and
we
do
not
want
your
advertising
program
or
your
delivery
program
our
truck
will
pick
it
up
at
your
warehouse
now
what
be
your
best
price
and
if
they
told
me
it
be
a
dollar
i
would
say
fine
i
will
consider
it
but
i
be
go
to
go
to
your
competitor
and
if
he
say
cent
he
be
go
to
get
the
business
so
make
sure
a
dollar
be
your
best
price
if
that
be
be
hard
nose
then
we
ought
to
be
as
hard
nose
as
we
can
be
you
have
to
be
fair
and
upfront
and
honest
but
you
have
to
drive
your
bargain
because
you
be
deal
for
million
and
million
of
customer
who
expect
the
best
price
they
can
get
if
you
buy
that
thing
for
you
have
just
bought
somebody
else
inefficiency
we
use
to
get
in
some
terrific
fight
you
have
to
be
just
as
tough
as
they
be
you
ca
not
let
them
get
by
with
anything
because
they
be
go
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
your
job
be
to
take
care
of
the
customer
i
would
threaten
procter
gamble
with
not
carry
their
merchandise
and
they
would
say
oh
you
ca
not
get
by
without
carry
our
merchandise
and
i
would
say
you
watch
me
put
it
on
a
side
counter
and
i
will
put
colgate
on
the
endcap
at
a
penny
less
and
you
just
watch
me
they
get
offend
and
go
to
sam
and
he
say
whatever
claude
say
that
be
what
it
be
go
to
be
well
now
we
have
a
real
good
relationship
with
procter
gamble
it
be
a
model
that
everybody
talk
about
but
let
me
tell
you
one
reason
for
that
be
that
they
learn
to
respect
us
they
learn
that
they
could
not
bulldoze
us
like
everybody
else
and
that
when
we
say
we
be
represent
the
customer
we
be
dead
serious
in
those
day
of
course
we
desperately
need
procter
gamble
product
whereas
they
could
have
gotten
along
just
fine
without
us
today
we
be
their
large
customer
but
it
really
be
not
until
that
we
begin
to
turn
a
basically
adversarial
vendor
retailer
relationship
into
one
that
we
like
to
think
be
the
wave
of
the
future
a
win
win
partnership
between
two
big
company
both
try
to
serve
the
same
customer
believe
it
or
not
as
big
as
we
have
become
by
then
i
do
not
believe
wal
mart
have
ever
be
call
on
by
a
corporate
officer
of
p
g
we
just
let
our
buyer
slug
it
out
with
their
salesman
and
both
side
live
with
the
result
then
one
day
my
close
friend
and
longtime
tennis
buddy
here
in
bentonville
george
billingsley
call
me
up
and
ask
me
to
join
him
on
a
canoe
trip
down
the
spring
river
he
say
he
be
bring
along
an
old
friend
name
lou
pritchett
who
be
a
vice
president
with
p
g
at
the
time
and
who
want
to
meet
me
and
talk
about
some
thing
relate
to
our
two
company
so
i
go
along
and
it
turn
out
to
be
the
most
productive
float
trip
i
ever
take
with
george
lou
pritchett
during
that
time
on
the
river
we
both
decide
that
the
entire
relationship
between
vendor
and
retailer
be
at
issue
both
focus
on
the
end
user
the
customer
but
each
do
it
independently
of
the
other
no
share
of
information
no
planning
together
no
system
coordination
we
be
simply
two
giant
entity
go
our
separate
way
oblivious
to
the
excess
cost
create
by
this
obsolete
system
we
be
communicate
in
effect
by
slip
note
under
the
door
as
a
result
we
assemble
the
top
ten
officer
of
both
company
in
bentonville
for
two
day
of
soul
search
and
think
and
within
three
month
we
have
create
a
p
g
wal
mart
team
to
build
a
whole
new
kind
of
vendor
retailer
relationship
we
form
a
partnership
to
conduct
our
business
with
one
of
the
most
important
outcome
be
that
we
start
share
information
by
computer
p
g
could
monitor
wal
mart
sale
and
inventory
data
and
then
use
that
information
to
make
its
own
production
and
shipping
plan
with
a
great
deal
more
efficiency
we
broke
new
ground
by
use
information
technology
to
manage
our
business
together
instead
of
just
to
audit
it
follow
the
p
g
wal
mart
partnership
many
other
company
begin
to
view
the
supplier
as
an
important
partner
the
partnership
be
also
a
model
for
many
of
our
other
vendor
relationship
in
our
situation
today
we
be
obsess
with
quality
as
well
as
price
and
as
big
as
we
be
the
only
way
we
can
possibly
get
that
combination
be
to
sit
down
with
our
vendor
and
work
out
the
cost
and
margin
and
plan
everything
together
by
do
that
we
give
the
manufacturer
the
advantage
of
know
what
our
need
be
go
to
be
a
year
out
or
six
month
out
or
even
two
year
out
then
as
long
as
they
be
honest
with
us
and
try
to
low
their
cost
as
much
as
they
can
and
keep
turn
out
a
product
that
the
customer
want
we
can
stay
with
them
we
both
win
and
most
important
the
customer
win
too
the
add
efficiency
of
the
whole
process
enables
the
manufacturer
to
reduce
its
cost
which
allows
us
to
low
our
price
one
thing
we
do
not
ever
want
to
do
though
be
let
all
these
complex
strategic
issue
between
us
and
other
big
company
or
these
controversy
like
small
town
merchant
and
middleman
get
in
the
way
of
our
think
like
customer
which
may
be
the
most
basic
way
in
which
we
make
the
customer
number
one
david
glass
i
be
in
a
store
recently
where
a
manager
and
an
assistant
manager
be
take
a
department
manager
through
her
department
they
be
say
if
you
be
a
customer
how
would
you
buy
that
item
she
be
cramped
for
space
and
have
put
this
item
out
of
reach
of
the
average
customer
and
they
kept
go
if
you
be
a
customer
what
related
item
would
you
want
to
buy
with
this
and
how
would
you
find
them
i
love
it
so
many
time
we
overcomplicate
this
business
you
can
take
computer
report
velocity
report
any
kind
of
report
you
want
to
and
go
lay
out
your
counter
by
computer
but
if
you
simply
think
like
a
customer
you
will
do
a
well
job
of
merchandise
presentation
and
selection
than
any
other
way
it
be
not
always
easy
to
think
like
a
customer
you
have
to
think
about
detail
whoever
say
retail
be
detail
be
absolutely
percent
right
on
the
other
hand
it
be
simple
if
the
customer
be
the
boss
all
you
have
to
do
be
please
them
i
could
not
agree
with
david
more
everything
we
have
do
since
we
start
wal
mart
have
be
devote
to
this
idea
that
the
customer
be
our
bos
the
controversy
it
have
lead
us
into
have
surprised
me
but
they
have
be
easy
to
live
with
because
we
have
never
doubt
our
philosophy
that
the
customer
come
ahead
of
everything
else

meeting
the
competition
sam
phone
to
tell
me
he
be
go
to
start
a
wholesale
club
it
be
no
surprise
he
be
notorious
for
look
at
what
everybody
else
do
take
the
best
of
it
and
then
make
it
well
sol
price
founder
fed
mart
and
founder
price
club
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
happen
to
wal
mart
if
we
have
laid
low
and
never
stir
up
the
competition
my
guess
be
that
we
would
have
remain
a
strictly
regional
operator
then
eventually
i
think
we
would
have
be
force
to
sell
out
to
some
national
chain
look
for
a
quick
way
to
expand
into
the
heartland
market
maybe
there
would
have
be
or
wal
mart
on
the
street
for
a
while
but
today
they
would
all
have
kmart
or
target
sign
in
front
of
them
and
i
would
have
become
a
full
time
bird
hunter
we
will
never
know
because
we
chose
the
other
route
we
decide
that
instead
of
avoid
our
competitor
or
wait
for
them
to
come
to
us
we
would
meet
them
head
on
it
be
one
of
the
smartest
strategic
decision
we
ever
make
in
fact
if
our
story
do
not
prove
anything
else
about
the
free
market
system
it
era
any
doubt
that
spirit
competition
be
good
for
business
not
just
customer
but
the
company
which
have
to
compete
with
one
another
too
our
competitor
have
hone
and
sharpen
us
to
an
edge
we
would
not
have
without
them
we
would
not
be
nearly
as
good
as
we
be
today
without
kmart
and
i
think
they
would
admit
we
have
make
them
a
well
retailer
one
reason
sears
fell
so
far
off
the
pace
be
that
they
would
not
admit
for
the
long
time
that
wal
mart
and
kmart
be
their
real
competition
they
ignore
both
of
us
and
we
both
blew
right
by
them
bud
walton
competition
be
very
definitely
what
make
wal
mart
from
the
very
begin
there
be
not
an
individual
in
these
whole
united
state
who
have
be
in
more
retail
store
all
type
of
retail
store
too
not
just
discount
store
than
sam
walton
make
that
all
over
the
world
he
be
be
in
store
in
australia
and
south
america
europe
and
asia
and
south
africa
his
mind
be
just
so
inquisitive
when
it
come
to
this
business
and
there
may
not
be
anything
he
enjoys
more
than
go
into
a
competitor
store
try
to
learn
something
from
it
at
first
we
only
butt
head
with
other
regional
discounter
like
gibson
and
the
magic
mart
discount
division
of
sterling
we
do
not
compete
directly
with
kmart
to
put
thing
into
perspective
compare
kmart
and
wal
mart
after
they
have
both
be
on
the
street
for
ten
year
our
fifty
plus
wal
mart
and
eleven
variety
store
be
do
about
million
a
year
in
sale
compare
to
kmart
five
hundred
store
do
more
than
billion
a
year
but
kmart
have
interested
me
ever
since
the
first
store
go
up
in
i
be
in
their
store
constantly
because
they
be
the
laboratory
and
they
be
well
than
we
be
i
spent
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
my
time
wander
through
their
store
talk
to
their
people
and
try
to
figure
out
how
they
do
thing
for
a
long
time
i
have
be
itch
to
try
our
luck
against
them
and
finally
in
we
saw
a
perfect
opportunity
in
hot
spring
arkansas
a
much
large
city
than
we
be
accustom
to
move
into
but
still
close
to
home
and
full
of
customer
we
understood
we
saw
kmart
sit
there
all
alone
really
have
their
way
with
the
market
they
have
no
competition
and
their
price
and
margin
be
so
high
that
they
almost
be
not
even
discounting
we
sent
phil
green
in
to
open
store
number
which
you
may
remember
be
where
he
stir
up
all
the
fuss
with
the
world
large
tide
display
and
all
his
other
outrageous
promotion
he
cut
price
to
the
bone
and
stole
a
bunch
of
kmart
customer
coincidentally
it
be
right
about
that
time
that
harry
cunningham
chose
to
retire
as
the
ceo
of
kmart
which
he
have
found
while
he
be
chairman
of
s
s
kresge
this
be
a
big
break
for
us
harry
be
really
the
guy
who
in
just
ten
year
have
legitimize
the
discount
industry
and
make
kmart
into
the
model
for
us
all
though
my
good
friend
john
geisse
who
help
found
the
target
and
venture
store
be
another
pioneer
way
ahead
of
his
time
harry
cunningham
from
the
time
anybody
first
notice
sam
it
be
obvious
he
have
adopt
almost
all
of
the
original
kmart
idea
i
always
have
great
admiration
for
the
way
he
implement
and
later
enlarge
on
those
idea
much
later
on
when
i
be
retire
but
still
a
kmart
board
member
i
try
to
advise
the
company
management
of
just
what
a
serious
threat
i
thought
he
be
but
it
be
not
until
fairly
recently
that
they
take
him
seriously
i
guess
we
really
be
a
flea
attack
an
elephant
and
the
elephant
do
not
respond
right
away
maybe
harry
right
maybe
they
do
not
take
us
seriously
until
much
later
but
i
always
believe
it
make
them
mad
our
go
in
on
them
like
that
in
hot
spring
just
a
few
year
later
around
and
we
definitely
get
the
message
that
kmart
with
store
thought
wal
mart
with
have
gotten
too
big
for
its
britches
all
of
a
sudden
they
take
a
direct
shot
right
into
our
backyard
by
opening
up
in
four
of
our
well
town
jefferson
city
and
poplar
bluff
missouri
and
fayetteville
and
rogers
arkansas
they
be
expand
like
that
all
over
the
country
at
the
time
and
all
the
regional
discounter
be
worried
in
we
have
a
session
of
our
discounter
trade
group
in
phoenix
and
a
lot
of
guy
be
talk
about
way
to
avoid
compete
with
kmart
directly
i
get
a
little
mad
and
told
everybody
they
ought
to
stand
up
and
fight
them
i
make
it
clear
we
plan
to
herb
fisher
founder
chairman
and
ceo
jamesway
corporation
kmart
be
opening
so
many
store
it
be
regard
as
the
genghis
khan
of
the
discounting
business
sam
have
always
be
clear
about
his
attitude
meet
them
head
on
competition
will
make
us
a
well
company
he
be
that
way
with
everyone
personally
he
be
such
a
fine
unassuming
quiet
gentleman
but
he
be
always
pick
your
brain
and
he
always
have
a
notebook
or
that
tape
recorder
he
will
learn
everything
you
know
but
he
share
his
information
freely
with
you
in
return
now
of
course
he
be
a
competitor
to
james
way
but
he
would
not
ever
apologize
for
that
he
think
it
make
us
a
well
company
and
he
be
right
something
else
happen
in
late
which
really
help
us
gear
up
for
competition
a
research
group
set
up
by
a
bunch
of
us
regional
discounter
who
at
the
time
do
not
compete
in
each
other
territory
have
its
first
meeting
here
in
bentonville
guy
like
herb
fisher
of
jamesway
and
herb
gillman
of
ames
and
dale
worman
of
fred
meyer
all
come
down
here
and
go
through
our
store
to
give
us
their
opinion
of
how
they
thought
we
be
do
and
man
what
they
have
to
say
really
shock
us
nick
white
executive
vice
president
wal
mart
bill
field
be
run
the
rogers
store
dean
sander
be
run
siloam
spring
and
i
be
run
springdale
all
close
to
bentonville
so
we
be
all
on
the
tour
these
guy
the
president
of
all
these
company
they
just
ripped
our
store
apart
tell
us
how
poorly
we
do
everything
the
signing
be
not
worth
a
damn
you
have
get
your
price
too
high
on
this
this
stuff
be
not
even
price
you
have
get
too
much
of
this
and
not
enough
of
that
i
mean
it
be
really
critical
that
be
really
a
turn
point
in
our
business
we
listen
to
everything
they
have
to
say
and
make
huge
adjustment
base
on
those
critique
it
help
us
gear
up
for
any
competition
especially
kmart
whose
attack
on
us
be
probably
the
best
single
external
event
in
wal
mart
history
we
pull
ourselves
together
and
design
a
big
plan
a
promotional
program
and
a
people
program
and
a
merchandising
program
for
how
we
be
go
to
react
since
our
run
on
kmart
in
hot
spring
have
turn
out
well
we
be
confident
we
could
compete
thomas
jefferson
kmart
really
take
us
on
in
about
and
i
remember
little
rock
particularly
they
take
us
on
there
in
north
little
rock
where
store
number
have
be
one
of
our
well
store
they
get
aggressive
and
we
fought
back
we
told
our
manager
there
no
matter
what
do
not
let
them
undersell
you
at
all
on
anything
i
remember
he
call
me
one
saturday
night
and
say
you
know
we
have
crest
toothpaste
down
to
six
cent
a
tube
now
and
i
say
well
just
keep
it
there
and
see
what
they
do
they
do
not
low
it
any
more
than
that
and
we
both
just
kept
it
at
six
cent
finally
they
back
off
i
always
thought
they
learn
something
about
us
at
that
store
that
we
do
not
bend
easy
because
they
never
come
at
us
with
that
degree
of
price
cut
anywhere
else
we
get
so
much
well
so
quickly
it
be
hard
to
believe
we
totally
stood
kmart
off
in
those
small
town
of
ours
almost
from
the
begin
they
be
not
very
successful
at
take
our
customer
away
in
jeff
city
and
poplar
bluff
once
kmart
arrive
we
work
even
harder
at
please
our
customer
and
they
stayed
loyal
this
give
us
a
great
surge
of
confidence
in
ourselves
but
at
the
time
remember
our
sale
be
about
percent
of
kmart
and
we
have
recently
suffer
that
exodus
of
executive
follow
the
ron
mayer
departure
so
we
be
have
a
heck
of
a
time
convincing
wall
street
to
stick
with
us
a
lot
of
people
do
not
think
we
could
stand
up
to
real
competition
one
analyst
margo
alexander
of
mitchell
hutchins
inc
really
worried
about
the
exodus
in
her
report
on
wal
mart
she
wonder
if
it
would
not
discourage
other
executive
from
come
on
board
she
say
they
might
see
an
inevitable
conflict
with
the
entrepreneur
who
will
never
be
satisfied
with
another
person
run
his
company
in
other
word
me
she
also
question
whether
i
have
retire
once
be
as
commit
to
run
the
business
as
i
have
be
previously
here
be
some
of
what
she
write
about
us
in
january
of
one
of
the
key
element
in
wal
mart
success
have
be
the
lack
of
competition
in
its
small
rural
market
it
be
clearly
easy
to
operate
in
this
kind
of
situation
than
in
a
competitive
one
pricing
need
not
be
so
sharp
and
the
right
merchandise
be
less
critical
simply
because
customer
have
no
alternative
although
wal
mart
say
its
store
compete
effectively
against
kmart
the
company
will
avoid
a
kmart
if
possible
while
we
do
not
expect
kresge
to
stage
any
massive
invasion
of
wal
mart
exist
territory
kresge
could
logically
act
to
contain
wal
mart
geographical
expansion
assume
some
containment
policy
on
kresge
part
wal
mart
could
run
into
serious
problem
in
the
next
few
year
we
would
very
much
like
to
recommend
purchase
of
the
stock
unfortunately
however
the
future
of
the
company
appear
uncertain
and
we
think
that
wal
mart
be
one
of
those
threshold
company
that
run
the
risk
of
stumble
report
like
that
one
do
not
help
us
much
but
the
truth
be
that
her
analysis
of
the
situation
be
not
necessarily
as
wrong
as
it
look
today
all
those
thing
could
have
come
true
she
miss
a
few
key
point
though
her
big
mistake
be
the
uncertainty
she
felt
about
the
management
team
that
follow
ron
mayer
as
i
say
earlier
have
david
glass
and
jack
shewmaker
both
on
board
in
senior
position
give
us
about
as
much
talent
under
one
roof
as
any
one
retailer
could
ever
hope
to
have
in
recent
year
i
have
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
the
fact
that
our
fast
expansion
the
great
growth
period
in
the
history
of
retail
actually
come
after
everybody
thought
our
goose
be
cooked
and
ready
to
be
eat
by
the
kmart
folk
from
detroit
another
point
miss
by
margo
alexander
and
others
be
that
a
very
fortunate
thing
happen
to
us
on
the
competitive
front
kmart
be
develop
its
own
problem
toward
the
end
of
they
have
purchase
more
than
two
hundred
store
location
left
over
from
the
defunct
grant
chain
and
they
have
their
hand
full
try
to
make
that
work
not
only
that
they
seem
to
have
a
management
philosophy
at
the
time
of
avoid
all
change
something
that
never
work
in
this
business
i
be
sure
that
worry
about
wal
mart
fell
way
down
on
their
priority
list
and
i
occasionally
think
back
to
how
lucky
we
be
not
to
have
have
to
face
harry
cunningham
or
kmart
current
management
team
during
that
period
regardless
of
what
be
go
on
at
kmart
the
new
team
we
have
in
place
in
bentonville
by
the
late
seventy
have
us
well
position
for
the
next
decade
of
growth
it
be
around
this
same
time
that
many
of
the
high
fly
promoter
in
the
discounting
business
begin
to
struggle
for
their
life
the
national
economy
weaken
in
the
mid
seventy
and
the
intense
competition
among
the
real
merchant
begin
to
drive
the
fast
buck
type
out
of
the
business
the
more
efficient
kmart
target
wal
mart
and
some
of
the
regionals
become
and
the
more
we
bumped
into
each
other
in
competitive
situation
the
more
we
be
able
to
low
price
the
percentage
of
gross
margin
in
this
industry
really
the
markup
on
merchandise
have
drop
steadily
from
around
percent
in
the
early
sixty
to
only
percent
today
almost
all
of
that
represent
increase
value
and
saving
to
the
customer
who
shop
discount
store
so
the
guy
who
be
not
run
efficient
operation
who
have
take
on
lot
of
debt
and
be
living
high
and
not
take
care
of
their
associate
who
be
not
scramble
around
to
get
the
best
deal
on
merchandise
and
passing
those
deal
on
to
their
customer
these
guy
get
into
trouble
when
we
saw
kmart
head
right
after
us
in
and
we
decide
we
could
pick
up
some
speed
in
our
expansion
effort
by
acquire
some
struggle
discounter
because
wal
mart
have
always
be
such
a
homegrown
operation
this
whole
period
spark
a
lot
of
philosophical
debate
around
our
office
and
frankly
i
change
side
so
often
that
i
drove
everybody
involve
pretty
crazy
i
do
not
have
many
problem
at
all
with
our
first
real
acquisition
which
come
in
my
brother
bud
and
david
glass
negotiate
a
deal
to
buy
a
small
chain
call
mohr
value
discount
store
up
in
illinois
their
store
have
be
average
million
to
million
a
year
per
store
and
it
seem
like
a
good
way
to
put
a
beachhead
into
some
new
territory
we
close
five
store
and
convert
the
remain
sixteen
to
wal
mart
and
it
be
not
much
of
a
shock
to
our
system
it
sure
do
not
slow
us
down
any
because
two
year
later
in
with
about
store
on
the
street
we
hit
a
billion
dollar
in
sale
for
the
first
time
of
all
the
milestone
we
ever
reach
that
one
probably
impressed
me
the
most
i
have
to
admit
i
be
amaze
that
wal
mart
have
turn
into
a
billion
dollar
company
but
i
could
not
see
any
logic
to
stop
there
and
right
about
then
another
acquisition
opportunity
come
our
way
this
one
be
a
good
bit
more
disruptive
but
it
help
us
make
a
geographic
leap
that
be
very
important
to
our
expansion
a
lot
of
people
back
east
who
do
not
know
much
about
wal
mart
still
think
of
us
today
as
a
southern
discount
operator
maybe
it
be
because
we
be
in
arkansas
which
most
people
think
of
as
a
southern
state
even
though
where
we
be
be
really
more
midwestern
or
maybe
it
be
because
of
our
downhome
image
but
the
truth
be
that
until
we
have
almost
no
store
east
of
the
mississippi
we
be
big
in
arkansas
louisiana
mississippi
and
texas
but
have
nothing
in
tennessee
alabama
georgia
or
the
carolina
we
be
not
much
of
a
competitor
in
the
south
at
all
on
the
other
hand
kuhn
big
k
store
have
become
a
good
size
player
in
the
south
base
in
nashville
tennessee
kuhn
have
start
as
a
single
variety
store
back
sometime
before
jack
kuhn
and
his
brother
gu
have
convert
the
company
into
a
discounter
make
an
acquisition
or
two
and
grown
it
into
a
chain
of
store
concentrate
in
tennessee
but
also
do
business
in
kentucky
alabama
georgia
and
south
carolina
all
state
where
we
thought
we
could
do
well
we
be
a
good
bit
big
than
they
be
but
the
two
of
us
have
be
watch
each
other
pretty
closely
it
be
sort
of
like
the
old
variety
store
day
when
one
chain
like
tg
y
would
not
go
into
the
territory
of
another
chain
like
hested
we
knew
that
one
way
or
another
we
have
to
head
on
into
the
south
and
i
guess
we
stir
them
up
by
cross
the
mississippi
and
opening
a
store
in
jackson
tennessee
they
retaliate
by
opening
store
in
west
helena
and
blytheville
arkansas
the
truth
be
we
be
closing
in
on
kuhn
and
really
do
a
well
job
than
they
be
in
fact
they
be
begin
to
falter
they
have
take
on
some
debt
and
built
a
fancy
headquarters
building
and
they
be
show
some
loss
i
have
a
heck
of
a
time
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
i
want
to
get
into
that
territory
before
kmart
or
somebody
else
woke
up
and
stole
our
thunder
there
it
seem
like
a
great
competitive
move
to
make
but
we
would
never
bitten
off
anything
close
to
this
size
before
and
we
do
not
know
what
it
would
be
like
try
to
digest
it
we
go
round
and
round
on
it
we
be
on
again
off
again
for
probably
two
year
finally
the
executive
committee
sat
down
to
vote
on
it
one
morning
and
it
come
out
split
right
down
the
middle
fifty
fifty
it
be
just
as
well
because
it
give
me
the
opportunity
to
take
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
decision
the
whole
thing
have
be
really
cloudy
all
along
with
a
lot
of
argue
finally
i
vote
to
do
it
we
do
not
know
how
to
go
about
fold
kuhn
into
wal
mart
but
we
put
paul
carter
in
charge
and
he
commute
back
and
forth
between
nashville
and
bentonville
for
quite
a
while
paul
carter
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
wal
mart
it
be
one
of
the
few
time
we
ever
saw
the
chairman
use
his
prerogative
and
say
we
be
go
to
do
this
it
be
a
new
kind
of
proposition
for
wal
mart
at
first
we
thought
we
be
go
to
run
everything
from
nashville
as
a
separate
division
then
we
change
our
mind
and
decide
to
close
all
their
office
down
and
bring
everything
over
here
it
be
the
furthest
out
we
would
ever
be
geographically
and
look
back
i
guess
the
decision
to
run
it
from
here
have
a
big
influence
on
how
we
have
run
the
company
ever
since
with
all
the
regional
manager
base
in
bentonville
i
go
over
there
to
big
k
weigh
pound
and
come
back
at
it
be
a
struggle
for
all
of
us
involve
and
a
stretch
for
the
whole
company
but
i
be
not
sure
that
be
not
good
for
every
organization
at
some
point
jack
shewmaker
take
the
situation
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
implement
a
lot
about
communication
in
a
spread
out
situation
hard
as
it
be
the
big
k
thing
be
really
good
for
this
company
it
be
like
a
caterpillar
that
turn
into
a
butterfly
as
a
company
we
be
really
ready
to
fly
after
we
emerge
from
that
one
we
close
down
some
of
kuhn
money
lose
store
and
for
the
first
time
we
try
to
supply
our
store
use
an
outside
company
a
third
party
distributor
which
do
not
work
at
all
but
once
we
figure
out
how
to
handle
it
the
acquisition
put
us
in
a
great
position
for
growth
we
explode
from
that
point
on
almost
always
opening
new
store
a
year
and
more
than
in
some
year
i
think
the
kuhn
deal
give
us
a
new
confidence
that
we
could
conquer
anything
i
do
not
know
how
the
folk
around
our
executive
office
see
me
and
i
know
they
get
frustrate
with
the
way
i
make
everybody
go
back
and
forth
on
so
many
issue
that
come
up
but
i
see
myself
as
be
a
little
more
inclined
than
most
of
them
be
to
take
chance
on
something
like
the
kuhn
decision
i
try
to
play
a
what
if
game
with
the
number
but
it
be
generally
my
gut
that
make
the
final
decision
if
it
feel
right
i
tend
to
go
for
it
and
if
it
do
not
i
back
off
sometimes
of
course
that
lead
me
into
mistake
back
in
the
early
eighty
for
example
i
travel
all
over
the
world
look
at
global
competition
in
retailing
i
go
to
germany
france
italy
south
africa
great
britain
australia
and
south
america
and
saw
several
concept
which
interested
me
i
be
impressed
with
the
giant
carrefour
store
in
brazil
which
get
me
start
on
a
campaign
to
bring
home
a
concept
call
hypermart
giant
store
with
grocery
and
general
merchandise
under
one
roof
i
checked
them
out
in
europe
and
come
back
push
the
concept
hard
i
argue
that
everybody
except
the
u
s
be
successful
with
this
concept
and
we
should
get
in
on
the
ground
floor
with
it
i
be
certain
this
be
where
the
next
competitive
battlefield
would
be
eventually
we
open
two
hypermarts
in
the
dallas
fort
worth
area
one
in
topeka
and
one
in
kansa
city
by
now
we
have
gotten
enough
respect
in
the
business
so
that
kmart
jumped
right
in
behind
us
with
their
own
hypermart
concept
call
american
fare
our
hypermarts
be
not
disaster
but
they
be
disappointment
they
be
marginally
profitable
store
and
they
taught
us
what
our
next
step
should
be
in
combine
grocery
and
general
merchandising
a
small
concept
call
the
supercenter
but
i
be
mistaken
in
my
vision
of
the
potential
the
hypermart
held
in
this
country
we
conduct
other
similar
but
less
publicize
experiment
that
do
not
work
out
so
well
either
our
dot
discount
drug
concept
grow
to
twenty
five
store
before
we
decide
it
be
not
go
to
be
profitable
enough
and
we
try
one
home
improvement
center
call
save
mor
in
the
building
which
have
house
the
original
wal
mart
in
rogers
which
be
also
not
a
success
as
david
glass
say
about
me
once
i
decide
i
be
wrong
i
be
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
but
when
one
of
our
experiment
work
watch
out
take
sam
club
for
example
it
be
an
experiment
when
we
start
it
up
in
and
now
nine
year
later
it
be
a
billion
business
with
more
than
store
and
terrific
growth
potential
sam
be
big
store
in
warehouse
type
building
aim
at
small
business
owner
and
other
customer
who
buy
merchandise
in
bulk
a
membership
fee
entitles
a
customer
to
shop
at
sam
which
charge
wholesale
price
for
name
brand
often
high
end
merchandise
everything
from
tire
to
camera
to
watch
to
office
supply
to
cocktail
sausage
and
soft
drink
if
you
have
never
be
in
one
they
be
a
lot
of
fun
to
shop
and
the
people
who
work
there
be
a
little
crazy
like
the
old
day
at
wal
mart
they
be
liable
to
do
anything
on
a
moment
notice
to
move
the
merchandise
just
like
discounting
i
be
sorry
to
say
we
ca
not
take
any
of
the
credit
for
invent
the
wholesale
club
concept
put
yourself
in
our
position
for
a
moment
though
and
you
can
see
why
we
have
to
steal
the
idea
from
those
who
do
roll
it
out
it
be
the
early
eighty
and
we
would
be
in
the
discount
business
for
around
twenty
year
only
the
efficient
operator
be
still
in
business
because
price
and
margin
have
be
fall
steadily
the
whole
time
suddenly
we
notice
a
whole
new
class
of
sub
discounter
undercut
our
price
wholesaler
with
very
low
overhead
who
be
sell
at
margin
way
below
the
percent
in
the
discount
business
to
percent
since
low
price
every
day
have
brought
us
this
far
we
have
to
explore
the
business
especially
since
we
knew
that
sol
price
one
of
the
original
discount
pioneer
be
behind
this
idea
he
have
start
his
price
club
store
in
so
one
day
in
i
go
to
see
sol
in
san
diego
i
have
met
him
earlier
when
my
son
rob
and
i
call
on
him
this
time
though
helen
and
i
be
out
on
the
west
coast
already
for
a
meeting
of
the
mass
merchandiser
so
we
drop
down
to
have
dinner
with
sol
and
his
wife
helen
at
lubock
and
i
admit
it
i
do
not
tell
him
at
the
time
that
i
be
go
to
copy
his
program
but
that
be
what
i
do
i
come
home
and
go
over
to
oklahoma
city
where
we
rent
an
old
building
for
about
ninety
cent
a
square
foot
or
maybe
even
seventy
five
cent
we
remodel
it
and
to
manage
it
put
together
a
pickup
crew
of
maverick
who
be
sort
of
underappreciated
at
wal
mart
we
have
two
or
three
buyer
we
whip
up
a
program
and
a
design
and
put
the
whole
thing
in
motion
we
open
our
first
club
in
it
have
that
same
feel
of
chaos
and
excitement
as
the
early
day
at
wal
mart
and
we
go
out
of
our
way
from
the
very
begin
to
separate
the
sam
club
culture
from
the
wal
mart
culture
one
of
the
guy
i
picked
be
rob
voss
he
be
not
really
look
on
as
a
top
management
talent
at
wal
mart
because
he
be
always
swim
against
the
current
more
than
he
be
go
with
it
he
be
a
little
bit
of
an
agitator
rob
voss
first
general
merchandise
manager
sam
club
i
told
sam
up
front
that
he
have
a
lot
of
ego
around
this
company
and
that
they
need
to
understand
we
be
go
to
be
do
our
own
merchandising
so
he
get
up
at
a
saturday
morning
meeting
and
told
everybody
this
be
a
direct
quote
the
sam
club
operation
will
be
do
their
own
merchandising
if
any
of
you
buyer
out
here
with
wal
mart
take
exception
to
that
and
feel
that
because
you
be
the
buyer
of
a
category
you
should
be
buying
it
for
the
entire
company
i
suggest
you
come
and
visit
with
me
in
my
office
on
a
one
on
one
basis
and
then
i
will
explain
it
to
you
in
a
little
more
detail
from
that
day
on
we
never
have
a
problem
we
quickly
go
on
to
open
sam
in
kansa
city
and
dallas
and
then
two
unit
in
houston
it
be
a
lot
like
wal
mart
once
we
have
those
five
unit
up
and
go
i
knew
we
could
run
with
it
and
we
do
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
guess
it
be
almost
what
you
would
call
a
second
childhood
for
me
a
second
challenge
anyway
i
have
a
chance
to
build
a
company
all
over
again
and
i
try
to
be
as
hand
on
as
i
could
although
david
glass
be
heavily
involve
with
sam
from
early
on
too
ron
loveless
retire
senior
vice
president
wal
mart
i
come
over
from
wal
mart
to
help
set
up
sam
since
we
be
pattern
after
price
club
sometimes
we
copy
them
without
exactly
know
what
we
be
do
we
be
bring
a
west
coast
idea
to
the
midwest
and
we
do
not
know
how
it
would
be
receive
i
remember
one
idea
that
do
not
transfer
too
well
price
club
have
a
huge
stack
of
wine
in
the
front
of
its
store
we
bought
the
same
amount
for
our
store
in
the
midwest
and
we
learn
the
hard
way
that
midwesterners
be
not
exactly
wine
drinker
tom
coughlin
senior
vice
president
sam
club
this
business
be
fun
it
really
be
it
be
so
basic
so
straightforward
we
do
no
advertising
but
our
whole
business
be
base
on
sell
the
concept
we
sell
small
business
operator
on
the
idea
that
for
a
year
they
can
have
a
just
in
time
warehouse
with
all
the
same
price
advantage
for
good
that
large
company
get
and
just
like
wal
mart
our
customer
get
to
know
and
love
our
culture
they
know
there
be
no
frill
whatsoever
in
those
warehouse
they
know
our
management
people
be
likely
to
be
the
one
to
grab
the
forklift
and
pull
the
good
down
for
them
and
they
come
to
expect
it
and
like
it
the
competition
in
the
club
business
can
get
pretty
spirit
sometimes
once
i
be
in
the
big
price
club
on
marino
avenue
in
san
diego
and
i
have
my
little
tape
recorder
with
me
like
i
always
do
and
i
be
make
note
to
myself
about
price
and
merchandising
idea
this
guy
a
big
guy
come
up
to
me
and
say
i
be
sorry
but
i
will
have
to
take
your
tape
recorder
and
erase
the
material
you
have
get
on
it
we
have
a
policy
against
people
use
them
in
the
store
well
we
have
the
same
policy
and
i
knew
i
be
caught
so
i
say
i
respect
that
but
i
have
get
thing
on
here
from
other
store
that
i
do
not
want
to
lose
so
let
me
write
a
note
to
robert
price
that
be
sol
son
so
i
write
robert
your
guy
be
just
too
good
i
be
try
to
get
some
information
on
this
recorder
about
some
of
the
item
you
be
carry
and
some
of
my
impression
of
your
store
and
he
caught
me
so
here
be
the
tape
if
you
want
to
listen
to
it
you
certainly
have
that
privilege
but
i
have
some
other
material
on
here
i
would
like
very
much
to
have
back
so
in
about
four
day
i
get
a
nice
note
back
from
robert
with
the
tape
and
none
of
it
have
be
blur
or
scratch
out
he
probably
treat
me
well
than
i
deserve
the
sam
launch
reflect
another
part
of
my
management
style
that
applies
not
only
to
the
competition
but
to
our
own
people
as
well
i
like
to
keep
everybody
guess
i
do
not
want
our
competitor
get
too
comfortable
with
feel
like
they
can
predict
what
we
be
go
to
do
and
i
do
not
want
our
own
executive
feel
that
way
either
it
be
part
of
my
strong
feel
for
the
necessity
of
constant
change
for
keep
people
a
little
off
balance
a
lot
of
folk
in
my
position
would
have
be
perfectly
content
with
the
situation
as
it
stood
in
our
wal
mart
be
earn
almost
million
a
year
on
sale
of
more
than
billion
we
be
still
grow
like
wildfire
and
we
be
underway
with
sam
but
i
felt
like
we
have
to
make
a
change
so
i
call
in
jack
shewmaker
by
now
our
president
and
chief
operating
officer
and
ask
him
if
he
would
mind
swap
job
with
david
glass
our
chief
financial
officer
not
your
everyday
request
from
the
chairman
in
most
company
i
guess
i
value
the
talent
of
both
of
these
guy
enormously
but
i
have
my
own
reason
for
want
to
see
how
the
switch
might
work
out
jack
be
so
smart
and
aggressive
and
sure
of
himself
that
sometimes
he
could
be
a
little
rough
on
folk
and
i
want
to
see
how
somebody
with
david
smoother
manner
would
handle
the
job
jack
say
he
already
knew
he
do
not
want
to
stay
at
wal
mart
until
he
be
an
old
man
so
after
some
discussion
we
agree
on
the
switch
david
take
the
president
job
and
jack
stayed
on
for
three
more
year
as
chief
financial
officer
and
he
do
a
great
job
today
he
do
international
consult
work
and
he
remains
a
valuable
wal
mart
board
member
david
of
course
turn
into
a
fantastic
president
and
about
five
year
ago
i
relinquish
my
ceo
title
to
him
at
that
time
jack
retire
as
well
as
all
that
work
out
for
everyone
and
it
really
do
i
wo
not
pretend
there
be
not
tension
surround
that
period
in
our
history
this
be
a
highly
competitive
business
and
an
even
more
competitive
company
it
naturally
attracts
a
lot
of
ambitious
people
sometimes
with
ego
to
match
ever
since
my
peewee
football
day
i
have
believe
almost
any
kind
of
competition
be
great
i
expect
our
folk
to
compete
with
one
another
and
as
i
have
say
what
i
hate
be
to
see
a
rivalry
become
a
personal
thing
where
the
folk
do
not
support
one
another
competition
be
actually
the
reason
i
love
retailing
so
much
the
wal
mart
story
be
just
another
chapter
in
that
history
of
competition
a
great
chapter
mind
you
but
it
be
all
part
of
the
evolution
of
the
industry
there
be
always
a
challenger
come
along
there
may
be
one
on
the
street
right
now
formulate
a
plan
to
get
to
the
top
to
stay
ahead
of
those
challenger
we
have
to
keep
change
and
look
back
over
our
shoulder
and
planning
ahead
that
be
one
reason
we
bought
the
mclane
company
a
few
year
ago
it
be
a
big
distributor
to
grocery
store
and
it
should
be
a
great
base
for
us
to
push
on
into
that
market
where
we
feel
customer
be
ready
for
our
way
of
do
business
right
now
i
see
a
lot
of
new
challenger
come
from
offshore
with
some
very
sophisticated
program
some
of
the
emerge
competitor
in
this
country
who
have
come
from
holland
germany
and
france
bear
close
watch
and
it
wo
not
be
long
before
we
have
a
wave
of
japanese
retail
concept
arrive
i
do
not
know
if
wal
mart
can
truly
maintain
our
leadership
position
by
just
stay
in
this
country
i
think
we
be
go
to
have
to
become
a
more
international
company
in
the
not
too
distant
future
we
have
create
an
international
division
in
the
company
and
we
have
a
joint
venture
with
a
mexican
company
call
cifra
for
the
development
of
club
aurrera
a
wholesale
club
concept
we
have
open
two
with
plan
for
more
soon
absorb
people
from
other
culture
quickly
and
smoothly
into
the
company
will
present
a
real
challenge
to
wal
mart
in
the
near
future
but
our
folk
be
up
to
it
on
the
domestic
front
competition
in
the
discount
business
have
improve
tremendously
in
the
last
few
year
our
competitor
be
do
a
well
job
of
serve
their
customer
of
get
them
through
the
checkout
line
they
be
run
cleaner
store
with
well
merchandise
presentation
they
be
make
our
job
a
lot
harder
but
so
far
none
of
our
competitor
have
yet
be
able
to
operate
on
the
volume
that
we
do
as
efficiently
as
we
do
they
have
not
be
able
to
get
their
expense
structure
as
low
as
ours
and
they
have
not
be
able
to
get
their
associate
to
do
all
those
extra
thing
for
their
customer
that
ours
do
routinely
greet
them
smile
at
them
help
them
thank
them
and
they
have
not
be
able
to
move
their
merchandise
as
efficiently
or
keep
it
in
stock
as
efficiently
as
we
do
if
anyone
be
ever
able
to
top
us
in
any
of
those
area
we
will
have
real
concern
at
this
point
no
one
have
be
able
to
do
it

expand
the
circle
distribution
and
transportation
have
be
so
successful
at
wal
mart
because
senior
management
view
this
part
of
the
company
as
a
competitive
advantage
not
as
some
afterthought
or
necessary
evil
and
they
support
it
with
capital
investment
a
lot
of
company
do
not
want
to
spend
any
money
on
distribution
unless
they
have
to
ours
spends
because
we
continually
demonstrate
that
it
lower
our
cost
this
be
a
very
important
strategic
point
in
understand
wal
mart
joe
hardin
executive
vice
president
logistics
and
personnel
some
of
our
guy
around
here
find
it
amuse
that
i
get
so
much
credit
for
wal
mart
reputation
as
a
world
leader
in
retailing
and
distribution
technology
it
be
not
because
we
be
not
on
the
cut
edge
we
be
they
be
amuse
because
as
i
told
you
ever
since
i
go
to
that
ibm
school
in
i
have
put
up
a
pretty
good
fight
every
time
somebody
want
to
buy
some
new
system
for
this
that
or
the
other
i
want
them
to
think
hard
about
how
they
be
go
to
justify
the
expense
before
they
even
come
to
me
with
it
but
there
be
no
question
about
it
one
of
the
main
reason
we
have
be
able
to
roll
this
company
out
nationally
be
all
the
pressure
put
on
me
by
guy
like
david
glass
and
earlier
jack
shewmaker
and
ron
mayer
to
invest
so
heavily
in
technology
yes
i
argue
and
resist
but
i
eventually
sign
the
check
and
we
have
be
able
to
move
way
out
front
of
the
industry
in
both
communication
and
distribution
during
that
period
in
the
late
seventy
when
kmart
management
have
such
a
strong
resistance
to
any
kind
of
change
that
resistance
include
investment
in
system
at
the
same
time
our
fellow
be
just
absolutely
convince
that
computer
be
essential
to
manage
growth
and
keep
down
our
cost
structure
today
of
course
they
have
be
proven
so
right
that
they
look
like
genius
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
in
fact
that
the
efficiency
and
economy
of
scale
we
realize
from
our
distribution
system
give
us
one
of
our
great
competitive
advantage
many
people
have
contribute
over
the
year
but
david
glass
have
to
get
the
lion
share
of
the
credit
for
where
we
be
today
in
distribution
david
have
a
vision
for
automate
distribution
center
link
by
computer
both
to
our
store
and
to
our
supplier
and
he
set
about
building
such
a
system
begin
in
at
searcy
arkansas
david
glass
searcy
probably
be
built
about
two
year
later
than
we
need
it
so
there
be
a
lot
of
pressure
on
us
to
get
it
up
and
run
the
big
knock
on
wal
mart
be
that
we
be
not
go
to
be
able
to
expand
much
beyond
the
mile
ring
around
our
distribution
center
in
bentonville
because
of
that
logistical
problem
our
disbeliever
say
we
would
always
be
a
medium
size
regional
retailer
confine
to
this
area
i
push
hard
for
searcy
as
the
solution
it
be
a
real
ambitious
plan
our
first
remote
mechanize
distribution
center
unfortunately
we
need
it
so
badly
that
we
have
to
rush
it
into
service
and
the
crunch
turn
it
into
a
disaster
my
disaster
it
be
as
bad
as
sam
opening
at
harrison
only
more
serious
we
be
shipping
freight
out
of
there
before
we
have
a
roof
on
the
building
and
nothing
not
even
the
toilet
work
like
it
be
suppose
to
we
have
guy
like
glenn
habern
our
data
processing
manager
and
paul
carter
down
there
drive
forklift
until
habern
tore
down
a
rack
and
spill
listerine
all
over
the
place
work
condition
be
terrible
and
the
next
thing
you
know
the
union
be
down
there
organize
it
be
such
a
nightmare
that
sam
begin
to
question
the
whole
idea
of
mechanize
distribution
he
really
be
not
sure
it
work
at
all
fortunately
he
hire
don
soderquist
from
ben
franklin
around
that
time
and
don
come
in
as
a
big
supporter
of
what
we
be
try
to
do
he
believe
in
mechanize
distribution
all
the
way
and
he
eventually
take
over
distribution
from
me
in
he
go
on
to
do
a
great
job
expand
it
help
introduce
a
lot
of
innovation
include
a
badly
need
new
inventory
management
system
fortunately
we
turn
searcy
around
and
make
it
work
because
it
save
our
neck
after
we
take
on
all
those
kuhn
store
we
have
to
figure
out
how
to
supply
them
and
our
arrangement
with
a
third
party
distributor
turn
into
a
nightmare
so
we
built
an
addition
at
searcy
to
service
them
and
it
solve
the
problem
searcy
which
be
one
of
our
best
perform
distribution
center
today
really
be
the
key
to
our
whole
distribution
system
after
we
prove
it
would
work
we
be
able
to
duplicate
the
model
anywhere
and
that
be
what
we
have
do
i
think
it
be
fair
to
say
that
our
distribution
system
today
be
the
envy
certainly
of
everyone
in
our
industry
and
in
a
lot
of
others
as
well
we
now
have
twenty
of
these
center
place
strategically
in
our
trade
area
around
the
country
still
mostly
within
a
day
drive
or
about
mile
of
the
store
they
serve
combine
they
account
for
more
than
million
square
foot
of
distribution
space
we
stock
over
item
in
our
store
and
our
warehouse
directly
replenish
almost
percent
of
their
inventory
compare
to
only
about
to
percent
for
our
competition
as
a
result
the
gap
from
the
time
our
in
store
merchant
place
their
computer
order
until
they
receive
replenishment
average
only
about
two
day
that
probably
compare
to
five
or
more
day
for
a
lot
of
our
competitor
which
do
not
ship
as
much
merchandise
through
their
own
network
the
time
saving
and
flexibility
be
great
but
the
cost
saving
alone
would
make
the
investment
worthwhile
our
cost
run
less
than
percent
to
ship
good
to
our
store
while
it
probably
cost
our
competitor
between
to
percent
to
get
those
same
good
to
their
store
the
math
be
pretty
simple
if
we
both
sell
the
same
good
for
the
same
price
at
retail
we
will
earn
percent
more
profit
than
they
will
right
there
joe
hardin
when
you
own
and
manage
your
distribution
and
logistics
channel
you
have
a
great
competitive
advantage
over
company
that
rely
on
third
party
supplier
it
automatically
shortens
your
lead
time
but
also
you
can
constantly
look
for
way
to
improve
your
operation
and
try
to
make
it
more
efficient
you
never
have
to
rely
on
what
go
on
in
somebody
else
shop
in
our
case
we
generally
know
where
thing
be
in
relationship
to
when
we
want
them
to
arrive
so
we
can
schedule
and
plan
to
move
good
into
the
store
at
the
right
time
that
maximizes
our
in
stock
position
which
be
vital
you
ca
not
generate
sale
unless
you
have
the
product
there
when
the
customer
want
it
not
only
do
we
stock
more
of
our
merchandise
in
our
own
distribution
center
we
also
rely
on
our
own
private
truck
fleet
to
a
much
great
degree
than
our
competitor
do
our
private
fleet
be
one
of
the
nation
large
maybe
the
large
last
year
david
ask
lee
scott
our
vice
president
who
oversees
transportation
to
try
and
locate
every
truck
and
trailer
in
the
fleet
on
a
single
day
just
to
show
that
we
could
do
it
of
course
he
do
and
at
last
count
lee
say
we
have
more
than
two
thousand
over
the
road
tractor
and
more
than
eleven
thousand
trailer
unlike
both
kmart
and
target
which
contract
out
with
third
party
to
deliver
a
lot
of
freight
from
their
distribution
center
we
have
always
felt
that
we
need
our
own
fleet
to
have
the
kind
of
flexibility
we
want
that
ability
to
respond
above
and
beyond
what
we
could
ask
some
outsider
to
do
for
us
we
need
driver
who
be
part
of
our
team
driver
who
be
as
dedicate
to
serve
our
customer
as
the
associate
in
the
store
and
man
do
we
ever
have
them
when
you
be
out
on
the
highway
and
you
pas
by
a
wal
mart
truck
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
that
the
guy
behind
the
wheel
be
a
true
professional
he
be
not
just
drive
a
truck
he
be
dedicate
to
service
those
store
and
he
know
he
be
an
ambassador
of
wal
mart
and
everything
we
stand
for
out
on
the
road
i
will
just
say
it
we
have
the
best
damn
truck
driver
in
america
and
their
loyalty
and
their
can
do
attitude
have
make
a
huge
difference
to
this
company
lee
scott
our
driver
really
be
extremely
loyal
to
their
mission
which
be
to
serve
the
store
they
report
back
to
wal
mart
continually
on
thing
like
merchandise
thrown
out
behind
the
store
that
look
like
it
be
good
attitude
and
morale
problem
in
the
store
for
a
long
long
time
sam
would
show
up
regularly
in
the
driver
break
room
at
a
m
with
a
bunch
of
doughnut
and
just
sit
there
for
a
couple
of
hour
talk
to
them
he
grill
them
what
be
you
see
at
the
store
have
you
be
to
that
store
lately
how
do
the
people
act
there
be
it
get
well
it
make
sense
the
driver
see
more
store
every
week
than
anybody
else
in
this
company
and
i
think
what
sam
like
about
them
be
that
they
be
not
like
a
lot
of
manager
they
do
not
care
who
you
be
they
will
tell
you
what
they
really
think
of
course
the
only
thing
that
make
the
whole
distribution
system
work
so
well
be
the
dedication
of
the
people
all
across
it
the
technology
and
hardware
be
just
tool
the
people
in
the
system
believe
just
as
firmly
as
the
associate
in
the
store
that
their
primary
job
be
to
take
care
of
the
customer
except
in
their
case
the
customer
be
the
wal
mart
store
or
sam
club
they
be
supply
with
that
idea
at
the
root
of
everything
we
have
developed
a
unique
ability
to
customize
what
we
do
to
meet
the
need
of
our
store
until
recently
for
example
we
brag
that
we
be
make
delivery
every
day
to
percent
of
our
store
then
we
discover
that
be
not
necessarily
the
best
thing
for
all
of
our
store
particularly
the
small
one
so
now
we
have
go
into
a
customize
delivery
program
in
which
store
can
pick
one
of
four
different
delivery
plan
every
six
month
each
store
decides
which
plan
it
prefers
and
we
also
have
a
plan
call
accelerate
delivery
design
for
store
locate
within
a
certain
distance
of
a
distribution
center
a
store
in
that
plan
can
order
merchandise
on
monday
night
and
get
it
on
tuesday
night
nobody
else
in
the
business
can
deliver
like
that
on
any
kind
of
widespread
basis
when
all
this
come
together
at
one
of
our
distribution
center
it
be
really
a
sight
to
behold
you
really
have
to
see
one
of
these
place
in
action
to
appreciate
them
and
sometimes
i
can
hardly
believe
them
myself
but
i
will
try
to
describe
the
activity
at
one
start
with
a
building
of
around
million
square
foot
which
be
about
as
much
floor
space
as
twenty
three
football
field
sit
out
somewhere
on
some
acre
fill
it
high
to
the
roof
with
every
kind
of
merchandise
you
can
imagine
from
toothpaste
to
tv
toilet
paper
to
toy
bicycle
to
barbecue
grill
everything
in
it
be
bar
cod
and
a
computer
track
the
location
and
movement
of
every
case
of
merchandise
while
it
be
store
and
when
it
be
ship
out
some
six
hundred
to
eight
hundred
associate
staff
the
place
which
run
around
the
clock
twenty
four
hour
a
day
on
one
side
of
the
building
be
a
shipping
dock
with
load
door
for
around
thirty
truck
at
a
time
usually
full
on
the
other
side
be
the
receive
dock
which
may
have
as
many
as
door
for
unload
merchandise
these
good
move
in
and
out
of
the
warehouse
on
some
mile
of
laser
guide
conveyor
belt
which
mean
that
the
laser
read
the
bar
code
on
the
case
and
then
direct
them
to
whatever
truck
be
fill
the
order
place
by
one
of
the
store
it
be
service
that
night
on
a
heavy
day
those
belt
might
handle
up
to
case
of
good
when
the
thing
be
run
full
speed
it
be
just
a
blur
of
box
and
crate
fly
down
those
belt
red
laser
flash
everywhere
direct
this
box
to
that
truck
or
that
box
to
this
truck
out
in
the
parking
lot
whole
pack
of
wal
mart
truck
rumble
in
and
out
all
day
i
get
tremendously
excite
go
out
to
these
center
talk
with
our
associate
and
drinking
coffee
with
them
and
the
truck
driver
it
be
amaze
to
me
how
many
idea
they
always
have
for
fine
tune
the
system
if
you
get
the
idea
that
i
be
awfully
proud
of
what
we
have
manage
to
do
in
distribution
you
be
right
to
get
the
whole
picture
though
it
be
important
to
realize
that
the
same
thing
be
happen
simultaneously
at
nineteen
other
almost
identical
distribution
center
every
day
not
only
that
for
us
to
continue
expand
the
way
we
do
we
have
to
constantly
plan
the
construction
and
staff
of
more
and
more
of
these
giant
mechanize
warehouse
and
that
be
no
small
task
for
joe
hardin
and
his
folk
we
will
probably
have
thirty
in
operation
in
just
the
next
few
year
they
be
already
on
the
draw
board
from
the
time
david
glass
come
on
board
in
he
be
be
push
me
to
invest
and
invest
and
invest
in
that
system
and
thank
goodness
he
manage
to
be
so
persuasive
at
the
same
time
he
and
jack
shewmaker
be
also
push
hard
for
heavy
investment
in
more
and
more
well
and
well
computer
system
so
that
we
could
track
sale
and
merchandise
and
inventory
across
the
company
especially
in
store
transaction
when
jack
become
our
president
and
chief
operating
officer
in
he
work
really
hard
at
get
me
to
invest
in
bar
cod
and
sku
item
control
which
be
a
computerize
stockkeeping
unit
inventory
system
jack
also
be
heavily
involve
in
the
creation
of
our
satellite
system
which
turn
out
to
be
another
one
of
our
tremendous
competitive
advantage
jack
shewmaker
glenn
habern
be
our
data
processing
manager
and
he
and
i
have
this
dream
of
an
interactive
communication
system
on
which
you
could
communicate
back
and
forth
between
all
the
store
and
the
distribution
center
and
the
general
office
glenn
come
up
with
the
idea
of
use
the
satellite
and
i
say
let
pursue
it
without
ask
anybody
so
we
get
it
to
the
point
where
we
be
ready
to
make
a
proposal
and
we
told
sam
he
just
listen
he
do
not
necessarily
discourage
me
but
he
do
not
encourage
me
either
sam
never
get
excite
about
system
the
technology
do
not
really
exist
to
do
this
for
a
retailer
in
the
early
eighty
but
we
get
together
with
the
macom
hughes
corporation
and
work
out
a
contract
and
eventually
we
commit
million
to
build
it
we
launch
it
in
and
i
mean
sam
like
to
kill
me
the
first
two
year
it
be
not
an
immediate
success
but
we
get
it
work
and
now
of
course
everybody
have
one
the
satellite
turn
out
to
be
absolutely
necessary
because
once
we
have
those
scanner
in
the
store
we
have
all
this
data
pour
into
bentonville
over
phone
line
those
line
have
a
limited
capacity
so
as
we
add
more
and
more
store
we
have
a
real
logjam
of
stuff
come
in
from
the
field
as
you
know
i
like
my
number
as
quickly
as
i
can
get
them
the
quicker
we
get
that
information
the
quicker
we
can
act
on
it
the
system
have
be
a
great
tool
for
us
and
our
technical
people
have
do
a
terrific
job
of
figure
out
how
to
use
it
to
our
best
advantage
jack
be
absolutely
right
about
me
and
system
though
i
rarely
get
excite
about
them
a
few
year
ago
we
built
this
huge
building
right
next
to
our
main
office
around
square
foot
just
to
house
the
computer
and
everyone
at
the
time
told
me
how
much
room
we
would
have
to
grow
i
mean
it
be
really
empty
in
there
just
two
or
three
year
ago
well
already
it
be
completely
full
of
computer
equipment
and
when
i
look
back
it
be
no
wonder
we
have
spent
almost
million
building
up
the
current
computer
and
satellite
system
we
have
i
be
told
it
be
the
large
civilian
data
base
of
its
kind
in
the
world
even
big
than
at
t
none
of
that
matter
to
me
what
i
like
about
it
be
the
kind
of
information
we
can
pull
out
of
it
on
a
moment
notice
all
those
number
for
one
thing
we
keep
a
sixty
five
week
roll
history
of
every
single
item
we
stock
in
wal
mart
or
sam
that
mean
i
can
pick
anything
say
a
little
combination
tv
vcr
like
i
use
here
in
my
office
and
tell
you
exactly
how
many
of
them
we
have
bought
over
the
last
year
and
a
quarter
and
exactly
how
many
of
them
we
have
sell
not
only
overall
but
in
any
or
every
region
every
district
every
store
it
make
it
tough
for
a
vendor
to
know
more
about
how
his
product
be
do
in
our
store
than
we
do
i
guess
we
have
always
know
that
information
give
you
a
certain
power
but
the
degree
to
which
we
can
retrieve
it
in
our
computer
really
do
give
us
the
power
of
competitive
advantage
i
can
walk
in
that
satellite
room
where
our
technician
sit
in
front
of
their
computer
screen
talk
on
the
phone
to
any
store
that
might
be
have
a
problem
with
the
system
and
just
look
over
their
shoulder
for
a
minute
or
two
will
tell
me
a
lot
about
how
a
particular
day
be
go
up
on
the
screen
i
can
see
the
total
of
the
day
bank
credit
card
sale
add
up
as
they
occur
i
can
see
how
many
steal
bank
card
we
have
retrieve
that
day
i
can
tell
if
our
seven
second
credit
card
approval
system
be
work
as
it
should
be
and
monitor
the
number
of
transaction
we
have
conduct
that
day
if
we
have
something
really
important
or
urgent
to
communicate
to
the
store
and
distribution
center
something
important
enough
to
warrant
a
personal
visit
i
or
any
other
wal
mart
executive
can
walk
back
to
our
tv
studio
and
get
on
that
satellite
transmission
and
get
it
right
out
there
and
as
i
told
you
earlier
i
can
go
in
every
saturday
morning
around
three
look
over
those
printout
and
know
precisely
what
kind
of
week
we
have
have
so
you
see
technology
and
distribution
be
every
bit
as
important
to
wal
mart
ability
to
grow
and
maintain
control
as
you
may
have
heard
or
read
over
the
year
but
when
you
see
all
those
satellite
dish
outside
our
building
or
hear
about
all
the
computer
inside
it
or
look
at
some
videotape
of
our
laser
guide
distribution
center
do
not
let
anybody
kid
you
without
the
right
manager
and
the
dedicate
associate
and
truck
driver
all
across
the
system
all
that
stuff
be
totally
worthless

think
small
well
now
sam
how
big
do
you
really
want
this
company
to
be
what
be
your
plan
ferold
arend
shortly
after
come
to
work
at
wal
mart
ferold
we
be
go
to
take
it
as
it
come
and
if
we
can
grow
with
our
own
money
we
will
maybe
add
a
store
or
two
sam
walton
not
long
ago
somebody
show
me
an
article
write
for
a
local
magazine
in
it
be
call
success
story
of
the
year
and
it
described
how
we
have
built
up
an
empire
of
nine
variety
store
then
it
quote
me
as
say
that
we
probably
would
not
grow
much
more
because
i
believe
in
personally
supervise
the
nine
store
group
and
i
thought
any
more
store
would
be
unwieldy
to
manage
without
additional
supervisor
so
what
the
heck
happen
how
do
we
ever
get
to
be
the
large
retailer
in
the
world
with
a
philosophy
like
that
i
really
believe
what
i
say
then
and
i
still
do
but
we
figure
out
a
way
to
grow
and
stay
profitable
and
there
be
no
logical
place
to
stop
the
way
i
approach
manage
the
business
i
always
try
to
maintain
a
sense
of
hand
on
personal
supervision
usually
by
fly
around
to
take
a
look
at
our
store
on
a
regular
basis
but
from
the
very
begin
even
on
my
paper
route
in
college
i
have
also
be
a
delegator
try
to
hire
the
best
possible
people
to
manage
our
store
that
be
be
the
case
since
back
in
newport
an
awful
lot
of
water
have
wash
over
the
dam
since
when
we
bought
that
little
front
street
store
in
newport
but
almost
every
single
thing
we
learn
every
basic
principle
we
apply
in
building
that
store
up
into
a
respectable
business
still
applies
to
our
company
today
it
be
hard
to
think
of
another
company
that
sustain
the
kind
of
growth
we
do
over
thirty
year
without
experience
any
major
financial
problem
or
dip
in
profitability
during
that
time
our
business
be
grow
at
annual
rate
of
anywhere
from
to
an
incredible
percent
in
some
year
along
the
way
we
always
have
lot
of
people
wait
for
us
to
stumble
and
fall
especially
wall
street
type
they
say
we
would
never
be
able
to
keep
do
thing
our
way
after
we
reach
billion
in
sale
but
we
do
and
kept
right
on
go
then
they
say
everything
would
fall
apart
at
billion
because
you
just
could
not
manage
a
company
that
big
with
our
little
down
home
management
philosophy
we
roar
past
that
and
then
hit
billion
and
billion
and
in
the
come
year
we
should
hit
around
billion
two
year
ago
we
earn
billion
in
profit
for
the
first
time
that
be
a
jump
from
only
million
just
ten
year
before
here
be
a
chart
that
completely
amazes
me
store
sale
million

store
sale
million
profit
million
store

billion

million

so
now
we
be
the
large
retailer
in
the
world
and
still
grow
like
a
weed
if
my
chart
do
not
paint
a
clear
enough
picture
for
you
of
how
large
the
company
be
here
be
some
other
way
to
think
about
wal
mart
size
every
week
nearly
million
people
shop
in
wal
mart
last
year
we
sell
enough
men
and
woman
underwear
and
sock
to
put
a
pair
on
every
person
in
america
with
some
to
spare
we
sell
million
men
and
boy
brief
million
panty
and
million
pair
of
sock
we
sell
one
quarter
of
all
the
fishing
line
purchase
in
the
u
s
some
mile
of
it
or
enough
to
go
around
the
earth
twenty
four
time
we
sell
million
sweatsuit
and
million
pair
of
jean
and
we
sell
almost
percent
of
all
the
telephone
bought
in
the
u
s
and
here
be
one
i
be
really
proud
of
in
one
week
last
year
we
sell
as
much
ol
roy
private
label
dog
food
as
we
do
in
all
of
with
sale
of
million
last
year
ol
roy
become
the
number
two
dog
food
in
america
and
remember
we
only
sell
it
in
wal
mart
another
one
procter
gamble
sell
more
product
to
wal
mart
than
it
do
to
the
whole
country
of
japan
i
could
go
on
and
on
but
you
get
the
idea
we
be
big
really
big
that
be
not
something
i
like
to
focus
on
i
always
want
to
be
the
best
retailer
in
the
world
not
necessarily
the
big
in
fact
as
i
say
in
that
article
thirty
something
year
ago
i
have
always
be
a
little
bit
afraid
that
big
might
get
in
the
way
of
do
a
good
job
of
course
be
this
big
have
some
real
advantage
until
we
reach
a
billion
dollar
a
lot
of
supplier
and
vendor
just
ignore
us
way
out
here
in
the
arkansas
outback
for
year
some
supplier
would
not
even
call
on
us
now
of
course
we
be
too
big
to
ignore
but
be
big
also
pose
danger
it
have
ruin
many
a
fine
company
include
some
giant
retailer
who
start
out
strong
and
get
bloat
or
out
of
touch
or
be
slow
to
react
to
the
need
of
their
customer
here
be
the
point
the
big
wal
mart
get
the
more
essential
it
be
that
we
think
small
because
that
be
exactly
how
we
have
become
a
huge
corporation
by
not
act
like
one
above
all
we
be
small
town
merchant
and
i
ca
not
tell
you
how
important
it
be
for
us
to
remember
when
we
puff
up
our
chest
and
brag
about
all
those
huge
sale
and
profit
that
they
be
all
make
one
day
at
a
time
one
store
at
a
time
mostly
by
the
hard
work
good
attitude
and
teamwork
of
all
those
hourly
associate
and
their
store
manager
as
well
as
by
all
those
folk
in
the
distribution
center
if
we
ever
get
carry
away
with
how
important
we
be
because
we
be
a
great
big
billion
chain
instead
of
one
store
in
blytheville
arkansas
or
mccomb
mississippi
or
oak
ridge
tennessee
then
you
probably
can
close
the
book
on
us
if
we
ever
forget
that
look
a
customer
in
the
eye
and
greet
him
or
her
and
ask
politely
if
we
can
be
of
help
be
just
as
important
in
every
wal
mart
today
as
it
be
in
that
little
ben
franklin
in
newport
then
we
just
ought
to
go
into
a
different
business
because
we
will
never
survive
in
this
one
bill
field
i
be
sure
that
our
whole
focus
on
think
small
all
relates
to
sam
run
that
store
in
newport
where
he
be
the
entrepreneur
and
he
be
out
there
involve
as
a
leader
of
the
community
he
see
that
entrepreneurial
element
as
be
so
important
and
something
he
never
want
us
to
lose
he
saw
the
big
change
in
ben
franklin
and
all
those
other
company
that
lose
it
because
they
get
too
big
and
distract
and
he
be
just
determine
it
wo
not
happen
here
for
us
think
small
be
a
way
of
life
almost
an
obsession
and
i
suspect
think
small
be
an
approach
that
almost
any
business
could
profit
from
the
big
you
be
the
more
urgently
you
probably
need
it
at
our
size
today
there
be
all
sort
of
pressure
to
regiment
and
standardize
and
operate
as
a
centrally
driven
chain
where
everything
be
decide
on
high
and
pass
down
to
the
store
in
a
system
like
that
there
be
absolutely
no
room
for
creativity
no
place
for
the
maverick
merchant
that
i
be
in
the
early
day
at
ben
franklin
no
call
for
the
entrepreneur
or
the
promoter
man
i
would
hate
to
work
at
a
place
like
that
and
i
worry
every
single
day
about
wal
mart
become
that
way
i
stay
on
these
guy
around
here
all
the
time
about
it
of
course
all
those
vendor
and
supplier
would
love
to
see
us
get
that
way
it
would
make
their
job
a
lot
simpler
for
sure
if
anybody
at
wal
mart
think
we
as
a
company
be
immune
to
big
disease
i
wish
they
would
just
pack
up
and
leave
right
now
because
it
be
always
something
we
will
have
to
worry
about
for
several
decade
now
we
have
work
hard
at
building
a
company
that
be
simple
and
streamline
and
take
its
direction
from
the
grass
root
it
be
a
pretty
tall
order
for
an
outfit
that
be
spread
out
all
over
the
country
as
fast
as
we
be
but
along
the
way
we
have
learn
some
practical
thing
about
think
small
and
developed
some
principle
that
have
have
a
big
effect
on
our
company
success
before
you
can
fully
understand
how
we
get
where
we
be
today
it
be
important
to
understand
these
principle
then
you
can
recognize
how
we
have
apply
them
all
along
the
way
in
the
building
of
the
company
see
how
we
have
do
some
of
these
thing
might
help
other
folk
out
there
who
face
the
same
challenge
of
grow
their
business
without
lose
touch
with
the
customer
there
be
nothing
at
all
profound
about
any
of
our
principle
in
fact
they
be
all
common
sense
and
most
of
them
can
be
found
in
any
number
of
book
or
article
on
management
theory
many
of
which
i
have
read
and
study
over
the
year
but
i
think
the
way
we
have
apply
them
at
wal
mart
have
be
just
a
little
different
here
be
six
of
the
more
important
way
we
at
wal
mart
try
to
think
small
think
one
store
at
a
time
that
sound
easy
enough
but
it
be
something
we
have
constantly
have
to
stay
on
top
of
because
our
sale
and
earnings
keep
go
up
do
not
mean
that
we
be
smarter
than
everyone
else
or
that
we
can
make
it
happen
because
we
be
so
big
what
it
mean
be
that
our
customer
be
support
us
if
they
stop
our
earnings
would
simply
disappear
and
we
would
all
be
out
look
for
new
job
so
we
know
what
we
have
to
do
keep
lower
our
price
keep
improve
our
service
and
keep
make
thing
well
for
the
folk
who
shop
in
our
store
that
be
not
something
we
can
simply
do
in
some
general
way
it
be
not
something
we
can
command
from
the
executive
office
because
we
want
it
to
happen
we
have
to
do
it
store
by
store
department
by
department
customer
by
customer
associate
by
associate
for
example
we
have
get
one
store
in
panama
city
florida
and
another
only
five
mile
away
in
panama
city
beach
but
actually
they
be
world
apart
when
it
come
to
their
merchandise
mix
and
their
customer
base
they
be
entirely
different
kind
of
store
one
be
built
for
tourist
go
to
the
beach
and
the
other
be
more
like
the
normal
wal
mart
built
for
folk
who
live
in
town
that
be
why
we
try
our
best
to
put
a
merchant
in
charge
of
each
store
and
to
develop
other
merchant
as
the
head
of
each
department
in
those
store
if
the
merchandise
mix
be
really
go
to
be
right
it
have
to
be
manage
by
the
merchandiser
there
on
the
scene
the
folk
who
actually
deal
face
to
face
with
the
customer
day
in
and
day
out
through
the
season
that
make
it
management
job
to
listen
to
those
merchandiser
out
in
the
store
we
have
these
buyer
here
in
bentonville
of
them
and
we
have
to
remind
them
all
the
time
that
their
real
job
be
to
support
the
merchant
in
the
store
otherwise
you
have
a
headquarters
driven
system
that
be
out
of
touch
with
the
customer
of
each
particular
store
and
you
end
up
with
a
bunch
of
unsold
workboots
overall
and
hunt
rifle
at
the
panama
city
beach
store
where
folk
be
beg
for
water
gun
and
fishing
rod
and
pail
and
shovel
and
at
the
panama
city
store
in
town
you
have
get
a
bunch
of
unsold
beach
gear
stack
up
gathering
dust
so
when
we
sit
down
at
our
saturday
morning
meeting
to
talk
about
our
business
we
like
to
spend
time
focus
on
a
single
store
and
how
that
store
be
do
against
a
single
competitor
in
that
particular
market
we
talk
about
what
that
store
be
do
right
and
we
look
at
what
it
be
do
wrong
david
glass
we
believe
that
we
have
to
talk
about
and
examine
this
company
in
minute
detail
i
do
not
know
any
other
large
retail
company
kmart
sears
penney
that
discus
their
sale
at
the
end
of
the
week
in
any
small
breakdown
than
by
region
we
talk
about
individual
store
which
mean
that
if
we
be
talk
about
the
store
in
dothan
alabama
or
harrisburg
illinois
everybody
here
be
expect
to
know
something
about
that
store
how
to
measure
its
performance
whether
a
percent
increase
be
good
or
bad
what
the
payroll
be
run
who
the
competitor
be
and
how
we
be
do
we
keep
the
company
orientation
small
by
zero
in
on
the
small
operating
unit
we
have
no
other
company
do
that
focus
on
a
single
store
can
accomplish
a
number
of
thing
first
of
course
it
enables
us
to
actually
improve
that
store
but
if
in
the
process
we
also
happen
to
learn
a
particular
way
in
which
that
panama
city
beach
wal
mart
be
outsmart
the
competition
on
say
beach
towel
then
we
can
quickly
get
that
information
out
to
all
our
other
beach
store
around
the
country
and
see
if
their
approach
work
everywhere
which
brings
us
to
the
next
principle
communicate
communicate
communicate
if
you
have
to
boil
down
the
wal
mart
system
to
one
single
idea
it
would
probably
be
communication
because
it
be
one
of
the
real
key
to
our
success
we
do
it
in
so
many
way
from
the
saturday
morning
meeting
to
the
very
simple
phone
call
to
our
satellite
system
the
necessity
for
good
communication
in
a
big
company
like
this
be
so
vital
it
ca
not
be
overstate
what
good
be
figure
out
a
well
way
to
sell
beach
towel
if
you
be
not
go
to
tell
everybody
in
your
company
about
it
if
the
folk
in
st
augustine
florida
do
not
get
the
word
on
what
work
over
in
panama
city
until
winter
they
have
miss
a
big
opportunity
and
if
our
buyer
back
in
bentonville
do
not
know
we
be
expect
to
double
our
sale
of
beach
towel
this
summer
the
store
wo
not
have
anything
to
sell
nowadays
i
see
management
article
about
information
share
as
a
new
source
of
power
in
corporation
we
have
be
do
this
from
the
day
when
we
only
have
a
handful
of
store
back
then
we
believe
in
show
a
store
manager
every
single
number
relate
to
his
store
and
eventually
we
begin
share
those
same
number
with
the
department
head
in
our
store
we
have
kept
do
it
as
we
have
grown
that
be
why
we
have
spent
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
on
computer
and
satellite
to
spread
all
the
little
detail
around
the
company
as
fast
as
possible
but
they
be
worth
the
cost
it
be
only
because
of
information
technology
that
our
store
manager
have
a
really
clear
sense
of
how
they
be
do
most
of
the
time
they
get
all
kind
of
information
transmit
to
them
over
the
satellite
on
an
amazingly
timely
basis
their
monthly
profit
and
loss
statement
up
to
the
minute
point
of
sale
data
that
tell
them
what
sell
in
their
own
store
and
a
lot
of
other
paper
they
probably
wish
we
would
not
send
them
i
be
not
go
to
pretend
we
be
perfect
at
this
we
do
have
our
share
of
miscommunication
like
that
time
the
moon
pie
be
ship
to
store
in
wisconsin
where
they
do
not
exactly
jump
off
the
shelf
and
sometimes
a
simple
attitude
be
as
valuable
as
all
the
technology
in
the
world
for
example
we
have
get
this
one
rule
i
hope
we
never
give
up
enforce
our
buyer
here
in
bentonville
be
require
to
return
call
from
the
store
first
before
they
return
the
call
of
vendor
or
anybody
else
and
they
be
require
to
get
back
to
the
store
by
sundown
of
the
day
they
get
the
call
obviously
we
be
too
doggoned
big
to
have
every
department
head
in
every
wal
mart
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
the
vendor
who
call
on
us
in
bentonville
so
we
try
to
think
up
way
to
get
at
a
similar
result
recently
we
have
start
seminar
for
our
department
manager
we
will
pick
a
department
like
sport
good
or
lawn
and
garden
then
we
will
pick
one
department
head
these
be
the
hourly
associate
who
actually
run
those
department
in
their
store
from
each
of
our
store
district
that
be
folk
right
now
we
will
bring
all
of
them
in
to
bentonville
to
talk
to
the
buyer
about
what
work
for
them
and
what
not
then
they
meet
with
the
vendor
and
explain
what
kind
of
complaint
we
be
get
about
their
product
or
what
work
well
together
all
these
folk
formulate
their
plan
for
the
come
season
and
then
the
department
head
go
back
to
their
district
and
share
what
they
have
learn
with
their
counterpart
in
neighbor
store
as
much
as
we
travel
to
our
store
and
bring
our
folk
in
to
bentonville
though
sometimes
i
have
the
feel
that
the
word
be
not
get
out
and
if
it
be
on
a
subject
i
feel
strongly
enough
about
i
be
not
above
get
in
front
of
one
of
our
tv
camera
here
and
go
out
by
satellite
to
all
our
associate
gather
in
front
of
their
tv
in
the
break
room
of
our
store
a
few
year
ago
i
have
an
idea
around
christmastime
that
be
just
burning
me
up
to
tell
people
about
so
i
go
on
the
camera
and
visit
with
everybody
about
how
our
sale
be
do
and
talk
a
little
about
my
hunt
and
let
them
know
that
i
hop
their
holiday
season
be
go
well
then
i
get
to
the
point
i
do
not
think
any
other
retail
company
in
the
world
could
do
what
i
be
go
to
propose
to
you
it
be
simple
it
wo
not
cost
us
anything
and
i
believe
it
would
just
work
magic
absolute
magic
on
our
customer
and
our
sale
would
escalate
and
i
think
we
would
just
shoot
past
our
kmart
friend
in
a
year
or
two
and
probably
sears
as
well
i
want
you
to
take
a
pledge
with
me
i
want
you
to
promise
that
whenever
you
come
within
ten
foot
of
a
customer
you
will
look
him
in
the
eye
greet
him
and
ask
him
if
you
can
help
him
now
i
know
some
of
you
be
just
naturally
shy
and
maybe
do
not
want
to
bother
folk
but
if
you
will
go
along
with
me
on
this
it
would
i
be
sure
help
you
become
a
leader
it
would
help
your
personality
develop
you
would
become
more
outgo
and
in
time
you
might
become
manager
of
that
store
you
might
become
a
department
manager
you
might
become
a
district
manager
or
whatever
you
choose
to
be
in
the
company
it
will
do
wonder
for
you
i
guarantee
it
now
i
want
you
to
raise
your
right
hand
and
remember
what
we
say
at
wal
mart
that
a
promise
we
make
be
a
promise
we
keep
and
i
want
you
to
repeat
after
me
from
this
day
forward
i
solemnly
promise
and
declare
that
every
time
a
customer
come
within
ten
foot
of
me
i
will
smile
look
him
in
the
eye
and
greet
him
so
help
me
sam
now
i
have
no
way
of
know
how
much
effect
a
little
communication
like
that
would
have
on
our
associate
or
on
our
customer
but
i
felt
so
strongly
about
the
idea
that
it
be
worth
call
attention
to
it
by
satellite
and
i
really
meant
it
when
i
say
i
do
not
think
any
other
retailer
in
the
country
could
do
it
i
do
know
this
a
lot
of
our
associate
start
do
what
i
suggest
and
i
be
sure
a
lot
of
our
customer
appreciate
it
we
use
mass
communication
to
transmit
the
idea
but
it
be
a
small
idea
aim
at
the
folk
on
the
front
line
the
one
most
responsible
for
keep
our
customer
happy
and
come
back
to
our
store
over
and
over
and
i
be
not
say
one
way
or
another
whether
my
little
pep
talk
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
we
go
on
from
that
christmas
to
pas
both
kmart
and
sears
in
sale
at
least
two
year
before
even
the
most
optimistic
wall
street
analyst
thought
we
could
do
it
keep
your
ear
to
the
ground
as
chairman
of
wal
mart
i
of
course
be
the
one
who
ultimately
authorize
all
those
expenditure
for
technology
which
prove
absolutely
crucial
to
our
success
but
truthfully
i
never
view
computer
as
anything
more
than
necessary
overhead
a
computer
be
not
and
will
never
be
a
substitute
for
get
out
in
your
store
and
learn
what
go
on
in
other
word
a
computer
can
tell
you
down
to
the
dime
what
you
have
sell
but
it
can
never
tell
you
how
much
you
could
have
sell
that
be
why
we
at
wal
mart
be
just
absolute
fanatic
about
our
manager
and
buyer
get
off
their
chair
here
in
bentonville
and
get
out
into
those
store
we
have
twelve
airplane
only
one
of
them
a
jet
i
be
proud
to
say
in
our
hangar
out
at
the
rogers
arkansas
airport
and
that
be
why
they
be
there
we
stay
in
the
air
to
keep
our
ear
to
the
ground
our
whole
travel
system
be
really
an
outgrowth
of
the
way
i
manage
those
nine
store
back
in
when
i
say
i
do
not
want
to
grow
anymore
back
then
as
you
now
know
i
would
get
in
my
old
tri
pacer
and
fly
to
those
store
once
a
week
to
find
out
what
be
sell
and
what
be
not
what
the
competition
be
up
to
what
kind
of
job
our
manager
be
do
what
the
store
be
look
like
what
the
customer
have
on
their
mind
of
course
i
have
continued
to
visit
store
almost
constantly
ever
since
and
it
be
the
part
of
my
job
i
enjoy
the
most
the
part
where
i
feel
i
make
the
great
contribution
but
with
almost
two
thousand
store
today
a
lot
of
other
folk
have
to
get
in
on
the
act
with
me
today
the
idea
be
pretty
much
the
same
our
district
manager
be
do
the
job
that
i
do
back
in
the
real
hand
on
get
down
in
the
store
stuff
but
also
we
have
eighteen
regional
manager
all
of
them
base
here
in
bentonville
every
monday
morning
they
pile
into
those
airplane
and
head
across
the
country
to
the
store
in
their
region
it
be
a
condition
of
their
employment
they
stay
out
three
to
four
day
usually
come
back
in
on
thursday
we
have
drum
into
their
head
the
belief
that
they
should
come
back
with
at
least
one
idea
that
will
pay
for
the
trip
then
they
gather
with
the
senior
management
of
the
company
all
of
whom
should
also
have
be
visit
store
earlier
in
the
week
if
they
expect
to
ask
any
intelligent
question
or
know
the
first
thing
about
what
go
on
for
our
friday
morning
merchandising
meeting
in
addition
to
the
fieldwork
of
course
we
have
computer
printout
at
the
meeting
which
tell
us
what
sell
and
what
not
but
the
really
valuable
intelligence
that
surface
in
these
session
be
what
everybody
have
brought
back
from
the
store
if
they
be
do
their
job
right
they
will
know
why
thing
be
or
be
not
sell
and
what
we
ought
to
be
think
about
sell
next
or
drop
from
our
assortment
if
they
have
be
to
that
panama
city
beach
store
and
see
a
suntan
cream
display
that
be
blowing
the
stuff
out
the
door
they
can
share
that
with
the
other
regionals
for
their
beach
store
or
if
they
have
be
to
a
big
store
in
the
rio
grande
valley
and
found
out
that
we
be
get
beat
by
a
competitor
on
lady
dress
because
their
assortment
be
more
suit
to
the
particular
taste
of
that
area
we
can
start
fix
it
when
that
meeting
be
over
every
one
of
those
regionals
should
be
on
the
phone
to
the
district
manager
who
should
be
passing
the
word
along
to
the
store
manager
who
will
get
the
department
manager
to
act
on
it
right
away
david
glass
our
friday
merchandising
meeting
be
unique
to
retailing
as
far
as
i
can
tell
here
we
have
all
these
regional
manager
who
have
be
out
in
the
field
all
week
long
they
be
the
operation
guy
who
direct
the
run
of
the
store
then
you
have
all
your
merchandising
folk
back
in
bentonville
the
people
who
buy
for
the
store
in
retailing
there
have
always
be
a
traditional
head
to
head
confrontation
between
operation
and
merchandising
you
know
the
operation
guy
say
why
in
the
world
would
anybody
buy
this
it
be
a
dog
and
we
will
never
sell
it
then
the
merchandising
folk
say
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
item
if
you
guy
be
smart
enough
to
display
it
well
and
promote
it
properly
it
would
blow
out
the
door
that
be
the
way
it
be
everywhere
include
wal
mart
so
we
sit
all
these
folk
down
together
every
friday
at
the
same
table
and
just
have
at
it
we
get
into
some
of
the
doggonedest
knock
down
drag
out
you
have
ever
see
but
we
have
a
rule
we
never
leave
an
item
hang
we
will
make
a
decision
in
that
meeting
even
if
it
be
wrong
and
sometimes
it
be
but
when
the
people
come
out
of
that
room
you
would
be
hard
press
to
tell
which
one
oppose
it
and
which
one
be
for
it
and
once
we
have
make
that
decision
on
friday
we
expect
it
to
be
act
on
in
all
the
store
on
saturday
what
we
guard
against
around
here
be
people
say
let
think
about
it
we
make
a
decision
then
we
act
on
it
once
these
regional
manager
have
come
back
on
thursday
we
load
up
the
plane
with
some
buyer
and
send
them
out
to
visit
the
individual
store
as
we
have
gotten
big
we
have
add
on
all
kind
of
way
to
keep
our
buyer
responsive
to
the
store
need
these
day
we
have
get
folk
call
regional
buyer
who
go
around
and
help
the
store
manager
customize
the
merchandise
for
their
own
store
my
favorite
buyer
program
be
one
call
eat
what
you
cook
once
a
quarter
every
buyer
have
to
go
out
to
a
different
store
and
act
as
manager
for
a
couple
of
day
in
the
department
he
or
she
buy
merchandise
for
i
guarantee
you
that
after
they
have
eat
what
they
cooked
enough
time
these
buyer
do
not
load
up
too
many
moon
pie
to
send
to
wisconsin
or
beach
towel
for
hiawatha
kansa
push
responsibility
and
authority
down
the
big
we
get
as
a
company
the
more
important
it
becomes
for
us
to
shift
responsibility
and
authority
toward
the
front
line
toward
that
department
manager
who
stock
the
shelf
and
talk
to
the
customer
when
we
be
much
small
i
probably
be
not
as
quick
to
catch
on
to
this
idea
as
i
should
have
be
but
as
an
avid
student
of
management
theory
back
in
the
mid
seventy
i
start
reading
the
work
of
w
edward
deming
the
famous
statistician
who
taught
so
much
to
the
japanese
about
improve
their
productivity
and
competitiveness
then
helen
and
i
take
a
trip
to
japan
and
korea
which
get
me
think
about
a
whole
bunch
of
different
thing
we
could
do
to
improve
our
company
that
be
probably
when
i
first
begin
think
about
some
of
the
very
real
way
that
we
could
improve
our
teamwork
and
put
more
authority
in
the
hand
of
our
people
in
the
store
our
most
famous
technique
for
do
this
be
a
textbook
example
of
think
small
we
call
it
store
within
a
store
and
it
be
the
simplest
idea
in
the
world
again
in
many
big
retail
company
the
department
head
be
just
an
hourly
employee
go
through
the
motion
somebody
who
punch
a
clock
then
rip
open
box
and
stack
whatever
in
them
onto
shelf
but
we
give
our
department
head
the
opportunity
to
become
real
merchant
at
a
very
early
stage
of
the
game
they
can
have
the
pride
of
proprietorship
even
if
they
be
not
fortunate
enough
to
go
to
college
or
be
formally
train
in
business
they
only
have
to
want
it
bad
enough
pay
close
attention
and
work
very
hard
at
develop
merchandising
skill
we
have
have
many
case
where
the
experience
have
fire
people
up
with
ambition
and
they
have
go
on
to
work
their
way
through
college
and
move
on
up
in
the
company
and
i
hope
we
have
many
more
case
like
that
again
this
only
work
because
we
decide
a
long
time
ago
to
share
so
much
information
about
the
company
with
our
associate
rather
than
keep
everything
secretive
in
store
within
a
store
we
make
our
department
head
the
manager
of
their
own
business
and
in
some
case
these
business
be
actually
big
in
annual
sale
than
a
lot
of
our
first
wal
mart
store
be
we
share
everything
with
them
the
cost
of
their
good
the
freight
cost
the
profit
margin
we
let
them
see
how
their
store
rank
with
every
other
store
in
the
company
on
a
constant
run
basis
and
we
give
them
incentive
to
want
to
win
we
be
always
try
for
that
fine
balance
between
autonomy
and
control
like
any
big
retailer
wal
mart
obviously
have
certain
procedure
which
we
require
our
store
to
follow
or
item
they
must
stock
but
we
have
take
step
to
make
sure
our
store
have
some
autonomy
the
responsibility
for
order
merchandise
lie
with
the
department
head
the
responsibility
for
promote
merchandise
be
with
the
store
manager
our
buyer
have
much
more
responsibility
for
decide
what
carry
in
our
store
than
buyer
at
most
other
company
we
run
them
hard
and
we
give
them
a
tough
time
because
we
do
not
want
them
get
a
big
head
and
think
they
be
all
powerful
but
the
fact
be
that
our
buyer
just
like
our
folk
in
the
store
be
in
unique
position
of
authority
for
the
retail
business
force
idea
to
bubble
up
this
go
hand
in
hand
with
push
responsibility
down
we
be
always
look
for
new
way
to
encourage
our
associate
out
in
the
store
to
push
their
idea
up
through
the
system
we
do
a
lot
of
this
at
saturday
morning
meeting
we
will
invite
associate
who
have
thought
up
something
that
be
really
work
well
for
their
store
a
particular
item
or
a
particular
display
to
come
share
those
idea
with
us
the
vpi
volume
produce
item
contest
be
a
perfect
example
of
how
we
put
this
into
practice
everybody
from
the
department
manager
level
on
up
can
choose
an
item
of
merchandise
they
want
to
promote
with
big
display
or
whatever
and
then
we
see
whose
item
produce
the
high
volume
i
have
always
thought
of
the
vpi
contest
not
just
as
a
way
to
stimulate
sale
but
as
a
method
of
teach
our
associate
how
to
become
well
merchant
to
show
them
what
can
be
do
by
pick
an
item
that
be
available
and
figure
out
a
creative
way
to
sell
it
or
buy
it
or
both
it
give
them
the
opportunity
to
act
the
way
we
use
to
in
the
early
day
they
can
do
crazy
thing
like
pick
an
item
and
hang
it
all
over
a
tree
fill
with
stuffed
monkey
in
the
middle
of
the
store
or
drive
a
pickup
truck
into
action
alley
and
fill
it
with
car
wash
sponge
we
be
not
just
look
for
merchandising
idea
from
our
associate
our
late
effort
be
a
program
call
yes
we
can
sam
which
by
the
way
i
do
not
name
again
we
invite
hourly
associate
who
have
come
up
with
money
save
idea
to
attend
our
saturday
morning
meeting
so
far
we
figure
we
have
save
about
million
a
year
off
these
idea
and
most
of
them
be
just
common
sense
kind
of
thing
that
nobody
pick
up
on
when
we
be
all
think
about
how
big
we
be
they
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
come
from
think
small
one
of
my
favorite
come
from
an
hourly
associate
in
our
traffic
department
who
get
to
wonder
why
we
be
shipping
all
the
fixture
we
bought
for
our
warehouse
by
common
carrier
when
we
own
the
large
private
fleet
of
truck
in
america
she
figure
out
a
program
to
backhaul
those
thing
on
our
own
truck
and
save
us
over
a
half
million
dollar
right
there
so
we
brought
her
in
recognize
her
good
think
and
give
her
a
cash
award
when
you
consider
that
there
be
of
us
it
be
obvious
that
there
be
more
than
a
few
good
idea
out
there
wait
to
be
plucked
tom
coughlin
let
me
tell
you
how
wal
mart
come
to
have
people
greeter
back
in
mr
walton
and
i
go
into
a
wal
mart
in
crowley
louisiana
the
first
thing
we
saw
as
we
open
the
door
be
this
old
gentleman
stand
there
the
man
do
not

let
me
know
neither
sam
nor
i
have
ever

such
a
thing
so
we
start
talk
to
him
well
once
he
get
over
the
fact
that
he
be
talk
to
the
chairman
he
explain
that
he
have
a
dual
purpose
to
make
people
feel
good
about

in
and
to
make
sure
people
be
not
walk
back
out
the
entrance
with
merchandise
they
have
not
paid
for
the
store
it
turn
out
have
have
trouble
with
shoplift
and
its
manager
be
an
old
line
merchant
name
dan
mcallister
who
knew
how
to
take
care
of
his
inventory
he
do
not
want
to
intimidate
the
honest
customer
by
post
a
guard
at
the
door
but
he
want
to
leave
a
clear
message
that
if
you
come
in
and
stole
someone
be
there
who
would
see
it
well
sam
thought
that
be
the
great
idea
he
would
ever
heard
of
he
go
right
back
to
bentonville
and
told
everyone
we
ought
to
put
greeter
at
the
front
of
every
single
store
a
lot
of
people
thought
he
would
lose
his
mind
our
folk
felt
that
put
someone
at
the
door
be
a
waste
of
money
they
just
could
not
see
what
sam
and
dan
mcallister
be
see
that
the
greeter
sent
a
warm
friendly
message
to
the
good
customer
and
a
warn
to
the
thief
they
fought
him
all
the
way
on
it
some
people
try
hard
to
talk
him
out
of
it
they
try
to
ignore
it
sam
just
kept
push
and
push
and
push
every
week
every
meeting
he
would
talk
about
greeter
he
would
throw
fit
whenever
he
go
into
a
store
and
do
not
find
one
gradually
he
wore
everyone
down
and
get
his
way
i
would
say
it
take
about
a
year
and
a
half
because
they
really
resist
it
but
sam
be
relentless
i
guess
his
vindication
have
to
be
the
day
in
when
he
walk
into
a
kmart
in
illinois
and
found
that
they
have
instal
people
greeter
at
their
front
door
if
people
greeter
be
the
only
good
idea
i
would
picked
up
from
the
associate
in
the
store
over
the
year
i
would
still
say
that
visit
the
store
and
listen
to
our
folk
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
us
of
my
time
as
an
executive
but
really
our
best
idea
usually
do
come
from
the
folk
in
the
store
period
i
should
say
though
that
the
people
greeter
be
an
exception
in
that
i
be
not
generally
dispose
to
idea
that
require
add
on
people
and
expense
stay
lean
fight
bureaucracy
anytime
a
company
grows
as
fast
as
wal
mart
have
pocket
of
duplication
be
go
to
build
up
and
there
will
be
area
of
the
business
which
we
may
no
longer
need
no
bos
or
employee
really
like
to
dwell
on
such
matter
it
be
only
human
nature
not
to
want
to
have
your
job
or
the
job
of
the
people
who
work
for
you
eliminate
but
it
be
absolutely
the
responsibility
of
a
company
top
management
to
be
think
about
this
issue
all
the
time
to
ensure
a
sound
future
for
the
overall
company
one
way
i
have
approach
this
be
by
stick
to
the
same
formula
i
use
back
when
we
have
about
five
store
in
those
day
i
try
to
operate
on
a
percent
general
office
expense
structure
in
other
word
percent
of
sale
should
have
be
enough
to
carry
our
buying
office
our
general
office
expense
my
salary
bud
salary
and
after
we
start
add
district
manager
or
any
other
officer
their
salary
too
believe
it
or
not
we
have
not
change
that
basic
formula
from
five
store
to
two
thousand
store
in
fact
we
be
actually
operating
at
a
far
low
percentage
today
in
office
overhead
than
we
do
thirty
year
ago
and
that
include
tremendous
expense
for
computer
support
and
distribution
center
support
though
not
the
actual
cost
of
run
the
distribution
center
really
it
include
everything
that
we
supply
centrally
in
the
way
of
support
for
the
store
some
folk
in
the
retail
business
have
ask
me
where
i
come
up
with
the
percent
formula
and
the
truth
be
i
just
pull
it
out
of
the
air
in
the
early
day
most
company
charge
percent
of
their
sale
to
run
their
office
but
we
have
always
operate
lean
we
have
operate
with
few
people
we
have
have
our
people
do
more
than
in
other
company
i
think
we
come
to
work
earlier
and
stayed
later
it
have
be
our
heritage
our
obsession
that
we
would
be
more
productive
and
more
efficient
than
our
competition
and
we
have
accomplish
that
goal
a
lot
of
first
time
visitor
be
kind
of
shock
by
our
executive
office
most
people
say
my
office
and
those
of
all
the
other
wal
mart
executive
look
like
something
you
would
find
in
a
truck
terminal
we
be
in
a
one
story
office
warehouse
building
the
office
be
not
real
big
and
the
wall
be
cover
with
inexpensive
panel
we
never
have
fancy
furniture
or
thick
carpet
or
suite
with
bar
for
our
executive
i
like
them
just
like
they
be
we
sure
as
heck
wo
not
win
any
interior
decorate
award
but
they
be
all
we
need
and
they
must
be
work
fine
just
ask
our
shareholder
david
glass
if
you
do
not
zero
in
on
your
bureaucracy
every
so
often
you
will
naturally
build
in
layer
you
never
set
out
to
add
bureaucracy
you
just
get
it
period
without
even
know
it
so
you
always
have
to
be
look
to
eliminate
it
you
know
when
tom
watson
sr
be
run
ibm
he
decide
they
would
never
have
more
than
four
layer
from
the
chairman
of
the
board
to
the
low
level
in
the
company
that
may
have
be
one
of
the
great
single
reason
why
ibm
be
successful
a
lot
of
this
go
back
to
what
deming
told
the
japanese
a
long
time
ago
do
it
right
the
first
time
the
natural
tendency
when
you
have
get
a
problem
in
a
company
be
to
come
up
with
a
solution
to
fix
it
too
often
that
solution
be
nothing
more
than
add
another
layer
what
you
should
be
do
be
go
to
the
source
of
the
problem
to
fix
it
and
sometimes
that
require
shoot
the
culprit
i
will
give
you
an
example
that
just
drove
sam
crazy
until
we
start
do
something
about
it
when
merchandise
come
into
the
back
of
a
store
it
be
suppose
to
be
marked
at
the
right
price
or
marked
correctly
on
the
spot
but
because
it
often
be
not
get
do
properly
we
create
position
call
test
scanner
people
who
go
around
the
store
with
hand
held
scanner
make
sure
everything
be
price
correctly
there
be
another
layer
right
there
and
sam
do
not
ever
visit
a
store
without
ask
if
we
really
need
these
folk
well
we
still
have
some
but
what
we
have
do
be
overhaul
our
back
office
procedure
to
make
sure
we
get
it
right
more
often
the
first
time
and
in
the
process
we
eliminate
one
and
a
half
people
out
of
the
office
in
every
wal
mart
store
in
the
company
that
be
big
buck
really
it
be
a
pretty
simple
philosophy
what
you
have
to
do
be
just
draw
a
line
in
the
dirt
and
force
the
bureaucracy
back
behind
that
line
and
then
know
for
sure
that
a
year
will
go
by
and
it
will
be
back
across
that
line
and
you
will
have
to
do
the
same
thing
again
i
guess
one
reason
i
feel
so
strongly
about
not
let
ego
get
out
of
control
around
wal
mart
be
that
a
lot
of
bureaucracy
be
really
the
product
of
some
empire
builder
ego
some
folk
have
a
tendency
to
build
up
big
staff
around
them
to
emphasize
their
own
importance
and
we
do
not
need
any
of
that
at
wal
mart
if
you
be
not
serve
the
customer
or
support
the
folk
who
do
we
do
not
need
you
when
we
be
think
small
that
be
another
thing
we
be
always
on
the
lookout
for
big
ego
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
small
ego
to
work
here
but
you
would
well
know
how
to
make
it
look
small
or
you
might
wind
up
in
trouble
so
you
see
what
i
mean
when
i
say
you
have
to
think
small
to
grow
big
and
really
i
do
not
have
any
doubt
that
wal
mart
will
stay
the
course
and
reach
billion
in
sale
by
the
year
it
be
a
challenge
nothing
like
it
have
ever
be
do
before
but
our
folk
will
do
it
and
now
i
be
go
to
confess
to
a
really
radical
thought
i
have
be
have
lately
i
probably
wo
not
do
anything
about
it
but
the
folk
who
come
after
me
be
eventually
go
to
have
to
face
up
to
this
question
even
by
think
small
can
a
billion
retailer
really
function
as
efficiently
and
productively
as
it
should
or
would
maybe
five
billion
company
work
well

give
something
back
i
believe
that
every
right
implies
a
responsibility
every
opportunity
an
obligation
every
possession
a
duty
john

jr
by
now
i
hope
i
have
give
you
a
pretty
clear
impression
of
what
my
business
priority
have
be
over
the
year
if
i
have
explain
myself
well
you
know
that
i
have
concentrate
all
along
on
building
the
fine
retailing
company
that
we
possibly
could
period
create
a
huge
personal
fortune
be
never
particularly
a
goal
of
mine
and
the
proof
of
that
lie
in
the
fact
that
even
to
this
day
most
of
my
and
my
family
wealth
remains
in
the
form
of
wal
mart
stock
i
think
most
people
in
our
position
would
have
hedge
their
bet
a
long
time
ago
and
diversified
into
all
kind
of
investment
as
it
be
happen
though
our
very
simplistic
very
personal
investment
strategy
have
turn
out
far
well
than
anyone
could
ever
have
expect
so
wal
mart
stock
have
make
the
walton
a
very
wealthy
family
on
paper
anyway
i
wo
not
deny
for
a
second
that
my
approach
have
be
single
mind
i
have
concentrate
on
keep
our
wal
mart
store
and
sam
club
on
track
and
i
have
to
admit
that
i
never
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
my
time
or
energy
think
about
what
some
of
the
broader
implication
of
our
family
wealth
could
be
maybe
it
be
because
we
have
never
have
any
intention
of
liquidate
our
stock
even
so
the
annual
dividend
income
from
that
stock
have
become
large
in
its
own
right
and
it
be
that
income
which
represent
the
actual
wealth
available
to
us
as
i
told
you
early
on
this
kind
of
wealth
seem
to
naturally
attract
all
kind
of
folk
who
just
want
us
to
give
them
a
handout
we
have
never
be
inclined
to
give
any
undeserving
stranger
a
free
ride
and
we
will
never
change
our
mind
about
that
nor
do
we
believe
that
because
we
have
money
we
should
be
call
upon
to
solve
every
personal
problem
that
come
to
our
attention
every
problem
of
the
community
the
state
or
for
that
matter
the
country
we
do
however
believe
in
worthy
cause
and
we
realize
how
fortunate
we
have
be
as
a
family
so
we
be
commit
to
use
our
personal
resource
for
as
much
benefit
as
possible
in
the
area
we
feel
need
the
most
help
employ
the
method
we
think
hold
the
most
promise
and
our
family
gift
reflect
a
wide
variety
of
interest
spread
across
numerous
organization
with
a
heavy
emphasis
on
education
most
of
the
give
we
have
do
have
be
either
anonymously
or
link
to
strict
request
for
no
publicity
and
i
be
not
go
to
go
into
the
financial
detail
of
our
charitable
activity
here
because
i
do
not
think
it
be
anybody
business
but
our
own
i
will
tell
you
though
that
we
think
we
do
our
part
in
addition
to
a
lot
of
educational
institution
recipient
of

i
or
our
child
have
personal
tie
but
we
have
also
support
national
organization
and
even
a
few
local
cause
of
national
importance
in
such
city
as
new
york
and
washington
helen
have
be
actively
and
publicly
supportive
of
a
number
of
institution
include
the
presbyterian
church
the
university
of
the
ozarks
and
the
national
museum
for
woman
in
the
art
and
i
have
support
such
group
as
the
citizen
against
government
waste
student
in
free
enterprise
and
the
arkansas
business
council
which
folk
around
here
insist
on
call
the
good
suit
club
we
also
have
some
pet
project
to
which
helen
and
i
together
be
strongly
and
personally
commit
in
the
last
ten
year
we
have
fund
a
special
scholarship
program
we
start
which
sends
kid
from
central
america
to
college
here
in
arkansas
right
now
we
have
get
about
of
them
enrol
at
three
different
arkansas
school
and
we
pay
about
a
year
per
student
to
provide
tuition
transportation
book
and
room
and
board
we
get
the
idea
while
we
be
travel
around
down
in
that
part
of
the
world
and
when
we
learn
that
the
then
soviet
union
and
cuba
have
program
to
teach
their
value
to
kid
from
other
place
we
decide
american
ought
to
be
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
with
our
value
we
want
kid
to
learn
about
the
tremendous
potential
of
the
free
enterprise
system
and
to
see
for
themselves
what
all
the
advantage
be
of
a
stable
democratic
government
besides
that
it
will
help
some
of
these
student
who
would
not
have
otherwise
receive
any
college
education
to
return
to
their
country
and
do
something
about
their
serious
economic
development
problem
who
know
maybe
one
day
some
of
them
will
be
run
wal
mart
or
sam
club
in
honduras
or
panama
or
guatemala
or
even
nicaragua
closer
to
home
the
walton
family
sponsor
seventy
scholarship
of
each
every
year
for
child
of
wal
mart
associate
so
we
feel
pretty
good
about
what
we
have
do
up
until
now
but
i
do
realize
there
be
a
big
issue
at
stake
here
and
i
have
be
do
a
lot
of
think
on
it
lately
as
a
family
we
have
be
in
the
planning
stage
of
how
we
want
to
leverage
our
resource
for
a
while
now
but
really
the
serious
business
of
get
it
do
will
begin
after
i
be
go
helen
and
i
expect
that
an
amount
at
least
equal
to
our
share
of
the
family
asset
will
go
to
nonprofit
organization
over
a
number
of
year
in
all
likelihood
education
be
go
to
be
the
issue
we
focus
on
the
most
it
be
the
single
area
which
cause
me
the
most
worry
about
our
country
future
as
a
nation
we
have
already
learn
that
we
must
compete
worldwide
with
everybody
else
and
our
educational
process
have
more
to
do
with
our
ability
to
compete
successfully
than
anything
else
unless
we
get
ourselves
on
the
right
track
pretty
quickly
and
start
rebuild
our
system
into
one
that
compare
favorably
with
the
rest
of
the
world
we
could
seriously
jeopardize
the
future
of
this
great
country
of
ours
frankly
i
would
like
to
see
an
all
out
revolution
in
education
we
have
get
to
target
the
inner
city
school
and
the
rural
poverty
pocket
like
the
mississippi
delta
and
figure
out
a
way
to
make
a
difference
we
have
to
start
at
the
preschool
level
and
develop
way
to
change
the
environment
for
child
so
they
have
a
chance
to
stay
in
school
and
learn
to
value
their
education
we
have
to
look
at
the
effect
of
so
many
single
mother
and
father
leave
their
kid
at
home
with
no
guidance
and
find
way
to
help
them
encourage
their
kid
incidentally
my
share
of
the
proceeds
from
this
book
will
go
to
the
new
american
school
corporation
which
be
a
private
initiative
start
by
business
leader
who
have
pledge
to
raise
million
for
the
development
of
break
the
mold
school
it
be
a
true
nonpartisan
effort
aim
at
help
american
school
meet
the
six
goal
establish
by
a
national
governor
task
force
which
be
convene
by
president
bush
and
chair
by
arkansas
governor
bill
clinton
as
the
family
focus
more
broadly
on
educational
reform
we
want
to
be
very
careful
we
be
devout
believer
in
the
wal
mart
way
of
do
thing
and
we
want
some
basis
by
which
to
measure
our
investment
we
be
not
satisfied
that
the
traditional
method
by
which
charitable
foundation
be
operate
really
meet
our
criterion
some
people
have
crow
a
great
deal
about
all
their
philanthropy
over
the
year
but
too
many
of
these
foundation
i
suspect
be
only
begin
as
tax
shelter
without
much
real
sense
of
purpose
many
of
them
seem
to
have
become
very
nice
place
to
work
for
a
small
group
of
folk
who
have
built
up
pretty
thick
crust
of
administration
and
bureaucracy
those
be
two
of
the
thing
we
have
fought
the
hardest
to
keep
out
of
our
company
so
naturally
we
do
not
want
them
clog
up
our
nonprofit
effort
we
be
go
to
insist
that
whatever
program
we
support
incorporates
those
same
value
when
it
come
to
college
education
and
scholarship
for
example
i
have
always
favor
program
that
require
the
recipient
to
work
and
kick
in
some
of
their
own
money
for
that
matter
i
have
always
prefer
to
hire
people
who
have
to
at
least
partly
work
their
way
through
school
no
doubt
because
of
my
own
background
the
secret
lie
in
motivate
kid
who
be
not
get
educate
today
to
want
to
put
themselves
through
school
and
to
make
them
understand
the
reward
they
can
expect
when
they
do
so
we
be
go
to
approach
philanthropy
with
the
same
lack
of
reverence
we
give
to
the
traditional
method
of
the
retail
business
when
we
start
out
there
we
be
go
to
see
if
we
ca
not
shake
up
some
of
the
time
honor
assumption
about
what
you
can
teach
people
about
what
you
can
do
with
people
whose
self
esteem
have
be
beaten
down
and
about
how
you
can
motivate
ordinary
people
to
do
extraordinary
thing
as
just
one
example
of
the
kind
of
folk
we
be
call
on
in
put
this
effort
together
we
ask
lamar
alexander
the
former
governor
of
tennessee
and
now
u
s
secretary
of
education
to
attend
our
last
family
meeting
here
in
bentonville
and
talk
with
us
about
some
of
the
idea
he
be
come
across
for
improve
our
public
education
system
we
do
not
come
by
this
passion
for
improve
education
out
of
some
fuzzy
head
notion
or
something
we
read
somewhere
we
see
the
need
every
day
at
wal
mart
in
the
old
day
just
be
bright
and
willing
to
work
hard
be
enough
to
give
you
all
the
opportunity
you
need
at
our
company
but
we
be
such
a
sophisticated
company
today
and
have
move
so
rapidly
in
the
area
of
technology
and
communication
that
skill
and
knowledge
in
these
field
have
become
a
vital
part
of
our
business
none
of
this
be
news
to
anyone
who
keep
up
with
world
business
trend
this
be
the
direction
in
which
we
be
all
head
and
to
succeed
we
be
just
go
to
have
to
do
a
well
job
of
educate
and
training
our
work
force
one
aspect
of
this
whole
philanthropy
issue
that
have
annoyed
me
considerably
over
the
year
be
the
criticism
by
some
of
our
detractor
that
wal
mart
do
not
do
its
fair
share
of
give
to
charity
the
criticism
seem
to
come
from
folk
who
say
we
do
not
meet
the
standard
guideline
for
corporation
guideline
which
be
set
i
guess
by
the
people
who
run
the
charity
business
wal
mart
like
many
other
corporation
conduct
a
very
aggressive
united
way
campaign
which
meet
with
great
success
among
our
associate
every
year
in
fact
we
keep
our
united
way
goal
sign
in
the
yard
right
outside
my
office
here
so
everybody
can
see
how
we
be
do
we
strongly
believe
in
united
way
because
in
spite
of
all
the
publicity
it
receive
recently
for
some
problem
in
the
national
office
most
all
the
money
that
be
collect
in
these
campaign
be
direct
locally
we
believe
in
locally
direct
charity
so
we
have
a
match
grant
program
for
associate
who
want
to
raise
money
for
charity
of
their
choice
we
be
also
a
big
contributor
to
the
child
miracle
network
telethon
which
support
locally
direct
child
hospital
last
year
wal
mart
and
its
associate
be
the
large
single
contributor
to
this
campaign
at
million
i
think
quite
a
few
company
use
charitable
give
guideline
as
a
way
to
say
in
effect
we
give
at
the
office
when
it
come
to
think
about
what
overall
good
the
company
should
be
accomplish
in
my
opinion
wal
mart
be
an
entirely
different
sort
of
enterprise
from
that
and
i
would
argue
that
our
relentless
effort
to
improve
our
business
have
always
be
tie
to
try
to
make
thing
well
for
the
folk
who
live
and
work
in
our
community
we
have
built
a
company
that
be
so
efficient
it
have
enable
us
to
save
our
customer
billion
of
dollar
and
whether
you
buy
into
the
argument
or
not
we
believe
it
that
in
itself
be
give
something
back
and
it
have
be
a
cornerstone
philosophy
of
our
company
for
example
we
do
billion
in
sale
this
year
for
the
last
ten
year
to
we
have
average
sale
of
say
billion
a
year
so
that
be
about
billion
in
sale
if
we
only
save
our
customer
percent
over
what
they
would
be
pay
if
we
be
not
there
and
i
think
that
be
very
conservative
that
would
be
billion
we
have
save
them
that
be
billion
which
be
a
product
of
a
free
market
system
that
allows
us
to
operate
efficiently
and
it
be
the
reason
our
customer
love
us
so
the
truth
be
that
wal
mart
have
be
a
powerful
force
for
improve
the
standard
of
living
in
our
mostly
rural
trade
area
and
our
customer
recognize
it
we
do
a
lot
of
thing
to
take
care
of
our
own
some
of
them
you
already
know
about
our
associate
have
almost
billion
in
their
profit
share
fund
some
of
which
i
suppose
the
company
could
have
give
to
charity
instead
we
have
a
relief
fund
for
associate
who
be
the
victim
of
natural
disaster
and
each
year
every
wal
mart
store
sponsor
one
student
in
its
community
to
a
scholarship
beyond
that
we
feel
very
strongly
that
wal
mart
really
be
not
and
should
not
be
in
the
charity
business
we
do
not
believe
in
take
a
lot
of
money
out
of
wal
mart
cash
register
and
give
it
to
charity
for
the
simple
reason
that
any
debit
have
to
be
pass
along
to
somebody
either
our
shareholder
or
our
customer
a
few
year
ago
when
helen
convince
me
that
our
associate
here
in
bentonville
need
a
first
class
exercise
facility
she
and
i
paid
the
million
dollar
in
construction
cost
ourselves
plus
an
annual
subsidy
for
a
few
year
to
get
it
start
we
paid
for
it
to
show
our
sincere
appreciation
to
the
associate
but
also
because
i
do
not
believe
in
ask
the
customer
or
the
shareholder
to
pay
for
something
like
that
as
worthy
a
cause
as
it
may
be
by
not
designate
a
large
amount
of
corporate
fund
to
some
charity
which
the
officer
of
wal
mart
may
happen
to
like
we
feel
we
give
our
shareholder
more
discretion
in
support
their
own
charity
and
i
have
be
particularly
proud
of
the
really
generous
community
support
show
by
some
of
our
shareholder
who
have
be
with
us
since
way
back
when
especially
the
early
store
manager
willard
walker
and
charlie
baum
be
two
guy
who
have
just
do
great
thing
for
the
community
with
some
of
what
they
have
accumulate
through
their
wal
mart
holding
maybe
the
most
important
way
in
which
we
at
wal
mart
believe
in
give
something
back
be
through
our
commitment
to
use
the
power
of
this
enormous
enterprise
as
a
force
for
change
one
of
the
well
example
of
what
i
be
talk
about
be
our
bring
it
home
to
the
u
s
a
program
which
we
start
in
in
response
to
the
soar
u
s
trade
deficit
wal
mart
like
every
other
american
retailer
be
a
huge
importer
of
merchandise
from
overseas
in
some
case
too
many
in
my
opinion
import
be
really
our
only
alternative
because
a
lot
of
american
make
good
simply
be
not
competitive
either
in
price
or
quality
or
both
we
commit
ourselves
to
see
if
we
could
do
anything
to
improve
the
situation
the
remedy
we
envision
be
not
some
blind
patriotic
idea
that
preaches
buying
american
at
any
cost
we
like
any
other
retailer
will
only
buy
american
if
those
good
can
be
produce
efficiently
enough
to
offer
good
value
we
be
not
interested
in
charity
here
we
do
not
believe
in
subsidize
substandard
work
or
inefficiency
so
our
primary
goal
become
to
work
with
american
manufacturer
and
see
if
our
formidable
buying
power
could
help
them
deliver
the
good
and
in
the
process
save
some
american
manufacturing
job
i
sent
out
an
open
letter
to
our
supplier
invite
them
to
work
with
us
on
the
program
wal
mart
believe
american
worker
can
make
the
difference
i
told
them
if
management
provide
the
leadership
we
be
surprised
ourselves
at
the
result
it
turn
out
that
if
wal
mart
commit
to
high
volume
purchase
well
in
advance
of
shipping
deadline
a
lot
of
american
manufacturer
could
save
enough
on
the
purchase
of
material
personnel
schedule
and
inventory
cost
to
realize
significant
efficiency
gain
so
in
fact
they
could
turn
out
a
wide
variety
of
merchandise
flannel
shirt
candle
men
knit
shirt
lady
sweater
bicycle
beach
towel
film
videotape
furniture
even
toy
at
competitive
price
we
also
take
a
close
look
at
our
overseas
buying
practice
and
discover
a
number
of
hidden
cost
such
as
have
to
own
inventory
from
the
time
it
leaf
port
on
a
ship
use
that
data
we
developed
a
formula
which
enable
us
to
make
a
true
apple
to
apple
cost
comparison
of
buying
something
overseas
versus
buying
it
at
home
now
if
we
can
get
within
percent
of
the
same
price
and
quality
we
take
a
small
markup
and
go
with
the
american
product
what
we
learn
be
that
we
have
fall
into
a
pattern
of
knee
jerk
import
buying
without
really
examine
possible
alternative
in
the
past
we
would
just
take
our
best
sell
u
s
make
item
send
them
to
the
orient
and
say
see
if
you
can
make
something
like
this
we
could
use
unit
of
this
or
more
if
the
quality
hold
up
i
be
sure
a
lot
of
other
retailer
do
the
same
thing
today
we
instruct
our
buyer
to
make
trip
to
place
like
greenville
south
carolina
dothan
alabama
aurora
missouri
and
hundred
of
other
out
of
the
way
place
in
pennsylvania
new
york
ohio
or
new
hampshire
before
just
routinely
dash
off
a
letter
of
credit
to
the
far
east
if
we
could
all
take
a
little
extra
trouble
to
work
some
of
these
deal
out
and
the
manufacturer
will
continue
to
come
up
with
their
own
creative
program
i
think
there
be
still
a
tremendous
amount
of
untapped
potential
left
in
this
idea
as
usual
some
of
our
critic
mostly
union
in
this
case
take
a
shot
at
me
for
this
idea
they
say
i
be
wrap
myself
in
the
flag
and
pull
a
typical
sam
walton
promotion
to
hide
the
fact
that
we
sell
a
lot
of
import
good
these
folk
i
be
afraid
be
really
living
in
the
past
they
do
not
believe
in
a
free
market
they
be
not
interested
in
new
solution
and
they
only
care
about
job
if
they
be
union
job
many
of
which
frankly
have
price
themselves
out
of
the
market
either
with
unrealistic
wage
or
total
inflexibility
with
this
approach
we
estimate
we
have
save
or
create
almost
american
manufacturing
job
so
before
anybody
dismisses
bring
it
home
as
a
publicity
stunt
they
should
listen
to
the
people
whose
job
be
save
or
create
by
the
program
farris
burroughs
president
farris
fashion
brinkley
arkansas
it
be
the
best
thing
that
ever
happen
to
brinkley
and
certainly
the
best
thing
that
ever
happen
to
me
before
we
have
a
contract
with
van
heusen
for
penney
and
sears
but
in
they
told
us
they
be
move
everything
to
china
we
be
struggle
from
season
to
season
with
ninety
job
when
i
get
this
call
from
a
guy
claim
to
be
sam
walton
it
turn
out
he
actually
be
sam
walton
and
he
want
to
know
if
we
thought
we
could
make
dozen
flannel
shirt
for
him
i
will
tell
you
what
though
he
be
the
only
guy
i
ever
work
for
who
look
me
right
in
the
eye
and
say
son
if
you
ca
not
make
money
off
this
project
do
not
do
it
most
retailer
could
not
care
less
whether
the
manufacturer
make
money
or
not
anyway
today
we
be
make
about
two
and
a
half
million
wal
mart
shirt
and
we
have
go
from
employee
the
week
mr
sam
call
to
today
and
we
know
where
it
come
from
every
christmas
we
give
our
employee
wal
mart
gift
certificate
there
be
no
charity
at
all
involve
in
this
program
and
in
fact
i
be
proud
to
say
that
it
benefit
us
at
wal
mart
in
a
very
direct
way
every
job
we
save
creates
another
potential
wal
mart
customer
who
not
worry
about
where
his
or
her
next
dollar
come
from
they
have
a
job
and
we
have
a
customer
so
we
all
come
out
ahead
farris
be
one
of
our
early
success
story
and
since
then
we
have
work
out
all
kind
of
buy
american
deal
with
small
and
large
manufacturer
include
fieldcrest
cannon
m
sunbeam
mirro
foley
u
s
electronics
kentogs
capital
mercury
mr
coffee
lasko
and
huffy
from
the
time
the
program
begin
in
until
the
end
of
last
year
we
estimate
that
we
bought
american
make
good
with
a
retail
value
of
more
than
billion
that
would
previously
have
be
purchase
overseas
and
just
to
keep
everybody
think
along
these
line
we
always
post
our
late
tally
and
our
late
bring
it
home
success
story
right
by
the
door
where
all
our
vendor
have
to
enter
our
building
to
make
sale
call
in
the
same
spirit
we
be
in
the
early
stage
of
an
environmental
initiative
encourage
supplier
and
manufacturer
to
eliminate
any
wasteful
practice
such
as
unnecessary
packaging
that
we
can
also
we
have
a
fairly
new
program
in
which
we
donate
percent
from
purchase
of
sam
american
choice
product
a
selection
of
our
own
private
label
product
toward
scholarship
for
student
study
mathematics
hard
science
and
computer
science
we
be
not
the
least
bit
naive
about
how
big
a
stick
wal
mart
swing
in
the
world
of
retailing
these
day
we
know
we
can
be
very
influential
powerful
if
you
prefer
so
today
i
think
it
be
important
for
our
people
to
remember
that
thing
be
not
the
same
as
the
old
day
when
we
be
the
scrappy
underdog
have
to
fight
for
every
single
break
we
still
want
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
but
now
we
need
to
guard
against
abuse
our
power
we
want
to
find
more
way
like
bring
it
home
in
which
we
can
use
our
influence
to
give
something
back

run
a
successful
company
ten
rule
that
work
for
me
one
thing
you
will
notice
if
you
spend
very
much
time
talk
with
sam
about
wal
mart
success
he
be
always
say
thing
like
this
be
the
key
to
the
whole
thing
or
that
be
our
real
secret
he
know
as
well
as
anyone
that
there
be
not
any
magic
formula
a
lot
of
different
thing
make
it
work
and
in
one
day
time
he
may
cite
all
of
them
as
the
key
or
the
secret
what
amaze
be
that
for
almost
fifty
year
he
be
manage

focus

david
glass
i
think
we
have
cover
the
story
of
how
all
my
partner
and
associate
and
i
over
the
year
built
wal
mart
into
what
it
be
today
and
in
the
tell
i
think
we
have
cover
all
the
principle
which
result
in
the
company
amaze
success
a
whole
lot
have
change
about
the
retailing
business
in
the
forty
seven
year
we
have
be
in
it
include
some
of
my
theory
we
have
change
our
mind
about
some
significant
thing
along
the
way
and
adopt
some
new
principle
particularly
about
the
concept
of
partnership
in
a
corporation
but
most
of
the
value
and
the
rule
and
the
technique
we
have
rely
on
have
stayed
the
same
the
whole
way
some
of
them
be
such
simple
common
sense
old
favorite
that
they
hardly
seem
worth
mention
this
be
not
the
first
time
that
i
have
be
ask
to
come
up
with
a
list
of
rule
for
success
but
it
be
the
first
time
i
have
actually
sat
down
and
do
it
i
be
glad
i
do
because
it
be
be
a
reveal
exercise
for
me
the
truth
be
david
glass
be
right
i
do
seem
to
have
a
couple
of
dozen
thing
that
i
have
single
out
at
one
time
or
another
as
the
key
to
the
whole
thing
one
i
do
not
even
have
on
my
list
be
work
hard
if
you
do
not
know
that
already
or
you
be
not
willing
to
do
it
you
probably
wo
not
be
go
far
enough
to
need
my
list
anyway
and
another
i
do
not
include
on
the
list
be
the
idea
of
building
a
team
if
you
want
to
build
an
enterprise
of
any
size
at
all
it
almost
go
without
say
that
you
absolutely
must
create
a
team
of
people
who
work
together
and
give
real
meaning
to
that
overuse
word
teamwork
to
me
that
be
more
the
goal
of
the
whole
thing
rather
than
some
way
to
get
there
i
believe
in
always
have
goal
and
always
set
them
high
i
can
certainly
tell
you
that
the
folk
at
wal
mart
have
always
have
goal
in
front
of
them
in
fact
we
have
sometimes
built
real
scoreboard
on
the
stage
at
saturday
morning
meeting
one
more
thing
if
you
be
really
look
for
my
advice
here
try
to
get
something
serious
out
of
this
exercise
i
put
myself
through
remember
these
rule
be
not
in
any
way
intend
to
be
the
ten
commandment
of
business
they
be
some
rule
that
work
for
me
but
i
always
pride
myself
on
break
everybody
else
rule
and
i
always
favor
the
maverick
who
challenged
my
rule
i
may
have
fought
them
all
the
way
but
i
respect
them
and
in
the
end
i
listen
to
them
a
lot
more
closely
than
i
do
the
pack
who
always
agree
with
everything
i
say
so
pay
special
attention
to
rule
and
if
you
interpret
it
in
the
right
spirit
as
it
applies
to
you
it
could
mean
simply
break
all
the
rule
for
what
they
be
worth
here
they
be
sam
rule
for
building
a
business
rule
commit
to
your
business
believe
in
it
more
than
anybody
else
i
think
i
overcame
every
single
one
of
my
personal
shortcoming
by
the
sheer
passion
i
brought
to
my
work
i
do
not
know
if
you
be
born
with
this
kind
of
passion
or
if
you
can
learn
it
but
i
do
know
you
need
it
if
you
love
your
work
you
will
be
out
there
every
day
try
to
do
it
the
best
you
possibly
can
and
pretty
soon
everybody
around
will
catch
the
passion
from
you
like
a
fever
rule
share
your
profit
with
all
your
associate
and
treat
them
as
partner
in
turn
they
will
treat
you
as
a
partner
and
together
you
will
all
perform
beyond
your
wild
expectation
remain
a
corporation
and
retain
control
if
you
like
but
behave
as
a
servant
leader
in
a
partnership
encourage
your
associate
to
hold
a
stake
in
the
company
offer
discount
stock

guaranteed
they
be
still
up
there
and
they
have
make
all
the
difference
rule
control
your
expense
well
than
your
competition
this
be
where
you
can
always
find
the
competitive
advantage
for
twenty
five
year
run
long
before
wal
mart
be
know
as
the
nation
large
retailer
we
ranked
number
one
in
our
industry
for
the
low
ratio
of
expense
to
sale
you
can
make
a
lot
of
different
mistake
and
still
recover
if
you
run
an
efficient
operation
or
you
can
be
brilliant
and
still
go
out
of
business
if
you
be
too
inefficient
rule
swim
upstream
go
the
other
way

the
conventional
wisdom

everybody
else
be
do
it
one
way
there
be
a
good
chance
you
can
find
your
niche
by
go
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
but
be
prepared
for
a
lot
of
folk
to
wave
you
down
and
tell
you
you
be
head
the
wrong
way
i
guess
in
all
my
year
what
i
heard
more
often
than
anything
be
a
town
of
less
than
population
cannot
support
a
discount
store
for
very
long
those
be
some
pretty
ordinary
rule
some
would
say
even
simplistic
the
hard
part
the
real
challenge
be
to
constantly
figure
out
way
to
execute
them
you
ca
not
just
keep
do
what
work
one
time
because
everything
around
you
be
always
change
to
succeed
you
have
to
stay
out
in
front
of
that
change

want
to
leave
a
legacy
with
the
possible
exception
of
henry
ford
sam
walton
be
the
entrepreneur
of
the
century
tom
peter
co
author
of
in
search
of
excellence
by
now
it
be
probably
clear
to
you
that
i
have
devote
most
of
my
life
to
wal
mart
start
it
grow
it
and
always
refining
the
concept
of
this
whole
phenomenon
my
life
have
be
full
and
fun
and
challenge
and
reward
beyond
even
my
wild
expectation
i
have
pretty
much
gotten
my
own
way
for
the
whole
run
while
a
lot
of
people
be
work
away
at
job
they
might
not
have
particularly
enjoy
i
be
have
the
time
of
my
life
if
i
be
not
in
the
store
try
to
pump
up
our
associate
to
do
an
even
well
job
or
in
the
office
look
over
number
to
see
where
the
next
trouble
spot
be
go
to
pop
up
or
lead
cheer
at
a
saturday
morning
meeting
i
be
probably
at
the
stick
of
my
airplane
look
out
over
some
part
of
this
beautiful
country
of
ours
and
check
out
the
number
of
car
in
those
kmart
parking
lot
or
maybe
i
be
take
a
few
hour
off
to
get
in
some
tennis
or
to
hunt
with
my
dog
all
that
have
wound
down
for
me
now
i
be
really
sick
these
day
and
i
guess
when
you
get
old
and
illness
catch
up
with
you
you
naturally
turn
just
a
little
bit
philosophical
especially
late
at
night
when
you
ca
not
sleep
and
your
mind
be
turn
everything
over
and
over
try
to
take
stock
of
where
you
have
be
and
what
you
have
do
the
truth
be
that
if
i
have
not
gotten
sick
i
doubt
i
would
have
write
this
book
or
take
the
time
to
try
to
sort
my
life
out
as
you
now
know
temperamentally
i
be
much
too
bias
toward
action
to
undertake
such
a
sedentary
project
but
since
i
have
i
be
go
to
go
all
the
way
and
try
to
share
with
you
how
i
feel
about
some
thing
that
seem
important
to
me
this
will
sound
strange
to
people
who
know
me
well
but
lately
i
have
wonder
if
i
should
feel
bad
about
have
be
so
wholly
commit
to
wal
mart
be
it
really
worth
all
the
time
i
spent
away
from
my
family
should
i
have
driven
my
partner
so
hard
all
these
year
be
i
really
leave
behind
something
on
this
earth
that
i
can
be
proud
of
have
accomplish
or
do
it
somehow
lack
meaning
to
me
now
that
i
be
face
the
ultimate
challenge
we
could
have
go
a
lot
of
different
way
at
several
point
many
folk
start
out
in
retailing
just
like
i
do
and
built
their
company
up
to
a
point
and
then
say
i
have
have
enough
and
sell
out
and
bought
an
island
i
could
have
kick
back
and
played
with
the
grandchild
or
i
could
have
devote
the
latter
year
of
my
life
to
good
work
i
guess
i
do
not
know
that
anybody
else
have
ever
do
it
quite
like
me
start
out
as
a
pure
neophyte
learn
his
trade
swept
the
floor
kept
the
book
trim
the
window
weigh
the
candy
rung
the
cash
register
instal
the
fixture
remodel
the
store
built
an
organization
of
this
size
and
quality
and
kept
on
do
it
right
up
to
the
end
because
they
enjoy
it
so
much
no
one
that
i
know
of
have
do
it
that
way
here
be
how
i
look
at
it
my
life
have
be
a
tradeoff
if
i
want
to
reach
the
goal
i
set
for
myself
i
have
to
get
at
it
and
stay
at
it
every
day
i
have
to
think
about
it
all
the
time
and
i
guess
what
david
glass
say
about
me
be
true
i
have
to
get
up
every
day
with
my
mind
set
on
improve
something
charlie
baum
be
right
too
when
he
say
i
be
driven
by
a
desire
to
always
be
on
the
top
of
the
heap
but
in
the
large
sense
the
life
and
death
sense
do
i
make
the
right
choice
have
now
thought
about
this
a
lot
i
can
honestly
say
that
if
i
have
the
choice
to
make
all
over
again
i
would
make
just
about
the
same
one
preacher
be
put
here
to
minister
to
our
soul
doctor
to
heal
our
disease
teacher
to
open
up
our
mind
and
so
on
everybody
have
their
role
to
play
the
thing
be
i
be
absolutely
convince
that
the
only
way
we
can
improve
one
another
quality
of
life
which
be
something
very
real
to
those
of
us
who
grow
up
in
the
depression
be
through
what
we
call
free
enterprise
practice
correctly
and
morally
and
i
really
believe
there
have
not
be
many
company
that
have
do
the
thing
we
have
do
at
wal
mart
we
have
improve
the
standard
of
living
of
our
customer
whom
we
have
save
billion
of
dollar
and
of
our
associate
who
have
be
able
to
share
profit
many
of
both
group
also
have
invest
in
our
stock
and
profit
all
through
the
year
when
we
start
out
the
whole
idea
be
nothing
but
a
pure
profit
motive
our
business
strategy
be
to
bring
the
customer
into
the
tent
by
sell
the
high
quality
good
we
could
at
the
low
possible
price
it
work
and
those
few
of
us
who
believe
in
it
from
early
on
and
invest
in
the
idea
get
rich
off
it
obviously
everybody
who
go
to
work
in
a
wal
mart
do
not
get
rich
but
there
have
be
many
story
over
the
year
of
associate
who
have
make
enough
at
least
to
buy
their
first
car
or
own
their
first
home
and
we
have
have
several
associate
who
have
retire
with
over
a
million
dollar
in
profit
share
we
have
be
able
to
help
our
associate
to
a
great
degree
than
most
company
because
of
what
you
would
have
to
call
enlighten
self
interest
we
be
selfish
enough
to
see
in
the
begin
the
value
to
the
company
of
let
them
share
the
profit
also
i
think
those
associate
in
our
company
who
believe
in
our
ideal
and
our
goal
and
get
with
the
program
have
felt
some
spiritual
satisfaction
in
the
psychological
rather
than
the
religious
sense
out
of
the
whole
experience
they
learn
to
stand
up
tall
and
look
people
in
the
eye
and
speak
to
them
and
they
feel
well
about
themselves
and
once
they
start
gain
confidence
there
be
no
reason
they
ca
not
keep
on
improve
themselves
many
of
them
decide
they
want
to
go
to
college
or
to
manage
a
store
or
take
what
they
have
learn
and
start
their
own
business
or
do
a
good
job
and
take
pride
in
that
wal
mart
have
help
their
pocketbook
and
their
self
esteem
there
be
certainly
some
union
folk
and
some
middleman
out
there
who
would
not
agree
with
me
but
i
believe
that
million
of
people
be
well
off
today
than
they
would
have
be
if
wal
mart
have
never
exist
so
i
be
just
awfully
proud
of
the
whole
deal
and
i
feel
good
about
how
i
chose
to
expend
my
energy
in
this
life
i
know
one
thing
for
sure
we
certainly
change
the
way
retail
work
in
this
country
and
when
i
say
we
i
do
not
mean
just
wal
mart
some
of
the
fellow
i
told
you
about
early
in
the
book
like
sol
price
and
harry
cunningham
and
john
geisse
deserve
a
lot
of
the
credit
too
the
whole
philosophy
have
change
in
the
retail
business
because
of
the
quality
discounter
of
whom
i
believe
we
be
the
very
best
almost
from
the
begin
our
objective
have
be
to
charge
just
as
little
as
possible
for
our
merchandise
and
to
try
and
use
what
muscle
we
have
have
to
work
out
deal
with
our
supplier
so
we
can
offer
the
very
best
quality
we
can
many
people
in
this
business
be
still
try
to
charge
whatever
the
traffic
will
bear
and
they
be
simply
on
the
wrong
track
i
will
tell
you
this
those
company
out
there
who
be
not
think
about
the
customer
and
focus
on
the
customer
interest
be
just
go
to
get
lose
in
the
shuffle
if
they
have
not
already
those
who
get
greedy
be
go
to
be
left
in
the
dust
there
be
lesson
in
what
happen
at
wal
mart
that
go
beyond
retail
and
apply
to
many
other
business
you
start
with
a
give
free
enterprise
be
the
engine
of
our
society
communism
be
pretty
much
down
the
drain
and
proven
so
and
there
do
not
appear
to
be
anything
else
that
can
compare
to
a
free
society
base
on
a
market
economy
nothing
can
touch
that
system
not
unless
leadership
and
management
get
selfish
or
lazy
in
the
future
free
enterprise
be
go
to
have
to
be
do
well
which
mean
it
benefit
the
worker
the
stockholder
the
community
and
of
course
management
which
must
adopt
a
philosophy
of
servant
leadership
recently
i
do
not
think
there
be
any
doubt
that
a
lot
of
american
management
have
bent
over
too
far
toward
take
care
of
itself
first
and
worry
about
everybody
else
later
the
japanese
be
right
on
this
point
you
ca
not
create
a
team
spirit
when
the
situation
be
so
onesided
when
management
get
so
much
and
worker
get
so
little
of
the
pie
some
of
these
salary
i
see
out
there
be
completely
out
of
line
and
everybody
know
it
it
be
obvious
that
most
company
would
be
much
well
serve
by
base
manager
pay
on
the
performance
of
the
company
or
return
on
investment
to
the
shareholder
or
some
yardstick
which
clearly
take
into
account
how
well
they
be
do
their
job
and
the
formula
have
to
make
sure
that
profit
be
divide
fairly
among
worker
management
and
stockholder
accord
to
their
contribution
and
risk
at
wal
mart
we
have
always
paid
our
executive
less
than
industry
standard
sometimes
maybe
too
much
less
but
we
have
always
reward
them
with
stock
bonus
and
other
incentive
related
directly
to
the
performance
of
the
company
it
be
no
coincidence
that
the
company
have
do
really
well
and
so
have
they
i
believe
our
way
of
look
at
thing
be
go
to
come
into
its
own
in
this
decade
and
the
next
century
the
way
business
be
conduct
worldwide
be
go
to
be
different
and
a
lot
of
that
difference
be
go
to
reflect
what
we
egotistically
think
of
as
the
wal
mart
way
in
the
global
economy
successful
business
be
go
to
do
just
what
wal
mart
be
always
try
to
do
give
more
and
more
responsibility
for
make
decision
to
the
people
who
be
actually
on
the
fire
line
those
who
deal
with
the
customer
every
day
good
management
be
go
to
start
listen
to
the
idea
of
these
line
soldier
pool
these
idea
and
disseminate
them
around
their
organization
so
people
can
act
on
them
that
be
the
way
the
successful
company
out
there
already
be
do
it
the
m
the
hewlett
packards
the
g
e
s
the
wal
mart
great
idea
come
from
everywhere
if
you
just
listen
and
look
for
them
you
never
know
who
go
to
have
a
great
idea
we
can
turn
the
whole
world
around
just
the
way
we
have
do
it
in
retail
we
can
do
it
well
than
the
japanese
because
we
be
more
innovative
we
be
more
creative
we
can
compete
with
labor
in
bangladesh
or
wherever
because
we
have
well
technology
which
can
give
us
more
efficient
equipment
we
can
get
beyond
a
lot
of
our
old
adversarial
relationship
and
establish
win
win
partnership
with
our
supplier
and
our
worker
which
will
leave
us
with
more
energy
and
talent
to
focus
on
the
important
thing
meeting
the
need
of
our
customer
but
all
this
require
overcome
one
of
the
most
powerful
force
in
human
nature
the
resistance
to
change
to
succeed
in
this
world
you
have
to
change
all
the
time
when
you
look
at
what
happen
to
the
american
auto
industry
it
be
tempt
to
want
to
treat
the
japanese
unfairly
the
way
they
treat
us
with
their
protectionist
law
our
auto
industry
do
not
play
on
level
ground
but
i
do
not
think
we
should
counter
with
protectionism
because
it
do
not
address
the
real
problem
the
quality
of
our
product
do
not
compete
with
that
of
the
japanese
whether
we
want
to
admit
it
or
not
the
challenge
be
a
great
one
for
management
what
they
have
to
do
be
build
a
partnership
with
their
people
i
understand
that
this
industry
have
all
kind
of
problem
we
have
not
see
in
ours
i
know
that
u
s
auto
worker
make
an
hour
versus
in
japan
and
that
mexican
auto
worker
earn
much
less
i
be
not
say
i
could
solve
all
these
problem
but
i
would
love
to
have
the
fun
of
try
to
take
a
unionized
company
today
and
sell
its
people
on
the
idea
of
have
to
be
competitive
globally
whether
it
be
in
auto
or
steel
or
electronics
i
would
love
a
chance
at
that
the
pleasure
of
see
if
they
could
be
motivate
into
a
team
that
would
share
in
all
the
company
success
and
still
have
a
union
it
would
take
a
powerful
lot
of
persuade
to
pull
this
off
but
i
guarantee
it
could
be
accomplish
by
somebody
obsess
and
persistent
enough
but
if
american
management
be
go
to
say
to
their
worker
that
we
be
all
in
this
together
they
be
go
to
have
to
stop
this
foolishness
of
pay
themselves
million
and
million
bonus
every
year
and
rid
around
everywhere
in
limo
and
corporate
jet
like
they
be
so
much
well
than
everybody
else
i
be
not
say
every
company
should
necessarily
be
as
chintzy
as
wal
mart
everybody
not
in
the
discount
business
consume
by
try
to
save
every
possible
dollar
for
their
customer
but
i
wonder
if
a
lot
of
these
company
would
not
do
just
as
well
if
their
executive
live
a
little
more
like
real
folk
a
lot
of
people
think
it
be
crazy
of
me
to
fly
coach
whenever
i
go
on
a
commercial
flight
and
maybe
i
do
overdo
it
a
little
bit
but
i
feel
like
it
be
up
to
me
as
a
leader
to
set
an
example
it
be
not
fair
for
me
to
ride
one
way
and
ask
everybody
else
to
ride
another
way
the
minute
you
do
that
you
start
building
resentment
and
your
whole
team
idea
begin
to
strain
at
the
seam
but
now
it
be
time
for
me
to
forget
about
all
that
be
past
and
think
about
what
i
really
want
the
legacy
of
wal
mart
to
be
in
the
future
i
would
like
to
believe
that
as
wal
mart
continue
to
thrive
and
grow
it
can
come
to
live
up
to
what
someone
once
call
us
the
lighthouse
of
the
ozarks
only
i
hope
we
can
spread
the
concept
far
than
our
home
region
here
in
the
foothill
because
we
be
really
a
national
company
now
for
wal
mart
to
maintain
its
position
in
the
heart
of
our
customer
we
have
to
study
more
way
we
can
give
something
back
to
our
community
i
be
tremendously
proud
of
the
thing
we
have
do
that
i
have
already
mention
and
we
be
already
study
way
we
can
go
far
to
stay
involve
to
be
more
socially
conscious
all
around
as
i
have
say
our
country
desperately
need
a
revolution
in
education
and
i
hope
wal
mart
can
contribute
at
some
level
if
for
no
other
reason
than
selfish
one
without
a
strong
educational
system
the
very
free
enterprise
system
that
allows
a
wal
mart
or
an
ibm
or
a
procter
gamble
to
appear
on
the
scene
and
strengthen
our
nation
economy
simply
wo
not
work
you
may
have
trouble
believe
it
but
every
time
we
have
test
the
old
say
it
have
paid
off
for
us
in
spade
the
more
you
give
the
more
you
get
finally
a
lot
of
folk
ask
me
two
related
question
all
the
time
the
first
one
be
could
a
wal
mart
type
story
still
occur
in
this
day
and
age
my
answer
be
of
course
it
could
happen
again
somewhere
out
there
right
now
there
be
someone
probably
hundred
of
thousand
of
someone
with
good
enough
idea
to
go
all
the
way
it
will
be
do
again
over
and
over
provide
that
someone
want
it
badly
enough
to
do
what
it
take
to
get
there
it
be
all
a
matter
of
attitude
and
the
capacity
to
constantly
study
and
question
the
management
of
the
business
the
second
question
be
if
i
be
a
young
man
or
woman
start
out
today
with
the
same
sort
of
talent
and
energy
and
aspiration
that
i
have
fifty
year
ago
what
would
i
do
the
answer
to
that
be
a
little
harder
to
figure
out
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
i
would
do
today
but
i
feel
pretty
sure
i
would
be
sell
something
and
i
expect
it
would
be
at
the
retail
level
where
i
could
relate
directly
to
customer
off
the
street
i
think
i
would
study
the
retail
field
today
and
go
into
the
business
that
offer
the
most
promise
for
the
least
amount
of
money
probably
some
kind
of
specialty
retail
something
to
do
with
computer
maybe
or
something
like
the
gap
even
the
body
shop
anyway
the
next
time
some
overeager
slightly
eccentric
shopkeeper
open
up
a
business
in
your
neck
of
the
wood
before
you
write
him
off
too
quickly
remember
those
two
old
codger
who
give
me
maybe
sixty
day
to
last
in
my
dime
store
down
in
fayetteville
go
check
the
new
store
out
see
what
they
have
get
to
offer
see
how
they
treat
you
and
decide
for
yourself
if
you
ever
want
to
go
back
because
this
be
what
it
be
really
all
about
in
this
free
country
of
ours
that
shopkeeper
success
be
entirely
up
to
you
the
customer
a
postscript
for
the
last
two
year
of
dad
life
he
fought
a
difficult
battle
against
a
form
of
bone
cancer
multiple
myeloma
which
from
the
time
of
diagnosis
he
understood
would
almost
certainly
prove
fatal
like
every
other
challenge
he
encounter
in
his
life
he
met
this
one
head
on
full
of
optimism
and
ready
to
try
new
way
of
conquer
the
problem
so
with
the
encouragement
of
the
whole
family
and
the
meticulous
hand
on
medical
care
management
of
my
brother
john
dad
embark
on
a
variety
of
experimental
treatment
program
with
a
group
of
excellent
doctor
he
take
his
medicine
but
he
never
dwell
on
either
the
illness
that
have
befallen
him
or
its
potential
cure
rather
he
seize
the
day
at
the
time
of
the
diagnosis
in
early
he
have
be
work
somewhat
ambivalently
on
an
autobiography
he
cancel
that
project
choose
instead
to
spend
most
of
his
time
and
energy
do
what
he
enjoy
most
fly
his
plane
from
town
to
town
go
from
wal
mart
to
wal
mart
visit
with
his
beloved
associate
toward
the
end
of
when
he
begin
to
realize
that
his
illness
be
catch
up
with
him
and
would
soon
limit
his
mobility
dad
at
the
urge
of
our
family
and
others
again
turn
his
attention
to
the
idea
of
put
his
story
down
on
paper
while
he
still
could
once
he
decide
to
write
it
he
threw
himself
into
this
book
project
with
the
same
focus
and
energy
he
apply
to
everything
he
do
in
life
he
be
very
particular
about
what
he
want
his
book
to
be
and
he
work
at
it
daily
make
revision
add
anecdote
refining
style
point
urge
others
to
contribute
their
memory
by
early
march
his
spirit
remain
high
as
he
continued
work
on
the
book
but
his
physical
condition
