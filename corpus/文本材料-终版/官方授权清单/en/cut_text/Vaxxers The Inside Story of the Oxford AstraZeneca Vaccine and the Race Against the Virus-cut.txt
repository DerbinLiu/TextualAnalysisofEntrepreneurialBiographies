prologue
we
don
t
know
what
s
in
it
i
spent
the
first
weekend
of
august
on
a
camp
trip
with
my
year
old
daughter
ellie
and
some
friend
the
last
six
month
in
oxford
have
be
crazy
but
now
here
we
be
on
a
remote
campsite
in
the
north
west
of
wale
with
our
little
tent
pitch
by
a
mountain
stream
no
phone
signal
and
no
electricity
it
be
a
welcome
chance
to
get
away
from
it
all
and
take
a
breath
by
the
sunday
even
ellie
have
have
enough
of
my
campfire
cooking
and
we
d
decide
to
treat
ourselves
to
dinner
from
the
pizza
van
wander
over
to
the
van
i
saw
that
my
friend
gabi
and
her
jack
russell
cookie
have
befriend
another
woman
and
dog
combination
their
conversation
have
start
like
so
many
in
the
last
few
month
how
have
you
be
cop
aren
t
these
time
strange
and
difficult
at
least
we
can
get
out
into
the
countryside
maybe
everything
will
be
back
to
normal
by
christmas
i
start
complain
about
the
lack
of
phone
signal
i
d
enjoy
the
peace
at
first
but
now
my
mind
be
on
the
zoom
meeting
i
have
the
next
morning
and
the
conversation
move
on
to
our
new
friend
s
worry
about
the
ongoing
g
installation
across
the
country
i
offer
that
public
health
england
have
found
the
technology
to
be
no
risk
to
health
and
i
didn
t
see
why
it
should
be
contentious
to
use
a
bit
more
of
the
radio
spectrum
to
give
us
well
connectivity
after
all
we
all
use
mobile
phone
and
we
all
knew
g
be
well
than
g
she
be
unconvinced
i
just
worry
she
say
we
just
don
t
know
but
we
do
know
i
thought
as
the
dog
continued
to
sniff
each
other
gabi
say
with
a
laugh
at
least
you
re
not
say
g
cause
covid
or
that
bill
gate
be
use
the
pandemic
to
fit
us
all
with
microchip
there
be
a
pause
gabi
have
touch
a
nerve
i
m
not
say
there
be
definitely
a
conspiracy
the
woman
put
forward
carefully
but
i
do
worry
that
we
don
t
know
what
they
put
in
these
vaccine
mercury
and
other
toxic
chemical
i
don
t
trust
them
they
don
t
tell
us
the
truth
at
this
moment
our
pizza
tomato
and
salami
no
cheese
at
my
daughter
s
insistence
be
ready
but
it
would
have
to
wait
of
course
i
wasn
t
away
from
it
all
why
have
i
imagine
i
would
be
it
be
everywhere
and
affect
everything
ok
i
say
after
take
a
second
to
think
i
have
to
introduce
myself
my
name
be
cath
green
and
i
might
not
look
like
it
in
my
bare
foot
and
this
dress
i
might
not
sound
like
it
either
believe
me
i
know
but
i
be
them
you
couldn
t
have
know
this
but
i
m
the
best
person
in
the
world
to
tell
you
what
s
in
the
vaccine
i
work
with
the
people
who
invent
it
it
s
me
and
my
team
in
my
lab
who
physically
make
it
we
order
the
ingredient
we
make
the
first
batch
we
make
more
batch
from
that
like
with
a
sourdough
starter
we
purify
it
down
and
we
put
it
into
the
tiny
little
vial
and
what
s
in
those
vial
be
what
s
be
use
now
in
the
trial
you
say
you
don
t
know
what
s
in
the
vaccine
but
i
do
i
know
exactly
what
s
in
it
and
you
can
ask
me
anything
you
want
about
it
we
talk
for
fifteen
minute
or
so
about
my
team
at
oxford
university
how
the
vaccine
be
design
and
how
we
be
try
to
make
enough
of
it
for
global
supply
to
make
sure
that
once
it
s
be
show
that
it
work
and
be
safe
everyone
who
need
it
can
get
it
i
go
through
the
list
of
ingredient
which
be
also
set
out
at
the
back
of
the
book
i
told
her
i
would
absolutely
be
prepared
to
give
it
to
my
own
family
it
be
all
very
amicable
and
i
hope
that
i
told
her
enough
about
me
to
let
her
see
that
i
be
not
the
thing
she
worry
about
a
global
elite
out
to
win
power
and
control
i
don
t
have
bill
gate
s
phone
number
i
don
t
know
how
to
put
a
nanobot
tracker
into
a
vaccine
i
m
just
cath
a
lighterman
s
daughter
do
my
best
with
the
knowledge
i
have
and
the
people
i
work
with
and
miss
hug
my
parent
like
everyone
else
i
don
t
know
whether
i
change
our
new
friend
s
mind
and
i
m
sorry
that
i
can
t
remember
her
name
or
her
dog
s
but
i
hope
our
conversation
let
her
see
another
side
to
the
story
one
that
definitely
have
its
moment
of
high
stake
human
drama
but
that
s
not
sensational
and
isn
t
design
around
newspaper
headline
or
tantalise
clickbait
it
s
a
story
of
decade
of
painstaking
preparation
of
collaborative
teamwork
across
discipline
sector
and
nationality
that
make
you
proud
to
be
human
it
s
a
story
of
ordinary
people
come
together
in
extraordinary
time
to
attempt
an
extraordinary
thing
i
have
many
similar
conversation
that
year
with
many
different
people
but
it
be
by
a
pizza
van
in
a
field
on
the
edge
of
snowdonia
that
i
decide
i
want
to
write
this
book
this
be
the
moment
i
knew
that
we
the
vaxxers
need
to
come
out
of
our
lab
and
explain
ourselves
the
story
isn
t
over
yet
the
end
have
not
be
write
but
we
have
come
a
long
way
towards
beating
this
virus
and
i
would
like
people
to
know
how
we
really
get
here
and
what
happens
next
how
we
get
out
of
this
mess
and
how
we
prepare
for
the
inevitable
next
one
but
right
then
i
be
on
holiday
my
daughter
be
get
bore
and
the
sun
be
come
out
we
say
a
friendly
goodbye
and
i
head
back
to
the
tent
for
a
slice
of
cold
pizza
and
a
warm
glass
of
wine
sarah
chapter
we
make
a
vaccine
november
this
be
the
story
of
a
race
not
as
it
have
so
often
be
portrayed
a
race
against
other
scientist
make
other
vaccine
with
billion
of
people
need
to
be
protect
we
be
always
go
to
need
all
the
vaccine
we
could
get
ideally
make
use
different
technology
so
that
if
one
fail
another
could
step
in
with
different
raw
material
to
minimise
the
likelihood
of
global
shortage
and
in
different
country
to
protect
against
hoard
and
vaccine
nationalism
instead
it
be
a
race
against
the
devastate
virus
that
take
million
of
life
ruin
livelihood
empty
school
kept
us
apart
from
people
we
love
and
close
down
entire
society
it
be
a
race
that
even
as
the
world
lock
down
in
the
first
month
of
we
have
in
some
way
already
lose
it
be
a
race
we
be
still
run
as
mutant
variant
threaten
to
escape
the
vaccine
and
treatment
we
have
developed
to
bring
the
pandemic
under
control
and
if
and
when
we
do
cross
the
finish
line
sadly
there
will
not
be
much
time
for
celebration
we
will
already
be
in
training
for
the
next
one

my
colleague
cath
and
i
decide
to
write
this
book
in
the
summer
of
by
this
point
we
have
design
our
vaccine
know
as
the
oxford
astrazeneca
vaccine
make
it
and
start
trialling
it
we
be
fairly
confident
that
it
would
work
but
we
do
not
yet
have
the
data
to
prove
it
the
country
be
start
to
open
up
again
and
though
there
be
warning
that
there
might
be
a
second
wave
people
s
life
seem
to
be
move
back
towards
something
like
normal
our
own
life
be
a
little
bit
more
normal
too
we
be
occasionally
have
a
day
off
at
the
weekend
and
i
be
force
myself
to
get
some
exercise
we
realise
that
we
want
to
do
something
to
engage
with
people
s
concern
about
vaccine
and
show
the
exquisite
care
and
attention
that
go
into
make
them
safe
we
want
to
dispel
some
myth
about
vaccine
science
and
scientist
and
we
want
the
chance
to
tell
the
real
story
at
least
our
part
of
the
story
of
how
we
make
the
oxford
vaccine
scientific
discovery
on
this
scale
be
very
rarely
a
eureka
moment
for
a
lone
genius
it
definitely
be
not
in
this
case
and
we
hope
we
never
sound
as
though
we
think
we
do
what
we
do
on
our
own
it
be
a
collaborative
effort
by
an
international
network
of
thousand
of
hero
dedicate
scientist
in
oxford
and
across
four
continent
but
also
clinician
regulator
manufacturer
and
the
brave
volunteer
citizen
who
offer
up
their
arm
for
us
and
week
after
week
stuck
cotton
bud
down
their
throat
and
though
there
be
plenty
of
drama
there
be
not
one
big
breakthrough
moment
in
a
bath
or
under
an
apple
tree
or
late
at
night
in
a
silent
empty
lab
but
rather
lot
and
lot
and
lot
of
small
moment
detail
after
detail
that
we
have
to
get
completely
right
item
after
item
to
be
ticked
off
the
list
problem
after
problem
that
have
to
be
solve
some
of
those
be
scientific
problem
how
do
we
make
this
genetically
stable
what
dose
of
the
vaccine
do
we
give
for
the
best
protection
how
many
dos
and
how
far
apart
others
be
economic
political
logistical
how
can
we
check
our
volunteer
temperature
when
thermometer
be
impossible
to
get
hold
of
how
can
we
get
vaccine
make
in
italy
into
the
arm
of
volunteer
in
the
uk
when
there
be
no
flight
where
be
the
money
for
all
of
this
come
from
countless
incremental
small
step
some
of
the
most
important
moment
have
actually
happen
before
anyone
have
ever
heard
of
covid
because
whenever
you
be
work
at
the
cut
edge
of
science
you
be
building
on
decade
of
meticulous
and
laborious
work
that
have
come
before
the
flipside
of
that
of
course
be
that
if
we
have
be
well
prepared
we
could
have
go
even
faster
those
of
us
work
in
the
field
have
expect
something
like
this
for
year
at
the
begin
lot
of
people
be
ask
why
do
we
not
see
this
come
the
answer
be
that
we
do
see
it
come
and
we
have
start
prepare
but
we
have
not
be
able
to
persuade
anyone
to
spend
the
money
that
we
need
to
do
what
be
require
so
what
do
we
have
to
do
to
be
ready
for
next
time
what
lesson
must
we
learn
to
prevent
us
from
have
to
go
through
this
again
we
have
always
know
that
whilst
vaccine
have
probably
save
more
life
than
any
other
scientific
discovery
they
also
more
than
almost
any
other
branch
of
medicine
make
people
anxious
perhaps
it
have
something
to
do
with
the
needle
perhaps
it
be
that
whereas
most
medicine
be
give
to
someone
who
be
already
ill
and
make
them
well
vaccine
be
give
to
people
who
be
healthy
to
prevent
something
that
might
never
happen
certainly
fear
and
doubt
often
rush
in
to
fill
gap
in
people
s
knowledge
so
we
want
to
try
to
fill
in
some
of
those
gap
ourselves
what
be
a
vaccine
and
why
do
we
need
them
how
do
they
work
how
have
it
be
possible
to
make
them
so
fast
what
be
in
them
how
do
we
know
they
be
safe
in
a
coronavirus
cause
a
disease
call
covid
swept
around
the
world
wreak
havoc
with
healthcare
system
economy
and
all
of
our
life
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
have
kill
more
people
in
one
year
than
any
infectious
disease
have
do
for
over
a
century
this
book
be
the
story
of
how
two
scientist
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
to
fight
back
we
be
not
big
pharma
or
them
we
be
two
ordinary
people
who
with
a
team
of
other
hard
work
dedicate
people
do
something
extraordinary
we
don
t
have
cleaner
or
driver
or
nanny
and
like
everyone
else
we
have
other
thing
go
on
in
our
life
there
be
day
when
we
swore
or
cry
with
frustration
and
exhaustion
we
lose
sleep
and
gain
weight
there
be
day
when
we
met
a
prince
or
a
prime
minister
and
other
day
when
it
seem
that
we
have
to
both
save
the
world
and
get
the
central
heating
fix
some
day
we
drank
champagne
others
we
struggle
to
find
anything
to
eat
for
lunch
there
be
day
when
we
seem
to
be
battling
against
our
employer
or
the
medium
or
a
swarm
of
wasp
as
well
as
the
virus
most
day
it
felt
like
our
big
chance
to
make
a
positive
impact
on
global
health
occasionally
it
felt
like
a
heavy
burden
to
bear
but
we
kept
go
as
do
many
others
who
work
alongside
us
for
long
day
through
weekend
and
bank
holiday
until
our
vision
of
a
vaccine
for
the
world
be
finally
realise

for
the
rest
of
my
life
people
will
ask
me
how
i
felt
at
the
moment
that
i
heard
about
the
trial
result
for
our
vaccine
the
answer
be
that
i
didn
t
have
any
strong
emotion
relief
that
the
vaccine
work
certainly
surprise
that
it
be
such
a
complicate
result
three
number
instead
of
one
trust
a
bunch
of
academic
to
come
up
with
that
concern
about
what
be
go
to
happen
next
and
then
i
take
myself
off
to
bed
before
anyone
get
the
chance
to
talk
to
me
i
wasn
t
allow
to
discus
this
with
anyone
it
be
late
in
the
even
on
saturday
november
professor
andy
pollard
my
colleague
run
the
clinical
trial
have
call
me
that
morning
to
tell
me
the
analysis
of
our
trial
data
would
be
happen
that
weekend
like
the
rest
of
the
world
we
have
be
wait
impatiently
for
this
moment
for
week
we
have
design
the
vaccine
in
a
few
day
in
january
at
that
point
on
a
just
in
case
basis
make
the
first
batch
in
a
record
break
sixty
five
day
as
it
have
become
clearer
and
clearer
that
a
vaccine
would
be
need
test
it
on
volunteer
in
four
continent
as
the
virus
rampage
across
the
planet
and
manufacture
million
of
dos
we
already
knew
it
be
very
safe
we
have
great
confidence
by
this
time
that
it
would
work
but
we
still
do
not
have
the
data
to
prove
it
the
analysis
we
be
wait
for
would
crunch
ten
of
thousand
of
data
point
from
the
thousand
of
volunteer
involve
in
the
trial
to
show
whether
and
how
well
our
vaccine
have
work
to
protect
them
against
covid
anything
over
would
be
consider
a
success
when
the
analysis
be
do
probably
sometime
on
the
sunday
andy
thought
that
would
trigger
the
process
of
inform
key
people
and
fill
in
the
blank
in
the
press
release
that
we
have
already
prepared
andy
told
me
to
get
a
good
night
s
sleep
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
wait
to
hear
from
him
with
the
news
i
have
first
talk
to
andy
about
him
be
chief
investigator
for
the
clinical
trial
back
in
february
my
work
be
in
early
vaccine
development
whereas
andy
have
be
responsible
for
several
very
large
vaccine
trial
and
have
enormous
experience
in
vaccine
policy
how
vaccine
be
actually
use
in
the
real
world
at
the
time
andy
have
no
idea
of
the
phenomenal
amount
of
work
he
be
let
himself
in
for
with
a
busy
week
come
up
i
knew
what
i
need
to
do
laundry
i
have
also
order
a
few
new
shirt
for
this
occasion
but
try
them
on
now
it
be
clear
that
one
do
not
suit
me
at
all
and
would
need
to
be
return
though
this
wasn
t
urgent
i
felt
that
complete
a
task
however
small
would
be
good
for
my
mental
health
the
drop
off
point
be
a
newsagent
s
a
mile
away
and
a
walk
on
that
crisp
november
day
would
also
help
as
i
walk
i
saw
quite
a
few
christmas
decoration
up
already
on
november
after
such
a
horrendous
year
it
seem
people
be
get
their
light
out
early
in
an
attempt
to
cheer
themselves
up
it
make
me
think
of
my
child
s
first
few
year
at
school
when
christmas
preparation
would
start
from
late
october
with
a
christmas
play
meaning
late
night
after
school
and
then
more
talk
of
christmas
non
stop
until
finally
term
finish
and
they
have
several
day
at
home
be
tire
and
not
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
and
it
still
wasn
t
christmas
this
year
the
early
christmas
tree
seem
to
drum
home
the
point
that
we
be
approach
the
end
of
the
year
and
we
still
didn
t
know
if
our
vaccine
would
work
i
continued
busying
myself
with
small
task
i
couldn
t
even
talk
to
my
family
about
what
be
happen
but
over
the
last
year
they
have
become
use
to
me
become
non
communicative
when
thing
be
difficult
at
work
they
knew
we
have
be
under
terrible
pressure
for
the
last
two
week
with
blood
sample
from
our
trial
volunteer
arrive
in
the
lab
and
need
to
be
process
one
shipment
of
sample
from
brazil
have
be
due
to
arrive
at
p
m
that
tuesday
but
have
actually
not
arrive
until
p
m
so
people
have
be
in
the
lab
check
thaw
divide
up
label
repacking
and
shipping
until
the
early
hour
of
wednesday
morning
later
that
day
i
have
make
the
unpopular
decision
to
send
home
anyone
not
work
on
the
blood
sample
because
of
rise
case
number
there
be
strict
rule
again
about
how
many
people
be
allow
to
be
in
the
lab
on
the
friday
we
have
start
run
out
of
freezer
space
so
i
have
spent
the
afternoon
beg
colleague
in
other
building
for
space
in
lockable
freezer
on
the
saturday
morning
i
have
spent
some
quiet
time
in
my
office
stick
label
onto
tube
ready
for
the
next
shipment
from
south
africa
a
lot
of
people
be
feel
stress
that
week
and
so
my
family
probably
put
my
withdrawn
behaviour
down
to
all
of
that
that
even
i
be
try
to
read
but
actually
doze
off
when
my
phone
ping
me
awake
with
a
message
from
andy
ask
me
to
do
a
video
call
it
be
odd
i
hadn
t
be
expect
to
hear
from
him
until
the
next
day
and
i
have
assume
he
would
then
just
be
tell
me
a
number
the
vaccine
s
efficacy
be
x
couldn
t
we
do
it
over
the
phone
i
message
back
no
he
need
to
show
me
some
slide
i
be
still
half
asleep
but
also
my
heart
be
race
why
be
this
happen
a
day
early
why
be
slide
need
once
i
have
the
laptop
set
up
andy
walk
me
through
his
slide
he
quickly
and
calmly
get
to
the
point
overall
efficacy
be
the
number
wasn
t
as
high
as
pfizer
s
or
moderna
s
announce
earlier
that
month
but
it
be
well
than
the
that
be
deem
the
minimum
for
the
vaccine
to
be
useful
and
much
well
than
the
that
some
commentator
have
be
warn
we
might
need
to
be
prepared
for
only
week
earlier
our
vaccine
be
effective
but
it
be
more
complicate
than
that
in
the
trial
we
have
test
a
number
of
different
dose
pattern
while
the
analysis
show
an
overall
efficacy
of
intriguingly
in
the
group
of
volunteer
who
have
receive
a
half
dose
follow
by
a
standard
dose
efficacy
be
in
the
group
who
have
receive
two
standard
dos
it
be
whenever
scientist
be
present
with
data
that
be
unexpected
we
wonder
if
it
be
a
chance
find
a
statistical
blip
but
look
at
it
in
more
detail
this
didn
t
seem
to
be
the
case
fn
colleague
at
astrazeneca
would
now
spend
sunday
repeat
the
analysis
our
oxford
university
statistician
have
already
do
so
that
we
would
have
two
independent
analysis
of
the
data
because
astrazeneca
be
a
publicly
list
company
the
result
have
to
be
announce
by
press
release
before
the
financial
market
open
on
monday
morning
i
spent
most
of
sunday
in
the
office
in
zoom
meeting
with
various
group
of
colleague
work
on
the
analysis
and
the
medium
plan
and
occasionally
pop
into
the
lab
to
check
that
everything
there
be
under
control
but
i
couldn
t
chat
for
long
because
i
couldn
t
let
anyone
in
the
lab
know
that
i
knew
the
efficacy
result
let
alone
what
it
be
everyone
work
on
the
vaccine
have
be
warn
that
they
would
probably
hear
the
result
on
the
news
to
give
myself
something
to
do
i
walk
to
the
shop
and
picked
up
some
fruit
for
the
lab
team
it
have
be
pizza
and
cake
for
several
day
by
p
m
the
word
for
the
press
release
which
i
would
need
to
approve
have
still
not
be
finalise
i
give
up
wait
and
go
to
bed
slept
fitfully
and
woke
soon
after
a
m
to
see
that
it
have
arrive
in
my
inbox
i
sent
my
approval
and
then
try
to
get
back
to
sleep
the
press
release
would
go
out
at
seven
and
i
knew
a
day
of
medium
interview
await
me
monday
morning
be
frosty
at
know
the
puddle
on
the
unlit

i
decide
to
abandon
the
bike
scrape
the
ice
off
the
car
and
drive
in
in
the
otherwise

building
two
people
be
cleaning

mask
tucked
under
their
nose
which
be
completely
useless
i
politely
told
them
that
the
mask
have
to
go
over
their
nose
as
well
sit
in
my
office
for
what
felt
like
the
millionth
time
that
year
i
turn
on
my
computer
and
clicked
the
link
to
the
press
team
s
spreadsheet
to
find
out
which
journalist
i
have
to
speak
to

couldn
t

of
click
i
give
up

to
the
loo
with
my
hairbrush
and
make
up
bag
and
discover
what

like
a
large
insect

on
my
left
cheek
red
and
swollen
by
the
time

since
when
she
found
me
in
my
office
that
morning
she
thought
i

well
up
with
emotion
over
the
enormity
of
what
we
have
achieve
she
reassure
me
that

have
have
very
little
sleep
and
now
have
to
face
a
day
of
press
interview

turn
out
that
my
first
call

there
have
be
no

i
hadn
t
have
any

make
myself

as
the
caffeine
start
to
kick
in
i
take
a
few
deep

of
my
day
job
which
be
develop
vaccine
against
five
other
disease
at
some
point
in
the
afternoon
someone
popped
their
head
around
my
office
door
to
suggest
buying
champagne
for
the
team
member
who
be
in
the
building
i
be
so
tire
i
have
really
hop
to
leave
the
celebration
for
another
day
but
others
be
keen
to
have
a
socially
distance
drink
the
plan
be
for
people
to
collect
a
glass
from
a
table
in
the
corridor
take
it
back
to
their
desk
and
join
a
video
call
so
at
around
five
o
clock
i
pour
myself
a
tiny
bit
of
champagne
sip
from
my
coffee
cup
we
be
short
of
glass
i
start
to
relax
i
briefly
enjoy
that
end
of
the
week
wind
down
feel
before
realise
it
be
still
monday
the
week
seem
to
have
go
on
for
several
month
already
some
of
the
journalist
have
ask
me
what
it
have
be
like
to
tell
my
family
and
i
have
to
confess
that
i
hadn
t
i
have
just
sent
a
whatsapp
message
around
a
m
say
big
news
day
when
i
get
home
they
hug
me
and
direct
me
out
of
the
kitchen
where
a
celebratory
meal
be
be
prepared
we
ate
together
raise
a
glass
of
wine
in
a
toast
and
finally
i
be
able
to
go
and
sleep

that
be
monday
november
seven
month
to
the
day
since
we
have
immunise
our
first
volunteer
in
the
first
trial
of
our
vaccine
and
less
than
a
year
since
anyone
have
ever
heard
of
a
novel
coronavirus
cause
pneumonia
in
wuhan
china
there
be
some
jubilant
headline
temper
by
increase
concern
about
rise
case
a
lot
be
make
of
the
fact
that
our
vaccine
unlike
others
do
not
need
to
be
kept
in
ultra
cold
freezer
but
could
be
transport
and
store
at
normal
fridge
temperature
this
would
make
it
vastly
easy
to
distribute
and
use
in
the
uk
and
around
the
world
a
lot
be
make
too
of
how
much
cheaper
this
vaccine
would
be
and
the
commitment
to
supply
it
at
cost
in
perpetuity
to
low
and
middle
income
country
there
be
excitement
that
we
have
million
dos
on
order
in
the
uk
enough
to
vaccinate
every
adult
and
billion
of
dos
be
manufacture
around
the
world
for
but
it
didn
t
take
long
before
the
negative
press
start
commentator
and
stock
market
analyst
in
the
united
state
attack
our
result
we
have
not
publish
enough
information
we
need
to
be
more
transparent
we
be
cherry
pick
our
data
our
half
dose
trial
result
be
base
on
a
mistake
and
therefore
suspect
we
have
not
include
enough
old
people
in
our
trial
anthony
fauci
since
the
director
of
the
national
institute
of
allergy
and
infectious
disease
and
one
of
the
most
highly
respect
scientist
in
the
field
compare
our
efficacy
result
unfavourably
with
pfizer
s
and
moderna
s
and
ask
why
anyone
would
want
to
receive
our
vaccine
the
uk
medium
start
to
pick
up
and
repeat
what
be
be
say
in
the
us
all
of
this
felt
very
unfair
not
to
mention
unhelpful
the
important
point
be
that
we
have
a
vaccine
that
be
very
safe
and
highly
effective
against
an
unbearably
awful
disease
but
that
point
be
get
lose
it
have
not
be
our
choice
to
put
the
result
in
a
press
release
as
academic
we
would
usually
publish
our
full
result
in
a
detailed
peer
review
paper
set
out
clearly
our
methodology
and
full
of
graph
and
kaplan
meier
curve
for
the
whole
scientific
community
to
pore
over
but
we
be
work
with
a
publicly
list
company
astrazeneca
and
when
a
publicly
list
company
receives
information
that
could
affect
its
share
price
legally
it
have
to
release
that
information
straightaway
to
prevent
insider
trading
so
it
have
to
be
a
press
release
first
the
academic
paper
which
be
submit
for
peer
review
the
day
after
the
press
release
would
contain
the
detail
to
answer
all
the
criticism
be
level
at
us
but
until
it
could
be
peer
review
edit
and
publish
the
information
vacuum
be
be
fill
by
speculation
we
could
only
be
grateful
to
those
british
scientist
come
to
our
defence
and
wait
as
celebratory
gift
arrive
in
my
office
champagne
card
flower
chocolate
bottle
of
vodka
and
a
cheque
for
from
a
grateful
pensioner
to
buy
some
mince
pie
i
wonder
whether
they
have
be
sent
before
the
negative
press
start
or
in
spite
of
it
in
any
case
we
really
appreciate
the
gesture
a
week
later
cycling
in
to
work
i
be
feel
somewhat
sorry
for
myself
which
be
not
a
particularly
constructive
emotion
so
during
the
privacy
of
my
twenty
minute
cycle
ride
i
ask
myself
why
i
be
get
endless
request
for
medium
interview
which
would
only
increase
once
our
paper
be
publish
i
have
to
keep
the
plate
spin
on
all
my
other
project
i
be
feel
the
pressure
of
have
kept
my
knowledge
of
the
efficacy
result
away
from
my
family
which
have
make
me
feel
cut
off
from
them
and
i
miss
my
son
my
daughter
be
at
home
have
reluctantly
decide
to
study
remotely
this
year
but
i
hadn
t
see
my
son
since
september
almost
twenty
two
year
earlier
i
have
give
birth
to
triplet
become
a
mother
of
three
within
the
space
of
sixteen
hour
and
now
have
one
of
my
child
away
from
home
in
such
difficult
circumstance
left
me
with
an
underlie
sense
of
tension
i
found
myself
check
the
covid
case
number
for
bath
where
he
be
living
every
day
for
one
interview
i
have
be
sent
a
list
of
sixteen
question
to
prepare
the
last
one
be
what
have
you
put
on
hold
during
that
you
be
look
forward
to
do
when
this
be
finish
even
think
about
that
as
i
read
the
email
my
eye
fill
with
tear
i
told
them
that
if
they
ask
me
that
question
i
would
cry
the
wall
between
my
professional
self
and
my
private
self
be
crumble
so
i
prepared
an
answer
that
i
could
give
without
get
emotional
i
want
to
take
my
family
on
a
wonderful
holiday
and
of
course
have
work
so
hard
for
such
a
long
time
it
be
dishearten
to
be
the
subject
of
so
much
criticism
the
best
approach
be
to
ignore
it
but
some
of
my
colleague
seem
to
be
take
thing
personally
they
want
to
engage
point
by
point
with
the
critic
and
be
keen
to
barge
in
and
explain
to
me
and
andy
that
by
not
do
so
we
be
be
defeatist
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
explain
why
their
prefer
approach
be
not
go
to
be
helpful
two
long
and
difficult
week
after
our
initial
press
release
on
december
the
lancet
publish
our
paper
fn
it
be
the
first
publication
of
full
phase
iii
efficacy
data
for
any
of
the
covid
vaccine
but
although
our
paper
do
answer
the
criticism
it
do
not
silence
the
critic
the
us
biotech
press
in
particular
be
present
vaccine
development
as
a
competition
that
require
winner
and
loser
with
pfizer
and
moderna
cast
as
the
winner
and
oxford
astrazeneca
as
the
loser
one
article
that
stung
refer
to
the
middle
performance
of
our
vaccine
and
fumble
clinical
trial
in
reality
the
only
competition
be
between
a
virus
and
human
ingenuity
with
my
colleague
i
have
be
say
to
the
press
for
month
that
the
world
be
go
to
need
multiple
vaccine
it
wasn
t
about
winner
and
loser
it
be
about
save
life

i
have
anticipate
that
once
our
efficacy
result
be
publish
thing
might
quieten
down
in
fact
the
next
few
week
as
our
vaccine
be
give
a
licence
by
the
uk
regulator
and
then
start
to
be
roll
out
in
the
uk
and
across
the
world
be
if
anything
busier
and
more
of
an
emotional
roller
coaster
than
ever
whilst
efficacy
be
of
course
an
important
number
the
real
impact
of
a
vaccine
be
dependent
not
just
on
that
one
number
but
also
on
how
much
of
it
you
can
make
supply
how
many
people
you
can
get
it
to
delivery
and
how
many
of
those
people
then
take
it
acceptance
and
apart
from
that
what
matter
in
the
long
term
be
not
efficacy
as
measure
in
a
clinical
trial
but
effectiveness
meaning
what
happens
when
the
vaccine
be
use
on
a
large
scale
in
the
real
world
unless
vaccine
be
compare
head
to
head
in
the
same
clinical
trial
the
efficacy
figure
cannot
be
directly
compare
because
of
sometimes
major
sometimes
subtle
difference
in
the
way
the
trial
be
set
up
and
run
on
the
day
that
our
lancet
paper
be
publish
the
uk
become
the
first
country
in
the
world
to
begin
to
roll
out
the
pfizer
vaccine
but
supply
be
limited
and
the
vaccine
need
very
careful
handle
and
special
arrangement
for
ultra
low
temperature
storage
initial
roll
out
be
slow
with
vaccine
administer
in
the
first
week
and
around
in
the
follow
week
at
the
same
time
case
number
in
the
uk
soar
dramatically
at
least
partly
fuel
by
a
new
more
transmissible
variant
of
the
virus
know
variously
as
the
kent
variant
the
english
variant
or
b
tighter

at
a
dizzy
pace
nh
staff

with
rise
case
number
and
concerned
about
fall
ill
themselves
be
ask
to
be
give
priority
over
people
living
in
care
home
for
the
limited
supply
of
vaccine
available
and
then
there
be
a
last
minute
admission
that
we
would
not
after
all
be
able
to
go
ahead
with
plan
to
relax
restriction
over
christmas
but
in
the
midst
of
this
good
news
do
come
on
december
the
uk
regulator
the
medicine
and
healthcare
product
regulatory
agency
mhra
announce
emergency
use
licensure
of

it
be
a
triumphant
day
for
the
team
the
culmination
of
almost
exactly
a
year
s
work
that
morning
i
listen
to
the
six
familiar
pip
of
the
bbc

and
then
the
headline
on
the

the

the
post

lie
there
hearing
our
achievement
sum
up
so
briefly
i
reflect
that
it
be
month
since
i
have
still
be
in
bed
at
a
m
and
hop
it

a

that
normality
could
be
return
after
a
turbulent
and
frantic
year
exultant

once
more
this
be
a
bright
shaft
of
light
a
game
changer
in
the
bad
of
time
the
best
of
news
with
so
many
more
dos
available
of
a

that
be
so
much
easy
to
handle

could
be
speed
up
dramatically
the
follow
monday
january
after
the

have
marked
a
very
subdue

i
would
have
to

my
turn
that
even
with

into

for
a

day
the

out
negative

only
add
to
the
sense
of
desperation
for

it
have
be

to
change
the
interval
between
dos
from
three
or
four
week
to
twelve

this
be
in

to
give
as
many
people
as

s
country
from

as
more
data
become
available
we
be
able
to
show
that
our

be
actually
more
effective
than
our
initial
analysis
on
november
have
suggest
and
that
a
twelve
week
interval
between
dos
provide
well
protection
than
a
shorter

vindicate
the
decision
that
have
of
necessity
be
take
without
the
benefit
of
a
full
data
set
it
also
become
clear
that
our
vaccine
would
not
only
protect
those
vaccinate
from
become
ill
but
would
also
significantly
reduce
transmission
of
the

to
others
our
vaccine
be
show
to
provide
protection
against
the
kent
variant

would
most
likely
prevent
at
least
severe
disease
cause
by
the
brazil
and
south
africa
variant
all
of
this
be
extremely
good
news
and
then
on
monday
february
the
first
real
world
effectiveness
data
be
publish
for
the
two
vaccine

pfizer
and
astrazeneca
three
month
on
from
our
phase
iii
trial
efficacy
result
this
be
a
moment
i
doubt
i
will
ever
be
ask
about
but
it
be
one
i
will
always
remember
a
study
of
the
entire
population
of
scotland
include
million
people
who
have
receive
a
vaccine
found
that
the
pfizer
vaccine
be
effective
in
prevent
hospitalisation
three
week
after
a
first
dose
and
the
oxford
astrazeneca
vaccine
be
effective
it
also
report
that
in
people
over
effectiveness
of
both
vaccine
after
a
first
dose
be
which
be
the
first
time
i
have
see
data
from
that
age
group
report
i
read
these
number
with
wide
eye
and
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
it
s
common
for
effectiveness
data
meaning
data
about
how
a
vaccine
work
when
it
be
use
in
the
whole
population
in
the
real
world
to
be
low
than
the
efficacy
data
report
in
clinical
trial
by
way
of
illustration
in
our
trial
no
one
who
have
receive
the
vaccine
have
be
hospitalise
give
an
efficacy
against
hospitalisation
of
in
real
life
with
the
vaccine
be
give
to
mainly
very
elderly
people
some
of
whom
be
in
care
home
or
be
already
suffer
from
fail
health
the
number
would
never
be
but
to
see
be
incredible
this
be
the
crucial
first
data
on
the
impact
of
our
vaccine
on
death
hospitalisation
and
illness
out
in
the
real
world
and
it
be
spectacular
and
in
the
first
direct
comparison
of
two
license
vaccine
in
large
number
of
people
in
the
real
world
our
vaccine
be
perform
as
well
as
pfizer
s
despite
the
difference
in
the
efficacy
data
report
from
clinical
trial
there
be
still
a
lot
for
us
to
do
we
be
still
very
busy
work
on
vaccine
against
new
variant
and
it
be
concern
that
our
vaccine
be
still
unpopular
and
mistrust
in
continental
europe
but
it
felt
like
our
roller
coaster
might
at
last
be
slow
down
and
allow
us
to
step
off
tentative
blinking
and
a
bit
shaken
back
to
normality
the
last
weekend
of
february
be
bright
and
sunny
and
i
finally
stop
use
the
excuse
that
the
field
be
too
muddy
to
run
in
and
take
myself
out

on
monday

with
the

more

in

science
doesn
t
exist
in
a
vacuum
when
we
start
to
work
on

across
the

we
be
draw
on

what

the
will

do
it
quickly
always
planning
multiple
step
ahead
with
early
vaccine
roll
out
and
public
health
benefit
in
mind
we
want
to
save
life
not
to
make
money
and
we
want
to
draw
on
everything
we
have
learn
from
the
previous
attempt
to
develop
vaccine
at
speed
so
that
we
didn
t
waste
time
wait
for
someone
else
to
play
their
part
what
none
of
us
foresaw
be
how
the
vaccine
would
become
a
political
football
our
year
of
constant
painstaking
attention
to
detail
result
in
a
vaccine
with
the
potential
to
save
million
of
life
around
the
world
could
be
dismiss
by
a
politician
with
a
grudge
carefully
word
statement
to
the
medium
explain
the
science
behind
the
vaccine
would
disappear
in
a
twitter
storm
of
bias
and
misinformation
with
incorrect
statement
repeatedly
cite
as
fact
be
we
simply
too
idealistic
too
naive
certainly
next
time
and
there
will
be
a
next
time
we
should
add
some
political
scientist
to
the
team
step
back
to
reflect
i
would
remind
myself
that
for
year
people
have
be
tell
me
the
technology
behind
my
vaccine
be
too
slow
or
too
expensive
or
just
not
good
enough
less
than
a
year
earlier
i
have
be
struggle
to
raise
a
few
hundred
thousand
pound
to
begin
work
on
this
vaccine
just
a
few
month
earlier
sensible
scientist
have
still
be
say
we
might
never
develop
an
effective
vaccine
against
covid
just
a
week
before
pfizer
have
report
its
efficacy
result
we
be
have
our
expectation
manage
that
would
be
a
good
result
and
might
be
acceptable
in
fact
in
less
than
a
year
we
have
produce
a
vaccine
that
be
very
safe
that
be
highly
effective
include
in
old
people
that
prevent
death
or
hospitalisation
after
one
dose
that
reduce
transmission
that
could
be
transport

store
at

rather
than

that
would
be
available
around

x

confirm
case
confirm
death
on
new
year
s
day
i
be
sit
at
my
desk
at
home
go
through
my
work
email
and
browsing
a
few
news
website
i
checked
in
with
promedmail
a
site
that
report
on
disease
outbreak
around
the
world
and
something
caught
my
attention
there
be
report
of
pneumonia
of
unknown
cause
in
wuhan
china
four
case
with
high
fever
and
pneumonia
not
respond
to
antibiotic
first
patient
work
at
a
seafood
market
interest
far
down
the
page
it
be
suggest
that
this
could
mark
the
return
of
sars
but
that
citizen
need
not
panic
and
more
information
would
follow
pneumonia
of
unknown
cause
could
be
lot
of
thing
and
i
make
a
mental
note
to
check
back
later
on
these
four
case
for
now
it
be
still
the
holiday
so
i
shut
down
my
laptop
and
go
to
join
the
rest
of
the
family
in
the
kitchen
where
we
have
a
new
christmas
jigsaw
on
the
go
and
a
stack
of
half
complete
crossword
when
i
look
again
the
next
day
there
be
a
new
report
twenty
seven
people
most
of
them
stallholders
from
the
seafood
market
have
be
hospitalise
and
seven
be
in
a
serious
condition
the
market
have
be
close
transmission
from
seafood
to
human
seem
highly
unlikely
to
me
fish
and
shellfish
be
not
normally
consider
to
be
source
of
virus
that
can
infect
human
however
reading
on
i
saw
that
there
be
now
confirmation
from
local
medium
that
other
animal
include
pheasant
snake
and
rabbit
have
also
be
on
sale
in
the
market
by
january
in
between
a
cold
sunny
walk
through
the
oxfordshire
countryside
a
pub
lunch
and
make
dinner
to
suit
each
family
member
s
different
taste
i
be
check
in
regularly
to
look
for
update
a
post
that
day
report
forty
four
case
with
eleven
people
critically
ill
and
close
contact
of
those
infect
be
monitor
the
disease
be
sars
like
the
post
say
but
it
be
still
unclear
what
be
cause
it
whilst
influenza
avian
flu
and
adenovirus
have
be
rule
out
there
be
many
other
respiratory
virus
that
could
be
responsible
i
checked
the
website
again
that
even
look
for
new
detail
new
clue
and
i
ran
through
the
possibility
in
my
mind
maybe
whatever
it
be
would
simply
disappear
we
might
learn
what
it
be
but
never
need
to
produce
a
vaccine
against
it
on
the
other
hand
this
really
could
be
a
new
outbreak
of
sars
or
something
sars
like
or
something
even
bad

as
a
professor
of
vaccinology
at
the
university
of
oxford
i
have
be
work
for
year
on
develop
vaccine
most
recently
against
so
call
emerge
pathogen
pathogen
be
micro
organism
that
can
make
us
ill
emerge
pathogen
be
those
pathogen
that
don
t
normally
infect
human
although
we
may
come
into
contact
with
the
wild
or
domesticate
animal
that
they
do
infect
and
that
have
the
potential
to
cause
severe
outbreak
when
human
become
infect
and
for
which
few
or
no
vaccine
or
treatment
exist
so
my
job
be
to
develop
vaccine
against
some
of
the
emerge
pathogen
we
already
know
about
and
prepare
to
make
a
vaccine
very
quickly
if
a
new
one
be
identify
if
this
new
illness
in
china
be
indeed
sars
or
sars
like
we
be
in
trouble
in
a
virus
previously
unknown
to
science
and
now
know
as
sars
or
sars
cov
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
begin
to
cause
pneumonia
in
a
province
of
china
scientist
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
have
most
likely
first
be
transmit
from
bat
to
human
via
small
mammal
like
raccoon
dog
ferret
badger
civet
or
domestic
cat
the
disease
spread
eventually
infect
people
from
twenty
nine
country
and
cause
death
there
be
no
vaccine
or
specific
treatment
and
around
of
those
infect
do
not
survive
vaccine
development
get
underway
but
it
didn
t
get
far
before
the
disease
have
be
contain
and
eradicate
by
the
century
old
but
very
effective
method
of
contact
trace
and
quarantine
find
the
case
identify
their
contact
and
keep
the
contact
in
quarantine
until
it
be
know
that
they
be
not
infect
the
outbreak
have
start
in
november
and
be
all
but
over
by
june
of
there
be
no
immediate
need
for
a
vaccine
although
we
couldn
t
be
certain
that
there
would
never
be
another
outbreak
of
sars
the
virus
be
presumably
still
circulate
in
bat
and
maybe
other
specie
another
very
nasty
coronavirus
then
appear
in
as
it
start
infect
people
living
in
the
middle
east
it
become
know
as
middle
east
respiratory
syndrome
or
mers
cov
coronaviruses
be
often
found
in
bat
and
many
simply
stay
within
bat
population
without
ever
cause
any
problem
for
human
however
sometimes
as
have
happen
with
sars
and
as
probably
also
happen
in
this
case
with
mers
the
bat
can
pas
on
their
infection
to
other
mammal
to
which
human
be
more
commonly
expose
it
eventually
become
clear
that
mers
cov
be
endemic
meaning
it
be
common
within
camel
population
in
the
middle
east
and
that
people
come
into
contact
with
infect
camel
be
themselves
become
infect
for
many
people
living
in
society
in
which
camel
have
played
an
important
role
for
century
this
be
hard
to
accept
instead
many
other
animal
be
consider
as
the
source
of
the
infection
could
it
be
cat
or
dog
what
seem
most
likely
to
have
happen
be
that
around
fifty
year
earlier
camel
from
africa
already
infect
with
mers
cov
from
bat
be
import
into
the
middle
east
the
disease
cause
barely
any
symptom
in
camel
so
it
be
not
obvious
that
they
be
bring
a
viral
infection
with
them
gradually
though
the
infection
then
spread
amongst
the
camel
in
the
region
mers
in
camel
be
a
lot
like
the
common
cold
in
human
young
camel
don
t
become
severely
ill
with
it
but
they
do
spread
it
camel
develop
antibody
as
they
recover
but
the
antibody
do
not
provide
lifelong
protection
so
they
can
be
re
infect
later
again
experience
only
a
very
mild
or
even
asymptomatic
illness
if
mers
have
remain
in
the
camel
population
it
would
not
have
cause
a
problem
and
probably
would
never
have
be
discover
however
as
more
and
more
camel
become
infect
it
spill
over
into
human
meaning
that
people
start
to
become
infect
as
well
in
africa
where
the
original
infect
camel
come
from
camel
tend
to
be
kept
in
herd
like
cattle
or
sheep
but
in
the
middle
east
camel
can
be
treat
more
like
family
pet
with
much
more
contact
with
human
and
so
more
opportunity
for
the
virus
to
be
pass
on
as
we
know
coronaviruses
be
pass
from
human
to
human
when
tiny
droplet
breathe
or
coughed
or
sneeze
from
the
nose
or
mouth
of
an
infect
person
enter
the
body
of
another
person
through
their
nose
mouth
or
eye
the
mers
virus
in
the
breath
of
an
infect
camel
be
breathe
in
by
anyone
come
close
to
that
camel
but
that
alone
doesn
t
necessarily
mean
the
virus
infects
that
person
there
s
another
crucial
step
before
a
virus
can
cause
an
infection
in
order
to
infect
a
cell
a
virus
need
to
latch
onto
a
receptor
on
the
surface
of
that
cell
the
cell
that
make
up
our
body
be
surround
by
a
smooth
membrane
which
be
stud
with
receptor
that
sense
the
environment
around
the
cell
and
allow
it
to
interact
with
signal
come
from
other
part
of
the
body
for
example
adrenaline
produce
in
response
to
stress
fear
or
exercise
have
to
bind
to
a
particular
receptor
on
the
surface
of
a
cell
to
exert
its
effect
different
virus
latch
onto
different
receptor
and
the
fit
have
to
be
good
for
the
virus
to
be
able
to
infect
the
cell
a
bit
like
a
phone
charger
need
to
fit
the
socket
on
a
phone
for
example
the
mers
cov
virus
latch
onto
the
dipeptidyl
peptidase
protein
know
as
dpp
it
isn
t
important
for
our
purpose
here
to
understand
much
about
dpp
it
play
a
part
in
immune
regulation
it
be
only
important
to
know
that
it
turn
out
that
dpp
in
camel
and
human
be
almost
identical
this
be
the
key
to
how
the
virus
could
infect
human
so
easily
have
this
receptor
be
different
in
human
the
virus
that
easily
infects
camel
cell
and
be
transmit
between
camel
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
infect
a
human
cell
the
camel
virus
could
have
be
breathe
in
with
no
effect
on
a
person
at
all
there
be
million
of
virus
that
for
this
reason
be
no
threat
to
us
whatsoever
however
in
this
case
mers
cov
happens
to
bind
onto
dpp
on
both
camel
and
human
cell
very
efficiently
so
the
virus
pass
easily
from
camel
to
human
by
january
around
eight
year
after
the
first
mers
infection
be
found
there
have
be
over
confirm
case
in
twenty
seven
country
and
death
most
of
the
case
have
be
in
saudi
arabia
where
there
have
be
outbreak
in
old
people
and
in
hospital
once
the
virus
get
inside
a
hospital
where
there
be
many
susceptible
people
in
close
proximity
it
can
spread
quickly
this
be
exactly
what
happen
in
south
korea
in
a
south
korean
businessman
have
travel
in
the
middle
east
and
become
unwell
after
return
home
in
the
nine
day
between
initially
seek
medical
help
and
diagnosis
he
visit
a
number
of
hospital
result
in
an
outbreak
that
infect
people
of
whom
thirty
eight
die
more
than
people
be
quarantine
to
bring
the
outbreak
under
control
thousand
of
school
be
close
and
there
be
significant
effect
on
the
economy
as
retail
sale
decline
and
interest
rate
be
cut
the
south
korean
outbreak
be
closely
study
as
it
offer
a
rare
opportunity
since
it
have
be
initiate
by
one
know
individual
it
be
possible
to
track
the
course
of
the
outbreak
very
precisely
and
gain
an
understand
of
how
the
disease
have
spread
healthcare
worker
be
test
and
virologist
also
test
sample
of
the
air
and
surface
in
hospital
to
find
out
where
the
live
virus
could
be
found
what
they
discover
be
that
even
young
healthcare
worker
have
become
infect
and
despite
have
very
mild
almost
asymptomatic
infection
they
have
be
able
to
spread
the
disease
to
others
this
make
mers
quite
different
from
sars
with
sars
infect
people
always
have
recognisable
often
severe
symptom
make
the
job
of
contact
trace
and
quarantine
somewhat
easy
while
sars
have
be
eradicate
mers
continue
to
cause
infection
in
the
middle
east
to
this
day
to
try
and
keep
infection
down
the
riyadh
camel
market
have
now
be
move
well
away
from
the
city
as
i
discover
myself
when
i
visit
it
with
naif
alharbi
a
saudi
former
student
of
mine
but
this
have
not
be
enough
to
stamp
out
mers
not
all
of
those
infect
turn
out
to
have
have
direct
contact
with
camel
meanwhile
some
young
and
healthy
people
who
work
with
camel
evidently
have
antibody
against
mers
but
be
not
aware
of
ever
have
be
ill
with
it
it
seem
likely
that
young
and
healthy
people
work
with
camel
be
become
infect
and
suffer
a
mild
cold
like
illness
during
which
time
they
be
unwittingly
transmit
the
virus
to
others
who
be
more
vulnerable
so
you
may
be
wonder
what
do
all
of
this
have
to
do
with
the
report
of
an
illness
in
china
in
january
in
order
to
understand
how
much
of
a
problem
be
likely
to
stem
from
whatever
be
cause
illness
in
china
we
need
to
understand
certain
characteristic
of
the
disease
the
two
key
question
be
be
it
cause
by
a
virus
that
be
be
transmit
between
people
and
if
so
be
people
able
to
pas
the
virus
on
before
they
show
sign
of
the
disease
themselves
while
the
suggestion
that
this
new
infection
could
be
sars
or
sars
like
be
definitely
a
cause
for
concern
the
same
promedmail
post
on
january
also
say
that
no
human
to
human
transmission
have
be
observe
and
no
medical
staff
have
be
infect
one
possible
scenario
that
fit
the
fact
be
that
this
be
a
previously
unknown
virus
that
infect
an
animal
like
rabbit
maybe
i
puzzle
to
myself
a
stallholder
have
brought
to
the
market
a
few
cage
of
apparently
well
but
actually
infect
rabbit
perhaps
as
with
mers
the
rabbit
virus
could
infect
people
who
spent
time
in
close
proximity
to
an
infect
rabbit
with
mers
though
only
old
people
have
become
seriously
ill
and
most
outbreak
have
happen
in
hospital
with
this
new
virus
this
pneumonia
of
unknown
cause
it
appear
that
in
contrast
young
healthy
people
be
fall
ill
and
there
have
be
no
outbreak
in
hospital
so
perhaps
unlike
mers
or
sars
this
virus
be
not
able
to
spread
from
human
to
human
perhaps
all
the
people
fall
ill
have
be
at
the
market
and
be
be
infect
directly
from
the
rabbit
if
that
be
the
case
then
the
outbreak
would
be
contain
very
quickly
by
closing
the
market
remove
all
the
livestock
and
deep
cleaning
the
site
before
reopen
there
would
be
no
time
to
develop
a
vaccine
nor
any
need
for
one
that
scenario
fit
the
fact
as
i
understood
them
but
of
course
we
do
not
yet
have
all
the
fact
passing
the
kitchen
table
that
even
i
try
put
another
couple
of
piece
into
the
christmas
jigsaw
they
didn
t
fit
i
would
come
back
and
look
at
them
later

in
order
to
understand
what
we
now
all
know
intimately
as
covid
and
to
explain
how
my
colleague
and
i
design
a
vaccine
to
protect
against
it
we
first
need
to
travel
kilometre
west
from
wuhan
in
china
to
guinea
in
west
africa
and
six
year
back
in
time
in
there
be
an
outbreak
of
an
extremely
deadly
and
terrify
disease
ebola
ebola
have
first
be
identify
in
and
there
have
be
numerous
small
outbreak
since
but
this
one
be
much
large
and
be
run
out
of
control
during
the
outbreak
which
eventually
kill
at
least
people
cause
some
hospital
to
become
overwhelmed
and
close
down
and
have
grave
economic
consequence
for
the
region
i
played
a
peripheral
role
in
the
test
of
an
ebola
vaccine
but
from
my
seat
on
the
sideline
i
be
able
to
follow
development
closely
and
see
what
go
well
and
what
do
not
the
inadequacy
of
the
world
s
response
to
this
disaster
and
the
determination
of
the
scientific
and
public
health
community
to
learn
from
those
mistake
be
key
to
understand
what
would
happen
next
these
experience
form
the
foundation
of
what
we
ve
do
in
oxford
because
of
what
happen
with
ebola
learn
what
work
well
and
what
do
not
we
be
able
to
design
make
and
test
a
vaccine
with
unprecedented
speed
and
with
high
level
of
confidence
in
the
outcome
ebola
be
a
filovirus
whereas
coronaviruses
like
sars
mers
and
sars
cov
cause
respiratory
tract
infection
from
cold
cough
and
sore
throat
to
pneumonia
and
breathing
difficulty
filovirus
cause
haemorrhagic
fever
ebola
symptom
be
initially
much
like
those
of
other
viral
infection
fever
headache
fatigue
and
muscle
ache
after
a
few
day
though
this
can
progress
to
vomit
and
diarrhoea
problem
with
the
liver
and
kidney
and
internal
and
external
bleeding
it
s
a
truly
devasting
disease
it
be
fatal
in
around
of
those
infect
before
outbreak
have
be
small
in
isolated
area
with
low
population
density
so
it
have
be
possible
to
contain
them
through
painstaking
contact
trace
and
quarantine
what
be
different
in
be
that
the
outbreak
spread
to
densely
populate
city
and
across
border
from
guinea
in
west
africa
to
the
neighbour
liberia
and
sierra
leone
as
the
disease
spread
exponentially
in
the
summer
and
early
autumn
that
year
the
healthcare
system
be
overwhelmed
and
people
be
die
untreated
in
the
street
of
monrovia
liberia
s
capital
city
by
the
time
the
outbreak
have
finally
be
contain
in
mid
there
have
be
more
than
case
and
over
death
at
the
time
there
be
no
license
vaccine
against
ebola
and
no
treatment
however
this
disease
be
so
frighten
that
the
us
government
have
begin
funding
work
on
a
vaccine
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
ebola
be
release
deliberately
in
a
bid
to
cause
death
and
panic
over
many
year
various
ebola
vaccine
have
be
produce
in
laboratory
and
test
on
monkey
so
that
by
two
different
vaccine
have
be
show
to
protect
rhesus
macaque
monkey
against
ebola
virus
after
a
single
vaccination
one
of
these
promising
vaccine
be
know
as
chad
eboz
which
be
an
example
of
a
replication
deficient
recombinant
simian
adenoviral
vectored
vaccine
this
be
not
as
complicate
as
it
sound
if
we
just
take
one
part
at
a
time
and
it
be
important
for
understand
what
we
do
in
with
covid
so
let
s
break
it
down
first
adenoviral
vectored
this
mean
the
vaccine
be
deliver
into
the
body
use
an
adenovirus
adenovirus
be
a
group
of
virus
that
cause
cold
in
human
snuffly
nose
or
sometimes
gastro
symptom
mild
and
short
live
there
be
lot
of
slightly
different
version
know
as
serotypes
each
identify
by
a
number
some
of
these
human
adenovirus
have
be
use
to
make
vaccine
include
ad
and
ad
the
adenovirus
that
give
us
a
cold
infect
a
cell
in
our
nose
or
throat
and
turn
the
cell
into
a
factory
to
make
lot
more
adenovirus
this
be
know
as
replication
eventually
the
cell
break
open
release
the
adenovirus
that
it
have
make
which
then
infect
more
cell
in
the
same
person
or
be
coughed
or
sneeze
out
and
may
infect
someone
else
the
virus
spread
around
the
body
or
to
another
person
or
both
if
a
particular
gene
be
remove
from
an
adenovirus
this
creates
an
adapt
version
of
the
virus
that
still
infects
human
cell
as
normal
but
be
then
unable
to
spread
any
far
the
adapt
adenovirus
can
t
make
copy
of
itself
and
spread
around
the
body
or
to
anyone
else
it
be
render
replication
deficient
fn
where
the
gene
have
be
remove
in
the
adenovirus
another
gene
be
then
insert
in
its
place
this
creates
a
recombinant
virus
which
simply
mean
it
combine
gene
from
two
different
source
the
add
in
gene
be
express
in
the
cell
infect
by
the
adenovirus
meaning
the
gene
s
instruction
be
carry
out
in
the
infect
cell
the
add
in
gene
instructs
the
cell
to
make
a
particular
protein
an
immune
response
be
then
trigger
against
that
protein
the
replication
deficient
recombinant
adenovirus
be
live
which
be
good
for
induce
strong
immune
response
but
it
be
also
very
safe
to
use
be
replication
deficient
mean
that
it
cannot
spread
to
any
more
cell
and
so
will
not
cause
an
ongoing
infection
this
be
the
technology
that
be
use
in
the
ebola
vaccine
and
the
same
technology
can
be
use
to
express
a
gene
for
an
ebola
or
malaria
or
influenza
protein
and
in
each
case
it
will
induce
an
immune
response
against
that
pathogen
one
way
of
think
of
it
be
to
see
the
viral
vector
as
a
vehicle
able
to
deliver
whatever
cargo
be
load
up
into
it
once
the
cargo
the
gene
for
the
ebola
protein
for
example
be
inside
the
human
cell
the
virus
us
the
human
cell
to
make
lot
of
copy
of
the
ebola
protein
rather
than
lot
of
copy
of
itself
the
immune
system
which
continually
scan
the
body
look
for
thing
it
doesn
t
recognise
then
spring
into
action
an
ebola
vaccine
make
use
human
adenovirus
have
be
produce
and
test
and
it
have
work
really
well
in
animal
the
problem
be
that
the
vaccine
be
make
from
an
adenovirus
that
quite
often
infects
human
in
its
unmodified
state
and
so
lot
of
people
already
have
antibody
against
it
in
those
people
the
vaccine
wouldn
t
induce
such
strong
immune
response
against
the
add
in
ebola
or
malaria
or
influenza
protein
the
idea
of
use
an
adenovirus
to
produce
a
vaccine
be
good
but
it
would
be
well
to
use
an
adenovirus
that
people
didn
t
already
have
antibody
to
the
problem
could
be
neatly
solve
by
use
an
adenovirus
that
circulates
amongst
chimpanzee
rather
than
human
there
be
many
different
adenovirus
found
in
chimpanzee
that
be
perfectly
capable
of
infect
human
and
give
them
a
cold
but
because
human
don
t
often
come
into
contact
with
chimp
we
haven
t
be
infect
by
these
chimpanzee
or
simian
adenovirus
and
so
we
don
t
have
antibody
against
them
the
ebola
vaccine
chad
eboz
be
make
from
a
chimpanzee
adenovirus
know
as
chad
the
e
gene
be
remove
to
render
it
replication
deficient
and
the
add
gene
be
one
that
encode
the
protein
found
on
the
surface
of
ebola
virus
the
glycoprotein
when
use
to
vaccinate
macaque
the
macaque
produce
immune
response
against
the
ebola
glycoprotein
with
these
immune
response
they
be
protect
against
ebola
virus
so
this
be
one
of
the
vaccine
that
have
be
show
by
the
time
of
the
outbreak
to
protect
macaque
from
ebola
the
other
vaccine
be
another
recombinant
viral
vectored
vaccine
so
it
use
a
very
similar
technology
the
main
difference
be
that
it
use
a
different
viral
vector
a
virus
call
vsv
rather
than
the
adenovirus
and
it
be
replication
competent
meaning
it
could
spread
throughout
the
body
after
vaccination
by
both
vaccine
have
be
show
to
protect
macaque
against
ebola
virus
but
neither
have
undergone
human
trial
as
the
outbreak
in
west
africa
rumble
on
it
become
obvious
that
this
be
not
just
a
west
african
problem
have
work
on
influenza
vaccine
i
be
well
aware
that
a
new
strain
of
that
virus
could
travel
around
the
world
in
a
matter
of
day
people
in
west
africa
have
already
travel
in
car
lorry
and
bus
unaware
that
they
be
infect
with
ebola
and
take
the
virus
with
them
with
the
virus
now
circulate
in
city
with
international
airport
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
someone
board
a
plane
virus
do
not
respect
border
religious
belief
or
political
leaning
the
wealthy
might
be
able
to
shield
themselves
more
effectively
but
even
they
be
not
safe
from
a
catastrophic
collapse
of
society
the
whole
world
be
susceptible
this
be
a
global
problem
that
require
a
global
response
an
effective
vaccine
could
control
the
outbreak
and
play
a
major
part
in
bring
it
to
an
end
along
with
other
colleague
at
the
jenner
institute
my
institutional
home
within
the
university
of
oxford
i
become
involve
in
effort
to
start
a
clinical
trial
of
the
chad
eboz
vaccine
as
soon
as
possible
in
other
word
trial
to
test
the
vaccine
on
human
fn
in
order
to
get
to
the
stage
where
we
could
test
it
on
people
though
we
need
all
of
the
necessary
funding
and
approval
something
we
will
come
back
to
in
other
chapter
the
timeline
over
the
next
few
month
be
a
large
part
of
what
go
right
and
then
what
go
wrong
in
our
response
to
the
ebola
outbreak
at
first
we
manage
to
move
unusually
fast
then
thing
get
bogged
down
we
submit
our
grant
application
to
fund
the
clinical
trial
on
august
by
september
after
a
massive
amount
of
careful
work
by
clinician
scientist
and
regulatory
and
ethical
body
approval
be
all
in
place
and
we
be
able
to
vaccinate
the
first
of
sixty
volunteer
in
oxford
ruth
atkins
a
year
old
nh
manager
and
former
nurse
move
at
such
speed
involve
a
lot
of
work
by
many
people
both
at
the
jenner
institute
where
i
be
base
and
at
the
clinical
biomanufacturing
facility
where
cath
be
now
base
in
close
consultation
with
the
regulatory
body
in
that
sense
it
be
a
small
taste
of
what
be
to
come
in
we
be
delighted
by
our
rapid
progress
which
be
necessary
give
the
public
health
emergency
that
be
unfold
by
october
with
result
exactly
as
we
have
hop
and
expect
base
on
our
exist
knowledge
of
how
adenoviral
vectored
vaccine
behave
there
be
sufficient
data
on
safety
and
immune
response
to
allow
a
second
study
in
mali
to
go
ahead
mali
be
not
one
of
the
main
country
affected
by
the
outbreak
but
it
share
a
border
with
guinea
and
there
be
an
expectation
that
ebola
might
spread
over
the
border
so
it
make
sense
for
the
trial
to
be
conduct
on
healthcare
worker
who
would
have
have
to
respond
to
any
ebola
case
in
this
trial
the
vaccine
be
show
again
to
be
well
tolerate
with
no
safety
concern
and
to
induce
strong
immune
response
however
no
one
yet
knew
whether
the
immune
response
would
be
strong
enough
to
provide
effective
protection
against
ebola
for
that
efficacy
study
in
the
affected
country
would
be
need
to
see
if
the
vaccine
actually
prevent
people
from
be
infect
and
become
ill
now
frustratingly
thing
slow
right
down
trial
to
test
vaccine
efficacy
be
call
phase
iii
trial
they
follow
on
from
phase
i
or
first
in
human
trial
which
test
a
vaccine
s
safety
and
ability
to
produce
an
immune

in

which
test
for

and
immune

in
a
wider
range
of
age
group
typically
all
of
these
trial
be
blind
randomise
placebo
control
trial
this
mean
that
half
the
people
be
vaccinate
receive
the
vaccine
and
half
receive
a
placebo
injection
which
will
not
provide
any
protection
the
placebo
might
be
simply
saline
solution
which
will
not
result
in
any
immune
response
or
it
might
be
another
vaccine
such
as
rabies
vaccine
which
won
t
protect
against
ebola
but
will
provide
some
other
benefit
to
the
volunteer
who
don
t
get
the
ebola
vaccine
neither
the

themselves
nor
the
people
assess
them
later
on
to
find
out
if
they
have
become

know
which
vaccine
they
have
have
when
enough
people
on
the
study
have
become
infect
the
statistician
unblind
the
study
and
count
up
how
many
infection
there
have
be
in
the
group
that
get
the
ebola
vaccine
and
how
many
infection
in
the
group
that
get
the
saline
or
rabies
vaccine
if
there
be
the

number
of

in
both
group
the
vaccine
be
not
effective
at
all
if
none
of
the
infection
be
in
the
ebola
vaccine
group
the
vaccine
be
extremely
effective
if
there
be
some
infection
in
the
ebola
vaccine
group
but
few
than
in
the
other
group
then
the
vaccine
efficacy
can
be
calculate
usually
if
the
vaccine
efficacy
be
or
well
it
will
be
worth
use
the
vaccine
to
control
the
outbreak
in
this
case
a
placebo
control
study
be
deem
unethical
by
those
planning
the
trial
ebola
have
a
high
fatality
rate
at
around
and
there
be
no
cure
how
it
be
argue
could
anyone
conduct
a
trial
in
which
people
have
a
chance
of
get
a
vaccine
which
might
protect
them
and
a
chance
of
get
one
that
definitely
would
not
in
fact
the
fatality
rate
have
be
drop
as
more
healthcare
centre
be
able
to
provide
well
supportive
care
for
those
infect
and
increase
their
chance
of
recovery
anyone
take
part
in
the
trial
would
be
closely
monitor
and
if
infect
would
receive
care
as
early
as
possible
thus
improve
their
chance
far
and
the
longer
discussion
about
ethical
trial
design
go
on
the
longer
no
one
be
receive
a
vaccine
that
give
them
any
chance
of
protection
at
all
people
continued
to
be
infect
and
people
continued
to
die
however
there
be
other
option
for
a
phase
iii
trial
another
type
of
trial
be
a
step
wedge
design
this
be
a
pragmatic
approach
that
take
account
of
the
fact
that
if
the
outbreak
be
widespread
and
you
want
to
introduce
a
vaccine
to
control
it
that
cannot
happen
everywhere
at
the
same
time
so
instead
vaccination
start
at
one
edge
of
the
outbreak
area
and
gradually
move
across
it
over
a
period
of
week
if
the
vaccine
be
effective
infection
in
the
area
where
people
have
be
vaccinate
will
decline
first
and
the
fall
in
infection
will
follow
the
progress
of
vaccination
across
the
outbreak
area
everyone
receives
the
trial
vaccine
as
the
vaccination
team
reach
their
area
although
those
living
furthest
away
from
the
start
point
have
to
wait
although
this
sound
like
a
possible
solution
with
this
set
up
it
be
actually
quite
difficult
to
work
out
how
effective
a
vaccine
be
get
a
clear
picture
of
a
vaccine
s
efficacy
be
especially
important
if
there
be
two
option
as
there
be
for
ebola
and
it
would
be
useful
to
know
whether
one
be
more
effective
than
the
other
so
instead
another
type
of
trial
design
be
eventually
decide
upon
a
ring
vaccination
study
with
delayed
vaccination
in
half
of
the
ring
in
order
to
use
this
type
of
trial
design
it
be
necessary
to
first
identify
someone
who
have
be
infect
with
ebola
then
all
of
that
person
s
contact
be
identify
and
the
contact
of
their
contact
and
the
limit
of
the
geographical
area
where
they
can
be
found
be
define
that
group
of
people
form
a
ring
around
the
initial
case
many
ring
be
identify
in
this
way
and
each
ring
be
randomly
assign
to
receive
either
immediate
vaccination
or
delayed
vaccination
that
mean
that
everyone
in
all
of
the
ring
receives
the
ebola
vaccine
but
some
ring
have
to
wait
three
week
the
number
of
new
infection
in
the
delayed
ring
be
compare
with
the
number
in
the
immediate
ring
to
ass
whether
the
vaccine
be
effective
whilst
all
of
the
discussion
about
how
to
conduct
the
phase
iii
trial
have
be
go
on
so
have
the
ebola
crisis
it
be
frustrate
to
see
the
process
slow
down
dramatically
when
a
vaccine
be
so
desperately
need
however
intensive
effort
to
bring
the
virus
under
control
use
contact
trace
quarantine
and
hygiene
measure
be
pay
off
and
by
april
when
the
ring
vaccination
study
start
a
full
year
after
the
outbreak
become
widespread
the
case
number
be
low
and
fall
originally
the
aim
and
expectation
have
be
that
the
two
vaccine
would
be
test
for
efficacy
at
the
same
time
in
different
location
by
this
point
though
there
be
only
one
location
with
high
enough
infection
level
for
a
phase
iii
trial
so
only
one
vaccine
could
be
test
at
a
time
vsv
be
to
go
first
with
a
switch
over
to
chad
later
on
the
result
of
the
vsv
trial
show
it
to
be
very
highly
effective
this
be
great
news
the
vaccine
be
then
use
to
bring
the
remainder
of
the
outbreak
under
control
ring
continued
to
be
identify
and
people
in
all
ring
be
vaccinate
straightaway
in
october
the
who
record
the
first
week
without
any
new
case
and
in
june
after
some
final
flare
ups
the
epidemic
be
declare
over
however
with
the
vsv
vaccine
bring
the
outbreak
under
control
the
chad
vaccine
be
never
test
for
efficacy
comparison
show
that
the
immune
response
be
very
similar
for
both
vaccine
so
it
be
likely
that
chad
would
also
have
be
highly
effective
in
protect
against
ebola
it
also
have
a
number
of
potential
advantage
over
the
vsv
vaccine
it
be
easy
to
manufacture
in
large
quantity
it
doesn
t
require
very
low
temperature
storage
and
because
it
be
replication
deficient
it
be
safer
for
people
with
compromise
immune
system
for
those
of
us
look
on
have
be
involve
in
the
very
rapid
initiation
and
completion
of
the
first
chad
clinical
trial
in
oxford
this
seem
to
be
a
miss
opportunity
why
do
it
take
so
long
to
test
for
efficacy
it
be
four
month
from
the
outcome
of
the
phase
ii
trial
until
the
start
of
the
phase
iii
study
i
make
this
point
at
a
conference
where
i
have
be
invite
to
speak
about
our
vaccine
trial
and
receive
a
rather
angry
response
from
a
who
representative
who
insist
that
everything
have
be
do
as
fast
as
possible
but
the
fault
do
not
lie
with
individual
not
do
their
job
properly
in
the
thick
of
thing
the
problem
be
a
lack
of
preparation
the
fact
be
that
the
delay
meant
not
only
that
it
take
longer
to
contain
the
deadly
ebola
virus
but
also
that
only
one
vaccine
end
up
be
test
for
efficacy
a
vaccine
that
require
very
low
temperature
storage
make
it
difficult
and
expensive
to
use
in
hot
country
in
order
to
know
if
any
vaccine
work
unfortunately
there
do
have
to
be
a
control
group
in
which
some
people
who
have
not
receive
the
vaccine
become
infect
in
this
case
with
a
potentially
fatal
disease
but
once
a
vaccine
have
be
show
to
be
effective
it
can
then
be
use
to
prevent
many
more
potentially
fatal
infection
between
december
and
april
while
the
discussion
about
the
design
of
the
efficacy
study
be
go
on
around
people
become
infect
and
more
than
of
those
people
die
in
the
ring
vaccination
study
that
be
eventually
carry
out
just
twenty
three
people
become
infect
whilst
wait
for
their
vaccination
in
a
randomise
placebo
control
trial
as
in
a
ring
vaccination
trial
only
a
very
small
number
of
infection
would
have
be
require
in
order
to
calculate
vaccine
efficacy
and
if
the
vaccine
have
be
show
to
be
effective
those
originally
give
the
placebo
could
then
have
be
offer
the
vaccine
if
we
have
start
randomise
placebo
control
trial
for
both
vaccine
in
december
at
site
where
the
small
number
of
case
that
would
need
to
occur
in
the
control
group
could
have
be
treat
quickly
effectiveness
would
have
be
establish
sooner
both
the
vsv
and
the
chad
vectored
vaccine
could
have
be
test
either
at
different
site
or
one
after
the
other
at
the
same
site
and
by
early
we
would
likely
have
end
up
with
two
effective
vaccine
to
deploy
against
this
and
future
outbreak
rather
than
just
one
fn
many
few
life
would
have
be
lose
in
in
truth
despite
have
know
about
ebola
virus
since
and
despite
have
invest
in
vaccine
development
over
many
year
the
world
be
not
ready
in
to
test
a
vaccine
against
ebola
the
response
be
simply
not
adequate

the
world
s
inadequate
response
to
ebola
be
a
wake
up
call
and
a
turn
point
relief
that
the
outbreak
have
be
contain
be
temper
by
anxiety
that
there
be
still
plenty
more
virus
out
there
that
could
wreak
similar
havoc
true
outbreak
of
these
very
frighten
disease
have
always
be
small
and
contain
in
the
past
but
that
have
be
true
of
ebola
too
until
various
international
organisation
with
the
who
foremost
begin
to
draw
up
list
of
other
dangerous
pathogen
for
which
we
really
should
be
develop
vaccine
diagnostics
and
therapeutic
fn
in
the
who
publish
a
list
of
priority
disease
include
sars
mers
and
ebola
as
well
as
lassa
fever
marburg
virus
crimean
congo
haemorrhagic
fever
rift
valley
fever
and
nipah
virus
the
idea
be
that
company
and
academic
researcher
could
put
forward
their
technology
for
review
and
some
would
be
fast
tracked
so
the
world
would
be
well
prepared
for
future
outbreak
for
me
this
be
great
news
i
have
be
work
on
a
technology
that
have
great
potential
but
lack
the
funding
for
far
test
in
oxford
we
have
conduct
safety
trial
for
chad
eboz
the
ebola
vaccine
that
never
get
to
phase
iii
trial
this
be
a
replication
deficient
simian
adenoviral
vectored
vaccine
since
i
have
also
be
work
on
another
replication
deficient
simian
adenoviral
vector
developed
in
my
lab
in
oxford
and
know
as
chadox
which
i
have
use
to
make
vaccine
against
influenza
and
mers
so
far
both
have
be
show
to
be
well
tolerate
with
no
safety
concern
in
phase
i
clinical
trial
however
without
more
funding
we
would
not
be
able
to
make
far
progress
chadox
be
what
be
call
a
platform
technology
meaning
that
it
can
be
use
to
make
many
different
vaccine
the
great
advantage
of
this
be
that
you
don
t
need
to
repeat
every
one
of
the
many
aspect
of
vaccine
development
for
each
new
vaccine
that
be
make
knowledge
of
how
to
manufacture
the
vaccine
how
to
store
it
and
what
dose
to
give
can
be
built
up
and
apply
to
every
vaccine
that
be
make
use
the
same
platform
this
reduces
development
time
and
crucially
for
the
development
of
vaccine
against
disease
like
those
on
the
priority
list
where
there
be
so
little
funding
available
it
also
reduces
the
development
cost
in
february
in
a
featureless
conference
room
in
a
hotel
near
geneva
airport
i
present
this
particular
platform
technology
to
the
who
panel
after
this
first
round
of
assessment
i
be
encourage
to
apply
for
a
second
round
i
be
also
advise
to
form
a
partnership
with
a
large
company
that
be
interested
in
similar
technology
as
a
university
oxford
can
supply
the
expertise
that
support
the
early
development
and
clinical
test
of
vaccine
but
eventually
if
its
vaccine
be
found
to
be
safe
and
effective
and
be
go
to
be
license
and
use
it
will
need
to
bring
a
commercial
company
on
board
the
company
would
then
take
the
lead
in
obtain
the
necessary
regulatory
approval
carry
out
the
manufacturing
at
scale
and
organise
the
logistics
of
supply
i
opt
to
partner
with
a
company
call
janssen
which
be
part
of
johnson
johnson
who
be
also
use
a
replication
deficient
adenovirus
to
make
vaccine
my
main
collaborator
at
janssen
be
olga
popova
a
very
experienced
project
manager
and
a
very
impressive

olga
spoke
perfect
english
work
for

live
in
rome
with
her
french
husband
and
young
daughter
she
be
always
smartly
dress
and
could
tell
you
the
best
hotel
to
stay
in
for
who
meeting
in
geneva
not
the
one
near
the
airport
and
the
best
thing
on
the
restaurant
menu
we
go
into
the
second
round
of
presentation
in
july
as
a
team
and
later
that
year
our
technology
be
approve
while
this
be
a
success
be
approve
be
certainly
validation
the
who
didn
t
have
any
money
to
hand
out
so
we
would
still
need
to
find
some
funding
if
we
be
to
make
any
more
progress
with
it
fortunately
the
who
be
not
the
only
organisation
that
have
leap
into

after
the
ebola
outbreak
a

the

the
world
need
to
protect
us
all
against
emerge

and
in
particular
the
priority
disease
it
also
want
to
reduce
the

take
to
develop
new

from
a
stop
start
ten
year
to
a
much
slicker
twelve
month
the
first
target
for
cepi
be
vaccine
against
mers
lassa
fever
and
the
particularly
nasty
nipah
the
one
you
don
t
want
to
get
accord
to
scientist
who
work
on
it
work
with
team
both
at
oxford
university
and
at
janssen
i
submit
a
proposal
to
develop
chadox
base
vaccine
against
all
three
disease
however
this
time
i
be
to
miss
work
with
olga
again
my
efficient
stylish
colleague
be
diagnose
with
cancer
and
sadly
pass
away
in
july
the
full
proposal
require
a
lot
of
work
and
it
do
not
help
that
the
deadline
kept
shift
we
have
a
family
holiday
in
italy
book
for
the
first
two
week
in
july
after
the
three
child
s
a
level
we
would
be
spending
a
few
day
in
milan
then
go
to
lake
como
and
on
to
venice
before
fly
home
via
milan
again
plenty
of
opportunity
for
the
boat
trip
the
family
tease
me
i
hanker
after
on
every
family
holiday
fortunately
the
deadline
for
the
application
be
at
the
end
of
june
so
i
be
look
forward
to
go
on
holiday
with
a
clear
conscience
have
submit
it
then
cepi
shift
the
deadline
to
a
week
later
halfway
through
the
holiday
then
it
move
again
i
eventually
complete
the
application
sit
on
the
step
of
the
campanile
in
st
mark
s
square
in

type
on
a

while
my

rob
and
the

be
climb
the
tower
to
check
out
the
view
from
the
top
despite
the
last
minute
venetian
edit
we
be
invite
to
move
forward
to
negotiate
a
contract
for
cepi
funding
this
be
unknown
territory
for
all
concerned
it
be
the
first
time
oxford
university
and
janssen
have
apply
jointly
for
funding
and
it
be
unusual
for
cepi
to
have
two
applicant
to
negotiate
with
on
top
of
that
cepi
be
still
a
new
organisation
and
its
funding
come
from
a
variety
of
source
each
with
different
condition
attach
all
of
which
then
have
to
be
pass
on
to
the
project
be
fund
the
negotiation
go
on
and
on
with
many
meeting
and
teleconference
until
finally
the
contract
signing
take
place
at
the
cepi
headquarters
in
london
in
september
it
be
eighteen
month
since
the
original
deadline
for
proposal
back
in
march
twenty
one
month
since
the
launch
of
cepi
more
than
two
year
since
the
who
call
to
speed
up
vaccine
development
and
we
have
achieve
nothing
beyond
secure
some
funding
you
may
be
start
to
get
an
idea
of
why
vaccine
usually
take
so
long
to
develop
fortunately
in
the
meantime
the
uk
government
have
decide
to
channel
some
of
its
overseas
aid
budget
into
vaccine
against
emerge
pathogen
and
i
have
secure
some
funding
for
early
development
of
a
mers
vaccine
outside
of
any
cepi
involvement
this
turn
out
to
be
extremely
fortuitous
also
in
the
meantime
in
february
a
new
entry
have
appear
on
the
who
s
top
ten
list
of
priority
disease
disease
x
disease
x
be
a
placeholder
represent
a
future
hypothetical
disease
no
one
knew
what
the
disease
would
be
or
when
it
would
emerge
but
expert
agree
that
the
emergence
of
something
sometime
soon
be
inevitable
look
back
now
it
s
interest
to
see
that
then
the
planning
be
for
an
epidemic
meaning
an
outbreak
in
one
geographical
area
but
not
a
global
pandemic
nonetheless
the
very
act
of
put
disease
x
on
the
list
be
an
important
recognition
of
the
need
to
prepare
for
pathogen
we
don
t
yet
know
as
well
as
the
one
we
do
so
how
could
we
prepare
for
a
disease
that
we
don
t
yet
know
about
how
do
you
design
a
vaccine
against
an
unknown
pathogen
up
until
the
invention
of
platform
technology
such
as
chadox
this
would
have
be
an
unsolvable
problem
but
platform
technology
be
design
to
be
adaptable
and
could
therefore
be
use
to
make
vaccine
against
many
different
pathogen
potentially
include
one
that
hadn
t
be
identify
yet
the
other
advantage
of
a
platform
technology
be
that
so
much
of
the
work
determine
how
to
manufacture
it
decide
what
dosage
to
use
could
be
do
before
we
knew
what
disease
we
want
to
use
it
against
but
even
with
the
time
save
by
use
a
platform
technology
the
development
process
remain
painfully
slow
typically
in
my
lab
there
be
a
delay
of
several
year
between
the
decision
to
start
work
on
a
vaccine
against
a
particular
virus
and
the
start
of
clinical
trial
this
be
largely
because
each
stage
of
development
need
funding
which
we
could
not
even
apply
for
until
we
have
successfully
complete
the
previous
stage
of
development
a
funding
application
could
easily
take
a
year
to
go
through
and
some
fund
be
only
open
to
application
for
a
small
window
once
a
year
despite
these
limitation
we
have
already
start
to
think
about
what
we
could
do
at
our
end
in
the
lab
to
speed
thing
up
at
the
very
begin
of
the
process
so
when
cepi
put
out
a
call
for
proposal
for
platform
technology
for
rapid
vaccine
development
against
disease
x
we
put
in
an
application
we
have
do
a
lot
of
the
planning
and
some
of
the
preliminary
work
on
how
to
cut
down
development
time
but
because
the
next
step
would
involve
a
lot
of
expensive
work
in
our
manufacturing
facility
for
example
do
all
the
test
of
the
material
to
be
use
in
any
vaccine
ahead
of
time
so
that
when
a
new
pathogen
come
along
we
could
simply
plug
it
in
to
the
adenovirus
and
start
manufacturing
we
need
the
kind
of
funding
cepi
could
provide
to
take
thing
any
far
we
be
hopeful
there
be
other
platform
technology
that
on
the
face
of
it
be
well
candidate
than
ours
because
they
could
go
faster
at
the
initial
vaccine
construction
stage
but
they
each
have
their
own
drawback
nucleic
acid
vaccine
for
example
consist
only
of
dna
or
mrnafn
a
relatively
new
kind
of
vaccine
should
be
simple
and
quick
to
produce
once
the
genome
of
a
new
disease
be
identify
however
mrna
be
so
unstable
it
need
to
be
formulate
with
lipid
make
the
manufacturing
process
more
complicate
and
even
with
the
addition
of
lipid
the
result
vaccine
need
to
be
store
at
very
low
temperature
so
whilst
the
development
of
mrna
vaccine
against
disease
x
might
be
fast
manufacture
transportation
and
storage
present
challenge
an
old
technology
dna
vaccine
have
be
use
in
clinical
trial
i
have
design
such
a
vaccine
and
be
vaccinate
with
it
in
a
trial
they
be
well
tolerate
but
as
thing
stand
they
don
t
induce
very
strong
response
in
human
so
fast
but
not
very
immunogenic
fn
adenoviral
vectored
vaccine
do
induce
strong
immune
response
even
with
a
single
dose
there
be
already
well
developed
manufacturing
process
for
produce
these
vaccine
at
large
scale
and
they
do
not
need
to
be
store
at
very
low
temperature
so
we
felt
that
if
we
could
get
cepi
funding
to
work
on
speed
up
that
early
development
part
of
our
process
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
create
a
very
strong
technology
for
make
safe
effective
vaccine
against
new
disease
at
pace
however
in
the
end
our
application
be
not
successful
the
reviewer
apparently
be
not
convince
that
a
viral
vectored
vaccine
could
be
produce
quickly
enough
in
the
event
of
a
disease
x
outbreak
it
be
disappoint
but
not
unexpected
for
an
academic
in
my
field
or
any
field
a
success
rate
for
grant
application
be
pretty
good
and
we
become
use
to
rejection
we
mentally
file
the
idea
to
return
to
later
and
continued
with
our
work
on
mers
lassa
and
nipah
vaccine
plus
new
work
on
crimean
congo

we

our

which
be
the
cause
of
much
regret
once

not

very

afterwards

by

of

many

we

well

to
respond

as
much
as
we
would
have
like
and
once
we
get
as
far
as
planning
clinical

we
have
a

of

about

send
email
to
make
sure
i
be
aware
of
the
outbreak
now
infect
and
not
sars
or
mers
and
wonder
when
the
genome
of
the
virus
cause
the
infection
would
be
release
back
at
work
in
my
office
on
monday
january
i
talk
through
it
all
with
my
colleague
te
lambe
we
discuss
the
continued
lack
of
evidence
of
human
to
human
transmission
which
didn
t
mean
that
it
wasn
t
happen
but
simply
that
there
be
no
clear
evidence
that
it
be
very
late
at
night
on
january
come
official
confirmation
on
promedmail
that
we
be
look
at
a
novel
meaning
a
previously
unknown
coronavirus
a
number
of
epidemiologist
immediately
post
on
promedmail
to
say
i
told
you
so
and
they
be
right
they
have
told
us
as
expert
in
this
area
they
have
be
warn
for
some
time
that
there
be
likely
to
be
an
outbreak
of
a
novel
coronavirus
most
likely
start
in
china
on
friday
the
th
china
report
the
first
fatality
a
year
old
man
by
the
end
of
that
friday
te
and
i
have
decide
that
as
soon
as
we
could
get
hold
of
the
genome
sequence
of
the
novel
coronavirus
we
would
start
to
make
a
vaccine
we
would
follow
the
same
design
approach
we
have
use
for
our
mers
vaccine
and
go
as
fast
as
we
could
at
this
point
it
all
still
felt
quite
theoretical
but
this
be
at
least
a
chance
to
demonstrate
what
we
could
do
with
our
chadox
vaccine
technology
and
if
a
vaccine
be
go
to
be
need
move
quickly
at
every
stage
and
planning
multiple
step
ahead
be
the
require
approach
we
have
be
think
about
disease
x
we
have
be
planning
for
disease
x
could
this
be
it
or
would
the
outbreak
fizzle
out
a
year
from
now
i
thought
at
the
time
as
we
wait
impatiently
for
the
coronavirus
genome
sequence
to
be
release
perhaps
we
will
have
demonstrate
we
can
go
fast
but
we
will
have
make
a
vaccine
that
no
one
want
or
need
cath

at
my
house
to
mark
the
end
of
we
drag
the
sofa
into
the
garden
so
that
people
could
sit
by
the
little
firepit

in

for

my

have
left
me
a

month
earlier
and
i
be
still
angry
and
hurt
and
a
bit
fearful
of
what
would
bring
but
a
night
of
fun
with
my

make
me
feel
love
and
alive
although
very
hungover
the
next
day
some
of
my
friend
turn
the
sound
up
louder
and
louder
that
night

go

from
my

school
no
one
mention
a

in
wuhan

on
new
year
s
day
i
clear
up
the
empty
bottle
and
ate
pizza
on
the
sofa
with
my

it
be
just
a
calm
family
day
on
monday
january
i
go
back
to
work
i
juggle
two
role
at
the
university
i
work
half
time
as
head
of
the
clinical
biomanufacturing
facility
cbf
and
half
time
run
a
research
team
at
the
wellcome
centre
for
human
genetics
the
cbf
a
vaccine
manufacturing
facility
service
by
twenty
five
highly
qualify
very
dedicate
scientist
and
engineer
be
an
unusual
set
up
for
a
university
there
be
only
a
few
university
across
the
globe
that
have
their
own
gmp
good
manufacturing
practice
manufacturing
facility
which
mean
we
can
manufacture
medicine
that
be
go
to
go
into
people
fn
we
have
three
main
role
at
the
cbf
we
make
the
start
material
from
which
we
or
others
can
make
clinical
grade
vaccine
in
other
word
vaccine
of
a
high
enough
quality
to
put
into
a
human
we
make
clinical
grade
vaccine
themselves
and
we
also
test
label
certify
and
release
those
vaccine
for
clinical
trial
our
goal
be
to
produce
really
high
quality
innovative
medicine
to
combat
disease
that
globally
cause
significant
harm
but
from
which
no
one
be
likely
to
make
any
profit
pharma
company
might
throw
money
at
heart
disease
but
nobody
s
throw
money
at
ebola
or
crimean
congo
haemorrhagic
fever
one
of
the
reason
that
i
love
my
work
be
that
vaccine
be
such
cost
effective
and
harm
reduce
public
health
intervention
in
other
word
if
you
be
go
to
put
money
into
try
to
improve
the
length
and
quality
of
someone
s
life
your
best
bet
be
to
give
them
a
vaccine
against
a
nasty
disease
even
before
covid
vaccine
be
save
an
estimate
million
life
a
year
and
enable
vastly
more
people
than
that
to
live
healthier
longer
more
productive
life
the
cbf
team
have
make
vaccine
to
protect
people
against
a
wide
range
of
disease
over
the
last
fifteen
year
these
include
disease
cause
by
bacteria
include
meningitis
tuberculosis
and
plague
parasite
malaria
and
virus
include
zika
rabies
and
mers
for
some
of
these
disease
there
be
no
know
treatment
for
others
the
treatment
be
often
expensive
or
difficult
to
administer
in
time
in
low
income
country
virus
be
a
fascinate
phenomenon
they
be
not
alive
they
cannot
reproduce
themselves
unaided
and
when
not
inside
a
host
cell
they
be
wholly
inert
but
once
they
infect
a
host
cell
they
can
almost
completely
take
it
over
convert
the
cell
s
effort
into
simply
make
more
virus
instead
of
do
the
thing
that
it
would
normally
do
this
process
usually
kill
the
host
cell
so
virus
have
to
be
transmissible
that
be
they
be
able
to
infect
different
cell
in
turn
spread
from
one
cell
to
another
when
you
or
i
get
expose
to
a
virus
for
the
first
time
we
might
be
lucky
the
virus
might
not
manage
to
latch
itself
onto
any
of
our
cell
and
so
we
do
not
become
infect
or
we
might
be
unlucky
in
that
the
virus
do
latch
itself
onto
and
infect
one
or
more
of
our
cell
the
virus
then
take
over
those
cell
and
the
cell
stop
do
what
they
need
to
do
and
start
make
copy
of
the
virus
which
harm
our
cell
in
such
a
way
that
symptom
of
that
viral
infection
occur
make
us
feel
ill
however
at
the
same
time
as
the
virus
be
infect
us
it
be
also
be
detect
by
our
immune
system
which
have
evolve
to
be
able
to
detect
previously
unencountered
intruder
determine
that
they
be
unwanted
and
then
inactivate
and
destroy
them
in
the
process
lay
down
a
memory
of
the
intruder
so
as
to
respond
to
it
well
the
next
time
and
our
immune
system
make
up
of
so
call
b
cell
and
t
cell
be
generally
very
good
at
this
b
cell
produce
antibody
which
bind
to
the
outside
of
the
virus
and
stop
it
from
infect
our
cell
and
t
cell
be
a
second
line
of
defence
that
can
recognise
cell
that
have
become
infect
and
destroy
them
the
reason
that
virus
can
nevertheless
make
us
sick
be
that
they
be
very
fast
it
be
possible
for
a
viral
infection
to
take
hold
before
the
immune
system
have
have
time
to
mobilise
an
effective
response
this
be
where
vaccine
come
in
during
a
viral
infection
your
immune
system
try
to
tackle
the
virus
if
it
succeed
then
you
get
well
and
you
be
left
with
an
immune
system
that
now
remembers
what
that
virus
look
like
have
train
itself
to
fight
it
and
will
spring
into
action
much
quicker
if
it
see
it
again
this
be
why
people
don
t
usually
catch
chicken
pox
twice
but
you
do
need
to
get
sick
with
chicken
pox
the
first
time
and
that
s
not
fun
vaccine
aim
to
give
your
immune
system
this
memory
of
what
a
dangerous
virus
look
like
so
that
you
can
tackle
it
effectively
if
you
come
across
it
but
without
you
have
to
get
sick
with
the
virus
in
the
first
place
they
achieve
this
by
present
a
harmless
mimic
of
the
virus
to
your
immune
system
there
be
various
way
that
vaccine
can
do
this
the
vaccination
against
smallpox
developed
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
by
edward
jenner
use
a
related
but
less
harmful
virus
cowpox
many
traditional
vaccine
present
the
body
with
a
weaken
or
inactivate
version
of
the
virus
modern
platform
or
plug
and
play
vaccine
technology
use
the
late
understand
of
how
biology
work
to
show
the
immune
system
only
the
part
of
the
virus
that
it
need
to
recognise
in
order
to
produce
an
immune
response
usually
this
will
be
a
protein
on
the
surface
of
the
virus
completely
harmless
on
its
own
at
the
cbf
the
approach
we
have
the
most
experience
with
be
the
adenovirus
vectored
vaccine
we
have
be
use
this
method
to
make
vaccine
for
research
colleague
like
sarah
since
and
use
the
chadox
platform
since
fn
i
pretty
much
always
feel
like
i
have
too
much
to
do
and
january
be
a
particularly
busy
month
in
early
january
the
cbf
team
be
hard
at
work
on
the
production
of
a
new
vaccine
against
ebola
for
our
colleague
te
lambe
we
also
have
new
team
member
arrive
who
need
to
learn
the
rope
they
have
no
idea
what
be
about
to
come
at
them
none
of
us
do
but
their
fresh
eye
combine
with
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
my
exist
team
member
would
prove
crucial
to
the
effort
we
be
about
to
embark
on
in
my
other
role
at
the
wellcome
centre
i
co
direct
a
phd
programme
and
in
january
i
always
have
hundred
of
application
to
review
and
shortlist
and
lot
of
admission
interview
to
do
i
also
help
out
with
admission
for
the
nuffield
department
of
medicine
and
organise
a
big
annual
conference
for
the
uk
genome
stability
network
in
short
my
diary
be
fully
book
up
with
just
the
everyday
stuff
of
my
normal
professional
life
for
the
first
two
week
of
the
year
i
be
aware
while
i
be
juggling
all
of
this
of
the
novel
coronavirus
virus
in
china
that
be
occasionally
feature
in
the
news
as
the
month
progress
more
and
more
people
be
raise
the
topic
with
me
and
ask
whether
i
be
work
on
it
my
friend
have
all
heard
of
the
concept
of
disease
x
probably
when
i
be
boring
them
senseless
in
the
pub
after
a
long
day
at
work
but
i
told
anyone
who
ask
that
i
wasn
t
work
on
it
and
i
didn
t
think
this
be
disease
x
i
admit
that
be
how
i
saw
it
at
first
and
i
wasn
t
alone
at
this
point
wuhan
have
not
lock
down
and
the
who
have
not
declare
an
international
public
health
emergency
outbreak
like
this
happen
all
the
time
i
reassure
my
friend
and
they
usually
die
out
locally
i
be
busy
i
have
other
thing
on
my
mind
and
i
assume
this
would
be
the
same
luckily
others
be
not
so
preoccupy
scientist
in
wuhan
shanghai
and
beijing
have
start
use

essentially
machine
that
can

s
genetic

on

take
from

with
wuhan
s
new
strange
pneumonia
they
be
work
to
unravel
the

s
letter
genome
the
vital
code
that
would
tell
the
world
what
this
virus
be
how
it
be
likely
to
behave
and
how
it
could
be
stop
sarah
and
her
team
be
busy
too
design
the
vaccine
there
be
no
reason
for
me
to
know
about
this
at
this
point
it
be
mostly
a
just
in
case
exercise
it
would
be
another
few
day
of
blissful
ignorance
before
i
realise
that
perhaps
this
be
disease
x
and
perhaps
i
be
go
to
be
work
on
it

even
before
the
genetic
sequence
of
the
novel
coronavirus
be
publish
sarah
and
te
have
decide
exactly
what
the
vaccine
would
look
like
and
have
start
to
discus
the
method
they
would
use
to
make
it
in
the
past
the
design
phase
for
a
new
vaccine
would
always
have
involve
do
a
lot
of
small
scale
work
in
sarah
s
research
lab
first
if
after
test
a
selection
of
research
grade
vaccine
in
the
lab
and
immunise
some
animal
she
decide
we
have
something
promising
enough
to
manufacture
for
clinical
trial
she
would
then
raise
the
fund
to
begin
all
over
again
make
the
clinical
grade
start
material
at
the
cbf
this
be
because
in
the
research
lab
they
don
t
use
the
very
pure
very
high
quality
very
highly
control
ingredient
we
need
to
use
when
we
manufacture
for
clinical
trial
for
example
in
one
of
the
early
stage
of
the
process
of
make
a
vaccine
we
need
to
grow
bacteria
in
a
nutritious
broth
or
growth
medium
the
liquid
use
in
research
lab
contains
small
amount
of
animal
derive
ingredient
any
animal
derive
material
use
for
a
vaccine
destine
to
go
into
someone
s
arm
have
to
be
very
strictly
control
in
term
of
its
origin
and
how
it
have
be
process
so
the
cbf
us
an
all
vegetarian
alternative
call
vegebroth
which
not
only
be
more
expensive
but
be
also
a
less
effective
medium
for
grow
bacteria
so
it
slows
down
the
work
make
the
vaccine
in
the
research
lab
and
test
it
out
before
we
start
make
it
in
the
cbf
be
a
bit
like
a
dressmaker
make
a
toile
or
muslin
of
a
couture
garment
before
cut
into
the
expensive
material
she
will
make
several
version
in
a
cheap
fabric
to
check
the
fit
once
the
fit
be
perfect
she
will
use
the
toile
as
a
guide
to
make
the
catwalk
version
do
thing
this
way
can
save
money
because
if
the
research
vaccine
doesn
t
work
we
have
not
go
to
the
expense
of
make
a
clinical
batch
it
also
mean
multiple
vaccine
option
can
be
assess
in
the
lab
and
the
best
one
select
for
far
development
this
method
have
serve
us
well
for
year
but
it
also
of
course
build
in
considerable
delay
the
whole
process
apply
for
funding
make
the
vaccine
in
the
lab
test
it
publishing
the
result
apply
for
more
funding
then
start
from
scratch
make
the
vaccine
in
the
cbf
usually
take
at
least
three
year
and
that
s
just
to
get
you
ml
or
so
of
start
material
this
time
te
and
sarah
knew
that
if
they
want
to
go
quickly
they
only
have
one
shot
and
they
do
want
to
go
quickly
they
want
to
show
what
their
technology
could
do
and
how
fast
it
could
work
and
they
knew
there
be
a
chance
it
might
actually
be
need
so
they
couldn
t
afford
to
waste
even
a
few
week
test
different
design
in
their
lab
like
they
usually
would
before
decide
which
one
to
take
forward
to
trial
that
make
the
decision
straightforward
however
at
this
point
i
still
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
because
they
weren
t
yet
think
about
put
it
into
human
which
be
where
i
come
in
most
virus
have
protein
stud
their
surface
that
become
the
target
for
vaccine
development
it
s
the
outside
of
a
pathogen
that
the
immune
system
need
to
recognise
flu
virus
have
two
major
protein
so
there
be
a
decision
to
make
about
which
one
to
target
but
coronaviruses
only
have
one
kind
of
protein
stick
out
of
them
the
now
famous
spike
protein
so
even
before
they
have
see
its
genome
once
they
knew
that
this
new
pathogen
be
a
coronavirus
sarah
and
te
knew
two
crucial
thing
that
the
virus
would
have
a
spike
protein
and
that
an
effective
vaccine
would
need
to
induce
an
immune
response
against
that
spike
protein
fn
sarah
have
an
obvious
template
to
follow
because
of
the
work
she
have
already
do
on
mers
also
a
coronavirus
the
mers
vaccine
that
have
be
make
be
a
replication
deficient
recombinant
simian
adenoviral
vector
vaccine
use
the
chadox
platform
to
deliver
the
gene
for
the
mers
spike
protein
we
knew
from
year
of
research
that
vaccine
make
use
the
chadox
platform
could
generate
a
strong
immune
response
with
one
dose
and
because
they
be
non
replicate
be
safe
to
give
to
child
the
elderly
and
anyone
with
a
pre
exist
condition
such
as
diabetes
the
mers
vaccine
specifically
have
already
be
through
two
clinical
trial
and
have
work
well
so
sarah
also
knew
a
third
crucial
thing
the
design
for
the
new
vaccine
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
the
design
for
the
mers
vaccine
essentially
the
gene
cod
for
the
spike
protein
plug
into
chadox
we
would
take
the
pattern
from
mers
and
go
straight
to
couture
the
trickier
question
be
which
method
should
we
use
to
put
the
component
part
together
and
start
to
generate
the
vaccine
which
scissors
and
thread
we
have
be
make
chadox
vectored
vaccine
in
the
lab
and
in
the
cbf
for
many
year
but
we
be
frustrate
with
how
slow
the
very
early
part
of
the
process
be
and
have
be
want
for
some
time
to
work
on
new
faster
method
there
be
two
circumstance
in
which
we
knew
these
faster
method
would
be
important
firstly
move
fast
would
be
crucial
if
we
want
to
make
personalise
vaccine
against
cancer
immunotherapy
to
treat
cancer
be
a
grow
field
tumour
often
contain
mutation
in
their
dna
that
make
them
different
from
the
healthy
cell
in
the
body
in
a
way
that
can
be
recognise
by
the
immune
system
in
rare
case
people
have
mount
such
a
strong
immune
response
against
their
tumour
that
they
spontaneously
recover
the
idea
of
personalise
cancer
vaccine
be
to
take
a
sample
of
the
tumour
sequence
its
dna
and
then
make
a
vaccine
specifically
for
that
patient
that
will
immunise
them
against
their
tumour
in
order
to
be
of
use
to
a
cancer
patient
the
vaccine
will
need
to
be
produce
very
quickly
before
the
patient
s
condition
deteriorates
although
since
it
be
personal
to
each
patient
not
in
large
amount
of
course
the
other
time
we
want
to
be
able
to
go
very
fast
be
when
we
need
to
make
a
vaccine
against
a
new
virus
at
risk
of
cause
an
epidemic
like
sars
cov
over
the
last
couple
of
year
sarah
have
invent
a
new
faster
method
for
make
the
starter
material
for
a
vaccine
this
new
method
we
call
it
the
rapid
method
as
oppose
to
the
classic
method
be
all
about
try
to
do
as
much
work
as
possible
in
advance
of
know
the
genetic
sequence
of
a
tumour
or
pathogen
so
that
once
we
knew
the
relevant
gene
we
could
get
from
that
point
to
a
work
vaccine
in
someone
s
arm
as
quickly
as
possible
fn
think
about
a
baker
who
sell
personalise
cake
iced
with
a
message
like
happy
th
birthday
joe
or
congratulation
on
your
engagement
ali
and
max
she
might
wait
until
she
get
an
order
and
only
then
start
the
process
of
mix
the
ingredient
baking
the
cake
let
it
cool
ice
it
all
over
wait
for
the
ice
to
set
and
then
finally
add
the
customise
message
if
she
get
the
order
the
day
before
the
cake
be
need
that
work
well
but
if
she
want
to
be
able
to
offer
a
quicker
service
she
could
bake
a
stock
of
cake
and
put
on
the
base
layer
of
ice
every
morning
she
be
take
a
financial
risk
if
no
order
come
in
the
pre
bake
cake
will
go
stale
and
need
to
be
thrown
away
but
it
may
be
worth
the
risk
when
a
customer
come
into
the
shop
all
she
have
to
do
be
pick
up
her
pip
bag
and
add
the
custom
message
while
he
wait
the
cake
be
then
ready
to
take
straight
to
the
party
only
in
the
case
of
a
vaccine
the
party
be
a
pandemic
in
the
classic
slow
method
we
make
the
cake
i
e
the
start
material
for
the
vaccine
from
scratch
when
we
get
an
order
in
i
e
discover
a
new
pathogen
and
establish
its
genetic
code
in
the
rapid
method
we
make
the
cake
in
advance
and
when
a
new
order
come
in
all
we
have
to
do
be
add
the
last
bit
of
decoration
i
e
the
appropriate
string
of
dna
fn
do
the
work
in
advance
be
an
upfront
investment
of
time
and
effort
but
it
be
worth
it
in
situation
where
time
be
of
the
essence
use
the
rapid
method
to
make
a
vaccine
against
a
novel
coronavirus
be
obviously
a
great
idea
but
it
be
brand
new
at
the
begin
of
we
hadn
t
ever
actually
use
it
it
be
like
a
recipe
that
hadn
t
ever
be
test
and
now
we
have
an
order
in
from
a
customer
who
might
turn
out
to
be
very
important

it
be
late
on
friday
january
te
and
sarah
be
still
try
to
decide
whether
they
could
use
the
rapid
method
or
would
be
well
off
just
use
the
classic
method
when
chinese
scientist
make
the
genetic
sequence
of
the
novel
coronavirus
publicly
available
online
a
genetic
sequence
be
a
long
list
of
the
four
letter
of
the
genetic
code
a
c
g
and
t
each
of
which
stand
for
one
of
the
four
chemical
compound
that
make
up
dna
and
the
sequence
for
this
new
virus
be
in
te
s
inbox
when
she
get
up
the
next
morning
she
immediately
start
work
in
her
pyjama
it
be
a
saturday
fn
it
be
relatively
easy
for
te
to
identify
which
sequence
of
letter
amongst
the
contain
the
genetic
code
for
the
spike
protein
as
the
sequence
be
very
similar
to
those
for
the
spike
protein
in
other
coronaviruses
like
sars
and
mers
however
over
the
weekend
several
different
version
of
the
genome
be
post
te
have
to
compare
them
and
make
a
decision
about
which
one
to
use
that
do
she
sent
the
information
over
to
another
colleague
sarah
sebastian
to
do
the
final
work
on
design
the

work
at
vaccitech
a
spin
out
company
found
by
sarah
gilbert
and
others
in
it
us
the

viral
vectored
technology
that
we
at
the
university
use
to
make
vaccine
against
emerge
pathogen
but
focus
instead
on
make
vaccine
to
treat
cancer
and
other
disease
sarah
s
originally
from
germany
and
educate
both
there
and
in
the

she
have
previously
work
with
sarah
g
at
the
university
on
malaria
vaccine
development
and
improve
viral
vectored
vaccine
important
work
but
never
something
that
funders
get
very
excite
about
like
many
senior
scientist
sarah
s
have
be
find
the
lack
of
job
security
work
in
an
unloved
field
challenge
it
s
one
thing
to
accept
a
short
term
contract
as
a
newly
graduate
researcher
but
she
be
experienced
and
good
at
her
job
and
very
reasonably
want
security
for
herself
and
her
family
when
she
plucked
up
the
courage
to
tell
sarah
g
that
she
have
be
offer
a
medical
write
job
sarah
g
want
to
avoid
a
loss
to
the
world
of
vaccinology
suggest
that
instead
she
should
approach
vaccitech
who
be
look
to
add
to
their
team
when
we
design
a
gene
to
go
into
a
vaccine
we
don
t
necessarily
use
exactly
the
same
sequence
that
be
in
the
virus
we
want
to
make
a
gene
that
will
produce
exactly
the
same
protein
sequence
but
will
do
that
really
efficiently
in
human
cell
that
mean
use
a
technique
call
codon
optimisation
sarah
s
be
go
to
use
that
and
other
technique
to
design
the
exact
dna
sequence
we
need
the
four
letter
in
the
genetic
code
a
c
g
and
t
provide
the
instruction
to
make
all
of
the
protein
in
our
body
and
protein
be
what
ultimately
enable
every
form
and
function
of
our
body
from
the
shape
of
our
muscle
to
the
digestion
of
our
dinner
use
enzyme
which
be
one
form
of
protein
protein
be
make
up
of
combination
of
twenty
different
amino
acid
think
of
it
as
like
make
necklace
from
different
colour
and
size
of
bead
if
you
have
twenty
different
type
of
bead
amino
acid
you
can
make
lot
of
different
kind
of
necklace
protein
the
genetic
code
or
dna
provide
the
instruction
to
put
amino
acid
in
order
for
example
one
of
the
amino
acid
be
call
methionine
every
protein
start
with
methionine
although
it
can
also
occur
in
other
place
in
a
protein
the
code
in
the
dna
that
say
put
methionine
here
be
atg
that
group
of
three
letter
be
call
a
codon
if
the
next
codon
be
tgg
that
mean
the
next
amino
acid
will
be
tryptophan
for
all
the
other
eighteen
amino
acid
there
be
multiple
codon
that
lead
to
the
same
amino
acid
be
include
for
lysine
the
code
be
either
aaa
or
aag
for
arginine
it
can
be
cgt
cgc
cga
cgg
aga
or
agg
different
organism
prefer
to
use
some
codon
rather
than
others
for
example
the
bacteria
that
cause
tuberculosis
have
a
very
gc
rich
genome
meaning
they
use
codon
that
contain
a
lot
of
g
and
c
whereas
malaria
parasite
be
very
at
rich
so
they
use
codon
that
contain
a
lot
of
as
and
t
tb
bacteria
and
malaria
parasite
can
both
encode
all
of
the
amino
acid
but
they
be
more
likely
to
use
some
codon
rather
than
others
in
human
arginine
be
more
likely
to
be
agg
than
cgt
if
we
want
the
new
protein
we
be
cod
for
to
be
produce
in
large
quantity
inside
human
cell
which
we
do
because
that
will
make
the
vaccine
more
efficient
at
stimulate
an
immune
response
we
should
use
the
codon
that
be
most
common
in
human
so
once
te
have
identify
the
part
of
the
genetic
code
we
want
codon
make
up
of
letter
of
genetic
code
provide
the
code
for
the
spike
protein
sarah
s
use
specially
design
computer
software
go
through
the
process
of
change
the
dna
sequence
to
use
the
common
human
codon
rather
than
the
rare
one
she
also
join
a
short
extra
sequence
onto
the
begin
of
the
spike
protein
s
code
this
be
another
technique
that
we
have
developed
to
make
the
vaccine
more
efficient
the
extra
sequence
cod
for
thirty
two
amino
acid
that
be
found
at
the
start
of
a
human
protein
call
tissue
plasminogen
activator
add
that
sequence
have
be
show
in
other
vaccine
to
lead
to
a
strong
immune
response
because
it
first
tell
the
vaccinate
human
cell
to
make
large
quantity
of
the
spike
protein
and
then
cut
itself
off
from
the
protein
once
the
protein
have
be
produce
within
forty
eight
hour
of
the
novel
coronavirus
genome
be
release
te
and
sarah
s
have
chosen
the
exact
protein
sequence
they
want
to
encode
and
the
precise
dna
sequence
that
they
need
for
that
the
order
to
get
this
new
piece
of
dna
make
be
sent
off
to
thermofisher
a
kind
of
life
science
supermarket
who
sell
everything
include
custom
make
synthetic
dna
the
order
would
have
look
like
a
roughly
letter
string
of
different
combination
of
the
letter
a
t
c
and
g
and
then
it
be
back
to
the
discussion
over
exactly
what
to
do
with
it
when
it
arrive
on
that
saturday
january
there
be
still
no
clear
evidence
that
human
to
human
transmission
be
take
place
there
have
be
no
confirm
case
outside
china
although
there
have
be
one
suspect
case
in
south
korea
and
i
be
still
sift
dphil
application
and
tell
my
friend
not
to
worry
on
the
even
of
monday
january
i
receive
an
email
from
sarah
g
ask
if
we
could
meet
to
discus
a
couple
of
thing
over
the
weekend
the
number
of
confirm
case
in
china
have
risen
from
to
and
earlier
that
day
china
have
confirm
human
to
human
transmission
be
take
place
sarah
suggest
that
this
news
make
it
more
likely
that
her
vaccine
project
would
move
from
experiment
in
her
lab
to
demonstrate
what
be
theoretically
possible
to
actually
make
a
vaccine
for
human
trial
meaning
i
be
go
to
need
to
get
involve
i
reply
the
next
day
i
be
not
a
same
day
email
replier
an
aspect
of
my
personality
that
have
be
severely
test
this
year
by
march
if
sarah
email
me
i
would
be
reply
within
twenty
minute
and
we
set
a
time
to
meet
it
still
didn
t
feel
particularly
urgent
a
couple
of
day
later
i
head
across
the
research
campus
to
the
jenner
institute
where
sarah
be
base
as
i
have
do
many
time
before
i
pass
through
the
airy
atrium
where
student
and
scientist
be
gather
in
small
group
drinking
coffee
or
in
intense
discussion
over
a
laptop
i
climbed
the
concrete
stair
two
floor
and
sat
down
in
sarah
s
little
office
full
of
university
issue
furniture
and
box
file
sarah
s
familiar
keep
calm
and
make
vaccine
mug
be
on
her
desk
it
seem
strange
look
back
on
it
now
but
the
meeting
be
relaxed
neither
of
us
i
think
have
yet
register
how
much
of
an
impact
this
virus
and
this
work
be
go
to
have
on
our
life
sarah
set
out
the
situation
she
and
te
have
already
order
the
dna
sequence
anticipate
that
they
might
get
funding
just
to
do
some
test
in
the
lab
and
animal
experiment
now
she
want
to
know
would
the
cbf
be
able
to
start
make
the
start
material
for
a
vaccine
against
this
new
virus
immediately
use
the
rapid
method
i
wasn
t
surprised
my
colleague
be
always
come
to
me
ask
me
to
do
a
lot
of
work
by
tomorrow
for
no
money
my
answer
be
measure
of
course
we
could
do
that
the
pre
gmp
lab
where
we
make
the
start
material
theoretically
have
capacity
to
work
on
four
project
at
any
one
time
although
we
didn
t
actually
have
enough
staff
to
do
that
and
i
could
see
that
this
be
potentially
important
but
the
team
be
all
currently
work
on
other
project
one
for
sarah
a
vaccine
against
crimean
congo
haemorrhagic
fever
and
one
for
te
against
lassa
and
marburg
virus
so
prioritisation
of
a
vaccine
against
this
new
coronavirus
meant
these
would
slip
my
other
concern
be
financial
the
cbf
be
run
like
a
small
business
within
the
university
and
in
order
to
operate
it
have
to
cover
its
cost
of
around
million
a
year
by
charge
its
client
researcher
like
sarah
and
te
who
in
turn
have
to
apply
for
grant
to
fund
their
research
the
project
that
sarah
be
ask
me
to
delay
or
deprioritise
be
already
agree
and
their
funding
be
secure
right
through
to
manufacture
it
would
be
a
big
risk
to
the
cbf
s
operation
to
drop
those
in
favour
of
this
new
project
when
it
wasn
t
at
all
clear
where
the
money
might
come
from
to
pay
for
any
of
it
sit
in
sarah
s
office
i
have
to
balance
the
risk
to
cbf
finance
of
lose
already
agree
work
with
the
fact
that
not
go
as
fast
as
possible
would
be
something
to
regret
if
the
spread
of
the
virus
continued
to
escalate
ok
i
say
let
s
go
for
it
i
be
in
the
cbf
would
make
the
start
material
for
the
vaccine
about
ml
of
seed
stock
from
which
all
batch
of
clinical
grade
vaccine
would
be
make
sarah
would
approach
a
selection
of
manufacturer
we
have
work
with
before
to
try
to
secure
manufacturing
slot
to
make
the
clinical
grade
vaccine
later
in
the
year
and
also
as
a
backup
feel
out
the
funders
of
our
next
clinical
grade
manufacturing
project
due
to
start
later
that
year
about
the
possibility
of
delay
if
necessary
i
head
straight
back
across
campus
to
the
cbf
to
begin
to
work
up
a
plan
and
let
my
team
know
what
be
go
on
over
the
next
few
day
wuhan
lock
down
and
start
building
hospital
and
case
be
report
in
one
and
two
in
country
across
the
world
as
we
wait
for
the
synthetic
dna
we
have
order
to
be
ship
back
to
us
sarah
sarah
s
the
cbf
team
and
i
discuss
which
method
we
should
use
to
make
the
start
material
the
still
not
fully
developed
rapid
method
or
the
try
and
test
classic
method
we
agree
to
try
the
rapid
method
because
of
course
we
want
to
move
as
quickly
as
possible
this
no
longer
felt
like
mostly
an
intellectual
exercise
but
also
to
initiate
the
classic
method
separately
as
a
backup
by
this
point
in
late
january
sarah
have
found
some
funding
for
us
to
cautiously
start
make
our
own
high
quality
batch
of
the
chadox
vaccine
need
to
kick
off
the
rapid
method
baking
the
cake
in
advance
we
be
about
halfway
through
and
would
take
another
three
week
or
so
to
complete
that
process
on
the
friday
of
that
week
that
be
still
our
plan
on
saturday
january
the
synthetic
dna
be
ship
back
to
us
inside
a
courier
deliver
jiffy
bag
be
what
look
like
an
empty
test
tube
in
fact
it
contain
about
billion
dehydrate
strand
of
the
dna
sequence
cod
for
the
spike
protein
this
be
invisible
even
under
a
microscope
and
weigh
a
few
microgram
far
less
than
a
grain
of
sand
which
weighs
a
few
milligram
by
the
monday
our
plan
to
bake
in
advance
our
own
chadox
vaccine
ready
to
be
decorate
with
the
gene
for
the
spike
protein
be
come
under
pressure
we
have
the
dna
we
need
to
start
decorate
everything
else
be
line
up
and
the
clinical
situation
be
look
increasingly
worry
it
no
longer
felt
right
to
wait
three
week
while
we
pre
bake
our
cake
instead
sarah
s
give
us
some
that
vaccitech
have
prepared
earlier
they
have
also
be
work
on
the
rapid
method
in
preparation
for
use
it
to
make
personalise
cancer
vaccine
and
so
we
embark
on
our
first
ever
attempt
to
make
a
vaccine
use
the
rapid
method
by
now
it
be
january
we
have
design
the
vaccine
agree
that
the
cbf
would
produce
the
start
material
decide
to
progress
with
both
classic
and
rapid
method
in
parallel
and
begin
all
the
necessary
paperwork
to
show
that
we
could
justify
our
decision
and
that
risk
have
be
consider
and
where
necessary
mitigate
sarah
have
found
some
funding
that
would
tide
us
over
for
a
while
my
team
at
the
cbf
be
prepared
and
ready
to
get
start
and
we
be
already
consider
way
to
speed
up
other
slow
part
of
the
manufacturing
and
release
process
it
be
also
at
around
this
point
that
sue
morris
an
adenovirus
expert
who
work
at
the
jenner
institute
with
sarah
sent
an
email
say
she
be
lose
sleep
sarah
have
come
up
with
the
original
idea
for
the
rapid
method
and
how
it
would
work
in
principle
but
it
be
sue
who
have
do
the
lab
work
to
make
it
happen
now
sue
be
kick
off
the
classic
method
in
sarah
s
lab
and
at
the
same
time
hold
our
hand
through
the
rapid
method
over
at
the
cbf
because
she
knew
more
about
it
than
anyone
else
this
would
be
the
first
of
many
similar
email
sleepless
night
be
to
become
the
new
normal
but
at
this
stage
we
be
all
naively
think
that
thing
would
calm
down
once
we
get
go

i
have
a
few
day
in
paris
book
at
the
end
of
the
month
for
my
birthday
i
have
live
there
for
three
year
from
work
in
a
laboratory
at
the
institut
curie
fund
by
an
eu
grant
my
old
friend
helen
and
i
drank
cocktail
in
crowd
bar
along
the
canal
saint
martin
and
i
wander
my
old
haunt
feast
on
charcuterie
and
brouilly
squash
in
at
tiny
table
in
my
favourite
caf
s
and
along
with
a
horde
of
other
tourist
saw
the
leonardo
exhibition
at
the
louvre
some
of
it
felt
just
like
in
the
old
day
and
yet
not
quite
my
friend
leo
have
an
apartment
in
the
belleville
area
know
for
its
chinese
restaurant
three
case
of
the
new
virus
have

all
people
recently
return
from
wuhan
leo
say
that
already
the
neighbourhood
felt
quieter
more
fearful
as
people
realise
that
this
be
not
just
a
problem
that
would
affect
someone
else
but
that
this
virus
be
now
spread
across
the
globe
i
return
from
paris
by
eurostar
late
on
the
even
of
friday
january
my

full
of

i
be
on
nearly
the
last
train
to
london
while
the
uk
be
still
a
part
of
the
european
union
it
felt
like
the
end
of
an
era
and
the
atmosphere
on
the
train
be
subdue
we
didn
t
know
then
that
while
it
be
indeed
the
end
of
that
era
we
be
right
at
the
start
of
a
new
one
that
none
of
us
have
vote
for
that
day
in

the
uk
record
its

my
memory

it
would
be
an
understatement
to
say
thing
escalate
fast
in
january
te
and
i
be
interested
in
how
quickly
we
might
be
able
to
make
a
vaccine
against
a
brand
new
pathogen
understand
that
it
might
turn
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
an
intellectual
exercise
by
the
middle
of
april
the
whole
world
want
to
know
i
spent
a
huge
amount
of
time
during
those
increasingly
strange
week
attempt
to
secure
the
funding
we
need
at
this
point
money
be
my
main
preoccupation
as
it
be
the
most
likely
reason
that
we
would
fail
to
make
a
vaccine
thankfully
the
bad
of
this
very
stressful
enterprise
be
over
by
the
end
of
april
by
that
point
we
have
over
million
in
commit
funding
and
a
commercial
partner
but
in
those
early
month
i
thought
of
little
else
day
and
night
we
couldn
t
wait
for
research
funding
to
be
award
which
you
will
understand
have
see
in
previous
chapter
how
painfully
slow
and
uncertain
this
process
can
be
so
we
decide
that
we
just
have
to
get
on
with
it
spending
money
we
do
not
yet
and
might
not
ever
have
we
would
ask
for
forgiveness
not
permission
i
wasn
t
sleep
a
great
deal
through
that
time
and
i
be
juggling
a
lot
of
ball
much
of
it
be
a
blur
but
i
do
remember
that
on
saturday
february
when
i
begin
write
the
application
to
the
governmental
body
uk
research
and
innovation
ukri
for
just
over
million
to
fund
the
manufacture
of
our
vaccine
for
our
first
clinical
trial
i
be
radioactive
i
don
t
mean
i
be
on
fire
or
on
top
of
my
game
i
mean
i
be
literally
radioactive
i
be
undergo
a
diagnostic
procedure
that
involve
swallow
a
capsule
of
radiolabelled
bile
acid
i
travel
a
lot
as
part
of
my
work
or
at
least
i
do
until
the
end
of
because
my
focus
have
be
work
on
vaccine
against
disease
that
be
prevalent
in
low
and
middle
income
country
and
because
cut
edge
scientific
research
be
by
nature
very
international
i
ve
take
work
trip
to
north
south
east
and
west
africa
china
saudi
arabia
the
united
state
much
of
south
east
asia
and
quite
a
bit
of
europe
often
trip
last
only
a
few
day
a
two
day
trip
to
delhi
economy
travel
both
way
and
only
leave
the
hotel
to
be
driven
back
to
the
airport
be
not
unusual
for
the
last
several
year
i
have
increasingly
be
suffer
on
these
trip
from
traveller
s
tummy
i
knew
all
the
advice
about
what
food
to
avoid
but
i
be
an
annoyingly
fussy
eater
and
sometimes
found
that
advice
difficult
to
follow
during
the
summer
of
i
decide
to
google
my
symptom
and
come
across
some
information
on
a
condition
call
bile
acid
malabsorption
apparently
it
often
go
undiagnosed
and
tends
to
get
bad
as
people
get
old
when
we
eat
food
contain
fat
our
gall
bladder
release
bile
acid
into
the
stomach
to
break
down
the
fat
and
allow
it
to
be
digest
the
bile
acid
pas
out
of
the
stomach
along
with
the
food
and
be
reabsorbed
in
the
small
intestine
and
recycle
however
in
some
people
the
reabsorption
doesn
t
happen
properly
that
mean
the
bile
acid
carry
on
through
the
digestive
tract
to
region
they
be
not
suppose
to
be
in
cause
irritation
and
leave
the
owner
of
the
digestive
tract
in
question
need
to
rush
to
the
loo
this
seem
a
plausible
explanation
for
my
issue
my
gp
concur
but
on
the
other
hand
i
might
have
bowel
cancer
and
she
would
be
remiss
not
to
rule
that
out
so
she
refer
me
to
a
consultant
gastroenterologist
for
test
the
consultant
turn
out
to
be
a
very
pleasant
woman
who
told
me
that
she
knew
of
my
work
because
her
former
phd
supervisor
be
a
collaborator
of
mine
this
kind
of
thing
be
an
occupational
hazard
oxford
be
not
a
large
city
but
there
be
a
huge
amount
of
medical
research
go
on
and
a
lot
of
hospital
when
i
go
into
hospital
in
labour
with
triplet
at
thirty
week
gestation
the
consultant
who
come
to
see
me
be
someone
for
whom
i
have
previously
organise
a
genetics
seminar
if
it
hadn
t
be
him
it
could
have
be
the
other
obstetrics
consultant
who
be
in
my
pilate
class
this
particular
consultant
arrange
a
series
of
test
for
me
which
all
come
back
as
normal
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
only
test
still
outstanding
be
a
so
call
sehcat
test
for
this
a
capsule
of
radiolabelled
synthetic
bile
acid
be
swallow
and
three
hour
later
a
scanner
be
use
to
detect
how
much
radioactivity
and
therefore
bile
acid
have
be
absorbed
into
the
gall
bladder
a
week
later
another
scan
be
take
to
see
how
much
remains
if
the
answer
be
very
little
it
mean
that
the
bile
acid
be
not
be
reabsorbed
in
the
normal
way
so
that
s
why
on
saturday
february
my
inside
be
literally
radioactive
and
my
mind
completely
occupy
with
thought
about
funding
case
of
the
still
unnamed
novel
coronavirus
be
by
this
time
start
to
be
report
in
dozen
of
country
across
asia
north
america
and
europe
include
three
confirm
case
in
the
uk
i
have
be
able
to
get
early
work
on
our
vaccine
off
the
ground
use
a
small
amount
of
flexible
funding
from
a
project
call
vaxhub
but
to
get
any
far
i
urgently
need
to
secure
much
more
actually
raise
fund
have
be
my
main
activity
for
year
when
people
think
of
scientist
i
think
they
imagine
us
bent
over
complex
equipment
in
a
lab
or
star
intently
at
a
test
tube
that
use
to
be
me
and
i
often
wish
it
still
be
i
enjoy
the
many
small
triumph
every
week
in
the
lab
create
a
perfect
image
of
the
dna
i
have
just
produce
and
cut
up
or
note
how
the
number
come
out
exactly
as
i
have
expect
on
a
virus
titration
fn
i
train
for
year
to
become
really
good
at
do
science
and
i
be
good
too
at
training
other
people
to
be
good
at
it
but
by
early
i
hadn
t
work
in
a
lab
for
over
ten
year
what
i
actually
spend
my
time
do
these
day
be
mostly
bring
in
the
money
i
be
employ
by
oxford
university
to
conduct
research
rather
than
to
teach
undergraduate
this
mean
that
i
be
require
to
secure
the
money
to
fund
that
research
i
have
to
find
way
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
equipment
and
material
we
use
in
the
lab
like
tissue
culture
vessel
or
growth
medium
for
culture
cell
i
have
to
cover
an
overhead
charge
to
pay
for
the
run
cost
of
the
university
building
we
work
in
and
so
on
i
also
have
to
cover
my
own
salary
and
the
salary
of
the
people
who
work
in
my
team
mainly
clinician
and
lab
researcher
but
also
three
full
time
project
manager
and
a
contract
specialist
to
help
secure
the
funding
keep
track
of
it
and
report
back
to
our
funders
essentially
each
research
group
be
like
a
small
business
or
charity
it
be
make
up
of
a
team
of
people
work
on
a
set
of
project
and
the
head
of
the
research
group
also
know
as
the
principal
investigator
have
to
bring
in
the
fund
to
keep
everyone
in
the
team
employ
this
cause
immense
stress
and
frustration
for
researcher
and
can
be
counterproductive
for
the
cause
of
scientific
research
itself
for
example
sometimes
grant
be
award
to
fund
research
into
a
particular
area
with
some
flexibility
as
to
how
the
fund
can
be
spent
increasingly
though
funding
be
for
a
quite
specific
purpose
and
sometimes
we
apply
for
and
be
award
contract
rather
than
grant
contract
be
more
prescriptive
than
even
the
most
restrictive
grant
they
sign
us
up
to
do
an
exact
project
in
this
exact
amount
of
time
for
this
exact
amount
of
money
they
can
be
appropriate
and
work
well
if
we
can
thoroughly
plan
out
everything
we
be
go
to
need
to
do
in
advance
for
example
if
we
be
manufacturing
a
vaccine
for
a
clinical
trial
and
then
conduct
that
trial
however
the
lack
of
flexibility
in
a
contract
can
be
problematic
for
reason
connect
to
government
funding
cycle
we
have
to
agree
to
start
the
work
by
a
certain
date
report
every
three
month
and
then
finish
by
a
certain
date
this
mean
researcher
be
often
try
to
shoehorn
the
work
they
want
to
do
into
the
time
and
budget
available
while
project
manager
spend
a
lot
of
time
track
the
researcher
activity
and
fill
out
more
form
apply
for
more
time
or
more
money
or
some
other
variation
to
the
contract
someone
in
the
team
take
maternity
leave
or
move
to
another
post
can
throw
a
whole
project
off
course
more
importantly
the
lack
of
flexibility
leaf
no
room
for
creativity
or
for
discovery
the
strict
structure
expect
us
to
know
what
we
be
go
to
do
and
how
long
it
will
take
to
achieve
it
which
work
when
the
research
can
be
define
in
advance
but
not
when
it
be
exploratory
and
innovative
obtain
funding
in
normal
time
be
also
a
long
and
uncertain
exercise
the
application
be
complex
to
write
the
process
frequently
take
a
year
from
start
to
finish
and
the
chance
of
success
be
always
well
under
one
in
three
as
you
ll
have
see
with
our
fail
cepi
application
in
chapter
research
council
and
other
funders
in
my
area
that
essentially
mean
cepi
the
wellcome
trust
ukri
and
until
recently
the
eu
will
put
out
call
for
proposal
invite
application
for
work
in
a
particular
area
to
be
submit
by
a
set
deadline
of
course
each
funder
have
its
own
application
process
with
its
own
quirk
involve
different
way
of
set
out
what
work
be
to
be
do
what
it
will
cost
and
how
long
it
will
take
each
funder
also
have
different
rule
about
what
it
will
pay
for
for
example
the
wellcome
trust
won
t
pay
for

in
research
lab
researcher
need
disposable
glove
this
be
in
part
to
protect
the
people
do
the
work
but
it
s
also
to
protect
the
work
from
us
as
human
have
bacteria
and
enzyme
on
our
skin
that
could
corrupt
whatever
we
re
work
on

glass
and

be
also
mandatory
in
most

on

other

pay
for

people
may
think
of
science
career
as
be
very
stable
but
in
reality
work
in
academic
research
can
be
extremely
uncertain
a
grant
might
provide
funding
for
a
project
last
anything
from
a
year
to
five
year
but
the
university
only
allows
us
to
advertise
job
for
that
project
once
the
money
have
be
award
this
mean
more
wait
it
might
be
month
before
someone
actually
start
work
on
the
project
but
their
employment
contract
can
t
extend
beyond
the
period
cover
by
the
funding
which
mean
someone
employ
to
work
on
a
three
year
project
who
doesn
t
arrive
until
six
month
in
will
get
a
contract
for
two
year
and
six
month
as
they
near
the
end
of
their
contract
researcher
often
don
t
know
whether
their
principal
investigator
will
obtain
far
funding
so
that
their
work
and
employment
can
continue
it
be
stressful
and
researcher
have
to
choose
between
devote
their
effort
to
get
the
research
do
and
paper
publish
thus
increase
the
chance
of
more
funding
or
look
around
for
other
job
many
excellent
scientist
sarah
sebastian
be
just
one
example
leave
academic
research
because
of
the
lack
of
stability
and
the
continuous
pressure
so
give
how
much
time
have
to
be
spent
secure
funding
and
write
paper
and
attend
meeting
all
over
the
world
to
hear
about
the
late
development
and
raise
one
s
profile
it
be
rare
for
a
principal
investigator
like
me
to
continue
with
any
lab
work
at
all
at
various
point
in
the
decade
prior
to
the
pandemic
i
regret
this
but
in
early
i
do
not
instead
i
look
on
those
year
of
navigate
the
complexity
and
frustration
of
endless
grant
application
as
vital
training
without
have
built
up
that
experience
i
would
never
have
be
able
to
make
my
way
through
the
fiendish
funding
maze
that
sprang
up
in
the
first
part
of
and
get
our
vaccine
project
so
far
so
fast

in
the
early
day
when
we
need
to
get
the
project
off
the
ground
and
the
world
wasn
t
yet
alive
to
the
urgency
of
the
situation
i
be
able
to
get
go
with
funding
from
vaxhub
all
of
the
other
funding
i
already
have
be
for
very
specific
project
but
the
vaxhub
funding
be
for
vaccine
development
work
in
general
and
that
allow
us
to
make
a
start
vaxhub
base
at
university
college
london
be
a
three
year
programme
that
be
aim
at
improve
vaccine
manufacturing
method
and
engage
with
both
uk
and
overseas
manufacturer
specifically
manufacturer
from
low
and
middle
income
country
it
be
important
because
manufacturing
can
be
a
big
bottleneck
in
get
new
vaccine
out
there
and
into
people
s
arm
it
s
no
use
make
a
fantastic
new
vaccine
that
look
great
in
the
lab
but
that
can
t
be
manufacture
in
a
way
that
allows
it
to
move
into
clinical
test
go
back
and
reinvent
it
to
make
it
suitable
for
manufacturing
can
add
year
to
the
development
process
the
funding
for
vaxhub
come
from
the
uk
government
s
official
development
assistance
budget
meaning
money
set
aside
to
invest
in
development
in
other
country
the
uk
have
commit
to
spending
of
its
gross
national
income
on
this
in
and
have
recognise
follow
the
ebola
outbreak
that
it
could
put
some
of
that
money
to
good
use
on
work
to
develop
vaccine
against
disease
that
cause
havoc
around
the
globe
the
funding
from
vaxhub
get
us
through
january
it
allow
us
to
buy
the
synthetic
dna
we
need
make
the
first
batch
of
vaccine
in
the
lab
immunise
some
mouse
and
analyse
the
result
but
even
as
te
and
i
be
get
start
with
design
the
vaccine
on
january
i
knew
that
if
we
want
to
keep
go
we
need
much
more
vaccine
development
funding
can
roughly
be
divide
into
four
phase
design
and
preclinical
test
make
and
test
the
start
material
make
the
vaccine
for
and
run
the
clinical
trial
and
finally
large
scale
manufacturing
and
roll
out
and
it
get
more
expensive
the
far
you
get
each
phase
require
at
least
one
more
zero
on
the
end
of
the
cost
our
main
prospect
be
cepi
and
ukri
so
i
start
scour
their
website
and
email
my
contact
there
on
january
i
initiate
discussion
with
cepi
they
say
that
they
be
go
to
focus
on
the
very
quick
platform
namely
dna
and
mrna
in
the
first
instance
i
be
astonish
dna
and
mrna
vaccine
can
be
ready
for
clinical
trial
quickly
but
not
necessarily
much
faster
than
adenoviral
vectored
vaccine
in
the
event
our
phase
iii
trial
be
the
first
to
start
by
a
long
way
this
could
certainly
be
the
chance
to
use
mrna
vaccine
on
a
large
scale
for
the
first
time
but
commit
to
only
dna
and
mrna
vaccine
make
no
sense
to
me
it
be
a
dishearten
start
the
who
declare
a
public
health
emergency
on
january
this
be
the
high
alert
level
that
the
who
can
announce
so
even
though
the
word
pandemic
be
not
use
the
world
should
have
take
more
notice
of
it
than
it
do
fn
the
next
day
the
first
uk
case
be
confirm
despite
what
cepi
have
say
in
january
about
focus
on
mrna
and
dna
vaccine
they
put
out
a
more
general
call
for
proven
vaccine
technology
applicable
for
large
scale
manufacturing
for
rapid
response
against
novel
coronavirus
ncov
the
closing
date
be
two
week
later
which
be
extremely
tight
not
long
after
ukri
put
out
a
similarly
wide
call
for
proposal
for
almost
any
research
that
might
help
to
tackle
covid
with
million
on
offer
altogether
part
of
successfully
win
funding
in
these
competitive
situation
be
know
how
much
of
the
total
pot
to
bid
for
assume
i
get
the
cepi
funding
to
make
and
test
the
start
material
the
next
thing
i
would
need
be
funding
to
manufacture
the
first
batch
of
clinical
grade
vaccine
for
clinical
trial
and
to
set
up
and
then
run
the
clinical
trial
themselves
neither
of
those
activity
come
cheap
but
i
knew
that
if
i
ask
for
much
over
of
the
total
pot
i
be
unlikely
to
get
it
fortunately
because
of
the
work
we
have
do
in
january
we
have
already
produce
a
batch
of
research
grade
vaccine
immunise
some
mouse
with
it
and
show
that
it
produce
an
immune
response
our
vaccine
genuinely
be
ready
to
take
to
the
next
stage
and
i
felt
our
application
be
strong
but
time
be
short
and
the
stake
be
high
and
everything
have
to
be
line
up
one
part
of
the
puzzle
be
manufacturing
cath
s
only
clean
room
be
already
take
manufacturing
an
ebola
vaccine
for
te
and
it
didn
t
feel
right
to
pull
that
work
fn
clean
room
be
the
name
for
the
strictly
regulate
lab
in
which
we
be
able
to
make
vaccine
for
human
use
but
our
long
time
collaborator
at
advent
in
italy
a
contract
manufacturing
organisation
specialise
in
make
adenovirus
vaccine
have
availability
in
april
and
may
so
i
ask
them
to
quote
for
do
the
manufacturing
with
the
start
material
cath
and
her
team
be
now
make
the
plan
for
the
clinical
trial
itself
have
to
be
quite
modest
and
even
then
i
knew
they
would
need
to
be
expand
later
but
this
at
least
would
get
us
start
coronaviruses
be
respiratory
virus
know
that
with
respiratory
virus
child
often
become
infect
and
transmit
the
virus
despite
not
be
noticeably
ill
themselves
i
want
to
include
immunisation
of
child
in
the
clinical
trial
the
oxford
vaccine
group
part
of
the
university
s
paediatrics
department
specialise
in
run
vaccine
trial
in
child
and
head
up
by
my
colleague
andy
pollard
have
enormous
experience
and
so
work
with
them
make
much
more
sense
than
try
to
set
this
up
from
scratch
within
my
own
group
as
it
turn
out
child
don
t
play
such
an
important
role
in
transmission
with
covid
and
we
learn
quite
quickly
that
have
a
vaccine
that
be
effective
in
old
people
would
be
far
more
crucial
because
of
that
we
decide
to
wait
for
the
vaccine
to
be
approve
for
use
demonstrate
that
it
be
highly
safe
and
effective
in
adult
before
enrol
child
into
the
trial
the
child
s
trial
be
eventually
start
in
march
however
ask
andy
to
join
the
team
turn
out
to
be
a
really
smart
move
anyway
not
only
because
of
his
huge
experience
but
also
because
of
his
unwavering
commitment
to
public
health
and
capacity
for
do
whatever
it
take
to
make
a
difference
so
this
be
the
state
of
thing
when
on
saturday
february
i
walk
to
the
john
radcliffe
hospital
in
oxford
to
swallow
a
radioactive
capsule
i
be
due
to
be
fly
to
amsterdam
the
next
day
for
a
meeting
about
the
mers
nipah
lassa
vaccine
programme
so
i
be
also
give
a
letter
to
take
with
me
to
the
airport
the
next
day
explain
why
i
might
set
off
the
security
alarm
look
back
now
it
seem
slightly
surprising
that
not
only
have
i
not
drop
my
other
work
at
this
point
i
also
be
prepared
to
get
on
a
plane
to
amsterdam
in
the
event
the
meeting
be
cancel
because
my
colleague
at
janssen
be
also
very
busy
with
their
own
covid
response
work
have
take
the
capsule
with
instruction
to
return
in
three
hour
i
walk
back
to
my
office
to
work
on
the
grant
application
fill
in
these
form
can
be
a
bit
like
take
an
exam
there
be
strict
word
limit
so
you
have
to
consider
carefully
what
be
be
ask
in
each
section
and
answer
precisely
with
no
waffle
i
have
hone
my
technique
over
time
but
it
s
still
about
as
fun
as
take
an
exam
as
the
radiolabelled
bile
acid
be
make
their
way
to
my
gall
bladder
i
work
my
way
through
the
application
form
a
week
later
i
be
back
in
the
hospital
look
at
an
image
of
my
abdomen
lie
still
on
a
hard
surface
with
a
pillow
thoughtfully
provide
and
the
scanner
over
my
abdomen
i
be
the
most
relaxed
i
have
felt
for
a
while
the
background
be
black
and
there
be
a
faint
roughly
circular
patch
of
white
dot
which
apparently
be
my
gall
bladder
with
a
few
more
white
dot
scat
over
the
large
area
of
my
abdomen
eventually
about
eight
month
after
first
suspect
that
i
be
suffer
from
bile
acid
malabsorption
i
get
a
letter
confirm
it
this
do
not
come
as
any
great
surprise
i
have
be
pretty
confident
eight
month
previously
that
this
be
what
be
go
on
the
gp
have
be
pretty
confident
too
and
the
simple
treatment
that
i
have
start
take
anyway
have
already
be
work
but
i
have
to
do
the
test
to
make
sure
and
to
rule
out
something
bad
like
bowel
cancer
which
inevitably
take
time
i
m
tell
this
story
as
it
strike
me
that
there
be
parallel
between
get
this
kind
of
official
diagnosis
and
vaccine
development
similarly
i
be
already
pretty
confident
in
january
that
we
have
design
a
vaccine
against
the
novel
coronavirus
that
would
be
safe
and
effective
but
we
couldn
t
just
assume
that
my
hypothesis
would
have
to
be
test
and
bad
case
scenario
like
a
vaccine
that
be
not
safe
rule
out
and
again
that
would
unfortunately
take
time
how
much
time
would
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
the
money

the
application
to
cepi
and
ukri
be
both
submit
in
mid
february
but
i
knew
it
would
be
several
week
before
we
heard
back
from
either
of
them
meanwhile
it
be
become
clearer
to
me
every
day
as
the
virus
continued
to
spread
across
the
world
at
unprecedented
speed
that
we
could
not
afford
to
lose
time
wait
and
even
when
the
money
do
come
through
though
really
it
be
an
if
rather
than
a
when
it
would
still
barely
touch
the
side
of
what
we
need
in
normal
time
we
would
have
an
idea
for
a
new
project
write
a
grant
application
and
only
when
we
heard
that
we
have
the
funding
probably
about
a
year
later
would
we
order
the
gene
and
start
the
work
but
mid
february
be
not
a
normal
time
we
have
order
the
gene
on
january
and
it
have
arrive
back
with
us
two
week
later
cath
and
her
team
at
the
cbf
have
begin
make
the
start
material
we
have
clinical
trial
design
and
work
with
andy
and
his
team
need
to
start
prepare
for
them
together
with
another
colleague
dr
sandy
douglas
we
be
already
think
about
large
scale
manufacturing
cath
and
i
have
start
talk
to
the
regulator
in
any
other
circumstance
we
would
have
wait
before
do
any
of
it
for
funding
to
be
confirm
instead
through
february
into
march
and
for
the
first
half
of
april
we
have
to
keep
go
cross
our
finger
and
hope
that
the
money
would
come
through
some
of
those
decision
we
could
take
on
our
own
in
a
university
academic
can
act
relatively
autonomously
at
least
for
a
short
while
and
cath
and
i
could
take
a
deep
breath
brace
ourselves
and
just
decide
that
she
be
go
to
commit
the
time
at
her
very
expensive
facility
for
other
thing
we
do
need
permission
though
for
example
i
have
include
in
the
ukri
application
the
cost
of
manufacturing
the
vaccine
at
advent
in
italy
but
to
reserve
the
precious
time
in
advent
s
clean
room
there
need
to
be
a
contract
usually
it
would
simply
be
unthinkable
to
ask
the
university
to
sign
a
contract
before
we
have
official
confirmation
of
the
funding
however
this
be
a
pandemic
without
the
contract
we
would
lose
the
manufacturing
slot
we
have
line
up
at
advent
without
the
slot
our
clinical
trial
would
be
delayed
there
have
to
be
a
way
go
against
normal
protocol
the
university
agree
to
take
the
risk
and
underwrite
the
contract
if
no
funding
come
through
the
university
would
cover
the
cost
forge
ahead
despite
no
guaranteed
funding
solve
one
problem
it
meant
we
weren
t
wait
but
it
wasn
t
enough
in
the
race
between
us
and
the
virus
the
virus
be
draw
ahead
to
have
any
chance
of
keep
pace
with
it
we
need
to
work
harder
and
faster
and
that
would
require
more
fund
than
i
have
felt
able
to
bid
for
from
cepi
and
the
ukri
pot
combine
the
obvious
place
to
look
be
cepi
again
i
call
them
up
and
ask
if
we
could
use
some
of
the
million
that
my
lab
have
be
award
in
principle
for
our
mers
nipah
lassa
project
that
award
include
funding
to
work
on
a
large
scale
manufacturing
process
for
chadox
vectored
vaccine
since
this
work
would
only
need
to
be
do
once
and
would
be
applicable
to
all
chadox
vectored
vaccine
could
we
spend
the
fund
now
for
work
on
large
scale
manufacturing
of
the
covid
vaccine
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
discuss
this
with
senior
people
at
cepi
during
february
and
march
and
write
an
application
to
do
it
one
difficulty
be
that
funders
want
a
definite
plan
what
exactly
be
we
go
to
do
how
long
will
it
take
and
what
will
it
cost
but
our
plan
kept
change
get
big
and
faster
every
day
as
it
become
increasingly
clear
how
urgently
the
world
be
go
to
need
this
vaccine
for
example
there
come
a
point
in
early
march
when
cath
and
i
realise
that
wait
for
advent
to
manufacture
the
vaccine
would
take
too
long
cath
and
her
team
would
need
to
stop
work
on
the
ebola
vaccine
and
switch
to
manufacturing
the
first
batch
of
our
vaccine
snappily
know
as
chadox
ncov
we
didn
t
have
the
funding
to
pay
for
the
manufacture
at
the
cbf
but
we
all
agree
we
re
just
go
to
have
to
do
it
anyway
we
also
start
lobbying
the
government
through
our
connection
at
the
uk
bioindustry
association
the
bia
a
network
of
company
that
work
to
manufacture
or
support
the
manufacture
of
biological
medicine
we
be
contact
anyone
we
could
find
to
say
we
think
we
can
make
a
vaccine
and
we
think
we
can
make
it
fast
but
we
be
go
to
need
money
this
be
not
a
cheap
process
and
we
start
look
for
a
commercial
pharmaceutical
partner
who
would
be
able
to
manufacture
our
vaccine
at
the
large
scale
that
it
be
now
obvious
would
be
necessary
just
five
week
after
cepi
have
put
out
a
call
for
proposal
we
get
the
funding
we
now
have
for
make
and
test
the
start
material
five
week
compare
this
with
the
twenty
one
month
it
have
take
to
get
from
proposal
to
funding
for
our
mers
nipah
lassa
project
it
provide
some
small
relief
but
the
reality
be
that
we
be
already
halfway
through
the
work
this
money
be
meant
to
fund
and
be
do
much
more
that
continued
to
be
unfunded
two
day
later
on
march
i
take
the
train
to
london
i
have
be
invite
to
speak
about
our
work
on
a
possible
covid
vaccine
at
a
private
briefing
of
the
government
s
science
and
technology
committee
and
attendance
in
person
be
still
just
about
what
be
expect
the
last
time
i
have
be
to
the
house
of
common
have
be
a
few
year
earlier
when
our
whole
family
go
on
a
tour
as
part
of
a
day
out
in
london
i
take
a
train
to
marylebone
station
and
walk
from
there
through
marylebone
and
mayfair
and
across
st
james
s
park
i
didn
t
want
to
go
on
the
tube
if
i
could
avoid
it
because
of
the
risk
of
be
crammed
together
with
people
who
might
be
infectious
so
i
enjoy
the
walk
through
the
unusually
quiet
street
i
be
one
of
six
expert
invite
to
give
evidence
to
the
committee
assemble
beforehand
outside
the
committee
room
we
all
kept
our
distance
from
one
another
then
one
of
the
other
expert
who
i
have
not
met
before
held
out
his
hand
to
shake
mine
i
respond
with
a
lao
style
greet
place
both
my
hand
together
in
a
prayer
position
and
give
a
small
nod
yes
we
shouldn
t
be
shake
hand
maybe
we
could
bump
elbow
instead
he
suggest
somewhat
uncertainly
i
say
that
i
d
rather
use
a
greet
that
involve
no
contact
at
all
to
be
honest
handshake
have
cause
me
problem
in
the
past
and
i
would
not
be
sorry
if
they
be
a
permanent
casualty
of
this
pandemic
on
a
visit
to
riyadh
to
discus
a
mers
vaccine
clinical
trial
i
knew
that
men
might
not
want
to
shake
hand
with
a
woman
and
so
didn
t
offer
my
hand
at
a
conference
i
be
to
be
invite
onto
the
stage
to
receive
an
award
from
the
guest
of
honour
a
saudi
prince
and
be
told
on
no
account
attempt
to
shake
hand
with
the
prince
but
as
i
walk
towards
him
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
so
i
shook
it
by
the
end
of
the
day
have
revert
to
the
practice
of
offering
my
hand
a
man
recoil
from
me
in
horror
his
hand
firmly
behind
his
back
say
i
don
t
shake
hand
with
stranger
by
which
of
course
he
meant
woman
establish
a
new
universally
recognise
greet
with
no
physical
contact
could
solve
a
number
of
problem
in
the
committee
room
in
the
palace
of
westminster
i
spoke
about
the
vaccine
development
work
we
be
do
in
oxford
how
it
follow
on
from
other
work
we
have
do
on
the
mers
vaccine
and
why
it
be
both
possible
and
essential
to
proceed
very
quickly
i
also
say
that
we
need
funding
for
the
work
as
a
matter
of
urgency
the
follow
day
march
the
who
declare
covid
a
global
pandemic
the
next
few
week
be
some
of
the
most
hectic
and
surreal
of
my
life
i
be
run
in
parallel
half
a
dozen
stage
of
vaccine
development
that
would
usually
happen
over
year
and
in
sequence
at
the
same
time
we
be
start
to
attract
a
lot
of
medium
interest
set
up
a
deal
with
big
pharma
and
go
into
lockdown
but
by
the
end
of
those
week
while
i
be
concerned
about
many
other
thing
our
money
worry
seem
to
be
over
finally
it
felt
like
we
have
the
support
to
be
able
to
do
what
we
need
to
at
the
end
of
march
just
as
the
entire
country
go
into
lockdown
for
the
first
time
we
heard
that
my
radioactive
bid
for
million
from
ukri
have
be
successful
which
be
lucky
because
we
have
already
spent
quite
a
lot
of
it
cath
and
her
team
be
several
week
into
make
the
vaccine
whose
manufacture
the
money
be
suppose
to
fund
and
of
course
that
contract
with
advent
have
be
sign
on
april
the
uk
s
new
vaccine
taskforce
be
announce
its
role
be
to
support
effort
to
develop
manufacture
and
roll
out
a
vaccine
as
soon
as
possible
include
by
rapidly
mobilise
funding
and
on
april
the
government
award
us
million
later
expand
to
million
to
support
both
expand
manufacturing
and
clinical
trial
again
we
have
already
start
spending
it
our
clinical
trial
start
two
day
later
we
also
be
not
guaranteed
the
whole
lot
million
be
award
initially
but
we
be
go
to
have
to
jump
through
a
hoop
partway
through
the
project
to
release
the
second
half
andy
and
his
team
need
these
fund
to
get
start
on
expand
the
clinical
trial
from
oxford
to
eighteen
other
site
around
the
uk
so
i
have
to
come
up
with
a
list
of
milestone
that
would
demonstrate
significant
progress
have
be
make
but
that
i
be
confident
we
would
achieve
very
soon
by
early
may
we
have
secure
the
second
half
of
the
million
which
meant
the
phase
iii
trial
could
begin
usually
secure
from
cepi
fn
or
million
from
ukri
let
alone
million
from
the
department
of
health
would
be
the
cue
to
throw
party
of
ever
increase
size
for
everyone
involve
which
be
a
continually
grow
group
of
people
but
of
course
we
be
lock
down
and
we
still
have
a
lot
to
do
there
be
no
time
to
celebrate
and
no
possibility
of
come
within
two
metre
of
one
another
let
alone
throw
a
party
it
didn
t
even
really
feel
like
a
success
it
felt
like
a
disaster
avert
it
would
have
be
completely
awful
if
we
have
not
get
the
funding
our
work
would
have
stop
and
our
name
would
have
be
mud
for
the
next
ten
year
as
the
university
paid
off
our
debt
so
there
be
no
party
just
huge
relief
all
round
now
that
we
have
finally
solve
the
money
we
could
get
on
with
the
science

about
find
a

as
though
the
thing
already
exist
maybe
in
a
forgotten
freezer
somewhere
and
our
only
job
be
to
look
hard
enough
we
never

that
way
we

use
range
from
try
and
test
method
that
a
sixteen
year
old
science
student
might
recognise
to
newly
developed
state
of
the
art
technology
the
work
be
fiddly
and
exact
the
people
often
manipulate
tiny
quantity
of
precious
substance
and
work
under
layer
of
protective
gear
be
meticulous
systematic
and
dedicate
as
we
ve
be
explain
in
this
book
we
be
not
completely
unprepared
we
have
be
think
about
and
try
to
prepare
for
disease
x
for
some
time
but
one
thing
we
have
not
thought
about
be
this
how
do
you
fight
a
pandemic
when
you
be
in
a
pandemic

at
the
end
of
january
before
i
left
for
my
birthday
trip
to
paris
i
sent
an
email
to
the
whole
team
at
the
cbf
the
email
let
them
know
that
we
be
immediately
begin
work
on
the
start
material
for
a
vaccine
against
the
coronavirus
from
wuhan
that
they
have
heard
me
talk
about
over
the
last
few
day
at
this
stage
that
be
all
we
be
commit
to
do
however
i
be
clear
to
note
this
be
an
evolve
situation
and
so
our
plan
may
change
on
an
almost
daily
basis
if
the
situation
globally
becomes
more
or
less
severe
different
kind
of
vaccine
be
make
in
different
way
when
it
come
to
make
any
adenovirus
vectored
vaccine
which
be
what
our
covid
vaccine
be
i
always
tell
people
it
be
a
bit
like
make
bread
partly
because
make
vaccine
from
start
material
which
be
unique
to
adenovirus
vectored
vaccine
be
like
make
sourdough
from
a
starter
and
maybe
also
because
during
the
first
lockdown
baking
become
quite
a
focus
for
me
as
a
way
to
stay
sane
my
family
s
weekly
zoom
baking
session
with
my
parent
my
sister
and
her
family
and
me
and
my
daughter
all
cooking
the
same
recipe
and
then
compare
our
creation
everything
from
cornish
pasty
to
chocolate
swiss
roll
really
help
to
get
me
through
there
be
five
step
in
the
recipe
for
any
adenovirus
vectored
vaccine
step
make
the
start
material
a
vaccine
s
start
material
be
like
a
sourdough
starter
it
act
as
the
basis
for
all
the
batch
that
will
eventually
be
make
step
in
a
clean
room
use
the
start
material
to
produce
the
require
quantity
of
vaccine
in
baking
term
this
be
when
you
mix
the
ingredient
and
bake
the
bread
step
still
in
the
clean
room
purify
the
vaccine
away
from
unwanted
cellular
component
use
in
the
manufacturing
process
stretch
the
analogy
a
bit
this
be
like
remove
the
bread
the
bit
you
want
from
the
tin
the
bit
that
be
useful
for
make
it
but
that
you
don
t
need
any
more
step
in
a
completely
sterile
environment
fill
into
individual
vial
slice
and
wrap
your
bake
bread
step
label
the
vial
document
the
process
test
and
certify
the
product
and
distribute
essentially
the
taste
test
before
put
on
the
shelf
in
this
chapter
use
these
same
step
i
m
go
to
walk
you
through
how
we
first
make
not
found
the
vaccine
that
be
now
be
roll
out
across
the
world
and
may
now
be
protect
you
and
your
family
from
this
horrible
disease
step
make
the
start
material
we
normally
allow
three
to
four
month
to
make
a
start
material
in
the
cbf
use
the
classic
method
but
this
time
we
be
go
to
be
attempt
the
rapid
method
at
this
point
my
most
optimistic
estimate
be
that
we
might
have
a
start
material
ready
by
mid
march
and
the
vaccine
make
by
advent
ready
for
clinical
trial
step
by
the
end
of
july
to
hit
these
date
everything
would
need
to
go
perfectly
the
rapid
method
which
we
have
never
use
before
would
need
to
work
the
team
would
need
to
do
double
shift
and
come
in
on
weekend
we
would
need
to
deprioritise
all
other
project
and
we
would
need
to
proceed
through
the
process
at
risk
in
other
word
move
forward
to
the
next
stage
of
the
process
before
all
test
be
complete
on
the
previous
stage
it
s
important
to
be
clear
here
that
the
risk
be
not
to
the
end
product
the
vaccine
itself
but
to
our
time
effort
and
finance
if
a
problem
be
identify
during
test
some
of
our
work
have
be
futile
and
we
have
to
back
up
and
repeat
a
step
in
the
event
many
thing
do
go
wrong
but
our
first
batch
of
start
material
be
ready
as
we
have
hop
by
march
and
the
vaccine
be
ready
for
trial
by
april
much
earlier
than
we
have
originally
hop
on
tuesday
january
after
the
first
of
her
many
sleepless
night
sue
and
the
pre
gmp
team
kick
off
the
rapid
method
the
pre
gmp
team
make
the
start
material
sue
take
the
pre
bake
chadox
vaccine
that
vaccitech
have
prepared
earlier
and
combine
it
with
the
synthetic
dna
that
cod
for
the
spike
protein
now
she
hopefully
have
a
sequence
of
dna
that
cod
for
the
covid
vaccine
chadox
ncov
but
virus
dna
outside
of
a
living
cell
be
just
an
inert
chemical
to
allow
the
virus
to
assemble
and
replicate
itself
the
dna
need
to
be
insert
into
living
cell
which
would
become
little
microfactories
churn
out
copy
of
the
virus
sue
and
the
team
introduce
the
dna
into
a
special
type
of
lab
grown
human
cell
know
as
hek
cell
fn
the
method
we
use
for
insert
naked
dna
into
a
human
cell
be
call
transfection
and
have
be
use
for
decade
the
external
membrane
of
human
cell
be
make
from
a
lipid
fatty
layer
you
can
imagine
it
like
the
outside
of
a
wash
up
liquid
bubble
this
act
as
a
boundary
between
the
substance
inside
the
cell
protein
chemical
the
cell
s
own
dna
and
the
nutritious
broth
or
growth
medium
that
the
cell
be
grown
in
the
dna
for
the
vaccine
cannot
get
across
that
membrane
into
the
cell
so
we
put
it
in
a
solution
that
coat
it
in
a
bubble
similar
to
the
lipid
layer
that
make
up
the
outside
of
the
hek
cell
when
the
vaccine
dna
in
its
solution
be
then
mixed
with
the
hek
cell
the
two
lipid
surface
can
fuse
together
in
the
same
way
as
when
two
small
wash
up
liquid
bubble
fuse
together
to
become
one
big
bubble
the
dna
be
now
inside
the
cell
where
it
provide
the
instruction
for
the
cell
to
make
lot
of
copy
of
the
adenovirus
we
always
make
lot
of
these
vaccine
dna
and
hek
cell
preparation
in
parallel
because
some
of
our
synthetic
dna
will
contain
error
this
time
around
because
we
have
never
use
this
method
before
we
also
make
preparation
with
lot
of
different
condition
different
ratio
of
adenovirus
dna
to
spike
protein
dna
different
ratio
of
cell
to
dna
and
so
on
after
about
a
week
we
should
have
start
to
see
that
virus
particle
be
be
produce
inside
the
hek
cell
each
individual
copy
of
a
virus
be
call
a
virus
particle
but
by
february
nearly
three
week
later
we
could
not
detect
virus
particle
in
any
of
the
dozen
of
preparation
we
have
make
the
rapid
method
have
fail
this
be
obviously
a
setback
and
a
disappointment
we
be
aware
that
sarah
and
other
colleague
be
wait
for
us
but
we
didn
t
take
it
too
hard
we
have
not
have
the
time
to
do
any
practice
run
and
it
be
always
a
big
ask
to
expect
a
new
method
to
work
first
time
the
plan
be
to
go
back
to
this
method
and
figure
out
what
go
wrong
so
that
we
be
ready
for
next
time
fortunately
while
we
have
be
try
to
get
the
rapid
method
work
sue
have
also
be
work
on
a
backup
use
the
slow
but
much
practise
classic
method
so
on
february
as
family
be
enjoy
half
term
ski
holiday
in
austria
and
italy
unaware
that
they
would
be
bring
coronavirus
back
home
with
their
memory
of
the
mountain
we
activate
plan
b
the
classic
method
but
faster
classic
plus
you
might
call
it
traditionally
we
do
the
transfection
then
leave
the
mixture
incubate
for
up
to
a
week
at
this
stage
to
allow
virus
to
be
make
and
to
proliferate
we
then
purify
the
vaccine
out
of
the
cell
it
have
grown
in
this
mean
we
remove
the
complicate
mixture
of
protein
nucleic
acid
fat
and
carbohydrate
that
make
up
the
content
of
a
human
cell
so
that
we
be
left
with
pure
viral
vaccine
particle
after
that
we
clone
the
viral
vaccine
particle
meaning
we
isolate
single
virus
particle
and
allow
each
one
to
infect
a
tiny
cell
culture
and
make
lot
more
copy
of
itself
inside
those
cell
culture
be
our
term
for
cell
in
growth
medium
then
we
check
the
genetic
sequence
of
each
clone
and
proceed
with
whichever
one
be
completely
correct
and
homogeneous
this
lengthy
and
labour
intensive
clone
process
be
know
as
single
virion
clone
because
we
be
make
a
clone
from
a
single
virus
particle
or
virion
it
be
necessary
to
ensure
we
end
up
with
a
vaccine
that
contains
completely
genetically
correct
and
identical
viral
particle
there
be
always
some
error
in
the
strand
of
synthetic
dna
provide
the
dna
be
make
by
a
machine
use
chemical
reaction
and
no
chemical
reaction
can
be
accurate
when
you
be
repeat
it
billion
time
also
mutation
or
contamination
can
happen
during
the
manipulation
we
do
to
get
this
far
over
the
year
we
have
found
many
different
way
that
thing
can
go
wrong
during
this
whole
process
that
be
only
of
interest
to
the
nerdiest
of
virologist
single
virion
clone
though
it
be
slow
labour
intensive
expensive
and
still
do
not
always
work
have
always
be
the
solution
but
this
time
to
go
faster
with
a
well
chance
of
a
successful
outcome
we
come
up
with
an
alternative
plan
the
classic
plus
plan
in
any
gmp
manufacturing
facility
there
be
what
be
call
a
qualify
person
or
qp
this
be
the
person
who
ultimately
certifies
the
release
of
every
batch
of
product
it
be
obviously
a
role
with
great
personal
responsibility
eleanor
berrie
have
be
a
qp
for
more
than
twenty
year
and
have
enormous
expertise
in
adenovirus
production
eleanor
s
plan
be
instead
of
work
from
single
virus
particle
which
involve
incubate
for
a
week
purify
isolate
virus
particle
and
clone
them
we
would
work
from
single
infect
cell
after
just
one
day
of
incubation
we
would
take
the
population
of
cell
that
have
be
transfected
dilute
them
in
order
to
separate
them
into
individual
cell
and
introduce
each
of
those
individual
cell
into
a
new
uninfected
culture
each
single
infect
cell
would
then
produce
an
independent
preparation
of
the
vaccine
which
could
be
expand
and
test
to
check
it
be
completely
correct
and
homogeneous
that
be
a
true
clone
limit
dilution
work
from
individual
cell
be
a
much
faster
but
less
reliable
way
of
get
a
completely
correct
and
homogeneous
population
than
single
virion
clone
work
from
individual
virus
particle
our
timing
here
be
fortunate
it
be
only
possible
to
use
this
method
because
of
recent
advance
in
dna
sequence
at
the
cbf
we
have
be
work
for
about
a
year
to
implement
a
technique
call
next
generation
sequence
ng
which
allow
us
to
read
the
whole
genome
sequence
of
any
adenovirus
ourselves
in
twenty
four
hour
at
high
sequence
depth
for
around
we
could
therefore
be
confident
in
proceed
with
material
that
have
not
be
through
the
traditional
more
reliable
but
much
slow
procedure
because
we
could
check
multiple
preparation
and
any
erroneous
or
mixed
preparation
could
be
reliably
detect
and
discard
this
would
save
us
week
if
not
month
of
effort
and
more
importantly
here
of
time
eleanor
set
up
the
classic
plus
transfection
on
february
three
day
after
we
decide
the
rapid
method
have
fail
she
would
not
normally
be
do
lab
work
this
be
like
get
the
professor
to
mop
the
floor
but
while
the
rest
of
the
country
be
maybe
not
take
this
new
virus
seriously
our
prime
minister
have
yet
to
attend
a
cobra
meeting
on
the
topic
we
be
follow
the
situation
in
china
and
in
europe
we
knew
the
stake
be
high
and
we
could
not
afford
another
failure
we
need
eleanor
s
hand
on
expertise
by
the
next
week
we
could
see
that
some
of
the
preparation
do
contain
viral
particle
you
can
t
see
these
with
the
naked
eye
or
even
with
a
standard
microscope
but
the
cell
which
be
much
big
than
the
viral
particle
grow
in
a
single
layer
on
the
surface
of
the
plate
what
we
could
see
down
the
microscope
be
hole
in
the
cell
layer
where
a
cell
have
become
infect
burst
and
go
on
to
infect
its
neighbour
we
have
clone
from
that
point
we
need
to
expand
these
tiny
amount
of
viral
vaccine
to
generate
enough
material
to
sequence
their
dna
we
do
this
gradually
move
our
viral
vaccine
to
ever
large
container
from
an
indentation
the
size
of
the
rubber
on
the
end
of
a
pencil
to
one
the
size
of
a
two
pound
coin
and
so
on
until
a
few
day
later
our
five
most
promising
look
candidate
be
each
transfer
to
a
flask
with
a
surface
area
of
cm
at
that
point
we
sequence
the
candidate
use
ng
and
discard
any
that
be
not
genetically
correct
by
early
march
we
have
picked
a
favourite
that
be
genetically
perfect
and
proliferate
particularly
well
its
name
be
d
and
i
have
a
lovely
picture
of
it
at
four
day
old
it
look
like
a
tiny
heart
we
need
enough
start
material
to
seed
the
manufacturing
process
many
time
over
so
we
now
set
about
make
a
much
large
preparation
of
d
to
do
this
we
use
special
flask
call
hyperflasks
each
with
a
surface
area
of
cm
equivalent
to
about
three
page
of
a
paper
the
cell
grow
in
a
single
layer
on
the
surface
area
of
their
container
we
seed
one
hyperflask
of
cell
culture
with
some
of
the
d
vaccine
preparation
the
adenovirus
vaccine
infect
the
cell
turn
them
into
adenovirus
vaccine
microfactories
and
kill
the
cell
in
the
process
the
next
day
we
repeat
the
process
now
use
the
amplify
d
adenovirus
vaccine
from
the
first
hyperflask
to
seed
eleven
more
hyperflasks
of
cell
culture
from
these
we
generate
nearly
ml
of
start
material
contain
about
billion
infectious
virus
particle
per
millilitre
in
total
we
end
up
make
about
ml
of
this
precious
fluid
just
over
half
a
pint
or
a
big
mug
of
tea
we
later
repeat
the
final
step
to
make
a
bit
more
these
few
millilitre
be
destine
to
seed
the
manufacture
of
every
dose
of
the
oxford
vaccine
ever
produce
it
seem
incredible
to
me
that
the
current
plan
be
that
there
will
be
at
least
billion
dos
all
born
from
this
same
start
material
step
use
the
start
material
to
produce
the
require
quantity
of
vaccine
originally
the
plan
be
for
us
at
the
cbf
only
to
go
as
far
as
step
as
we
be
get
to
work
on
the
start
material
sarah
be
in
touch
with
the
italian
company
advent
to
arrange
manufacturing
there
the
idea
be
that
they
would
use
our
start
material
to
make
the
vaccine
for
clinical
trial
leave
us
free
to
continue
with
our
other
work
make
a
new
vaccine
against
ebola
for
te
in
the
few
week
since
that
january
meeting
in
sarah
s
office
though
the
world
have
change
quickly
by
the
middle
of
february
the
virus
have
seed
itself
in
dozen
of
country
all
over
the
world
although
the
who
be
still
say
that
it
be
impossible
to
predict
what
direction
the
epidemic
not
yet
officially
a
pandemic
would
take
it
have
also
start
discuss
the
possibility
of
make
a
vaccine
within
eighteen
month
the
critical
piece
of
new
information
be
that
people
with
the
virus
could
be
asymptomatic
and
silently
transmit
for
day
the
world
be
go
to
need
this
vaccine
as
soon
as
humanly
possible
there
be
grow
pressure
for
us
to
drop
ebola
and
immediately
switch
to
make
the
covid
vaccine
the
reality
be
that
this
would
be
the
fast
way
to
get
clinical
grade
vaccine
for
first
in
human
trial
but
there
be
no
money
for
it
and
we
hadn
t
finish
the
work
on
the
ebola
vaccine
feeling
be
run
high
a
group
of
key
people
come
together
for
a
crucial
meeting
in
early
march
me
sarah
te
andy
pollard
design
and
eventually
run
the
trial
sandy
douglas
already
think
about
scale
up
manufacturing
and
adrian
hill
head
of
the
jenner
institute
and
already
encourage
us
to
consider
commercial
partnership
and
eventual
distribution
to
low
and
middle
income
country
we
decide
that
as
soon
as
the
start
material
be
ready
my
team
would
drop
everything
else
and
start
production
here
in
oxford
i
have
to
admit
that
come
out
of
that
meeting
i
felt
both
exhilarate
and
terrify
as
i
brace
myself
to
tell
my
team
that
there
have
be
a
change
of
plan
and
that
all
eye
would
be
on
us
as
we
attempt
to
make
a
vaccine
in
record
time
with
no
backup
plan
and
no
room
for
error
i
reassure
myself
they
be
expert
they
know
what
they
be
do
i
have
faith
in
them
the
covid
vaccine
project
could
not
be
in
well
hand
the
cbf
s
most
senior
expertise
in
adenovirus
production
lie
in
three
dedicate
woman
eleanor
berrie
our
senior
qp
emma
bolam
our
head
of
production
and
cathy
oliveira
our
new
production
manager
the
four
of
us
immediately
get
together
to
work
up
a
plan
how
much
do
we
realistically
think
we
could
make
and
how
fast
we
make
three
decision
our
first
decision
be
that
we
would
continue
to
proceed
at
risk
move
to
the
next
stage
of
the
process
before
all
test
be
complete
on
the
previous
stage
again
to
be
clear
the
risk
here
be
not
to
the
end
product
but
to
us
for
example
we
be
expect
the
start
material
to
be
ready
by
march
we
would
never
in
normal
circumstance
consider
use
a
start
material
until
it
have
undergone
a
whole
suite
of
test
to
be
sure
that
it
met
strict
standard
of
purity
and
quality
but
these
be
not
normal
circumstance
to
move
quickly
we
would
still
perform
all
the
same
test
as
usual
we
just
wouldn
t
wait
for
the
result
before
move
on
to
the
next
part
of
the
process
if
the
start
material
fail
any
of
its
test
we
would
have
to
throw
out
anything
we
have
make
from
it
but
that
risk
a
risk
of
waste
time
and
effort
and
serious
money
but
not
of
quality
be
one
we
be
prepared
to
take
second
decision
the
ebola
vaccine
we
just
need
to
get
it
to
a
stage
from
which
we
would
be
able
to
restart
the
work
later
the
production
team
head
by
cathy
go
rapidly
to
work
purify
the
ebola
vaccine
material
and
deposit
it
safely
in
the
deep
freeze
thirdly
we
have
to
make
a
decision
about
prepare
our
clean
room
the
measure
we
take
to
reduce
the
chance
of
contamination
during
manufacturing
include
very
efficient
filter
of
the
air
inside
the
room
frequent
air
change
and
protective
clothing
overall
overshoe
glove
hat
and
goggles
for
anyone
work
inside
the
room
at
the
cbf
we
usually
also
strip
clean
and
fumigate
the
entire
suite
between
manufacturing
project
this
be
not
strictly
necessary
but
it
be
our
standard
practice
the
suite
have
be
fully
clean
and
fumigate
just
before
we
start
the
ebola
vaccine
manufacture
in
january
the
four
of
us
thought
very
carefully
about
the
risk
that
would
come
with
skip
the
fumigation
in
this
case
the
big
risk
albeit
a
very
small
one
be
that
the
covid
vaccine
might
get
contaminate
with
a
bit
of
the
previously
manufacture
product
fn
we
have
a
very
sensitive
and
specific
test
for
this
valuable
product
so
we
knew
we
would
be
able
to
test
our
final
vaccine
to
check
if
there
have
be
any
contamination
proceed
without
fumigation
would
save
at
least
three
week
we
drew
up
a
formal
risk
assessment
and
submit
it
to
the
medicine
and
healthcare
product
regulatory
agency
mhra
the
body
responsible
for
approve
every
step
of
our
vaccine
development
process
and
ultimately
for
decide
whether
to
allow
it
to
be
use
who
agree
our
approach
this
be
the
first
of
a
very
large
number
of
communication
we
would
have
with
the
mhra
over
the
come
month
that
relationship
and
the
mhra
s
proactive
approach
be
a
critical
part
of
this
story
to
make
the
vaccine
you
need
to
introduce
the
start
material
into
the
human
cell
that
will
act
as
the
virus
production
factory
when
we
be
make
the
original
start
material
we
grow
the
production
cell
attach
to
plastic
plate
or
flask
in
a
neat
layer
like
a
tile
floor
or
patio
that
be
useful
because
it
meant
later
we
could
monitor
whether
the
virus
production
process
be
work
by
look
down
a
microscope
and
check
for
a
hole
in
the
cell
layer
cell
that
be
infect
by
the
virus
would
make
so
many
copy
of
the
virus
that
eventually
they
would
burst
and
infect
adjacent
cell
create
a
visible
hole
but
this
isn
t
a
practical
approach
for
large
scale
manufacturing
you
would
just
need
far
too
much
surface
area
instead
we
use
cell
that
have
be
adapt
so
that
they
can
grow
suspend
in
their
nourish
broth
in
constantly
move
conical
flask
at
the
cbf
we
have
a
small
supply
of
these
specially
adapt
hek
cell
which
we
have
grown
ourselves
test
very
stringently
then
preserve
in
small
vial
in
a
very
low
temperature
freezer
but
to
make
lot
of
vaccine
we
need
lot
of
these
production
cell
so
we
need
to
expand
them
on
march
our
new
production
manager
cathy
take
two
of
our
precious
vial
of
hek
cell
out
of
the
frozen
store
once
the
cell
be
thawed
she
introduce
them
into
a
small
conical
flask
of
growth
medium
over
the
next
two
week
the
cell
grow
exponentially
that
be
in
the
first
day
or
so
they
double
then
in
the
next
few
day
they
double
again
and
so
on
as
the
cell
grow
we
kept
increase
the
amount
of
broth
we
be
grow
them
in
and
move
them
to
big
and
more
container
at
the
start
we
have
two
tiny
vial
worth
of
cell
two
week
later
we
have
nearly
ten
litre
of
cell
culture
ready
to
receive
the
virus
start
material
at
the
same
time
as
our
production
cell
be
grow
exponentially
in
the
lab
so
be
case
number
out
in
the
world
and
the
consequence
for
our
daily
life
be
double
and
redouble
too
with
thing
get
exponentially
weirder
and
bad
every
day
this
be
how
exponential
growth
work
the
first
double
from
tiny
to
small
look
like
nothing
after
a
few
more
doubling
though
it
s
amaze
where
you
get
to
on
march
as
sarah

all
my
friend
be
convince
they
have
coronavirus
but
no
one
could
get
a
test
the
shop
shelf
be
empty
fast
and
i
couldn
t
get
a
delivery
slot
with
tesco
on
march
the
foreign
office
advise
against
all
non
essential
travel
and
it
be
impossible
to
get
hold
of
hand
sanitiser
anywhere
i
make
our
first
own
brand
batch
use
lab
chemical
accord
to
the
who
recipe
it
be
thin
and
smelt
of
alcohol
but
it
would
work
we
repurposed
a
soap
dispenser
and
instal
it
by
the
front
door
of
the
lab
on
march
the
government
confirm
that
school
would
close
indefinitely
from
that
friday
which
be
in
two
day
time
and
many
of
us
include
me
panicked
about
what
we
be
go
to
do
i
quickly
secure
letter
for
all
my
team
member
with
child
confirm
that
they
be
key
worker
and
so
their
child
could
continue
to
go
to
school
there
be
no
egg
in
the
shop
and
it
be
announce
that
as
of
that
even
pub
caf
s
and
restaurant
would
have
to
close
there
be
lot
of
chat
amongst
my
friend
about
meeting
up
while
we
still
could
and
i
have
to
give
them
a
talk
to
sunday
march
be
a
pretty
strange
day
two
team
member
email
to
say
they
felt
unwell
and
would
not
come
to
work
the
next
day
just
in
case
on
the
upside
my
daughter
ellie
brought
me
a
cup
of
coffee
in
bed
it
be
mother
s
day
i
be
invite
to
contribute
to
the
government
s
vaccine
taskforce
and
my
favourite
pub
the
magdalen
arm
be
do
takeaway
for
sunday
lunch
two
week
after
cathy
have
introduce
our
thawed
hek
cell
into
a
small
conical
flask
we
have
about
ten
litre
of
culture
contain
billion
cell
on
march
we
inoculate
our
ten
litre
of
culture
use
about
ten
millilitre
of
our
start
material
this
be
a
big
moment
we
be
put
the
bread
in
the
oven
and
then
we
would
just
have
to
wait
to
see
whether
it
be
go
to
rise
i
think
it
be
that
day
that
i
first
felt
the
fear
a
low
twist
at
the
base
of
my
gut
that
say
this
be
madness
there
be
no
way
this
be
go
to
work
blimey
that
be
a
crazy
day
my
phone
be
buzzing
with
update
and
query
non
stop
and
although
i
be
interview
dphil
candidate
all
day
in
every
moment
between
interview
i
pull
out
my
laptop
and
rattle
off
a
few
response
keep
the
non
vaccine
part
of
my
job
go
in
be
really
difficult
and
would
have
be
impossible
without
supportive
and
understand
colleague
fn
that
even
my
gut
twist
again
as
the
prime
minister
announce
a
nationwide
lockdown
and
told
us
we
must
stay
at
home
i
have
to
give
myself
a
talk
to
no
matter
how
much
i
be
freak
out
the
team
couldn
t
see
it
they
need
me
calm
two
day
later
our
bread
be
ready
our
production
cell
have
produce
lot
of
virus
but
not
yet
burst
the
harvest
could
begin
step
purify
the
vaccine
in
this
step
we
get
rid
of
all
of
the
bit
of
the
human
cell
in
which
we
have
grown
our
viral
vaccine
and
any
badly
form
non
functional
viral
particle
leave
us
with
pure
vaccine
we
want
the
bread
not
the
tin
we
bake
it
in
or
in
other
food
term
it
s
like
have
a
vast
vat
of
minestrone
only
on
a
microscopic
scale
but
only
want
the
carrot
this
be
by
far
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
process
we
again
have
a
choice
to
make
about
the
method
we
would
use
this
time
it
be
between
use
a
well
rehearse
method
that
we
be
confident
would
work
but
that
would
produce
less
vaccine
about
dos
or
a
new
method
that
might
go
wrong
but
if
it
go
right
would
yield
much
more
product
maybe
dos
by
now
the
clinical
trial
team
be
start
to
think
big
and
andy
be
ask
me
pretty
much
every
day
how
many
dos
we
would
be
able
to
make
i
always
have
the
sneak
suspicion
that
whatever
number
i
give
him
he
add
in
his
head
without
even
realise
it
or
maybe
on
purpose
just
to
push
us
harder
the
cbf
manufacture
its
first
adenovirus
vectored
vaccine
in
against
malaria
a
vaccine
that
be
still
undergo
clinical
trial
ever
since
then
we
have
use
the
traditional
purification
method
at
the
time
of
harvest
most
of
the
adenovirus
vaccine
particle
be
still
inside
the
hek
cell
the
cell
be
relatively
large
so
they
can
easily
be
separate
from
their
nutrient
broth
by
a
low
speed
centrifugation
the
culture
of
vaccine
contain
cell
be
simply
transfer
to
sterile
bottle
which
be
spun
at
rpm
in
a
centrifuge
effectively
just
a
large
high
power
salad
spinner
all
the
cell
contain
the
vaccine
form
a
pellet
at
the
bottom
of
each
bottle
and
the
broth
can
simply
be
pour
away
in
fact
you
could
just
leave
the
flask
for
an
hour
and
the
cell
would
all
settle
to
the
bottom
centrifugation
simply
speed
thing
up
we
need
the
vaccine
to
be
pure
we
don
t
want
trace
of
the
production
cell
in
it
not
least
because
those
vaccinate
would
then
make
immune
response
against
component
of
the
hek
cell
instead
of
against
the
spike
protein
to
get
the
vaccine
out
from
the
pelleted
cell
we
add
a
lysis
buffer
a
solution
of
salt
and
detergent
and
pop
the
cell
by
freeze
and
thaw
them
three
time
as
the
cell
freeze
the
liquid
inside
them
form
into
ice
and
expands
bursting
the
cell
external
membrane
the
content
include
the
virus
particle
leak
out
into
the
buffer
solution
we
then
thaw
and
recentrifuge
and
because
the
vaccine
particle
be
very
small
they
stay
in
the
solution
while
the
broken
bit
of
cell
form
a
new
pellet
at
the
bottom
of
the
tube
now
we
have
a
solution
call
clarify
cell
lysate
this
contains
all
the
properly
form
virus
particle
but
also
any
empty
adenovirus
shell
that
have
not
form
properly
and
will
be
useless
as
vaccine
as
well
as
other
soluble
material
that
come
out
from
the
cell
when
they
burst
to
purify
the
active
vaccine
we
use
the
fact
that
the
particle
we
want
have
a
different
density
from
all
the
bit
we
don
t
want
we
make
two
salty
solution
of
different
density
and
carefully
layer
them
inside
a
specially
strengthen
test
tube
then
we
carefully
layer
the
clarify
cell
lysate
contain
our
vaccine
particle
on
top
it
s
a
bit
like
the
way
a
bartender
make
a
fancy
layer
cocktail
except
that
all
the
layer
be
colourless
solution
and
there
be
more
pressure
not
to
mess
it
up
we
don
t
throw
the
test
tube
in
the
air
and
catch
them
behind
our
back
instead
we
centrifuge
the
cocktail
at
a
very
high
speed
the
g
force
that
the
mixture
be
subject
to
be
so
strong
that
the
different
tiny
particle
in
the
solution
separate
into
the
layer
settle
where
they
be
just
about
float
denser
particle
need
a
saltier
solution
to
float
think
about
the
salty
dead
sea
so
they
settle
in
the
low
denser
saltier
layer
the
high
g
force
you
can
experience
on
a
roller
coaster
be
currently
most
human
would
be
unconscious
at
g
when
we
spin
our
test
tube
to
collect
our
cell
they
reach
g
and
this
final
spin
to
purify
the
vaccine
be
at
g
after
two
hour
of
spin
all
the
properly
form
vaccine
particle
be
gather
together
in
a
single
band
within
the
tube
with
the
empty
unwanted
particle
and
other
bit
we
don
t
want
in
another
layer
high
up
the
tube
we
collect
the
liquid
contain
our
vaccine
particle
use
a
needle
and
syringe
insert
through
the
side
of
the
tube
at
the
point
where
the
vaccine
contain
band
have
form
and
then
repeat
the
centrifugation
process
to
make
sure
no
empty
particle
have
snuck
through
then
there
be
one
final
purification
step
to
remove
any
remain
salt
fn
the
traditional
purification
method
i
ve
just
described
be
very
effective
and
my
team
be
very
experienced
in
do
it
but
it
be
labour
intensive
take
a
long
time
and
be
not
easily
automate
or
scalable
we
also
end
up
discard
a
significant
amount
of
good
virus
particle
during
the
process
none
of
that
matter
normally
when
we
be
require
to
make
a
small
high
quality
batch
of
a
new
product
for
clinical
trial
but
now
with
the
plan
trial
clearly
promising
to
be
one
of
the
large
we
have
ever
run
we
be
go
to
need
all
the
vaccine
we
could
get
and
it
do
matter
a
couple
of
year
earlier
we
have
make
a
rabies
vaccine
for
our
colleague
sandy
douglas
this
be
a
project
design
not
only
to
manufacture
a
new
effective
rabies
vaccine
but
also
to
develop
improvement
to
the
adenovirus
vaccine
manufacturing
process
for
all
vaccine
use
the
chadox
platform
the
work
do
on
this
project
successfully
implement
a
new
purification
process
laid
the
foundation
for
all
of
the
large
scale
manufacturing
that
be
to
come
fn
in
contrast
with
the
traditional
method
the
new
method
be
fast
automatable
scalable
and
reproducible
it
also
yield
double
or
triple
the
amount
of
vaccine
but
we
have
only
do
it
once
go
with
what
we
knew
be
the
safest
option
but
could
result
in
a
lot
less
vaccine
be
produce
on
the
other
hand
if
the
new
method
go
wrong
and
we
have
to
start
all
over
again
make
a
new
batch
of
vaccine
it
would
set
us
back
week
it
be
a
hard
decision
and
once
again
discussion
get
heat
my
team
be
generally
cautious
which
be
exactly
what
you
want
in
this
job
a
careful
crew
who
will
do
everything
possible
to
make
sure
our
operation
be
compliant
with
the
rule
i
have
to
listen
to
their
concern
about
the
risk
but
we
be
also
all
very
aware
that
maximise
the
dos
so
that
the
trial
could
be
as
big
as
possible
be
go
to
be
important
as
we
do
so
many
time
throughout
make
the
covid
vaccine
we
take
the
more
unknown
path
that
be
high
risk
but
high
reward
alongside
the
try
and
test
method
obviously
this
be
double
the
work
for
the
team
but
we
have
learnt
by
now
that
we
have
to
hedge
our
bet
and
always
have
a
backup
we
decide
to
split
the
batch
two
of
the
seven
flask
would
be
purify
with
the
new
method
and
five
with
the
traditional
one
the
subsequent
meeting
with
sandy
be
for
once
shorter
than
plan
no
row
no
one
threaten
to
punch
anyone
on
the
nose
everyone
be
happy
purification
be
always
a
nervous
few
day
in
the
clean
room
the
vaccine
be
all
contain
in
a
few
flask
then
a
few
tube
and
finally
a
single
bottle
or
bag
and
a
mistake
at
any
point
can
jeopardise
everything
you
need
a
steady
hand
and
a
calm
temperament
fortunately
the
team
have
both
on
march
cathy
open
the
centrifuge
remove
the
tube
that
have
go
through
the
traditional
purification
method
and
take
a
photo
for
our
record
the
photo
show
an
enormous
fuzzy
cloud
of
vaccine
right
in
the
centre
of
the
tube
later
that
day
she
email
it
to
the
whole
team
with
the
subject
line
look
at
these
baby
she
say
it
look
like
a
halo
our
yield
look
good
and
the
product
look
perfect
someone
email
back
only
half
joking
this
might
just
be
the
fuzzy
band
that
save
the
world
it
be
a
big
relief
to
have
get
the
first
batch
safely
to
this
stage
to
have
successfully
turn
the
bread
out
of
the
tin
and
the
whole
team
be
on
a
high
i
think
this
be
the
moment
we
believe
we
might
pull
this
off
the
content
of
all
the
tube
be
pool
the
final
purification
step
be
perform
to
get
rid
of
any
remain
salt
and
our
first
batch
of
vaccine
in
total
a
bit
less
than
ml
less
than
a
pint
of
milk
be
put
into
a
sterile
bag
and
into
the
freezer
ready
for
the
next
step
put
the
vaccine
into
vial
then
we
go
back
to
process
the
second
batch
use
the
new
method
at
first
everything
seem
to
go
well
we
have
apparently
good
yield
and
the
first
step
of
the
purification
go
as
expect
but
on
the
even
of
april
i
open
a
devastate
email
from
cathy
the
material
that
be
come
off
the
final
step
be
behaving
very
strangely
instead
of
the
expect
perfectly
clear
solution
the
liquid
emerge
be
cloudy
we
knew
this
be
not
a
good
sign
on
the
phone
to
cathy
a
few
minute
later
the
atmosphere
at
the
lab
be
subdue
we
have
never
see
this
before
and
no
one
really
knew
what
to
do
it
be
late
at
night
so
we
agree
that
we
should
put
everything
safely
in
the
fridge
everyone
should
go
home
and
try
to
get
some
sleep
and
we
would
approach
it
with
fresh
brain
in
the
morning
the
next
morning
we
collect
all
the
material
and
ran
some
test
very
little
vaccine
could
be
detect
in
the
final
product
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
try
to
work
out
whether
there
be
some
way
to
salvage
something
from
what
we
have
but
by
the
even
it
be
clear
that
it
be
hopeless
our
best
guess
be
that
the
virus
particle
have
all
clumped
together
somewhere
unexpected
at
the
final
stage
and
be
accidentally
discard
i
don
t
think
i
can
explain
how
awful
this
felt
for
the
team
they
knew
how
important
this
be
and
they
felt
personally
responsible
for
the
failure
that
night
i
give
everyone
a
pep
talk
they
have
already
do
one
impossible
thing
i
told
them
create
the
first
batch
in
record
time
ask
for
two
impossible
thing
be
just
too
much
even
to
have
try
be
enough
i
remind
them
as
well
that
it
be
because
of
their
reason
argument
at
the
start
that
we
have
split
the
batch
in
two
and
still
have
all
the
excellent
material
from
the
first
purification
run
imagine
the
disaster
if
we
have
just
go
all
in
for
the
new
method
and
the
one
shot
have
fail
yes
this
run
have
not
be
successful
and
yes
we
have
lose
some
material
but
we
hadn
t
lose
all
of
it
they
should
remain
proud
of
their
enormous
achievement
and
not
get
deject
we
have
to
pick
ourselves
up
and
keep
on
go
step
fill
the
vial
because
we
be
go
to
put
it
into
people
s
arm
the
final
vaccine
product
of
course
must
be
completely
sterile
clean
room
area
be
divide
into
grade
the
high
grade
a
be
a
completely
sterile
environment
so
there
can
be
no
bacteria
or
other
microorganism
present
in
the
air
or
on
the
surface
obviously
this
be
difficult
to
achieve
microorganism
be
all
around
us
in
the
air
in
the
soil
and
on
our
body
but
this
sterile
environment
be
what
we
need
for
fill
the
vaccine
into
vial
because
we
only
make
small
batch
the
simplest
and
most
cost
effective
way
for
us
to
fill
our
product
into
vial
be
manually
inside
a
grade
a
isolator
which
be
itself
inside
a
grade
c
clean
room
the
isolator
be
a
seal
box
the
width
of
the
room
into
which
completely
purify
air
be
pumped
to
keep
it
sterile
one
side
be
a
glass
screen
with
two
pair
of
seal
glove
set
into
it
so
that
the
operator
sit
side
by
side
outside
the
box
in
their
full
protective
gear
can
handle
the
material
and
equipment
inside
the
box
without
touch
it
with
their
hand
there
be
a
hatch
at
each
end
so
that
wrap
sterilise
material
and
equipment
can
be
place
inside
the
box
from
one
end
and
fill
sterile
vial
can
be
remove
from
the
other
vial
fill
be
one
of
the
most
skilled
job
that
we
do
at
the
cbf
it
be
high
pressure
work
that
be
also
boring
repetitive
delicate
and
tire
on
the
arm
the
production
team
know
how
to
handle
it
though
and
be
very
steady
on
march
we
have
deposit
our
first
successfully
purify
batch
in
the
freezer
a
couple
of
day
later
i
do
a
radio
interview
in
which
our
work
be
introduce
as
the
only
story
in
the
world
my
mind
flash
to
the
lab
there
be
so
much
to
do
and
so
much
that
could
still
go
wrong
several
member
of
the
team
be
have
to
self
isolate
as
they
live
in
share
house
with
a
housemate
who
have
symptom
others
be
have
to
shield
lot
of
us
have
kid
on
their
easter
holiday
although
the
school
be
stay
open
for
the
child
of
key
worker
which
be
amazingly
helpful
be
the
only
story
in
the
world
felt
like
quite
a
heavy
weight
to
bear
thursday
april
be
fill
day
fill
day
be
always
a
big
day
at
the
cbf
the
whole
team
be
involve
as
there
be
lot
of
check
test
monitoring
distribution
and
documentation
to
do
we
remove
our
small
bag
of
vaccine
from
the
freezer
transfer
it
into
the
grade
a
isolator
and
then
pumped
it
through
a
series
of
filter
with
tiny
pore
that
remove
any
bacteria
the
final
sterile
filter
material
be
then
ready
for
fill
it
wasn
t
tense
exactly
but
there
be
a
definite
feel
of
focus
and
close
attention
on
other
day
it
s
often
quite
jolly
but
today
there
be
no
chat
inside
the
hush
of
the
clean
room
our
fill
operator
for
the
day
ioana
baleanu
sat
head
down
at
the
glass
screen
and
use
a
microdispenser
system
a
tiny
very
precise
syringe
carefully
place
approximately
ml
a
tenth
of
a
teaspoon
of
vaccine
into
each
small
sterile
glass
vial
she
then
pass
the
vial
still
inside
the
isolator
to
emma
the
day
s
crimp
operator
who
delicately
add
a
sterile
rubber
stopper
and
a
metal
crimp
to
keep
it
close
and
put
it
on
a
rack
when
the
rack
be
full
it
be
pass
out
of
the
isolator
through
the
hatch
each
vial
be
then
inspect
for
defect
and
vial
that
pass
be
log
and
label
all
the
time
sample
be
be
take
and
the
isolator
environment
be
monitor
for
sterility
normally
on
a
fill
day
we
order
in
a
big
lunch
for
everyone
as
there
be
no
easy
way
for
people
to
go
out
for
food
during
a
very
busy
and
long
day
this
time
be
a
bit
different
there
be
no
platter
of
sandwich
everything
be
individually
wrap
and
we
ate
socially
distance
at
our
desk
this
just
brought
home
to
us
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
and
the
hope
that
be
tie
up
in
what
we
be
do
by
the
end
of
the
day
the
team
have
fill
log
and
label
vial
for
the
first
time
in
age
we
felt
like
we
could
breathe
more
easily
even
though
we
realise
we
be
only
at
base
camp
it
felt
like
we
have
a
climbed
a
mountain
and
i
hear
it
s
quite
difficult
even
to
get
to
base
camp
on
mount
everest
step
label
the
vial
document
the
process
and
test
and
certify
the
quality
of
the
product
this
be
steady
behind
the
scene
work
check
everyone
else
s
work
and
ensure
that
strict
standard
be
met
label
might
sound
like
a
simple
job
but
there
be
very
comprehensive
regulation
involve
a
lot
of
documentation
to
ensure
that
product
for
clinical
trial
be
properly
label
helena
parracho
who
be
in
charge
of
label
get
volunteer
from
across
the
cbf
team
to
help
her
in
get
everything
assemble
checked
and
ready
a
mistake
at
the
label
stage
could
result
in
a
volunteer
be
give
a
wrong
drug
or
a
wrong
dose
which
of
course
could
be
very
serious
the
documentation
of
the
process
be
necessary
in
order
to
get
approval
from
the
mhra
without
which
no
trial
can
go
ahead
in
the
uk
we
need
to
submit
a
dossier
of
document
describe
the
manufacturing
process
and
the
full
trial
plan
every
stage
of
the
manufacturing
process
be
govern
by
regulation
which
we
make
sure
we
adhere
to
by
have
detailed
protocol
for
everything
the
process
of
put
on
protective
clothing
before
enter
the
clean
room
for
example
be
described
in
a
nineteen
page
document
with
another
five
document
total
sixty
page
relate
to
the
supply
of
the
bunny
suit
hair
covering
etc
each
person
work
in
the
clean
room
have
to
be
train
in
the
procedure
and
the
training
be
repeat
every
six
month
there
be
some
people
who
unfortunately
through
no
fault
of
their
own
be
heavy
shedder
of
the
bacteria
we
all
carry
around
with
us
and
those
people
can
t
work
in
a
clean
room
at
all
as
another
example
put
vaccine
into
vial
can
only
be
do
by
people
who
have
be
train
and
have
then
perform
the
procedure
on
the
number
of
vial
we
expect
to
fill
use
sterile
broth
instead
of
vaccine
on
three
separate
occasion
the
vial
of
broth
be
then
put
in
an
incubator
to
see
if
any
bacteria
grow
if
they
do
that
mean
the
operator
have
fail
to
maintain
sterility
and
they
have
to
do
more
training
and
repeat
the
test
once
they
pas
the
test
they
have
to
retake
it
every
six
month
we
have
detailed
procedure
to
make
sure
everything
have
be
properly
plan
quality
assurance
and
then
lot
more
to
test
that
everything
go
as
it
should
have
do
quality
control
and
record
be
kept
for
all
of
this
if
it
isn
t
write
down
it
didn
t
happen
once
the
product
be
in
vial
it
also
have
to
undergo
a
series
of
stringent
test
to
ensure
that
it
be
completely
sterile
and
uncontaminated
and
of
appropriate
quality
for
use
after
all
three
of
those
thing
have
happen
we
can
take
the
final
step
of
certify
that
the
batch
produce
be
suitable
for
use
in
a
specific
trial
test
be
not
glamorous
or
excite
but
it
be
obviously
a
crucial
part
of
the
process
it
be
also
a
very
important
part
of
this
story
because
of
how
much
time
we
manage
to
save
from
very
early
in
the
year
we
all
knew
that
every
day
we
could
shave
off
the
process
would
save
life
we
be
constantly
look
to
see
how
we
could
do
thing
one
day
faster
two
day
faster
without
compromise
safety
and
in
the
end
we
manage
to
shave
more
than
two
month
off
our
test
time
we
have
to
send
some
vial
off
to
specialist
company
for
part
of
the
test
and
these
external
test
have
in
the
past
take
three
month
or
more
this
time
before
we
have
even
start
manufacturing
we
have
be
in
intense
discussion
with
the
mhra
about
how
we
could
speed
up
test
without
compromise
on
safety
we
have
devise
a
rapid
test
programme
which
be
much
more
expensive
but
also
much
faster
as
soon
as
the
vaccine
be
available
we
initiate
the
rapid
test
proceed
at
risk
we
also
immediately
start
prepare
all
of
the
documentation
the
mhra
would
need
and
label
the
vial
normally
we
would
wait
to
do
this
as
there
be
no
point
waste
time
prepare
document
and
label
the
material
if
the
test
fail
we
would
just
have
to
delete
the
file
and
throw
away
label
vial
but
in
this
case
we
need
to
be
ready
to
use
the
vial
the
moment
we
have
the
all
clear
on
the
test
and
the
approval
with
a
lot
of
late
night
and
weekend
work
and
mass
of
support
from
our
test
partner
and
our
specialist
courier
we
ship
the
vaccine
frozen
on
dry
ice
and
our
big
fear
be
that
there
would
be
a
courier
hold
up
and
the
dry
ice
would
run
out
and
the
vaccine
would
thaw
invalidate
the
test
we
manage
to
reduce
our
test
time
from
three
month
to
just
over
two
week
we
get
the
final
test
result
back
on
april
and
the
next
day
our
qp
richard
tarrant
certify
the
batch
as
ready
for
use
the
whole
team
watch
while
he
sign
the
final
document
that
would
mean
the
product
be
ready
to
go
the
vaccine
be
ship
in
reality
just
carry
across
the
road
to
the
clinic
ready
for
the
first
vaccination
to
take
place
the
next
day
we
have
go
from
dna
construct
to
clinical
trial
in
sixty
five
day
an
achievement
no
one
would
have
thought
possible
in
february
when
we
start
we
be
all
exhaust
we
have
a
slice
of
socially
distance
cake
and
go
home
to
try
to
get
some
sleep
at
this
point
no
one
knew
for
sure
whether
the
vaccine
would
work
but
even
so
i
think
we
all
felt
that
we
have
do
something
enormous
cath
chapter
scale
up
february
june
confirm
case
million
confirm
death
thursday
april
it
be
a
strange
time
the
elderflowers
be
out
i
know
that
because
i
be
swap
tip
with
my
friend
sally
about
the
best
biomanufacturing
process
to
make
them
into
home
make
fizz
and
the
day
be
get
longer
i
know
that
because
it
be
light
in
my
kitchen
when
andy
s
email
come
through
at
a
m
spring
be
come
but
it
felt
like
we
have
be
in
lockdown
forever
and
case
number
be
still
go
up
and
everything
be
still
awful
and
there
be
no
end
in
sight
i
read
andy
s
mail
the
university
of
oxford
have
today
announce
an
agreement
with
the
uk
base
global
biopharmaceutical
company
astrazeneca
for
the
far
development
large
scale
manufacture
and
extensive
distribution
of
the
covid
vaccine
currently
be
trialled
by
the
university
this
be
an
important
development
because
it
will
provide
the
critical
infrastructure
need
to
ensure
global
equitable
access
to
the
vaccine
if
the
clinical
trial
demonstrates
that
the
vaccine
be
safe
and
effective
the
trial
have
just
begin
and
be
progress
well
over
the
previous
month
it
have
become
clear
to
all
of
us
work
on
it
that
the
project
be
rapidly
get
to
the
point
that
we
at
the
university
couldn
t
handle
it
on
our
own
since
january
my
team
have
be
work
flat
out
to
lovingly
hand
make
the
first
few
hundred
vial
of
vaccine
for
the
trial
but
while
it
have
be
a
big
achievement
to
get
these
first
vial
ready
in
record
time
if
the
vaccine
work
we
be
go
to
need
a
lot
more
a
lot
lot
more
how
do
you
go
from
a
few
hundred
vial
to
million
perhaps
even
billion
it
s
a
huge
scale
up
in
a
short
space
of
time
my
colleague
sandy
douglas
and
his
team
have
be
develop
a
process
that
we
be
confident
would
be
capable
of
produce
million
of
dos
but
the
logistics
of
actually
make
them
and
then
distribute
them
across
the
world
be
daunt
i
have
know
that
negotiation
be
take
place
with
at
least
one
major
pharmaceutical
company
i
also
knew
that
there
have
be
discussion
about
whether
the
vaccine
manufacturing
and
innovation
centre
an
organisation
that
be
still
be
establish
but
that
once
fully
function
will
be
a
centre
of
excellence
for
vaccine
development
and
manufacturing
and
provide
the
uk
with
a
national
vaccine
response
capability
could
take
on
the
role
they
be
not
prepared
to
do
so
wisely
it
turn
out
i
don
t
think
any
of
us
realise
what
an
enormous
undertaking
this
would
be
and
with
hindsight
we
could
never
have
achieve
it
without
big
pharma
but
andy
s
email
be
the
first
time
i
heard
mention
that
it
would
be
astrazeneca
and
it
be
something
of
a
surprise
i
knew
they
be
big
in
cancer
medicine
and
they
be
obviously
a
name
in
the
pharma
world
but
they
do
not
have
a
particular
reputation
for
vaccine
manufacture
we
felt
a
bit
disconnect
as
though
decision
that
would
really
affect
our
work
life
by
this
point
all
of
us
be
work
on
this
project
all
of
the
time
and
it
have
completely
take
over
every
wake
and
sleep
hour
be
be
take
at
the
high
level
of
the
university
with
no
consultation
with
those
of
us
who
actually
knew
how
to
make
this
vaccine
we
also
felt
a
bit
of
trepidation
that
team
up
with
a
pharmaceutical
giant
would
mean
someone
else
make
large
profit
off
the
back
of
our
effort
we
be
realistic
that
there
would
need
to
be
a
profit
motive
for
big
pharma
to
get
involve
but
we
be
hopeful
that
if
the
vaccine
be
go
to
end
up
make
a
lot
of
money
for
other
people
at
least
the
university
might
also
see
some
return
on
its
investment
the
press
release
that
andy
have
sent
round
suggest
that
both
partner
have
agree
to
operate
on
a
not
for
profit
basis
for
the
duration
of
the
pandemic
and
that
royalty
return
to
the
university
after
that
would
be
reinvested
into
pandemic
preparedness
this
be
reassure
as
be
the
intention
to
commit
to
deliver
the
vaccine
at
low
cost
to
the
part
of
the
world
that
would
not
be
able
to
pay
for
an
expensive
vaccine
which
be
something
that
all
of
us
on
the
team
felt
strongly
about
but
it
do
feel
like
our
relationship
with
the
project
have
slightly
shift
we
be
all
at
this
point
very
tire
april
have
be
a
tough
month
deal
with
the
start
of
the
trial
make
our
first
batch
of
vaccine
at
the
cbf
liaise
with
advent
in
italy
whom
we
have
contract
to
make
a
second
clinical
trial
batch
for
us
talk
to
the
regulator
and
work
on
scale
up
like
our
colleague
in
the
nh
and
in
care
home
we
be
have
trouble
get
hold
of
ppe
and
by
early
may
i
have
so
many
staff
off
sick
or
isolate
that
i
be
work
in
the
lab
as
well
as
everything
else
we
have
be
work
flat
out
and
be
continue
to
do
so
and
at
first
have
astrazeneca
on
board
felt
like
an
additional
problem
rather
than
a
solution
look
back
i
realise
how
negative
and
unreasonable
this
sound
we
could
not
have
get
anywhere
without
them
and
we
all
get
along
very
well
now
but
at
the
time
when
we
be
already
work
eighteen
hour
day
we
be
not
always
happy
about
our
demand
new
team
member
especially
when
it
felt
like
our
new
team
member
be
actually
our
new
bos
for
a
while
i
change
my
whatsapp
bio
to
work
for
the
man
astrazeneca
want
to
be
hand
on
immediately
and
the
request
for
meeting
for
documentation
and
for
sample
start
come
thick
and
fast
early
on
the
meeting
all
do
remotely
on
our
computer
of
course
felt
slightly
haphazard
astrazeneca
be
an
enormous
entity
with
multiple
team
across
the
uk
and
the
us
with
quite
specialise
role
whereas
everyone
at
our
end
be
involve
in
and
knew
about
everything
also
they
have
no
experience
of
manufacturing
viral
vector
so
the
technical
aspect
of
produce
viral
vector
and
the
quality
test
need
for
these
kind
of
product
be
all
new
to
them
it
be
frustrate
to
have
to
keep
repeat
ourselves
to
slightly
different
combination
of
astrazeneca
people
equally
they
be
so
use
to
huge
global
project
that
they
didn
t
always
realise
how
much
we
didn
t
know
about
the
logistics
of
manage
large
scale
manufacturing
or
trial
or
distribution
we
be
essentially
a
family
run
pizzeria
do
everything
ourselves
from
check
with
the
clinic
how
many
dos
they
need
each
day
to
stick
on
label
and
arrange
courier
and
they
be
pizza
express
with
software
and
huge
system
and
outsource
to
run
global
operation
they
also
use
a
lot
of
abbreviation
that
we
didn
t
understand
and
we
sometimes
felt
foolish
have
to
ask
them
to
explain
what
they
be
talk
about
they
must
have
thought
we
be
so
basic
so
there
be
a
steep
learn
curve
on
both
side
of
the
deal
in
the
first
month
but
it
be
also
clear
from
the
start
that
astrazeneca
be
think
big
big
than
i
have
imagine
at
that
point
and
hearing
the
scale
of
their
ambition
be
pretty
inspire
to
us
all
i
remember
be
in
a
meeting
very
early
on
probably
in
may
when
someone
at
astrazeneca
confidently
use
the
phrase
billion
of
dos
that
s
a
real
shock
to
the
system
when
a
really
big
day
for
you
be
manually
put
dos
into
vial
they
be
prepared
to
throw
everything
at
it
straightaway
rather
than
wait
for
result
from
clinical
trial
before
they
fully
invest
the
astrazeneca
team
also
immediately
push
the
project
in
what
turn
out
to
be
a
vital
direction
that
would
make
a
huge
difference
to
who
could
receive
the
vaccine
around
the
world
when
we
make
small
batch
of
chadox
product
for
clinical
trial
at
the
cbf
we
always
store
the
final
product
at
degree
centigrade
ultra
low
temperature
freezer
be
routine
piece
of
kit
in
research
laboratory
and
clinical
trial
site
and
storage
in
these
condition
mean
that
our
limited
quantity
of
precious
trial
material
have
a
long
shelf
life
in
some
case
more
than
five
year
we
do
however
have
a
lot
of
data
for
many
of
our
exist
adenovirus
vaccine
that
demonstrate
that
the
material
be
stable
at
degree
normal
fridge
temperature
for
at
least
a
year
when
astrazeneca
saw
this
data
they
quickly
understood
its
importance
they
immediately
initiate
study
on
the
first
large
scale
batch
of
chadox
ncov
come
through
the
result
show
that
our
vaccine
could
be
transport
and
store
refrigerate
rather
than
frozen
have
enormous
implication
for
how
easy
the
vaccine
would
be
to
distribute
and
to
use
robust
vaccination
programme
for
polio
measles
and
other
childhood
disease
reach
every
corner
of
the
world
already
need
refrigeration
all
the
way
from
the
factory
to
a
tiny
healthcare
facility
to
a
person
s
arm
so
our
vaccine
would
fit
into
exist
try
and
test
supply
chain
and
would
be
able
to
travel
far
and
wide
we
wouldn
t
have
to
worry
about
the
vaccine
thaw
during
transit
or
about
whether
there
be
a
reliable
freezer
let
alone
an
ultra
low
temperature
freezer
at
its
final
destination
but
i
be
get
ahead
of
myself

in
the
early
spring
while
others
be
make
initial
contact
with
astrazeneca
and
draw
the
road
map
to
billion
of
dos
my
day
to
day
effort
be
still
at
a
rather
small
scale
we
would
need
hundred
and
then
thousand
of
dos
for
our
clinical
trial
and
the
cbf
manufacture
material
that
we
be
in
the
process
of
make
in
the
end
we
manage
to
get
about
dos
from
the
material
we
have
purify
and
frozen
at
the
end
of
march
would
soon
run
out
while
we
be
produce
our
own
vaccine
and
in
constant
discussion
with
each
other
and
the
regulator
about
how
we
could
do
that
as
quickly
as
possible
we
be
also
work
intensely
with
our
italian
colleague
at
advent
and
pull
together
a
group
of
manufacturer
to
help
us
to
work
out
how
to
scale
up
way
beyond
what
either
we
or
advent
be
capable
of
right
at
the
start
the
original
plan
have
be
that
we
at
the
cbf
would
produce
the
start
material
and
then
ship
it
to
advent
for
manufacture
however
in
early
march
when
we
realise
that
my
team
at
the
cbf
would
be
able
to
complete
production
quicker
than
advent
we
change
the
plan
we
would
make
a
first
batch
at
the
cbf
and
advent
would
stick
to
their
plan
and
use
our
start
material
make
a
second
batch
we
would
definitely
need
it
all
the
trial
be
grow
all
the
time
with
more
people
and
location
be
add
on
an
almost
daily
basis
so
half
of
the
first
chadox
ncov
start
material
go
to
my
production
team
for
us
to
make
the
first
batch
of
vaccine
and
we
sent
the
other
half
to
italy
that
be
on
march
we
be
still
await
test
result
but
as
be
become
normal
we
proceed
at
risk
under
normal
circumstance
on
receipt
of
start
material
an
organisation
like
advent
would
first
do
a
practice
run
through
but
of
course
this
take
time
in
february
as
we
be
make
our
start
material
we
have
also
be
try
to
persuade
advent
to
drop
the
practice
run
it
be
uncomfortable
at
first
advent
have
a
reputation
for
quality
that
they
do
not
want
to
risk
at
the
same
time
they
understood
the
urgency
eventually
they
agree
to
try
to
deliver
to
a
very
aggressive
timescale
and
we
agree
to
pay
even
if
the
run
be
unsuccessful
work
with
the
team
at
advent
be
one
of
the
highlight
of
this
project
for
me
they
be
a
small
team
about
the
same
size
as
the
cbf
and
like
us
they
specialise
in
viral
vector
manufacture
their
bos
stefania
di
marco
be
hugely
knowledgeable
the
situation
in
italy
at
the
time
also
meant
that
the
whole
team
be
particularly
keen
to
help
the
epidemic
have
take
hold
there
early
in
late
february
there
have
be
a
cluster
of
case
in
lombardy
and
ten
town
have
be
lock
down
school
in
the
area
have
close
supermarket
shelf
have
empty
serie
a
football
game
have
be
cancel
while
uk
death
remain
in
single
figure
italy
s
soar
past
and
exhaust
italian
doctor
take
to
social
medium
to
try
to
explain
what
be
happen
there
and
warn
it
would
soon
be
happen
elsewhere
in
early
march
when
there
be
no
restriction
in
the
uk
and
no
one
be
wear
ppe
the
advent
team
be
only
allow
to
travel
between
home
and
work
and
on
video
call
they
be
all
wear
mask
and
be
shock
that
we
weren
t
their
commitment
be
apparent
as
be
the
challenge
of
try
to
deliver
against
this
stressful
backdrop
see
the
position
of
our
italian
colleague
and
feel
their
personal
desire
for
the
project
to
succeed
make
it
feel
like
we
be
all
part
of
the
same
effort
we
have
just
enough
start
material
sourdough
starter
from
step
of
the
five
step
process
described
in
chapter
for
one
batch
at
the
cbf
and
one
batch
at
advent
there
would
be
nothing
left
over
so
we
each
have
just
the
one
shot
the
start
material
arrive
in
italy
on
march
it
be
a
nervous
wait
flight
to
italy
be
already
disrupt
and
as
always
we
be
worried
about
the
dry
ice
evaporate
if
the
material
defrost
it
would
be
useless
and
we
would
lose
at
least
two
week
go
back
to
make
more
we
be
monitoring
the
temperature
from
a
tracer
include
in
the
packaging
and
there
be
relief
all
round
when
it
arrive
still
safely
frozen
like
us
advent
be
already
prepare
their
production
cell
the
cell
in
which
they
be
go
to
grow
their
vaccine
at
the
cbf
we
expand
two
precious
vial
of
hek
cell
to
a
final
volume
of
ten
litre
from
which
we
eventually
make
dos
advent
who
operate
on
a
much
big
scale
be
expand
their
cell
in
large
bag
aim
for
one
hundred
litre
from
which
they
would
be
able
to
make
thousand
of
dos
they
successfully
infect
their
production
cell
with
our
start
material
mix
the
ingredient
and
baking
the
bread
step
on
april
step
be
purification
remove
the
bread
from
the
tin
advent
s
method
for
separate
the
pure
vaccine
from
the
unwanted
cell
debris
be
similar
to
the
method
developed
by
sandy
that
we
have
just
fail
with
at
the
cbf
the
advent
team
be
very
experienced
in
make
high
quality
product
use
this
approach
and
their
purification
be
successful
by
early
may
they
have
fill
vial
for
us
to
use
in
the
ever
expand
clinical
trial
step
an
extraordinary
achievement
from
such
a
small
team
step
be
label
document
and
test
the
product
label
the
vial
a
manual
process
be
a
big
task
so
we
decide
to
split
the
work
between
us
advent
ship
some
of
the
vial
to
us
overnight
on
dry
ice
and
everyone
slept
with
their
finger
cross
as
all
be
once
more
in
the
hand
of
the
courier
with
major
travel
disruption
across
europe
and
most
flight
completely
ground
i
have
vision
of
the
vial
go
round
and
round
unclaimed
and
alone
on
a
baggage
carousel
in
an
empty
arrival
hall
obviously
i
knew
that
in
reality
they
would
be
in
the
freight
section
at
the
back
but
the
airport
must
have
be
quiet
and
lonely
place
at
that
time
with
the
vial
safely
deliver
to
the
cbf
the
team
inspect
each
one
individually
reject
any
whose
seal
be
not
properly
crimped
or
any
vial
that
be
not
perfectly
intact
and
proceed
to
get
the
label
on
the
advent
produce
material
be
need
straight
away
in
the
phase
ii
iii
trial
that
be
about
to
start
in
the
uk
but
because
it
have
be
manufacture
use
a
different
cell
line
from
the
one
we
have
use
at
the
cbf
and
use
a
different
purification
method
we
have
to
demonstrate
batch
to
batch
consistency
before
we
could
use
it
most
of
the
test
that
advent
have
perform
on
their
batch
be
the
same
as
those
we
have
do
on
the
cbf
material
test
for
sterility
test
for
the
presence
of
residual
cellular
material
from
the
production
cell
check
for
the
absence
of
any
know
virus
etc
but
there
be
one
test
that
have
be
do
differently
advent
ass
the
amount
of
vaccine
in
its
batch
or
the
concentration
use
a
method
call
qpcr
while
we
at
the
cbf
use
spectrophotometry
these
test
use
different
technique
qpcr
be
a
molecular
genetic
test
measure
the
number
of
copy
of
viral
dna
per
millilitre
spectrophotometry
estimate
the
amount
of
viral
dna
base
on
how
much
ultraviolet
light
the
material
absorbs
each
viral
particle
contains
the
same
amount
of
dna
so
measure
the
viral
dna
tell
us
how
many
viral
particle
there
be
to
check
that
the
two
measurement
method
be
equivalent
we
have
previously
sent
advent
a
vial
of
our
vaccine
for
them
to
test
it
use
their
method
they
report
the
same
concentration
as
we
have
determine
use
our
method
so
we
be
initially
confident
that
the
test
be
interchangeable
but
just
to
be
sure
we
would
do
the
same
thing
the
other
way
round
we
would
check
the
concentration
of
the
advent
batch
use
spectrophotometry
to
our
surprise
we
do
not
get
the
same
concentration
reading
as
the
italian
have
measure
instead
our
test
suggest
that
this
new
batch
be
more
concentrate
than
the
advent
team
have
thought
the
difference
we
found
be
about
twofold
this
be
not
a
problem
we
have
ever
come
across
before
we
would
never
usually
need
to
use
batch
from
two
different
manufacturer
in
one
clinical
trial
and
we
be
only
do
it
this
time
because
this
trial
be
big
and
more
urgent
than
any
we
have
ever
do
before
we
weren
t
particularly
concerned
though
measure
virus
concentration
be
difficult
and
the
margin
of
error
on
these
test
can
be
up
to
we
also
knew
from
previous
clinical
trial
that
adenovirus
vectored
vaccine
be
well
tolerate
and
effective
at
a
broad
range
of
different
dos
so
high
precision
be
not
necessary
just
to
check
that
everything
be
ok
we
sent
some
vaccine
over
to
alex
spencer
at
the
jenner
institute
a
senior
immunologist
who
do
a
lot
of
the
preclinical
study
on
the
vaccine
developed
there
alex
use
vaccine
from
both
batch
cbf
and
advent
to
vaccinate
two
set
of
mouse
and
then
monitor
their
immune
response
two
week
later
she
provide
data
that
both
batch
induced
good
immune
response
as
hop
and
that
there
be
no
significant
difference
in
the
response
to
the
two
batch
this
be
all
good
news
both
vaccine
be
immunogenic
but
we
still
didn
t
have
a
comparison
of
the
vaccine
concentration
which
would
have
require
a
much
large
experiment
use
multiple
dos
for
each
vaccine
and
we
still
have
no
explanation
for
the
difference
between
the
two
test
result
for
advent
s
batch
of
vaccine
this
be
the
subject
of
many
meeting
as
we
have
to
decide
whether
to
proceed
with
vaccinate
the
phase
ii
iii
trial
volunteer
and
if
so
how
the
volunteer
in
the
first
phase
i
trial
have
be
give
a
dose
of
billion
virus
particle
determine
use
our
cbf
spectrophotometry
test
fn
we
decide
that
we
would
use
the
same
method
to
determine
the
dose
of
the
advent
material
for
the
volunteer
in
the
phase
ii
iii
trial
by
use
this
approach
we
knew
that
the
dose
would
be
both
well
tolerate
and
immunogenic
whichever
of
the
two
result
be
accurate
it
also
err
on
the
side
of
caution
if
the
cbf
method
turn
out
to
be
wrong
and
the
value
determine
by
qpcr
be
in
fact
more
accurate
then
we
would
have
give
a
low
dose
than
anticipate
which
would
be
safe
if
on
the
other
hand
we
base
our
dose
on
the
advent
value
as
determine
by
qpcr
and
then
that
turn
out
to
be
wrong
we
would
have
give
our
volunteer
twice
as
much
vaccine
as
we
intend
and
we
would
not
risk
do
that
fn
we
checked
this
approach
with
the
mhra
and
they
agree
the
safety
of
trial
participant
be
always
the
mhra
s
primary
concern
and
ours
thus
the
initial
dose
give
to
the
first
volunteer
in
the
phase
ii
iii
trial
at
the
end
of
may
be
viral
particle
per
dose
accord
to
cbf
spectrophotometry
or
it
be
roughly
half
that
much
viral
particle
by
advent
s
qpcr
measurement
the
recruitment
of
volunteer
to
clinical
trial
be
often
quite
a
challenge
many
of
the
trial
we
run
in
oxford
be
to
try
to
find
vaccine
to
prevent
disease
that
be
endemic
in
other
country
so
there
be
no
obvious
direct
benefit
to
the
participant
it
be
a
big
commitment
to
travel
to
a
clinic
to
be
vaccinate
with
an
experimental
medicine
for
the
good
of
a
community
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
however
covid
be
completely
different
the
disease
have
fundamentally
change
life
in
the
uk
school
be
close
people
s
livelihood
be
at
risk
people
be
die
alone
within
hour
of
announce
that
we
be
recruiting
volunteer
for
trial
we
have
thousand
of
application
i
think
that
all
of
us
involve
have
be
humble
by
the
generosity
and
commitment
of
the
trial
participant
turn
up
to
numerous
clinic
for
blood
sample
and
take
weekly
swab
test
for
month
and
month
it
reinforces
my
belief
that
people
be
in
the
main
good
and
generous
and
altruistic
it
s
always
worth
remember
that
the
vaccine
wouldn
t
have
be
possible
without
them
if
we
didn
t
have
people
who
be
ready
and
willing
like
this
we
wouldn
t
have
be
able
to
gather
crucial
data
on
our
vaccine
and
we
wouldn
t
be
vaccinate
people
in
the
million
as
we
be
now
but
because
recruitment
to
the
trial
be
go
so
well
we
be
use
up
the
vaccine
at
a
rapid
rate
the
first
fill
vial
from
advent
have
already
be
ship
out
to
the
eighteen
clinical
site
around
the
uk
this
have
be
a
massive
logistical
enterprise
pack
up
and
shipping
the
precise
number
of
vial
need
for
each
site
not
help
by
the
fact
that
the
site
kept
ask
for
more
more
more
for
week
line
of
courier
van
would
queue
up
each
day
outside
the
cbf
and
the
team
be
work
absolutely
flat
out
to
ensure
that
each
vial
be
properly
label
distribute
and
account
for
i
be
occasionally
get
very
frustrate
with
the
trial
clinician
who
seem
to
find
it
very
easy
to
demand
that
we
provide
fifteen
vial
to
hull
tomorrow
without
understand
that
i
have
neither
a
magic
carpet
nor
an
ability
to
produce
vaccine
out
of
thin
air
there
be
some
stressful
meeting
and
i
might
have
sworn
with
frustration
in
some
of
them
not
at
people
but
at
the
situation
at
one
point
early
in
june
a
week
or
so
into
the
phase
ii
iii
trial
it
become
clear
that
there
be
not
enough
vaccine
in
the
country
to
meet
the
need
of
the
trial
site
some
site
be
recruiting
volunteer
faster
than
expect
sometimes
dos
get
waste
if
volunteer
do
not
turn
up
and
also
the
clinician
kept
add
more
element
to
the
trial
think
of
additional
thing
to
test
and
the
number
just
kept
on
rise
advent
have
fill
and
label
their
second
batch
of
vial
by
this
time
but
there
be
a
problem
the
vaccine
be
still
in
italy
the
trial
be
in
the
uk
and
there
be
no
commercial
flight
operating
between
the
two
we
be
stuck
what
we
do
next
be
a
perfect
illustration
of
how
out
of
the
ordinary
the
situation
be
my
operation
manager
omar
el
muhanna
who
have
a
lot
of
experience
work
in
extreme
emergency
situation
suggest
that
we
charter
a
plane
it
felt
very
rock
star
even
though
it
be
the
vaccine
travel
first
class
and
not
any
of
us
it
turn
out
charter
a
private
jet
cost
around
normally
well
beyond
the
budget
of
a
small
academic
clinical
trial
but
by
this
time
we
have
the
might
of
a
global
pharma
company
behind
us
all
those
meeting
with
our
astrazeneca
colleague
be
start
to
come
good
we
get
permission
to
proceed
the
jet
arrive
in
london
the
next
day
with
no
passenger
just
a
large
box
of
dry
ice
and
precious
vial
for
next
day
distribution
across
the
uk
the
trial
must
go
on

after
a
week
or
so
of
vaccination
with
the
first
advent
batch
the
team
monitoring
the
data
come
from
the
site
be
surprised
to
note
that
the
volunteer
receive
this
new
batch
be
have
few
and
milder
reaction
slight
soreness
where
the
needle
go
in
fever
for
a
day
than
we
have
see
in
the
phase
i
trial
use
the
cbf
batch
we
have
all
be
continue
to
think
about
why
the
two
test
for
concentration
have
give
different
result
in
oxford
we
decide
to
set
up
some
new
test
to
try
to
identify
difference
between
the
two
batch
in
my
research
lab
in
my
other
job
at
the
wellcome
centre
for
human
genetics
i
regularly
use
two
technique
to
understand
how
protein
function
in
cell
i
thought
that
we
could
use
these
technique
to
analyse
how
well
the
two
batch
manage
to
persuade
cell
to
make
spike
protein
which
be
of
course
what
the
vaccine
have
to
do
in
a
recipient
s
body
in
order
to
trigger
the
immune
response
i
set
up
a
system
in
which
i
could
separately
infect
two
different
flask
of
human
cell
with
the
two
vaccine
batch
and
then
monitor
how
much
spike
protein
be
produce
when
we
align
the
quantity
of
the
two
batch
assume
the
cbf
test
result
be
correct
the
advent
batch
produce
less
spike
protein
when
we
correct
and
align
the
vaccine
use
the
advent
qpcr
concentration
the
vaccine
produce
highly
similar
quantity
of
spike
this
data
alongside
the
data
from
the
trial
participant
reaction
to
the
vaccine
suggest
that
the
cbf
test
method
might
not
be
the
most
appropriate
way
to
measure
the
concentration
of
the
advent
batch
what
we
conclude
be
that
our
spectrophotometric
concentration
test
be
accurate
when
we
use
our
purification
method
advent
s
qpcr
concentration
test
be
accurate
when
use
either
their
purification
method
or
our
purification
method
so
when
we
have
sent
our
vaccine
to
advent
the
two
test
have
give
the
same
result
the
issue
appear
to
be
that
our
spectrophotometric
test
be
not
accurate
when
combine
with
advent
s
purification
method
we
have
be
keep
the
mhra
up
to
date
with
all
of
our
finding
and
now
report
back
again
they
say
that
the
volunteer
who
have
already
receive
what
we
now
believe
be
a
half
dose
could
remain
in
the
trial
and
agree
a
plan
to
continue
use
qpcr
to
measure
concentration
from
now
on
it
be
this
first
set
of
volunteer
who
receive
a
low
dose
because
we
initially
use
the
spectrophotometry
method
who
be
responsible
for
the
unexpected
dramatic
and
confuse
find
in
november
the
reason
we
end
up
with
the
different
efficacy
at
and
depend
on
which
group
of
volunteer
be
analyse
our
data
seem
to
show
that
an
initial
half
dose
follow
by
a
full
dose
offer
well
protection
than
two
standard
dos
however
the
number
of
people
who
have
receive
this
initial
half
dose
be
small
so
our
confidence
in
the
accuracy
of
the
find
be
low
than
our
confidence
in
other
result
we
say
at
the
time
that
we
want
to
gather
more
data
and
perform
far
analysis
to
understand
it
when
we
do
we
discover
that
the
situation
be
even
more
complicate
than
it
have
seem

it
be
one
thing
get
hundred
and
then
thousand
of
vial
ready
for
trial
but
there
be
also
an
intense
focus
on
gear
up
to
make
million
of
dos
of
vaccine
for
potential
deployment
should
it
prove
to
be
safe
and
effective
usually
we
would
not
even
start
to
think
about
scale
up
or
deployment
until
we
have
complete
phase
ii
trial
which
would
be
at
least
three
or
four
year
into
development
this
time
though
we
have
start
think
about
it
back
in
february
before
we
have
even
produce
a
single
vial
of
vaccine
or
design
the
phase
i
trial
right
from
the
start
of
the
outbreak
in
wuhan
sandy
have
fear
that
this
disease
be
more
concern
than
initial
report
suggest
from
early
february
when
there
have
be
just
a
handful
of
confirm
case
in
the
uk
he
push
hard
for
us
to
take
it
very
seriously
and
get
ourselves
in
the
position
to
make
large
amount
of
vaccine
should
it
be
need
he
also
say
we
need
to
set
up
emergency
childcare
arrangement
in
case
school
close
which
we
all
thought
be
completely
mad
and
do
not
do
sandy
be
the
first
person
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
possible
to
get
a
vaccine
from
design
to
deployment
in
less
than
a
year
if
the
effort
be
make
and
funding
be
provide
at
the
time
the
big
name
be
all
say
it
would
take
at
least
two
year
but
sandy
doesn
t
take
no
for
an
answer
and
partly
for
that
reason
he
be
prove
completely
right
how
then
do
we
get
to
the
point
of
be
able
to
manufacture
million
of
dos
of
a
completely
new
vaccine
use
a
technology
that
we
have
only
ever
use
to
make
batch
of
a
few
thousand
dos
the
great
advantage
of
the
type
of
purification
process
that
sandy
have
ask
us
to
use
for
the
rabies
vaccine
that
fail
for
us
at
the
cbf
in
march
and
work
well
for
advent
be
that
unlike
the
method
that
do
work
for
us
at
the
cbf
in
march
it
be
inherently
scalable
whereas
our
method
involve
centrifuge
and
freeze
thaw
cycle
and
make
cocktail
be
manual
and
labour
intensive
and
would
require
exponentially
more
skilled
people
and
centrifuge
to
scale
up
with
sandy
s
method
you
can
just
use
ever
large
vessel
to
grow
ever
more
cell
to
produce
ever
more
vaccine
and
ever
large
column
or
filter
to
purify
the
material
and
you
end
up
with
much
more
product
at
the
cbf
we
can
grow
up
to
ten
litre
of
culture
at
a
time
from
which
we
can
make
a
few
hundred
dos
at
advent
they
can
grow
one
hundred
litre
of
culture
at
a
time
from
which
they
can
make
a
few
thousand
dos
commercial
vaccine
producer
use
special
litre
tank
or
bioreactors
to
make
several
million
dos
per
run
and
it
be
not
only
the
purification
process
that
sandy
have
optimise
over
the
previous
year
he
have
also
be
work
in
his
research
group
to
optimise
vaccine
yield
find
way
to
maximise
both
the
number
of
cell
that
could
be
grown
per
millilitre
of
culture
and
the
number
of
virus
particle
that
could
be
produce
by
each
cell
carina
joe
a
post
doctoral
researcher
in
sandy
s
group
have
figure
out
that
by
change
the
growth
medium
the
nutritious
broth
in
which
the
cell
multiply
she
could
improve
the
yield
up
to
fivefold
meaning
that
we
would
obtain
five
time
more
vaccine
from
a
give
volume
of
culture
they
have
so
far
though
only
test
this
method
at
a
small
scale
in
the
research
lab
in
oxford
to
prove
that
it
work
well
when
scale
up
would
require
access
to
a
bioreactor
as
well
as
other
specialise
equipment
the
best
place
to
find
these
be
in
industrial
bioprocessing
plant
where
they
produce
drug
like
antibiotic
or
insulin
and
for
that
we
would
need
help
and
more
money
sarah
have
already
put
in
her
radioactive
february
application
for
million
from
ukri
to
make
vaccine
for
and
run
our
first
clinical
trial
but
sandy
suggest
that
he
could
make
a
separate
bid
for
funding
to
bring
in
an
industrial
partner
to
help
us
to
develop
the
process
at
scale
so
we
would
be
ready
for
eventual
manufacture
the
aim
be
to
very
rapidly
within
three
month
prove
that
we
have
a
process
that
could
be
use
to
make
million
of
dos
we
would
then
be
in
the
ideal
position
as
soon
as
we
have
evidence
of
safety
and
efficacy
from
clinical
trial
of
already
know
how
to
make
enough
vaccine
to
actually
deploy
it
we
would
also
be
in
a
much
strong
position
to
find
an
industry
partner
for
commercial
manufacturing
we
have
make
vaccine
use
this
technology
before
but
never
at
scale
and
neither
astrazeneca
nor
anyone
else
would
have
have
much
interest
in
an
academic
vaccine
with
no
proven
potential
for
large
scale
manufacture
the
timing
be
excellent
as
i
have
be
at
a
meeting
of
the
uk
bioindustry
association
earlier
that
week
it
be
mid
february
when
i
have
travel
down
to
london
by
train
sat
tightly
packed
around
a
table
in
an
airless
meeting
room
jostled
elbow
to
elbow
for
a
buffet
lunch
and
generally
do
a
lot
of
mingle
and
chat
during
all
the
breakout
session
i
have
be
scoping
out
who
in
the
uk
would
be
interested
in
help
us
with
a
big
coronavirus
project
if
one
start
to
kick
off
afterwards
i
met
my
sister
at
an
event
she
have
organise
at
the
design
museum
then
we
go
for
dinner
and
cocktail
on
kensington
high
street
to
celebrate
my
birthday
it
be
a
totally
normal
trip
down
to
london
and
of
course
at
the
time
i
didn
t
realise
how
long
it
would
be
until
i
would
do
anything
like
it
again
although
these
kind
of
conference
be
sometimes
see
as
pointless
unproductive
jolly
the
relationship
i
have
built
there
over
year
of
soggy
quiche
slice
and
partially
frozen
cheesecake
turn
out
to
be
very
important
it
meant
that
when
i
come
to
these
people
with
urgent
and
unprecedented
request
in
the
come
week
there
be
great
trust
between
us
so
when
i
ask
netty
at
the
bia
to
put
a
call
out
explain
the
work
we
already
have
in
train
our
confidence
in
our
technology
and
our
need
for
assistance
from
industry
the
response
be
heart
warm
and
incredible
we
immediately
receive
offer
of
support
equipment
loan
and
expertise
share
from
across
the
uk
this
enable
sandy
to
rapidly
finalise
his
request
for
funding
he
ask
for
to
use
his
process
to
manufacture
at
fifty
litre
and
litre
scale
at
the
pall
facility
in
portsmouth
with
support
from
the
vaccine
manufacturing
and
innovation
centre
team
fn
the
vmic
facility
itself
be
unfortunately
still
in
its
construction
phase
in
a
field
outside
didcot
the
first
test
run
at
fifty
litre
scale
be
start
in
portsmouth
in
the
last
week
of
march
and
a
litre
run
be
start
shortly
afterwards
we
be
not
at
this
point
manufacturing
vaccine
that
could
be
use
in
clinical
trial
that
would
have
require
a
rigorously
control
gmp
compliant
facility
these
be
practice
run
test
method
prove
they
could
work
at
this
scale
and
get
an
idea
of
yield
by
mid
april
while
we
be
quality
test
the
first
ever
vial
of
vaccine
produce
by
the
cbf
pall
be
successfully
produce
fifty
litre
and
litre
scale
of
research
grade
vaccine
and
demonstrate
excellent
yield
fn
we
have
a
route
to
large
scale
manufacturing
the
process
be
go
to
work
it
be
a
big
moment
up
until
then
we
have
an
idea
a
theory
we
still
didn
t
know
if
the
idea
would
work
that
be
what
the
trial
be
for
to
establish
whether
the
vaccine
be
safe
and
effective
but
even
assume
it
do

our
vaccine
would
remain
only
an
idea
just
an
interest
piece
of
research
with
no
impact
in
the
real
world
unless
we
found
a
way
to
make
it
at
scale
a
vaccine
s
ability
to
save
life
be
not
only
about
a
single
efficacy
number
it
be
also
about
how
much
you
can
make
how
easily
you
can
get
it
to
people
and
then
ultimately
how
many
people
be
willing
to
receive
it
this
be
big
because
it
be
the
moment
we
knew
we
be
go
to
be
able
to
make
our
vaccine
and
potentially
if
the
vaccine
work
save
life
on
a
massive
scale
with
this
proven
success
sandy
go
back
to
the
government
with
a
request
for
more
funding
he
have
developed
a
process
and
refining
it
with
pall
proven
it
could
work
at
scale
now
he
need
more
financing
to
contract
with
large
scale
gmp
compliant
manufacturer
so
that
they
could
stop
do
whatever
they
have
be
planning
to
do
in
and
get
to
work
make
our
vaccine
instead
this
be
get
really
urgent
sandy
have
pretty
much
arrange
for
large
scale
manufacturing
via
a
series
of
gentleman
s
agreement
but
in
the
end
the
people
be
ask
to
deliver
the
good
be
commercial
company
with
cost
and
salary
to
pay
there
come
a
point
when
goodwill
run
out
and
they
need
a
real
contract
there
be
a
tense
few
week
of
unproductive
negotiation
with
possible
funders
then
the
cavalry
arrive
in
the
form
of
the
brand
new
vaccine
taskforce
combine
technical
expertise
with
a
route
to
decision
make
at
the
high
level
of
government
the
taskforce
suddenly
make
what
many
have
say
be
a
crazy
proposal
in
february
a
reality
sandy
be
award
fund
to
build
a
manufacturing
consortium
that
could
not
only
make
lot
of
vaccine
but
also
test
it
store
it
transport
it
and
get
it
into
vial
which
require
highly
specialist
plant
this
be
not
straightforward
some
manufacturer
need
new
equipment
or
to
repurpose
exist
equipment
some
need
training
and
everything
be
more
difficult
than
normal
because
we
be
still
in
the
middle
of
a
pandemic
one
crucial
new
part
of
this
set
up
be
oxford
biomedica
serendipitously
they
have
a
brand
new
and
so
far
empty
manufacturing
suite
just
around
the
corner
from
us
sandy
suggest
to
the
taskforce
that
government
funding
could
enable
them
to
buy
all
the
equipment
need
to
make
our
vaccine
at
scale
to
guarantee
a

base
supply
fn
sandy

build
a

with
the
intention
of
be
operational
by

fn
by

everything
be

brought
the

the

for

nothing

twenty
year
before
the
pandemic
when
my
child
be
about
fifteen
month
old
i
have
a
brief
episode
of
complete
amnesia
i
be
on
my
own
in
a
car
drive
towards
a
junction
and
need
to
get
into
either
the
left
or
the
right
lane
i
realise
that
i
didn
t
know
which
lane
i
want
to
be
in
because
i
have
no
idea
where
i
be
go
i
also
have
no
idea
where
i
be
why
i
be
in
a
car
or
who
i
be
i
be
in
full
control
of
the
vehicle
in
a
quiet
suburban
area
and
drive
within
the
speed
limit
but
i
slow
down
to
give
myself
more
time
to
work
out
what
be
go
on
i
told
myself
not
to
panic
but
to
think
about
what
day
it
be
that
seem
like
a
low
stress
question
to
answer
rather
than
address
who
i
be
or
anything
else
challenge
still
nothing
then
all
of
a
sudden
everything
come
flood
back
it
be
a
saturday
morning
and
i
be
on
my
way
into
the
lab
i
be
on
a
road
i
have
probably
take
several
thousand
time
before
i
be
somewhat
rattle
by
this
episode
and
take
it
as
a
sign
that
i
probably
need
less
stress
and
more
sleep
that
be
easy
say
than
do
after
the
baby
be
born
i
have
take
eighteen
week
of
maternity
leave
for
eight
of
which
the
baby
be
in
hospital
then
i
have
go
back
to
work
full
time
while
my
partner
rob
take
over
at
home
as
a
research
scientist
i
be
employ
on
a
series
of
short
term
contract
typically
three
year
long
failure
to
deliver
result
would
mean
failure
to
secure
more
funding
and
i
would
be
out
of
a
job
i
couldn
t
afford
to
coast
on
my
first
day
back
at
work
my
supervisor
have
organise
a
two
hour
meeting
at
p
m
this
meant
i
be
definitely
go
to
miss
bath
time
to
discus
the
fact
that
he
want
to
start
clinical
trial
of
the
vaccine
we
be
develop
this
would
be
the
first
time
the
group
have
venture
into
clinical
test
and
i
would
be
responsible
for
get
the
necessary
approval
despite
the
fact
that
i
have
no
experience
in
that
field
the
important
fact
i
manage
to
latch
onto
be
that
we
would
be
collaborate
with
a
biotech
company
who
have
conduct
trial
before
i
just
about
caught
the
name
of
the
person
there
i
should
contact
the
rest
of
that
year
be
a
blur
be
a
mother
of
triplet
with
a
full
time
job
probably
stood
me
in
good
stead
for
the
challenge
of
suddenly
become
the
main
breadwinner
for
a
family
of
five
on
a
couple
of
hour
sleep
a
night
that
be
pressure
to
be
honest
although
i
be
ask
the
question
a
lot
i
rarely
thought
about
how
i
be
deal
with
the
pressure
in
every
day
i
simply
have
to
deal
with
lot
of
different
problem
each
of
which
in
itself
be
probably
something
i
have
dealt
with
before
there
be
more
problem
now
and
shorter
gap
between
them
but
i
be
work
with
a
large
team
of
skilled
and
hard
work
people
who
be
all
expert
in
their
field
all
absolutely
focus
on
do
the
best
job
they
possibly
could
and
all
prepared
to
do
whatever
need
do
some
very
well
qualify
people
have
take
a
turn
stick
bar
cod
label
onto
sample
tube
the
hard
part
be
deal
with
so
many
different
part
of
the
process
all
at
the
same
time
rather
than
in
sequence
start
from
february
i
be
work
through
every
weekend
because
that
be
the
only
time
i
be
not
constantly
be
interrupt
i
would
also
wake
up
in
the
early
hour
think
about
a
job
that
need
to
be
do
or
a
question
ask
or
answer
then
i
would
think
of
a
second
and
a
third
and
before
i
knew
it
i
would
be
head
downstairs
to
my
computer
before
i
forgot
all
the
detail
of
what
have
suddenly
become
clear
to
me
i
never
set
an
alarm
or
force
myself
out
of
bed
but
a
a
m
start
become
normal
for
a
while
it
wasn
t
the
first
time
i
have
manage
on
too
little
sleep
nor
the
first
time
i
have
have
to
cut
out
from
my
life
anything
that
wasn
t
strictly
necessary
plus
as
we
go
into
successive
lockdown
there
be
not
much
else
i
could
do
but
work
in
march
and
april
i
would
wake
up
worried
that
the
whole
programme
would
be
derail
because
between
us
we
have
manage
to
overlook
something
important
the
team
have
more
or
less
assemble
itself
from
the
few
of
us
who
have
start
the
project
others
we
ask
to
join
volunteer
and
people
whose
own
research
have
stop
because
of
the
pandemic
it
have
be
a
handful
of
people
in
january
and
be
around
by
july
not
include
the
colleague
we
be
work
with
at
advent
astrazeneca
in
brazil
and
south
africa
at
the
mhra
and
so
on
group
of
people
be
work
together
who
have
not
work
together
before
which
add
to
my
sense
that
something
no
one
have
thought
about
could
come
along
and
trip
us
up
but
i
be
not
the
only
one
constantly
think
thing
through
try
to
anticipate
problem
and
look
for
thing
we
might
have
miss
everything
get
do
later
in
the
year
any
time
there
be
a
lull
my
adrenaline
level
drop
and
exhaustion
set
in
it
happen
in
august
when
i
nearly
fell
asleep
at
the
kitchen
table
over
dinner
one
even
then
slept
for
twelve
hour
straight
rob
be
worried
that
the
fatigue
meant
i
might
have
covid
i
didn
t
it
happen
again
in
the
middle
of
december
when
the
efficacy
result
have
be
publish
but
we
be
still
wait
for
the
second
shoe
to
drop
which
would
be
when
the
mhra
announce
emergency
use
licensure
of
the
vaccine
i
slept
like
the
dead
for
one
night
every
member
of
the
team
work
harder
than
they
ever
have
before
be
part
of
what
make
it
possible
to
develop
the
vaccine
in
record
time
but
of
course
it
be
not
the
whole
story
as
often
as
i
be
ask
how
i
be
deal
with
the
pressure
an
even
more
common
question
be
how
it
could
be
possible
to
turn
what
be
usually
a
ten
year
process
into
a
one
year
process
without
cut
any
corner
some
people
be
relieve
that
we
be
make
such
quick
progress
but
for
many
the
speed
with
which
we
be
work
lead
to
worry
and
mistrust
there
be
a
concern
that
if
we
be
do
it
so
fast
we
must
be
rush
it
take
less
care
or
miss
out
important
part
of
the
process
the
answer
to
that
question
be
really
the
thread
run
through
this
whole
book
but
in
this
chapter
i
want
to
summarise
it
as
clearly
as
i
can
it
be
true
that
vaccine
have
in
the
past
take
a
long
long
time
to
develop
until
a
new
vaccine
usually
take
at
least
ten
year
to
develop
from
concept
to
roll
out
many
take
much
longer
the
malaria
vaccine
programme
at
the
jenner
institute
have
be
go
for
twenty
five
year
and
research
into
malaria
vaccine
have
be
go
on
for
more
than
a
hundred
year
so
far
with
limited
success
the
lab
to
jab
record
holder
be
the
mumps
vaccine
developed
in
four
year
by
maurice
hilleman
in
the
united
state
in
the
s
but
the
standard
lengthy
timeline
we
be
all
use
to
be
never
because
vaccine
development
require
ten
fifteen
or
thirty
year
of
continuous
painstaking
lab
work
clinical
trial
and
data
analysis
for
every
vaccine
that
have
ever
be
developed
up
until
most
of
the
elapse
development
time
be
spent
wait
in
there
be
three
key
factor
that
enable
us
to
cut
out
the
wait
and
crunch
ten
year
into
one
first
the
work
we
have
already
do
second
change
to
the
way
funding
be
give
out
and
third
do
in
parallel
thing
that
we
would
normally
do
in
sequence
in
some
way
it
be
mislead
to
say
that
we
developed
the
vaccine
in
a
year
a
large
part
of
the
reason
we
be
able
to
move
so
fast
in
be
due
to
all
of
the
work
we
have
be
do
both
on
other
vaccine
and
on
planning
for
disease
x
in
the
year
lead
up
to
it
we
be
unfortunately
not
as
well
prepared
as
we
could
have
be
for
example
we
have
not
be
able
to
do
as
much
work
as
we
would
have
like
on
speed
up
the
early
dna
sequence
to
vial
part
of
our
development
process
include
my
new
rapid
method
to
make
the
start
material
and
sandy
s
new
purification
method
so
we
do
not
have
the
absolutely
best
route
fully
mapped
out
our
plan
be
not
finalise
but
we
be
also
not
start
from
scratch
we
have
year
of
experience
and
a
large
body
of
work
behind
us
thanks
to
that
we
have
a
good
idea
of
where
we
be
go
and
how
best
to
get
there
most
importantly
we
do
not
need
to
design
make
and
test
a
brand
new
vaccine
we
have
a
try
and
test
platform
technology
that
we
have
be
work
on
for
year
start
with
a
flu
vaccine
back
in
and
include
a
vaccine
against
mers
another
coronavirus
that
meant
that
before
we
even
knew
the
pathogen
s
genome
we
knew
the
design
for
our
vaccine
the
gene
cod
for
the
sars
cov
spike
protein
plug
into
chadox
and
once
we
do
receive
the
genome
we
be
able
to
design
the
exact
dna
sequence
we
need
within
forty
eight
hour
less
than
four
month
after
that
we
have
the
first
dos
make
quality
assure
and
ready
to
use
in
clinical
trial
because
of
the
many
safety
trial
we
have
do
on
previous
adenovirus
vectored
vaccine
with
subject
age
from
to
we
then
have
a
large
amount
of
data
on
what
dosage
would
be
safe
and
what
dosage
would
induce
the
best
immune
response
all
of
those
international
conference
also
come
good
it
meant
that
we
have
a
huge
network
of
trust
colleague
all
over
the
world
when
we
want
to
set
up
trial
in
brazil
or
south
africa
andy
wasn
t
just
pitch
up
unannounced
at
a
hospital
in
rio
or
johannesburg
we
have
exist
relationship
we
knew
all
the
people
already
and
we
knew
they
would
be
able
to
conduct
high
quality
clinical
trial
because
they
already
have
the
infrastructure
and
experience
the
plug
and
play
approach
of
a
platform
technology
a
safe
effective
proven
delivery
system
that
can
be
quickly
adapt
to
a
new
disease
be
not
available
to
maurice
hilleman
in
the
s
he
spent
two
year
get
to
the
stage
we
reach
in
four
month
transfer
a
virus
take
from
his
daughter
s
throat
through
a
succession
of
chicken
egg
a
technique
that
have
be
use
to
produce
other
viral
vaccine
until
he
judged
it
have
be
weaken
enough
to
be
trialled
as
a
vaccine
but
whilst
technological
advance
be
crucial
to
our
ability
to
work
quickly
in
they
be
not
the
only
or
even
the
main
factor
at
play
decade
after
hilleman
s
work
on
mumps
despite
all
the
advance
in
technology
get
from
idea
to
first
clinical
trial
in
two
year
would
still
be
see
as
extremely
fast
and
even
five
year
be
consider
very
efficient
what
have
enable
maurice
hilleman
to
move
so
quickly
compare
with
those
who
come
after
him
be
that
he
be
in
the
fortunate
position
of
have
access
to
the
support
and
funding
he
need
when
he
need
it
access
to
funding
be
the
second
reason
we
be
able
to
move
so
quickly
in
the
truth
be
that
previous
vaccine
development
include
for
disease
of
significant
global
burden
like
malaria
and
against
pathogen
that
could
wreak
as
much
havoc
as
covid
have
do
like
influenza
a
which
include
avian
flu
have
be
slow
not
because
it
be
impossible
or
unsafe
to
go
fast
but
because
go
fast
be
not
see
as
a
high
enough
priority
develop
a
vaccine
be
expensive
manufacturing
a
vaccine
be
even
more
expensive
for
every
vaccine
development
programme
there
have
to
be
first
a
reason
for
someone
to
start
and
second
ever
increase
level
of
funding
to
keep
go
small
company
and
university
scientist
be
those
most
likely
to
start
a
piece
of
research
but
tend
not
to
have
the
skill
set
or
facility
to
take
thing
all
the
way
through
to
licensure
large
pharmaceutical
company
which
be
require
to
make
a
profit
for
their
shareholder
might
have
the
skill
set
and
facility
need
to
get
a
vaccine
license
and
to
manufacture
at
scale
but
not
the
motivation
for
example
if
a
vaccine
be
likely
to
only
ever
be
need
in
small
quantity
like
the
vaccine
for
nipah
or
lassa
fever
or
mers
and
remember
the
ebola
vaccine
test
in
the
outbreak
be
originally
developed
as
part
of
a
us
bio
defence
programme
not
to
protect
people
in
west
africa
there
s
not
much
commercial
incentive
similarly
if
a
new
vaccine
candidate
work
well
from
an
immunological
point
of
view
but
would
be
too
expensive
or
impractical
in
some
other
way
to
manufacture
at
scale
no
one
be
likely
to
make
it
an
example
of
an
academic
lead
project
that
do
not
make
it
beyond
phase
i
trial
for
reason
of
impracticality
be
a
covid
vaccine
project
from
the
university
of
queensland
in
australia
a
protein
use
in
the
vaccine
induced
those
vaccinate
to
produce
antibody
to
a
part
of
the
hiv
virus
this
meant
that
if
they
then
take
an
hiv
test
it
would
appear
to
be
positive
there
be
no
danger
that
the
trial
participant
have
be
infect
with
hiv
but
since
there
be
also
no
chance
that
the
hiv
test
would
be
change
to
allow
the
vaccine
to
be
use
without
interfere
with
the
test
vaccine
development
have
to
stop
within
this
landscape
research
funding
body
can
be
reluctant
to
support
development
work
beyond
the
early
least
costly
stage
when
they
know
that
without
the
support
of
a
large
commercial
partner
it
be
unlikely
to
reach
completion
this
be
the
market
failure
that
organisation
like
cepi
and
gavi
and
the
gate
foundation
have
be
try
to
address
we
call
it
the
funding
valley
of
death
because
so
many
hopeful
project
fall
into
it
never
to
be
see
again
it
be
an
issue
we
have
be
try
to
address
at
oxford
university
where
we
take
the
view
that
we
need
to
be
able
not
only
to
research
a
vaccine
candidate
in
the
lab
but
also
to
manufacture
it
for
clinical
trial
and
conduct
at
least
the
phase
i
safety
trial
ourselves
however
even
with
the
right
skill
set
and
facility
we
still
have
to
find
the
funding
to
pay
for
our
work
in
normal
circumstance
that
funding
come
in
tranche
you
apply
for
a
first
tranche
of
funding
and
wait
to
hear
whether
you
have
be
successful
that
alone
can
easily
take
a
year
then
you
do
a
bit
of
work
perhaps
demonstrate
that
the
vaccine
be
capable
of
induce
an
immune
response
in
animal
and
protect
animal
against
the
pathogen
you
publish
the
result
and
present
your
work
at
conference
to
raise
its
profile
and
attract
the
attention
of
funders
that
maybe
take
another
year
or
two
then
if
your
result
look
promising
you
apply
for
the
next
much
large
tranche
of
funding
to
manufacture
the
vaccine
in
readiness
for
clinical
trial
apply
for
approval
and
vaccinate
a
small
number
of
people
in
a
phase
i
study
you
wait
to
hear
whether
you
have
be
successful
which
can
easily
take
a
year
perhaps
this
time
you
aren
t
successful
so
you
write
another
application
wait
another
year
and
so
on
it
be
as
if
you
be
make
a
roast
dinner
and
for
every
ingredient
you
have
to
make
a
separate
trip
to
the
shop
to
buy
it
then
cook
it
and
demonstrate
that
it
be
go
to
be
delicious
before
move
on
to
the
next
and
even
for
us
with
the
cbf
on
site
and
the
ability
to
run
clinical
trial
once
we
get
to
the
stage
of
want
to
run
large
scale
phase
iii
trial
it
go
beyond
the
kind
of
funding
that
be
available
to
a
university
we
have
to
publish
our
study
and
wait
for
interest
from
pharmaceutical
company
or
large
scale
endeavour
like
cepi
that
be
like
get
to
the
point
of
have
successfully
cooked
all
the
vegetable
then
have
to
just
put
them
steam
in
the
front
window
and
hope
that
someone
would
offer
to
sell
you
a
chicken
in
this
kind
of
limp
along
with
a
delay
of
several
year
between
decide
to
start
make
a
vaccine
and
the
first
clinical
trial
simply
would
not
do
the
pandemic
be
kill
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
and
shut
down
entire
society
and
it
become
imperative
and
urgent
to
have
a
vaccine
to
control
it
in
january
february
and
march
we
be
out
on
a
limb
work
at
financial
risk
to
the
university
and
probably
at
even
great
risk
to
our
own
professional
reputation
but
by
april
there
be
widespread
recognition
that
resourcing
research
into
covid
vaccine
be
an
urgent
priority
we
be
allow
to
do
a
big
shop
and
put
all
the
ingredient
we
need
in
the

all
at

the

also
hugely
increase
by
the
end
of

need
to
do
to
review
and
approve
first
our
trial
and
later
our
result
put
us
and
other
covid
vaccine
at
the
front
of
the
queue
bring
in
dozen
of
outside
expert
to
help
and
like
us
work
long
hour
seven
day
a
week
as
other
work
be
deprioritised
we
gain
access
to
a
huge
pool
of
skilled
scientist
who
would
usually
have
be
work
on
other
trial
or
research
and
scientist
and
other
expert
from
around
the
world
be
more
willing
than
ever
before
to
cooperate
and
collaborate
i
join
call
lead
by
the
who
in
which
many
group
develop
vaccine
present
their
plan
and
report
on
progress
we
all
want
to
learn
from
each
other
and
knew
that
unlike
normal
this
be
not
a
race
or
a
competition
for
a
limited
market
where
the
winner
would
take
all
for
some
commercial
vaccine
be
first
mean
make
the
most
money
because
it
be
difficult
for
other
company
to
break
into
the
market
once
the
first
vaccine
be
in
widespread
use
with
billion
people
at
risk
it
be
go
to
take
lot
of
vaccine
make
by
different
company
in
different
country
and
in
different
way
to
beat
the
virus
and
we
need
to
share
our
knowledge
to
get
there
as
fast
as
possible
the
third
reason
we
be
able
to
move
so
quickly
be
that
from
the
start
we
proceed
at
risk
do
in
parallel
and
back
to
back
thing
that
would
usually
be
do
in
sequence
with
long
pause
in
between
as
we
ve
explain
at
risk
do
not
mean
at
risk
to
the
safety
of
the
vaccine
the
risk
be
to
those
of
us
work
on
the
vaccine
that
we
would
have
waste
our
time
and
money
so
for
example
usually
we
would
not
start
work
on
make
the
clinical
grade
vaccine
in
cath
s
cbf
until
we
have
show
the
research
grade
vaccine
work
in
animal
this
time
we
do
those
two
piece
of
work
in
parallel
the
risk
be
that
if
the
vaccine
do
not
work
in
animal
we
would
have
waste
our
effort
manufacturing
it
similarly
usually
we
would
not
start
work
on
the
design
of
a
clinical
trial
until
we
have
complete
all
the
preclinical
animal
trial
that
way
if
the
preclinical
trial
show
that
the
vaccine
be
not
safe
or
not
effective
we
would
not
have
waste
anyone
s
time
prepare
clinical
trial
that
could
not
go
ahead
this
time
we
do
all
the
design
and
preparation
of
the
clinical
trial
include
recruiting
and
screen
the
volunteer
whilst
the
preclinical
trial
be
still
go
on
that
way
it
be
literally
the
day
after
we
have
the
safety
data
from
our
preclinical
trial
which
be
also
the
day
that
cath
s
cbf
have
vial
of
the
vaccine
ready
to
use
that
we
be
put
the
vaccine
into
the
arm
of
our
first
volunteer
in
phase
i
safety
trial
we
overlap
phase
of
clinical
trial
once
we
have
the
data
we
need
on
safety
we
start
scale
up
manufacturing
before
we
have
even
do
our
first
clinical
trial
you
wouldn
t
dream
of
do
that
in
any
normal
world
because
it
be
so
expensive
astrazeneca
and
its
partner
manufacture
million
of
dos
of
vaccine
before
we
have
data
show
that
the
vaccine
work
that
be
even
more
expensive
it
meant
that
if
the
vaccine
turn
out
not
to
work
they
would
have
to
throw
million
of
dos
away
we
start
talk
to
the
mhra
early
we
kept
talk
to
them
all
the
way
through
and
they
review
all
of
our
data
over
page
of
it
on
a
roll
basis
rather
than
wait
to
start
until
we
have
provide
every
last
piece
of
evidence
under
the
roll
review
the
mhra
look
at
everything
they
always
look
at
the
preclinical
data
the
manufacturing
data
and
the
safety
and
efficacy
data
and
they
look
at
it
just
as
carefully
as
they
always
do
but
they
start
sooner
and
put
more
people
on
it
that
be
how
they
get
it
do
quicker
the
last
piece
of
wait
that
get
cut
short
of
course
be
the
wait
for
the
result
of
our
efficacy
trial
in
during
the
ebola
outbreak
by
the
time
the
phase
iii
trial
start
the
outbreak
be
be
brought
under
control
this
make
it
difficult
to
ass
whether
the
vaccine
be
test
be
effective
or
not
as
people
on
the
trial
be
not
be
expose
to
the
virus
but
in
with
the
covid
pandemic
spread
so
fast
around
the
world
and
with
our
volunteer
mostly
healthcare
worker
who
be
more
likely
than
most
to
be
expose
to
the
virus
we
would
not
have
so
long
to
wait
before
no
one
have
ever
developed
a
vaccine
in
a
year
but
that
be
not
because
it
could
not
be
do
it
be
because
it
have
never
be
try
we
be
able
to
go
faster
in
not
because
we
cut
any
corner
or
take
risk
with
our
product
we
still
do
every
single
thing
that
need
to
be
do
to
develop
a
vaccine
safely
we
do
not
miss
out
any
step
nor
be
any
individual
task
fill
a
vial
vaccinate
a
volunteer
analyse
a
graph
do
with
less
than
the
usual
care
and
attention
we
go
faster
because
we
have
to
this
time
the
world
need
the
vaccine
as
soon
as
possible
and
as
we
know
from
see
the
daily
death
rate
every
day
count
cath
chapter
trial
april
july
confirm
case
million
million
confirm
death
thursday
april
be
a
memorable
day
for
me
on
many
level
i
woke
up
feel
really
nervous
not
because
it
be
the
day
we
be
go
to
put
the
first
shot
of
our
vaccine
into
the
arm
of
our
first
volunteer
in
our
first
trial
i
have
every
confidence
that
that
would
go
smoothly
but
because
i
be
schedule
to
do
a
radio
interview
with
lbc
s
james
o
brien
and
he
s
a
tough
interviewer
i
m
completely
happy
stand
on
stage
and
talk
science
to
an
audience
of
scientist
but
this
felt
very
different
i
knew
that
james
would
ask
broad
question
and
i
m
not
a
vaccinologist
or
a
medical
doctor
and
i
didn
t
want
to
let
anyone
down
by
say
anything
wrong
or
stupid
or
that
could
be
take
the
wrong
way
i
be
have
a
bad
case
of
imposter
syndrome
in
the
end
it
seem
to
go
pretty
well
i
think
i
cheer
james
up
everything
be
feel
a
bit
gloomy
at
this
point
we
have
be
lock
down
for
a
month
the
prime
minister
have
still
not
return
to
work
have
be
in
intensive
care
ppe
shortage
be
so
bad
that
some
doctor
and
nurse
be
be
ask
to
work
in
bin
bag
the
un
have
warn
that
covid
could
cause
famine
of
biblical
proportion
and
the
chief
medical
officer
chris
whitty
have
use
the
previous
day
s
government
coronavirus
briefing
to
say
that
it
be
wholly
unrealistic
to
expect
life
to
return
to
normal
soon
he
also
say
that
the
way
out
would
be
a
vaccine
or
treatment
but
that
it
be
extremely
unlikely
we
would
find
either
before
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
but
my
message
be
one
of
hope
the
trial
have
start
we
be
confident
that
this
vaccine
will
work
we
will
find
a
way
out
of
this
terrible
situation
while
i
be
be
self
indulgent
worry
about
my
radio
interview
the
real
action
be
up
the
hill
at
the
university
s
centre
for
clinical
vaccinology
and
tropical
medicine
we
call
it
the
ccvtm
admittedly
only
a
slight
improvement
this
be
the
small
facility
across
the
road
from
mine
where
volunteer
come
to
be
vaccinate
in
our
clinical
trial
today
we
be
vaccinate
just
two
people
elisa
granato
a
microbiologist
and
edward
o
neill
a
cancer
researcher
after
take
blood
sample
from
each
of
them
the
nurse
inject
one
with
the
real
vaccine
and
one
with
a
placebo
neither
they
nor
the
nurse
knew
who
be
get
which
afterwards
our
volunteer
be
monitor
in
the
clinic
for
an
hour
for
any
unexpected
side
effect
such
as
allergic
reaction
then
they
be
free
to
go
neither
sarah
nor
i
be
there
to
witness
this
moment
we
be
be
very
strict
about
social
distance
but
fergus
walsh
the
bbc
s
medical
editor
be
so
like
a
lot
of
other
people
i
saw
it
that
even
on
the
news
it
trigger
a
mix
of
emotion
relief
and
optimism
gratitude
and
nerve
i
be
use
to
make
vaccine
that
get
use
in
clinical
trial
that
s
my
job
but
usually
the
vaccine
in
question
be
unlikely
to
have
any
direct
impact
on
me
or
my
love
one
this
time
it
be
personal

it
take
us
sixty
five
day
between
january
and
april
to
make
our
first
batch
of
vaccine
it
take
us
another
seven
month
from
april
to
november
to
test
it
in
a
series
of
ever
expand
clinical
trial
most
of
the
work
include
work
through
the
unthinkably
huge
amount
of
logistical
detail
require
to
get
a
trial
up
and
run
so
quickly
during
a
pandemic
be
do
by
the
oxford
vaccine
group
which
be
andy
s
team
over
people
from
oxford
work
on
the
clinical
trial
each
play
their
own
part
andy
be
the
conductor
with
various
soloist
take
turn
to
make
their
contribution
but
everyone
include
the
second
violin
in
the
back
row
have
a
vital
part
to
play
clinical
trial
of
vaccine
be
divide
into
three
phase
there
be
no
hard
and
fast
rule
about
how
many
people
should
be
include
in
each
phase
or
how
long
they
should
last
phase
i
trial
also
call
first
in
human
trial
test
for
safety
because
there
be
always
a
risk
that
a
new
medicine
won
t
behave
as
expect
they
start
small
they
will
also
always
involve
healthy
adult
age
between
and
or
these
volunteer
be
screen
before
vaccination
to
make
sure
that
they
be
indeed
healthy
after
vaccination
their
health
will
be
intensely
scrutinise
blood
sample
will
be
take
and
checked
for
anything
abnormal
the
volunteer
also
have
a
health
diary
to
fill
in
every
day
for
a
week
they
be
ask
to
say
which
solicit
adverse
event
they
be
experience
adverse
event
in
this
context
mean
side
effect
a
solicit
adverse
event
be
one
that
we
be
expect
and
have
ask
about
such
as
a
sore
arm
or
a
headache
we
also
ask
about
unsolicited
adverse
event
for
the
full
duration
of
the
trial
typically
a
year
meaning
anything
else
bad
that
happens
healthwise
even
if
the
volunteer
do
not
think
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
vaccination
we
then
ass
each
event
to
determine
whether
it
be
definitely
probably
possibly
or
not
related
to
vaccination
as
you
can
imagine
we
end
up
with
a
varied
list
of
adverse
event
in
oxford
bike
accident
crop
up
quite
a
lot
there
be
a
trial
in
baltimore
where
gunshot
wound
be
record
more
than
once
but
we
have
to
collect
the
information
to
make
sure
we
don
t
miss
something
important
if
there
be
an
unexpected
increase
in
any
type
of
adverse
event
it
could
be
a
consequence
of
the
vaccine
and
if
there
be
a
concern
that
the
vaccine
be
cause
unexpected
or
serious
adverse
event
the
trial
will
stop
while
we
investigate
the
reason
we
start
trial
in
healthy
young
adult
first
be
not
so
much
that
vaccine
be
more
dangerous
to
unhealthy
or
old
people
although
it
do
make
sense
to
test
a
new
medicine
on
the
strong
member
of
the
population
it
be
also
that
unhealthy
or
old
people
be
more
dangerous
to
vaccine
trial
unfortunately
people
with
underlie
health
condition
and
old
people
be
more
likely
to
experience
poor
health
and
if
one
of
the
first
volunteer
becomes
ill
soon
after
vaccination
it
be
more
difficult
to
know
whether
the
vaccination
could
have
be
responsible
and
so
more
likely
that
we
will
have
to
stop
the
trial
to
investigate
although
the
primary
aim
of
a
phase
i
vaccine
trial
be
to
look
at
safety
immune
response
will
be
look
at
too
all
vaccine
work
by
induce
the
body
to
produce
an
immune
response
so
there
be
no
point
continue
with
a
vaccine
that
do
not
induce
an
immune
response
no
matter
how
safe
it
be
once
a
phase
i
trial
have
demonstrate
acceptable
safety
and
show
that
immune
response
be
induced
in
young
healthy
adult
a
phase
ii
trial
can
include
more
people
with
a
wider
age
range
again
we
test
for
safety
and
for
immune
response
as
people
age
the
immune
system
doesn
t
respond
to
new
information
as
well
as
it
use
to
as
a
result
some
vaccine
don
t
produce
such
a
strong
immune
response
in
old
people
that
doesn
t
mean
there
be
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
we
be
learn
all
the
time
how
to
design
vaccine
that
do
induce
a
good
response
in
old
people
fn
but
this
be
why
it
be
important
to
test
new
vaccine
in
different
age
group
we
need
to
know
which
one
be
go
to
be
effective
in
old
people
and
which
one
aren
t
and
then
use
the
vaccine
accordingly
in
phase
ii
volunteer
again
undergo
health
screen
and
we
only
recruit
those
without
pre
exist
condition
so
that
we
be
only
look
at
change
in
response
to
the
vaccine
due
to
age
rather
than
age
plus
diabetes
or
cardiovascular
disorder
for
example
the
phase
iii
trial
will
include
a
much
large
number
of
people
this
time
with
no
pre
screen
for
underlie
health
condition
it
be
in
phase
iii
that
information
about
whether
the
vaccine
protects
people
against
the
disease
be
collect
in
phase
i
and
ii
we
look
at
blood
sample
to
see
whether
volunteer
be
produce
good
immune
response
but
in
phase
iii
we
look
at
whether
those
immune
response
be
actually
protective
against
disease
do
people
who
have
be
vaccinate
fall
ill
when
expose
to
the
pathogen
or
not
typically
all
three
phase
of
a
vaccine
trial
will
be
blind
randomise
placebo
control
trial
that
mean
that
half
the
volunteer
receive
the
real
vaccine
and
the
other
half
receive
a
placebo
the
volunteer
don
t
know
which
one
they
be
receive
and
nor
do
the
people
administer
the
vaccine
processing
the
record
of
adverse
event
or
carry
out
the
immunology
test
by
eventually
compare
the
data
from
the
vaccine
group
and
the
placebo
group
we
can
draw
conclusion
about
the
effect
of
the
vaccine
to
know
whether
a
vaccine
protects
people
from
disease
some
people
in
the
trial
have
to
become
infect
with
that
disease
which
can
be
problematic
as
sarah
illustrate
in
chapter
in
the
case
of
ebola
when
enough
people
have
test
positive
we
can
unblind
the
trial
meaning
we
look
at
which
vaccine
those
people
receive
if
all
the
infection
be
in
the
placebo
group
the
vaccine
be
extremely
effective
if
equal
number
have
receive
the
vaccine
and
the
placebo
then
the
vaccine
be
not
effective
in
real
life
the
number
will
be
somewhere
in
between
in
normal
time
it
take
several
year
to
progress
from
phase
i
to
phase
iii
trial
but
of
course
covid
be
different
as
in
so
many
other
area
of
this
vaccine
s
development
the
trial
team
have
to
do
all
the
work
they
would
usually
do
and
collect
all
the
safety
data
they
would
usually
collect
and
more
but
without
the
usual
long
pause
between
stage
in
fact
the
stage
overlap
this
meant
that
i
learn
a
lot
usually
by
the
time
one
of
our
vaccine
go
to
clinical
trial
my
team
have
move
onto
another
project
not
in
this
case
in
this
case
we
be
still
make
the
vaccine
while
the
trial
be
be
plan
and
carry
out
run
the
trial
at
this
pace
also
meant
that
the
team
run
the
vaccination
and
the
immunology
team
analyse
blood
sample
take
from
our
volunteer
have
to
work
phenomenally
hard
i
can
t
overstate
their
extraordinary
commitment
as
with
so
many
of
the
milestone
on
this
project
april
when
our
vaccine
be
give
to
a
person
for
the
first
time
be
both
the
culmination
of
a
huge
amount
of
work
and
the
begin
of
a
lot
more

design
clinical
trial
mean
first
of
all
answer
a
lot
of
question
who
will
our
volunteer
be
how
old
how
many
what
dose
will
we
give
them
one
dose
or
two
how
far
apart
what
will
we
measure
during
the
trial
how
long
will
the
trial
run
for
in
many
of
these
decision
be
relatively
straightforward
in
other
case
we
be
have
to
make
difficult
call
in
a
fast
move
situation
where
we
necessarily
do
not
have
full
information
some
of
these
decision
would
turn
out
to
have
significant
consequence
for
example
as
be
usual
we
start
off
test
our
vaccine
on
young
healthy
adult
we
then
widen
the
age
range
first
add
to
year
old
and
then
over
s
the
decision
to
delay
bring
old
people
into
the
trial
until
there
be
a
lot
of
safety
data
be
cautious
and
would
normally
have
be
uncontroversial
but
it
cause
us
some
problem
down
the
line
together
with
the
dramatic
effect
of
the
uk
wide
lockdown
on
disease
transmission
it
meant
that
by
the
time
old
people
have
be
fully
vaccinate
in
our
trial
case
number
be
very
low
also
old
people
be
behaving
very
cautiously
meaning
they
be
not
go
out
and
get
infect
as
a
result
very
few
volunteer
over
the
age
of
have
test
positive
for
covid
by
the
time
the
trial
report
its
result
on
november
with
hindsight
it
be
easy
to
say
that
we
should
have
include
old
people
in
the
trial
earlier
so
that
we
have
more
definitive
data
sooner
on
whether
the
vaccine
protect
old
people
but
at
the
time
we
design
the
trial
it
seem
right
from
a
safety
point
of
view
to
take
the
standard
approach
of
start
with
young
healthy
adult
and
expand
from
there
we
also
thought
a
lot
about
whether
we
would
test
one
dose
or
two
the
advantage
of
a
one
dose
vaccine
be
obvious
in
a
pandemic
we
want
to
see
rapid
protection
after
vaccination
without
have
to
wait
until
a
second
dose
be
give
we
do
start
out
planning
a
one
dose
vaccine
at
this
point
we
thought
we
be
make
an
outbreak
vaccine
to
contain
the
spread
of
disease
as
quickly
as
possible
and
we
knew
from
previous
trial
of
other
vaccine
on
the
platform
that
chadox
would
result
in
strong
immune
response
after
just
one
dose
however
we
also
give
a
small
number
of
people
in
our
phase
i
trial
two
dos
four
week
apart
why
because
we
be
scientist
and
so
our
instinct
be
to
try
to
find
thing
out
and
because
there
be
so
much
uncertainty
at
that
point
it
make
sense
to
keep
our
option
open
by
the
time
we
start
to
get
data
suggest
that
those
who
have
receive
two
dos
be
produce
a
well
immune
response
it
be
become
clear
that
covid
be
spread
very
fast
around
the
whole
world
could
possibly
reinfect
people
who
have
already
be
infect
and
be
likely
to
continue
to
circulate
for
many
year
to
come
in
these
circumstance
it
be
possible
that
have
a
highly
effective
vaccine
would
be
more
important
than
have
a
fast
act
one
we
knew
that
one
dose
be
induce
an
immune
response
but
we
could
also
see
that
the
immune
response
from
two
dos
be
well
we
didn
t
know
at
this
stage
how
strong
the
immune
response
need
to
be
to
protect
against
infection
so
rather
than
give
everybody
in
the
trial
one
dose
and
then
discover
that
efficacy
be
low
than
we
have
hop
for
we
opt
to
change
the
trial
plan
to
give
everyone
two
dos
one
benefit
of
the
fact
that
our
vaccine
be
base
on
a
platform
that
have
be
use
in
multiple
previous
trial
be
that
we
do
not
have
to
do
a
dose
escalation
study
the
first
vaccination
with
chadox
in
be
in
an
influenza
vaccine
trial
before
this
there
have
be
many
vaccine
trial
of
other
replication
deficient
adenoviral
vectored
vaccine
there
be
no
reason
to
expect
that
the
safety
profile
the
reaction
experienced
by
people
be
vaccinate
would
be
any
different
with
chadox
but
we
still
proceed
with
caution
in
this
flu
vaccine
trial
the
first
three
people
to
be
vaccinate
receive
a
dose
one
hundred
time
low
than
the
dose
we
anticipate
use
in
later
trial
this
be
not
expect
to
result
in
much
of
an
immune
response
but
be
just
to
make
sure
there
be
no
unforeseen
safety
problem
rather
than
vaccinate
all
three
on
the
same
day
only
one
person
be
vaccinate
first
they
stayed
in
the
clinic
for
an
hour
to
make
sure
there
be
no
immediate
allergic
reaction
receive
a
follow
up
phone
call
from
the
trial
doctor
the
next
day
to
check
that
all
be
well
and
then
come
back
to
the
clinic
for
a
check
up
the
day
after
that
as
there
be
no
problem
two
more
people
be
vaccinate
at
the
same
dose
and
all
of
the
safety
data
from
the
participant
diary
and
check
ups
two
week
later
be
review
before
we
be
give
permission
to
move
on
the
next
three
volunteer
be
give
a
dose
ten
time
high
so
still
ten
time
low
than
we
would
expect
to
continue
use
and
the
same
procedure
of
vaccinate
first
one
and
then
two
more
people
be
follow
a
third
group
be
give
a
dose
five
time
high
and
a
fourth
group
finally
be
give
the
full
dose
have
be
through
that
process
with
the
flu
vaccine
later
trial
of
chadox
do
not
need
to
start
from
such
a
low
dose
and
for
the
mers
vaccine
trial
in
three
different
dos
have
be
test
omit
the
very
low
one
use
in
the
influenza
vaccine
trial
for
our
covid
vaccine
chadox
ncov
have
test
multiple
chadox
vaccine
previously
and
know
that
we
need
rapid
onset
of
an
immune
response
in
a
pandemic
only
the
high
dose
be
test
we
also
knew
that
in
order
to
ass
the
vaccine
s
ability
to
protect
people
from
disease
we
would
have
to
wait
for
our
volunteer
to
catch
covid
in
the
course
of
their
normal
life
with
some
disease
such
as
malaria
or
influenza
we
can
conduct
what
we
call
challenge
trial
in
which
volunteer
be
intentionally
expose
to
the
pathogen
this
have
the
advantage
of
yield
result
very
quickly
however
at
the
time
we
be
design
the
trial
for
our
covid
vaccine
relatively
little
be
know
about
sars
cov
the
pathogen
or
covid
the
disease
the
ethical
implication
of
expose
people
to
a
dangerous
and
poorly
study
virus
with
no
know
treatment
meant
that
challenge
trial
be
for
the
time
be
off
the
table
fn
when
we
be
first
planning
the
vaccine
trial
case
in
the
uk
be
increase
and
predict
to
peak
in
may
we
thought
that
if
we
could
get
around
people
immunise
by
then
we
should
be
able
to
see
if
the
vaccine
be
work
by
as
early
as
june
but
of
course
case
in
the
uk
increase
faster
in
february
and
march
than
anyone
have
expect
first
a
university
student
and
his
mother
be
diagnose
quarantine
and
recover
without
anyone
else
become
infect
then
there
be
a
family
who
have
be
on
a
ski
holiday
in
europe
and
then
suddenly
there
be
lot
of
case
and
no
understand
of
where
they
have
come
from
the
national
lockdown
reduce
the
daily
number
of
new
case
which
be
crucial
for
protection
of
the
population
as
a
whole
but
problematic
for
our
trial
with
few
people
become
infect
we
would
still
get
our
safety
and
immune
response
data
on
the
same
timetable
but
we
would
have
to
wait
longer
for
the
data
on
efficacy
as
well
as
design
the
trial
and
get
approval
the
clinic
have
to
be
prepared
nurse
need
to
be
train
to
administer
the
vaccine
information
leaflet
and
consent
form
have
to
be
draft
and
most
importantly
our
first
volunteer
need
to
be
recruit
and
screen
trial
also
have
to
be
register
in
the
public
domain
clinicaltrials
gov
to
ensure
that
no
one
can
start
a
trial
and
then
not
report
the
finding
if
the
result
be
not
as
good
as
hop
all
this
preparation
which
of
course
would
usually
only
start
once
funding
have
be
secure
would
normally
take
at
least
six
month
when
sarah
ran
her
phase
i
clinical
trial
for
the
mers
vaccine
in
she
need
twenty
four
volunteer
and
it
take
thirty
one
week
to
recruit
and
screen
them
another
critical
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
be
need
before
we
could
start
in
human
trial
be
the
result
of
our
preclinical
study
that
be
be
perform
in
macaque
monkey
although
sarah
and
others
have
trialled
chadox
vectored
vaccine
in
people
previously
this
precise
vaccine
with
the
sars
cov

from
a
very
early
stage
richard
cornall
the
head
of
the
university
s
nuffield
department
of
medicine
have
institute
weekly
meeting
of
everyone
work
on
covid
related
research
project
the
idea
be
to
discus
finding
share
progress
and
bring
our
knowledge
to
bear
on
each
other
s
work
this
be
extremely
unusual
some
of
these
academic
be
more
use
to
compete
than
collaborate
and
i
thought
richard
s
initiative
show
great
foresight
every
week
the
zoom
call
be
full
of
up
to
fifty
people
represent
the
team
develop
the
covid
test
develop
the
covid
track
and
trace
app
run
the
recovery
trial
test
potential
covid
treatment
look
at
the
immunology
in
infect
people
understand
the
virus
protein
structure
make
antibody
do
the
genome
sequence
try
to
set
up
challenge
study
in
animal
and
so
on
i
be
sure
that
this
be
part
of
the
reason
that
the
university
of
oxford
lead
on
so
much
covid
related
research
that
year
fn
some
vaccine
have
in
the
past
cause
people
to
suffer
bad
disease
if
they
become
infect
naturally
later
on
this
have
happen
with
a
vaccine
against
respiratory
syncytial
virus
in
the
s
although
there
be
no
problem
immediately
after
vaccination
which
be
when
we
would
usually
expect
to
see
any
adverse
event
some
of
the
child
who
be
vaccinate
developed
very
severe
disease
when
they
later
encounter
the
virus
something
similar
appear
to
be
happen
with
some
attempt
to
make
a
vaccine
against
sars
although
the
vaccine
in
question
be
only
test
in
animal
the
sars
outbreak
be
contain
without
vaccine
but
even
if
it
have
not
be
a
vaccine
that
be
possibly
cause
antibody
induced
enhancement
in
animal
trial
would
not
have
be
a
good
candidate
for
far
development
a
lot
have
be
learn
about
vaccine
and
the
immune
system
since
the
s
and
we
now
understand
what
type
of
vaccine
have
the
potential
to
cause
this
kind
of
vaccine
enhance
disease
and
what
type
of
immune
response
be
involve
the
only
way
to
test
this
before
first
in
human
trial
be
to
vaccinate
and
then
deliberately
expose
animal
to
very
high
dos
of
the
coronavirus
we
thought
a
lot
about
whether
we
should
delay
the
start
of
our
human
trial
and
wait
for
the
result
of
these
animal
test
we
knew
that
every
day
count
especially
now
that
we
be
in
lockdown
because
of
fall
case
number
start
even
a
few
day
later
could
delay
our
result
by
week
sarah
and
te
have
a
high
degree
of
confidence
that
they
understood
this
issue
well
and
that
it
would
not
be
a
problem
no
vaccine
developed
on
the
chadox
platform
have
ever
cause
this
kind
of
response
include
the
very
similar
chadox
mers
vaccine
which
have
be
test
in
a
clinical
trial
on
the
other
hand
the
strong
view
be
push
by
some
at
richard
cornall
s
weekly
meeting
be
that
wait
would
provide
an
additional
layer
of
confidence
in
the
safety
of
the
vaccine
it
be
another
judgement
call
and
because
it
be
about
safety
we
err
on
the
side
of
caution
the
study
be
carry
out
by
our
collaborator
at
the
national
institute
of
health
rocky
mountain
lab
in
the
united
state
we
be
receive
frequent
update
and
have
most
of
the
result
by
the
afternoon
of
the
st
with
the
final
email
into
sarah
s
inbox
at
a
m
on
the
morning
of
the
rd
the
result
be
as
we
have
expect
base
on
all
of
our
other
study
the
vaccine
induced
the
right
kind
of
immune
response
not
the
wrong
kind
it
didn
t
cause
any
worsen
of
the
effect
of
the
virus
in
fact
the
vaccinate
animal
do
well
after
exposure
to
these
massive
dos
of
coronavirus
than
the
control
animal
this
be
already
strong
evidence
that
the
vaccine
would
prove
to
be
both
safe
and
effective

so
the
trial
and
a
whole
new
set
of
challenge
could
begin
phase
i
trial
might
typically
include
a
few
dozen
people
but
our
plan
be
to
vaccinate
about
people
with
a
single
dose
of
our
vaccine
and
with
a
single
dose
of
the
placebo
fn
again
we
start
gradually
two
people
on
the
first
day
six
on
the
third
day
then
quickly
ramp
up
from
there
until
we
be
vaccinate
around
a
hundred
people
a
day
there
be
also
a
small
group
of
ten
volunteer
who
be
give
a
second
booster
dose
twenty
eight
day
after
the
first
dose
so
that
the
team
could
ass
whether
that
improve
their
immune
response
the
start
of
our
clinical
trial
make
us
suddenly
extremely
public
property
i
be
on
lbc
andy
be
on
bbc
breakfast
and
sarah
be
on
the
andrew
marr
show
three
day
after
we
vaccinate
our
first
two
volunteer
a
false
claim
that
elisa
granato
have
die
go
viral
on
social
medium
the
completely
untrue
article
really
who
on
earth
would
use
their
time
to
make
up
something
like
that
look
credible
it
be
understandable
that
people
be
take
in
by
it
and
it
offer
a
really
good
insight
into
how
easy
it
be
to
spread
fake
news
it
be
unpleasant
for
elisa
and
her
family
and
i
be
sure
very
worry
for
the
other
volunteer
sign
up
for
the
trial
but
elisa
take
it
in
her
stride
post
on
twitter
and
then
do
an
online
interview
with
fergus
walsh
for
the
bbc
fn
people
have
post
on
her
twitter
feed
from
all
over
the
world
say
that
they
would
not
believe
she
be
still
alive
until
they
saw
her
in
a
date
stamp
interview
the
department
of
health
put
out
a
statement
too
i
wonder
what
the
person
who
create
the
fake
story
get
out
of
it
that
same
weekend
i
be
at
a
zoom
party
hopefully
in
a
couple
of
year
we
will
all
have
completely
forgotten
what
that
phrase
mean
mid
zoom
i
get
a
weird
call
from
the
university
internet
security
team
say
that
they
have
notice
unusual
activity
on
my
twitter
account
and
ask
whether
i
be
ok
be
i
feel
worried
or
threaten
i
wasn
t
because
i
don
t
really
check
twitter
that
religiously
i
have
post
a
thank
you
to
my
team
on
the
day
of
the
first
vaccination
name
them
all
in
an
attempt
to
recognise
each
person
s
effort
and
contribution
that
have
get
us
to
this
point
i
be
become
conscious
i
suppose
that
as
with
all
team
effort
there
would
be
people
who
end
up
very
visible
and
people
who
disappear
into
the
background
the
problem
be
as
the
security
team
now
gently
explain
to
me
i
wasn
t
suppose
to
name
people
fn
also
my
tweet
have
get
people
go
a
lot
of
people
have
like
it
tweet
thanks
and
congratulation
which
be
lovely
but
it
have
also
attract
some
commit
anti
vaxxers
and
then
there
be
a
small
twitter
off
as
someone
try
to
call
it
a
british
success
story
and
other
people
jumped
in
point
out
that
it
be
an
international
team
to
me
this
be
like
most
thing
more
complicate
than
a
tweet
really
allow
for
i
be
proud
of
the
international
nature
of
my
team
and
of
uk
science
in
general
diversity
of
idea
help
progress
at
the
same
time
we
all
live
and
work
in
the
uk
by
choice
and
although
i
will
not
be
happy
if
the
current
government
try
to
take
the
credit
there
be
a
lot
about
this
country
the
flexibility
and
creativity
of
the
university
the
cooperation
of
the
bioscience
industry
the
backbone
of
the
nh
that
do
contribute
to
the
success
of
the
vaccine
and
i
be
proud
of
that
however
after
a
whole
weekend
be
completely
lose
to
deal
with
the
medium
in
one
form
or
another
we
decide
we
need
a
medium
blackout
the
attention
be
all
start
to
get
a
bit
intense
and
personal
and
very
distract
we
be
vaccinate
member
of
the
public
now
and
just
need
to
focus
on
get
it
do
and
get
it
do
properly
our
volunteer
fill
in
daily
online
health
diary
for
the
first
week
after
vaccination
and
we
also
ask
them
to
record
any
other
health
issue
they
be
experience
for
a
month
and
any
serious
event
for
a
year
this
be
so
that
we
could
ass
the
vaccine
s
safety
they
also
come
back
to
the
clinic
at
interval
after
and
day
for
check
ups
and
to
give
blood
sample
so
that
we
could
study
their
immune
response
fn
this
be
where
the
immunologist
come
in
the
cell
of
your
immune
system
circulate
in
your
blood
these
be
your
white
blood
cell
as
discuss
in
chapter
this
army
of
cell
be
your
defence
mechanism
against
pathogen
and
for
the
purpose
of
understand
vaccine
there
be
two
type
that
be
the
most
important
b
cell
and
t
cell
b
cell
make
the
antibody
that
will
help
to
fight
off
future
infection
and
t
cell
can
recognise
infect
cell
that
have
be
turn
into
virus
factory
and
target
them
for
destruction
before
they
can
finish
the
job
we
already
knew
that
one
of
the
key
benefit
of
the
chadox
platform
be
that
these
type
of
vaccine
generate
both
b
cell
and
t
cell
response
give
your
immune
system
a
two
pronged
response
to
fight
infection
we
want
to
know
whether
the
chadox
ncov
vaccine
be
behaving
as
we
expect
it
to
and
generate
both
antibody
and
t
cell
the
blood
test
would
tell
us
that
each
volunteer
donate
about
three
tablespoon
of
blood
at
each
visit
which
be
split
into
a
number
of
small
tube
ready
for
a
number
of
different
test
one
test
look
at
whether
the
blood
sample
contain
antibody
able
to
bind
to
part
of
the
sars
cov
virus
a
second
ask
whether
the
antibody
could
neutralise
the
virus
and
prevent
it
from
enter
human
cell
and
a
third
look
for
the
presence
of
t
cell
even
at
this
first
phase
i
stage
the
team
in
the
immunology
lab
be
work
all
hour
as
sample
arrive
from
day
even
and
weekend
clinic
and
not
just
round
the
clock
but
against
the
clock
too
sample
have
to
be
process
within
four
hour
or
the
cell
would
start
to
die
and
the
test
would
be
void
people
be
work
in
the
lab
until
two
or
three
in
the
morning
and
up
to
ten
day
back
to
back
two
couple
make
donation
for
us
to
have
healthy
meal
deliver
to
the
site
every
day
for
month
it
make
us
feel
notice
and
support
and
more
importantly
it
stop
us
feel
hungry
the
catering
facility
be
shut
and
we
be
all
run
out
of
change
for
the
vend
machine
and
hungry
people
make
mistake
fn
we
also
receive
lot
of
colourful
picture
from
child
that
we
put
up
on
the
wall
drawing
of
the
virus
and
their
suggestion
of
how
to
beat
it
and
thanks
for
what
we
be
do
which
be
very
motivate
when
we
be
tire
and
stress
fn
morale
be
high
though
there
be
a
sense
of
purpose
and
excitement
and
enormous
goodwill
because
everyone
on
the
team
knew
their
work
be
make
a
difference
as
well
as
the
diary
and
the
blood
test
the
participant
be
also
reporting
any
covid
symptom
and
those
with
symptom
be
immediately
test
for
the
presence
of
the
virus
and
give
medical
help
if
need
if
the
test
come
back
positive
it
might
count
as
a
case
that
would
be
part
of
the
calculation
on
whether
the
vaccine
be
work
or
not
although
we
also
have
to
take
into
account
how
long
it
be
since
they
have
be
vaccinate
all
the
phase
i
vaccination
be
do
by
may
on
may
we
start
recruiting
for
our
combine
phase
ii
iii
study
and
the
follow
week
we
begin
vaccinate
people
at
eighteen
site
around
the
uk
we
do
not
yet
have
the
data
on
immune
response
for
that
we
would
have
to
wait
for
the
result
of
the
blood
test
take
at
various
interval
after
vaccination
but
we
have
enough
data
to
give
us
high
confidence
in
the
vaccine
s
safety
so
we
be
prepared
to
increase
the
pool
of
people
in
the
trial
we
start
our
phase
iii
trial
in
volunteer
age
which
be
the
population
we
have
test
in
phase
i
now
as
well
as
look
at
safety
and
immune
response
we
want
to
test
whether
the
vaccine
actually
work
do
it
stop
you
from
get
ill
with
covid
as
oppose
to
just
make
your
body
generate
the
right
kind
of
antibody
and
t
cell
at
the
same
time
we
start
expand
the
phase
ii
safety
and
immunology
trial
to
include
old
people
we
vaccinate
people
age
between
and
and
then
people
age
and
over
again
we
record
all
the
safety
data
and
the
immune
response
once
we
be
confident
that
the
vaccine
be
highly
safe
for
these
group
we
could
add
them
to
the
phase
iii
trial
as
have
be
the
case
for
the
phase
i
trial
we
have
no
problem
find
people
willing
to
offer
their
arm
to
us
there
be
people
who
saw
it
as
do
their
bit
or
a
way
to
do
something
positive
at
such
a
difficult
time
there
be
people
who
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
get
out
of
the
house
some
people
be
still
have
to
get
close
to
vulnerable
people
as
part
of
their
work
and
want
a
chance
to
be
protect
and
in
turn
protect
others
some
have
lose
family
member
to
covid
i
think
everyone
recognise
that
they
be
part
of
something
important
this
phase
ii
iii
trial
that
we
start
on
may
use
the
first
batch
of
vaccine
from
advent
the
batch
that
be
puzzle
us
because
it
be
give
us
two
different
concentration
reading
when
we
use
two
different
test
on
it
at
this
point
our
plan
be
still
to
give
people
just
one
dose
however
by
mid
june
the
immunology
data
from
the
ten
people
we
have
give
a
second
booster
dose
be
start
to
suggest
that
two
dos
would
produce
a
well
immune
response
the
people
in
this
group
have
high
level
of
antibody
and
we
be
find
similar
effect
in
study
on
mouse
ferret
and
monkey
in
early
july
we
decide
to
change
the
trial
design
and
give
everyone
two
dos
at
least
four
week
apart
everyone
who
have
originally
agree
to
receive
a
single
dose
be
contact
to
see
if
they
would
be
willing
to
have
a
second
dose
that
all
take
time
which
be
why
we
end
up
with
second
dos
be
give
at
a
variety
of
interval
this
turn
out
to
be
helpful
because
it
give
us
information
we
would
otherwise
not
have
have
about
dosage
interval
when
you
want
trial
result
as
quickly
as
possible
you
be
unlikely
to
design
in
a
twelve
week
interval
because
of
the
delay
it
build
in
it
also
lead
to
some
confusion
when
we
report
our
efficacy
data
we
originally
report
that
the
efficacy
result
be
in
the
group
of
people
receive
a
half
dose
follow
by
a
standard
dose
but
later
analysis
show
that
give
two
standard
dos
and
increase
the
interval
between
them
from
four
to
twelve
week
result
in
high
efficacy
it
be
this
not
the
low
first
dose
that
be
important
the
decision
to
switch
to
give
everyone
in
the
trial
two
dos
at
least
four
week
apart
also
meant
we
would
have
to
wait
a
lot
longer
before
we
could
expect
the
result
of
our
phase
iii
trial
for
this
part
of
the
trial
we
also
include
a
far
type
of
test
weekly
swab
volunteer
in
the
uk
be
ask
to
swab
their
nose
and
throat
every
week
even
if
they
have
no
symptom
i
don
t
know
if
you
have
ever
have
to
do
one
of
these
yourself
but
i
have
and
it
s
not
pleasant
i
guess
maybe
you
get
use
to
it
if
you
do
it
every
week
but
still
it
show
commitment
that
we
continue
to
receive
every
week
thousand
of
these
data
point
from
our
selfless
volunteer
volunteer
post
their
test
to
the
uk
national
test
lab
with
a
special
barcode
that
mark
then
as
trial
sample
and
the
data
generate
be
then
sent
to
the
trial
team
in
this
way
the
trial
be
not
only
collect
the
same
data
as
the
phase
i
trial
serious
adverse
event
from
health
diary
immune
response
from
blood
sample
and
symptomatic
covid
from
covid
test
it
be
also
building
a
picture
on
asymptomatic
case
which
be
important
for
understand
whether
the
vaccine
could
reduce
virus
transmission
as
well
as
disease
asymptomatic
infection
isn
t
a
problem
for
the
person
who
have
it
they
have
a
viral
infection
that
doesn
t
make
them
ill
unless
they
happen
to
do
a
test
they
don
t
even
know
that
they
be
infect
but
because
people
with
asymptomatic
infection
don
t
usually
know
they
be
infect
and
so
don
t
change
their
behaviour
but
be
still
infectious
this
type
of
infection
be
really
important
in
spread
the
virus
to
others
who
might
then
become
much
more
seriously
ill
if
the
vaccine
have
no
effect
on
asymptomatic
infection
the
virus
would
continue
to
circulate
in
the
population
even
if
everyone
have
be
vaccinate
since
no
vaccine
be
effective
the
virus
would
then
continue
to
make
a
small
proportion
of
people
ill
fn
also
if
the
virus
continue
to
circulate
it
will
mutate
and
could
do
so
in
a
way
that
make
it
more
transmissible
or
more
dangerous
or
more
able
to
evade
a
vaccine
the
swab
that
our
volunteer
sent
in
every
week
enable
us
to
build
up
a
picture
of
how
many
people
have
infection
and
for
how
long
and
with
what
amount
of
virus
in
their
nose
and
throat
despite
not
have
any
symptom
we
be
vaccinate
more
people
and
the
dose
schedule
have
become
more
complicate
space
at
our
little
clinic
be
become
an
issue
we
have
already
expand
the
trial
to
other
centre
in
the
uk
but
that
still
left
us
with
a
problem
in
oxford
one
day
in
june
our
building
and
facility
manager
oto
velicka
email
me
cath
be
it
ok
if
we
hook
the
new
clinic
up
to
the
cbf
s
power
supply
what
new
clinic
i
message
back
oto
suggest
i
look
out
the
window
it
be
like
something
from
a
sci
fi
movie
over
the
course
of
an
afternoon
truck
after
truck
crawl
down
the
gravel
track
perform
some
graceful
manoeuvre
and
unfurled
like
a
strange
white
flower
within
forty
eight
hour
a
fully
functional
vaccination
and
test
clinic
have
emerge
in
the
car
park
however
even
with
our
shiny
new
pop
up
clinic
there
be
no
way
that
the
team
in
oxford
could
manage
the
number
need
for
a
phase
iii
trial
also
the
case
rate
in
oxford
be
very
low
during
the
summer
of
when
these
trial
be
start
whereas
other
part
of
the
country
be
still
suffer
from
significant
level
of
infection
remember
we
need
some
people
in
the
trial
to
be
expose
to
the
virus
to
know
whether
the
vaccine
work
sarah
be
receive
lot
of
email
tell
her
to
go
to
birmingham
or
leicester
where
infection
rate
be
high
unfortunately
that
didn
t
really
help
by
the
time
we
have
set
up
recruit
volunteer
vaccinate
them
twice
and
wait
for
the
vaccine
to
induce
an
immune
response
case
rate
would
have
be
brought
down
again
we
do
though
have
the
trial
set
up
in
eighteen
site
around
the
uk
and
we
be
prioritise
healthcare
worker
who
be
more
likely
to
be
expose
to
the
virus
in
the
course
of
their
normal
life
there
have
also
always
be
plan
to
test
the
vaccine
in
other
country
the
whole
world
be
go
to
need
it
not
just
the
few
country
that
could
afford
to
pay
the
most
immune
response
can
be
influence
by
ethnicity
and
also
by
the
different
microorganism
that
people
encounter
in
their
everyday
life
in
some
country
regulator
will
not
allow
a
vaccine
to
be
use
unless
there
have
be
some
test
in
those
country
but
also
with
trial
spread
around
the
world
there
be
a
high
chance
that
at
least
one
of
them
would
be
somewhere
with
high
transmission
bad
for
the
local
population
but
good
for
the
trial
in
june
once
we
have
show
in
uk
volunteer
that
the
vaccine
be
behaving
as
expect
in
term
of
reaction
and
immune
response
we
expand
the
trial
to
brazil
and
south
africa
a
lot
of
country
have
come
forward
to
say
they
want
to
run
trial
but
we
still
have
only
limited
quantity
of
vaccine
we
chose
these
country
because
we
already
have
good
link
with
highly
professional
and
experienced
colleague
there
and
be
confident
the
trial
would
run
smoothly

i
hit
peak
stress
at
the
start
of
may
i
be
try
to
juggle
a
lot
of
problem
that
felt
out
of
my
control
and
like
many
people
i
have
have
no
physical
contact
with
another
adult
in
month
until
this
year
i
have
completely
underestimated
the
power
of
hug
i
know
my
friend
be
worried
about
me
because
they
offer
food
delivery
and
care
package
and
bunch
of
flower
start
show
up
unexplained
on
my
porch
however
over
the
summer
life
get
back
to
a
strange
version
of
normal
at
the
cbf
we
have
our
glum
day
because
there
be
a
lot
of
work
to
catch
up
on
and
we
be
still
socially
distance
and
miss
the
normal
social
interaction
that
glue
a
team
together
but
there
be
a
feel
that
thing
be
gradually
get
well
people
come
out
of
their
house
there
be
kid
lark
about
in
port
meadow
again
and
people
boat
on
the
river
while
my
daughter
ellie
and
i
be
swim
in
it
pub
be
allow
to
open
and
we
could
sit
in
small
group
in
the
garden
at
the
perch
or
the
isi
with
a
cold
beer
i
even
manage
three
steal
camp
weekend
away
though
in
each
case
this
do
involve
drive
around
to
find
a
g
signal
so
i
could
do
zoom
call
from
the
car
whilst
ellie
be
tasked
with
keep
an
eye
out
for
traffic
warden
i
love
living
in
a
city
and
can
t
be
do
without
bar
and
a
caf
to
make
me
a
good
brunch
but
i
also
love
the
feel
of
sleep
under
canvas
and
don
t
mind
if
it
s
cold
and
wet
so
long
as
there
be
a
campfire
and
some
rum
it
be
also
lovely
to
spend
some
time
just
hang
out
with
my
daughter
swim
and
eat
ice
cream
the
place
we
stayed
have
make
huge
effort
to
be
covid
secure
with
few
pitch
and
lot
of
cleaning
in
the
shower
block
as
well
as
the
camp
trip
i
take
advantage
of
eat
out
to
help
out
saw
my
mum
and
dad
for
the
first
time
in
month
and
ran
a
rule
of
six
socially
distant
mock
glastonbury
festival
across
multiple
garden
still
no
hug
though
on
july
fifty
six
day
after
the
last
of
our
phase
i
volunteer
have
be
vaccinate
the
trial
team
have
an
initial
set
of
data
on
their
immune
response
wait
for
the
immunology
result
have
felt
like
wait
for
my
a
level
result
i
knew
that
i
have
work
hard
and
i
be
pretty
sure
it
have
go
ok
but
i
just
need
to
see
the
piece
of
paper
until
then
there
be
always
that
nag
doubt
what
if
i
read
the
question
wrong
similarly
with
the
vaccine
we
knew
it
must
be
highly
safe
hundred
of
people
have
receive
it
and
if
there
have
be
any
serious
issue
the
trial
would
have
be
stop
we
have
get
strong
immune
response
when
we
have
test
the
vaccine
on
mouse
in
the
lab
we
knew
that
the
mers
vaccine
it
be
model
on
have
be
very
safe
too
and
have
induced
a
good
immune
response
so
we
have
our
expectation
but
we
just
need
to
see
the
piece
of
paper
and
the
moment
andy
show
us
the
graph
that
demonstrate
the
right
kind
of
immune
response
we
knew
we
have
pass
and
with
a
good
grade
this
be
hard
evidence
that
the
vaccine
we
have
make
actually
have
a
chance
of
work
it
be
difficult
not
to
tell
my
friend
who
be
ask
for
news
every
day
be
tight
lipped
be
not
in
my
nature
though
i
do
manage
it
when
require
which
have
be
quite
a
lot
in
the
last
year
but
within
a
few
day
the
team
have
publish
a
paper
with
their
finding
and
we
be
free
to
talk
about
it
the
paper
set
out
the
result
of
our
first
phase
i
ii
study
and
it
be
very
good
news
its
opening
line
be
in
its
own
understated
scientist
way
thrill
the
pandemic
of
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
sars
cov
might
be
curtail
by
vaccination
as
one
journalist
write
in
the
new
statesman
the
next
day
it
be
a
cautious
good
news
story
with
the
potential
to
become
such
a
good
news
story
it
almost
doesn
t
bear
think
about
there
have
be
no
serious
adverse
event
related
to
the
use
of
chadox
ncov
the
vaccine
be
very
safe
to
use
just
as
important
the
lab
test
show
that
the
blood
of
the
vaccinate
volunteer
contain
high
level
of
the
antibody
and
t
cell
that
should
help
to
fight
off
covid
and
in
the
small
group
that
have
have
a
booster
the
level
of
antibody
go
up
far
after
the
second
dose
this
be
a
strong
suggestion
that
the
vaccine
would
work
to
protect
people
against
the
disease
but
the
number
of
volunteer
who
have
get
sick
with
covid
by
this
time
be
too
small
for
us
to
be
able
to
tell
whether
that
would
truly
be
the
case
we
also
have
no
data
yet
on
immune
response
in
old
people
so
really
this
be
less
like
get
a
level
result
and
more
like
do
really
well
in
your
mock
it
bode
well
but
the
real
test
be
still
to
come
when
i
look
back
to
the
day
of
that
first
vaccination
april
it
seem
such
a
long
time
ago
we
hadn
t
yet
have
the
huge
challenge
of
the
lockdown
cycle
of
hope
and
despair
on
the
radio
i
felt
able
to
send
out
a
message
of
hope
that
the
trial
be
start
and
the
vaccine
be
come
that
even
te
sandy
and
i
get
together
for
fizzy
wine
by
zoom
as
i
write
after
an
unbelievably
hard
year
when
many
of
us
lose
love
one
before
their
time
we
be
back
to
hope
again
the
trial
have
prove
that
the
vaccine
be
very
safe
and
highly
effective
and
it
have
start
to
be
use
to
protect
our
family
and
friend
if
you
volunteer
for
this
trial
thank
you
this
be
how
scientific
progress
be
make
thank
you
too
to
volunteer
in

thank
you
to

every

build
the

every

contributes

allows

to

and

conservative
estimate
of
life
save
due
to
vaccination
million
we
don
t
often
come
into
direct
contact
with
anti
vaxxers
although
a
few
do
make
an
appearance
on
one
particularly
memorable
day
in
in
june
andy
told
me
that
we
d
be
meeting
a
very
important
visitor
the
follow
week
i
ask
andy
if
it
be
a
politician
i
be
of
course
extremely
grateful
for
the
funding
we
have
receive
from
the
uk
government
but
a
little
concerned
that
we
would
now
become
a
must
visit
destination
for
a
long
line
of
politician
want
to
drop
by
for
a
photo
opportunity
you
have
to
promise
not
to
tell
anyone
not
at
work
and
not
at
home
say
andy
it
s
prince
william
the
visit
be
exceptionally
carefully
plan
and
at
on
the
day
itself
andy
and
i
have
a
briefing
call
with
the
university
security
team
to
run
through
the
arrangement
one
last
time
security
have
receive
news
of
a
group
planning
to
stage
a
protest
against
our
vaccine
trial
that
morning
which
be
a
slight
concern
the
protestors
didn
t
know
about
the
royal
visit
of
course
and
they
be
planning
to
target
my
building
rather
than
andy
s
or
cath
s
where
it
be
actually
due
to
take
place
it
seem
they
be
be
lead
by
one
person
who
have
stag
protest
about
a
variety
of
thing
in
the
past
fracking
the
anticoronavirus
lockdown
and
covid
vaccine
every
so
often
he
would
announce
his
intention
to
stage
a
protest
on
his
facebook
page
and
invite
others
to
join
him
his
previous
one
have
be
at
another
of
our
clinical
trial
site
and
have
be
a
slight
irritation
rather
than
a
security
risk
he
be
apparently
ask
why
we
be
vaccinate
child
even
though
we
weren
t
security
be
not
expect
a
very
large
crowd
for
the
protest
and
my
office
look
out
over
the
front
of
the
building
so
i
suggest
that
i
could
just
check
for
any
protestors
by
look
out
of
the
window
before
set
off
to
meet
the
prince
if
necessary
we
could
leave
by
another
exit
and
walk
the
long
way
round
the
security
team
be
not
entirely
happy
with
that
plan
but
we
agree
to
speak
if
there
seem
to
be
a
problem
when
it
be
time
to
leave
te
and
i
have
a
good
look
out
of
the
window
it
be
a
glorious
june
day
lovely
weather
for
a
protest
there
be
no
one
directly
outside
but
a
bit
far
along
a
bunch
of
men
in
dark
jacket
be
stand
around
a
car
look
shifty
te
point
out
that
that
be
actually
the
university
security
team
so
we
left
by
the
front
entrance
and
head
over
to
the
clinical
centre
first
stop
be
the
ppe
station
where
we
sanitise
our
hand
and
put
on
surgical
mask
it
be
the
first
time
i
have
worn
a
mask
in
my
building
at
that
point
we
be
rely
on
social
distance
achieve
via
very
low
staff
number
but
at
the
clinic
and
cbf
they
have
need
to
implement
strict
ppe
protocol
early
on
because
of
all
the
trial
volunteer
come
in
to
that
part
of
the
campus
it
take
me
longer
than
i
expect
to
put
it
on
and
adjust
it
to
fit
well
around
my
nose
a
few
month
later
it
have
become
second
nature
to
put
on
a
mask
before
enter
my
building
and
every
time
i
left
my
office
andy
and
i
be
go
to
be
have
a
chat
with
the
prince
that
would
be
film
in
a
fairly
unglamorous
meeting
room
on
the
ground
floor
fn
after
introduction
but
no
handshake
the
three
of
us
sat
down
it
be
a
slightly
odd
experience
the
three
of
us
sit
in
a
row
two
metre
apart
be
film
but
it
probably
wasn
t
the
odd
thing
that
happen
that
year
and
prince
william
be
well
inform
and
seem
genuinely
interested
and
supportive
afterwards
i
stayed
in
the
meeting
room
and
andy
lead
the
way
to
the
cbf
cath
told
me
later
that
six
minute
have
be
assign
for
a
tour
of
her
clean
room
where
the
vaccine
be
make
the
prince
be
a
good
sport
about
do
introduction
and
then
get
himself
sign
in
into
clean
room
clothes
overshoe
gown
glove
through
the
airlock
into
the
clean
room
and
back
out
again
in
the
allot
time
all
while
retain
everybody
s
name
then
it
be
on
to
the
mobile
clinic
to
drop
in
on
some
people
who
be
be
vaccinate
upstairs
to
the
lab
to
meet
te
and
member
of
the
lab
team
and
then
to
another
odd
look
event
that
i
be
able
to
glimpse
through
the
slat
of
the
meeting
room
blind
prince
william
be
stand
in
the
courtyard
in
a
marked
square
on
the
grass
face
and
chat
to
four
member
of
our
team
each
also
in
their
marked
square
other
people
be
watch
from
the
edge
of
the
courtyard
all
smile
broadly
the
whole
thing
be
a
great
morale
boost
for
the
team
i
later
found
out
that
a
few
protestors
have
turn
up
at
my
building
and
shout
a
bit
but
they
have
arrive
shout
and
left
all
during
the
time
i
be
at
the
clinic
if
they
watch
the
news
that
even
they
would
have
see
that
only
a
few
hundred
yard
away
from
their
anti
vaccine
protest
prince
william
s
supportive
visit
to
the
vaccine
centre
be
take
place
they
must
have
be
kick
themselves

i
don
t
understand
anti
vaxxers
why
would
anyone
be
ideologically
oppose
to
a
safe
and
cost
effective
public
health
measure
that
save
million
of
life
and
stop
people
from
have
to
live
with
the
long
term
disability
that
can
be
cause
by
disease
such
as
polio
and
smallpox
and
it
seem
covid
but
there
will
always
be
people
with
strange
belief
who
stick
to
them
come
what
may
anti
vaxxers
who
be
actually
a
pretty
small
if
noisy
group
only
become
a
problem
if
they
try
to
interfere
with
other
people
s
acceptance
of
vaccine
vaccine
hesitancy
however
be
a
different
matter
it
be
natural
that
people
want
to
understand
the
risk
and
benefit
of
vaccine
and
important
that
as
scientist
we
engage
with
their
concern
it
have
be
very
common
over
the
last
year
or
so
to
read
or
hear
thing
like
we
don
t
know
what
s
in
it
or
be
it
go
to
change
my
dna
or
it
feel
like
it
s
be
rush
and
that
make
me
uncomfortable
or
i
ll
take
my
chance
with
the
virus
thanks
when
i
catch
myself
bristling
at
yet
another
question
or
comment
that
implies
i
and
my
colleague
be
up
to
no
good
in
some
way
or
conduct
poor
science
i
try
to
remember
that
there
be
a
history
that
even
if
people
do
not
remember
the
detail
informs
these
concern
when
maurice
hilleman
developed
his
mumps
vaccine
in
record
break
time
for
example
in
the
s
he
do
some
thing
that
we
would
consider
at
best
ethically
questionable
today
mumps
be
generally
a
fairly
mild
disease
in
otherwise
healthy
child
but
it
can
sometimes
cause
meningitis
result
in
seizure
paralysis
and
deafness
or
infect
the
pancreas
and
cause
diabetes
it
can
also
cause
birth
defect
if
pregnant
woman
be
infect
hilleman
conduct
the
first
clinical
trial
of
his
vaccine
on
sixteen
child
at
a
home
for
child
with
learn
disability
he
go
on
to
test
it
at
another
child
s
home
and
then
on
hundred
of
child
in
nursery
school
and
kindergarten
in
philadelphia
where
he
be
base
today
we
would
always
test
vaccine
in
animal
before
test
them
in
human
and
in
adult
before
test
them
in
child
we
also
ensure
we
have
the
inform
consent
of
everyone
participate
in
a
trial
or
if
they
be
child
the
consent
of
their
parent
or
guardian
which
be
not
obtain
for
the
child
in
hilleman
s
first
trial
this
be
not
the
only
example
of
people
be
use
in
medical
research
without
their
knowledge
or
consent
the
infamous
tuskegee
experiment
in
the
united
state
recruit
african
american
men
into
a
study
and
told
them
they
would
receive
free
healthcare
the
study
last
forty
year
from
to
the
real
purpose
of
the
experiment
be
to
observe
the
course
of
untreated
syphilis
infection
in
the
men
of
whom
two
third
be
select
for
the
study
because
they
have
latent
meaning
currently
asymptomatic
syphilis
infection
the
men
be
not
told
of
their
diagnosis
and
be
never
treat
with
antibiotic
which
be
widely
available
by
during
the

the

either

rather
than

there
be
no

of

the

be
vaccinate

as
with
the

they

therefore
never
spread
through
the

and
cause
infection
and
disease
as
cath
describes
in

and
the
manufacturing
process
be
tightly
control
and
all
raw

be
test
before
the

a

there
be
an

here
those

that
it

reasonable
for

involve
child
there
be
separate
information
sheet
for

child
and
sometimes
different
sheet
for
child
of
different
age
child
may
be
ask
to
assent
meaning
they
have
a
say
have
be
give
some
information
they
can

but
parent
can
still
refuse
permission
give
them
the
final
say
for
more
complex
study
such
as
malaria
vaccination
challenge
study
in
which
volunteer
be
deliberately
infect
with
malaria
to
find
out
if
the
vaccine
protects
them
there
be
a
questionnaire
for
the
volunteer
to
take
to
find
out
whether
they
have
understood
the
information
they
have
be
give
it
be
a
key
requirement
of
those
study
for
the
volunteer
to
come
to
the
vaccination
clinic
twice
every
day
after
they
have
be
infect
so
that
they
can
be
closely
monitor
and
then
treat
with
anti
malarial
drug
when
necessary
fail
to
understand
that
could
be
dangerous
and
so
researcher
will
only
accept
someone
onto
the
trial
if
they
be
confident
they
have
understood
the

anyone

they

information
about
their
safe
use
in
non

woman
and
in
men
the
next
step
be
to
conduct
developmental

reproductive
toxicology
dart
study
in
animal
vaccinate
either
before

or
soon
after

require

for
the
duration
of

study
and
be
test
before
each
vaccination
to
make
sure
that
they
be
not
pregnant
after
vaccine
safety
have
be
demonstrate
in
the
general
population
and
the
dart
study
have
be
complete
a
separate
study
in
pregnant
woman
will
be
conduct
before
the
vaccine
be
recommend
for
use
in
pregnant
woman
generally
of
course
there
be
many
vaccine
that
be
safe
for
use
and
recommend
for
use
in
pregnant
woman
but
this
be
something
that
be
carefully
assess
rather
than
assume
nonetheless
and
even
with
everything
that
have
be
do
to
address
and
avoid
the
mistake
of
the
past
it
remains
the
case
that
nothing
in
life
be
risk
free
and
so
when
decide
whether
to
receive
a
vaccine
as
with
everything
else
in
life
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
benefit
outweigh
the
risk
unfortunately
it
be
also
the
case
that
as
human
being
we
be
just
not
good
at
understand
different
level
of
risk
we
tend
either
to
think
thing
be
very
worry
or
to
believe
that
they
be
absolutely
fine
when
in
fact
nothing
we
do
or
fail
to
do
be
risk
free
and
most
thing
be
somewhere
in
between
for
example
many
people
would
not
go
out
pick
wild
mushroom
for
dinner
in
case
they
picked
a
poisonous
one
very
worry
a
death
angel
be
an
innocuous
look
white
mushroom
that
can
cause
liver
failure
and
death
but
many
of
the
same
people
would
give
no
thought
at
all
to
eat
a
wild
mushroom
risotto
at
a
restaurant
absolutely
fine
in
fact
though
the
restaurant
be
less
risky
it
be
not
risk
free
do
the
restaurant
test
each
batch
of
mushroom
for
toxicity
be
they
from
the
same
supplier
every
week
what
happens
when
the
expert
forager
go
on
holiday
and
leaf
someone
else
to
do
the
pick
for
a
week
both
pick
our
own
and
trust
someone
else
be
somewhat
risky
we
face
the
non
zero
risk
of
be
injured
or
kill
every
time
we
leave
our
home
but
because
the
benefit
of
leave
the
house
be
so
great
we
tend
not
to
spend
much
time
think
about
or
try
to
calculate
these
risk
absolutely
fine
plus
there
be
also
risk
to
stay
in
the
house
a
plane
might
crash
into
the
bedroom
window
or
more
likely
a
candle
might
start
a
house
fire
we
also
tend
to
overestimate
risk
of
thing
that
be
rare
but
dramatic
like
plane
crash
and
underestimate
the
risk
of
thing
that
be
so
common
that
they
tend
not
to
feature
in
the
news
like
car
crash
whether
you
measure
it
by
distance
travel
or
hour
spent
on
the
journey
travel
be
much
safer
by
air
or
bus
and
rail
than
in
a
car
a
logical
but
exhaust
approach
would
be
to
ass
the
risk
and
benefit
of
every
one
of
our
action
or
inaction
and
then
reduce
the
bad
risk
as
much
as
possible
ideally
without
lose
the
benefit
to
conduct
a
thorough
risk
assessment
we
need
to
think
about
both
the
severity
and
the
likelihood
of
an
event
a
freak
occurrence
like
a
plane
crash
through
the
bedroom
window
be
high
on
severity
but
low
on
likelihood
since
it
be
very
rare
and
also
there
be
nothing
we
can
do
to
make
the
already
tiny
risk
small
we
shouldn
t
spend
any
time
think
about
it
and
certainly
shouldn
t
avoid
sleep
in
the
bedroom
in
order
to
mitigate
the
risk
get
stung
by
a
wasp
in
the
garden
now
and
again
be
highly
likely
but
for
most
of
us
not
very
severe
again
we
probably
shouldn
t
spend
time
worry
about
it
and
should
just
enjoy
time
in
the
garden
if
we
know
we
be
allergic
to
wasp
though
we
should
make
sure
we
have
an
epipen
to
hand
a
car
crash
be
go
to
be
somewhat
severe
and
somewhat
likely
in
this
case
it
be
worth
be
aware
of
and
try
to
reduce
the
risk
for
example
by
keep
the
vehicle
properly
maintain
wear
a
seat
belt
not
drinking
and
drive
or
use
your
phone
and
obey
the
rule
of
the
road
this
will
reduce
the
risk
but
not
remove
it
completely
because
of
other
road
user
accident
can
still
happen
to
highly
competent
driver
in
well
function
car
most
of
us
will
nonetheless
sometimes
opt
to
put
ourselves
and
our
child
in
car
because
of
the
benefit
they
bring
when
do
our
own
personal
risk
assessment
on
a
vaccine
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
a
great
deal
of
risk
reduction
have
already
take
place
every
stage
of
the
process
be
tightly
regulate
the
raw
material
we
use
be
from
supplier
work
to
specific
quality
standard
but
be
test
again
once
receive
at
the
manufacturing
facility
the
facility
itself
must
satisfy
many
requirement
and
be
periodically
inspect
by
regulator
who
also
want
to
know
about
all
of
the
manufacturing
procedure
that
be
use
and
how
the
staff
have
be
train
trial
take
place
first
in

then
in
small

there

increase
number
of
adult
to
ensure
the
vaccine
be
highly
safe
before
they
can
be
license
we
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
not
all
vaccine
be
the
same
one
common
misconception
around
vaccine
be
that
they
all
contain
lot
of
thing
that
we
would
not
want
inject
into
us
in
the
past
i
have
found
it
frustrate
when
try
to
address
these
concern
that
some
people
lump
all
vaccine
together
for
example
my
brother
in
law
contact
me
to
say
his
friend
be
hesitant
to
have
the
flu
vaccine
because
she
have
say
of
course
it
contains
mercury
this
be
not
true
many
year
ago
when
flu
vaccine
be
often
put
into
multi
dose
vial
they
sometimes
contain
thiomersal
a
mercury
base
preservative
if
bacteria
be
accidentally
introduce
when
the
vial
be
first
use
the
thiomersal
would
kill
them
and
prevent
them
from
be
inject
into
anyone
receive
a
later
dose
from
the
same
vial
however
thiomersal
have
not
be
use
in
the
uk
for
many
year
none
of
the
vaccine
in
routine
use
in
the
uk
or
europe
or
the
us
contain
thiomersal
even
when
they
do
the
amount
be
tiny
and
the
mercury
be
in
a
form
that
be
quickly
excrete
thanks
to
the
medium
interest
in
different
kind
of
covid
vaccine
i
hope
it
be
perhaps
now
clearer
that
there
be
many
approach
to
make
vaccine
and
as
a
result
different
vaccine
will
have
different
ingredient
you
can
easily
find
out
what
ingredient
be
in
any
vaccine
you
be
concerned
about
because
every
vaccine
be
accompany
by
a
summary
of
product
characteristic
sheet
that
set
out
among
other
thing
exactly
what
be
in
it
you
can
find
them
by
search
online
and
for
our
oxford
vaccine
you
can
turn
to
the
back
of
this
book
and
find
an
annotate
ingredient
list
fn
many
vaccine
ingredient
might
look
unfamiliar
but
be
in
fact
substance
that
be
found
naturally
in
the
body
all
be
present
in
extremely
small
quantity
a
few
thousandth
of
a
gram
or
less
and
other
than
for
people
with
severe
allergy
there
be
no
evidence
that
any
of
them
cause
any
harm
in
these
amount
there
be
a
very
small
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
oxford
astrazeneca
vaccine
at
around
the
same
level
that
be
found
in
some
natural
food
the
british
islamic
medical
association
statement
on
the
vaccine
say
this
be
not
enough
to
cause
any
noticeable
effect
and
have
be
described
as
negligible
by
muslim
scholar
when
covid
vaccine
begin
to
become
available
there
be
message
circulate
on
social
medium
say
that
they
contain
substance
derive
from
pork
or
beef
and
that
they
be
therefore
not
suitable
for
muslim
or
hindu
this
be
not
true
just
as
the
claim
that
flu
vaccine
contain
mercury
be
not
true
but
message
from
friend
be
generally
trust
and
pass
on
and
the
correct
information
be
not
often
sought
out
it
take
far
social
medium
campaign
to
convince
people
that
there
be
no
basis
for
these
claim
it
can
be
hard
to
shift
someone
s
long
held
view
even
if
it
be
wrong
i
sent
my
brother
in
law
the
ingredient
list
for
the
flu
vaccine
his
friend
be
concerned
about
for
him
to
pas
on
but
i
wonder
whether
that
will
have
change
his
friend
s
mind
perhaps
she
found
it
hard
to
accept
that
she
have
be
make
an
incorrect
assumption
for
year
perhaps
she
take
offence
at
be
told
she
be
wrong
she
felt
she
knew
there
be
mercury
in
flu
vaccine
there
isn
t
and
that
this
be
harmful
because
it
be
toxic
and
built
up
over
time
the
form
that
use
to
be
use
in
some
vaccine
doesn
t
do
this
however
aside
from
mistaken
worry
base
on
incorrect
information
there
be
three
kind
of
risk
we
do
need
to
consider
and
weigh
up
when
it
come
to
vaccine
first
not
all
vaccine
be
safe
for
everyone
some
vaccine
be
not
advise
for
specific
group
of
people
for
example
some
vaccine
use
weaken
version
of
the
pathogen
itself
or
of
a
closely
related
organism
they
include
the
bcg
vaccine
use
to
prevent
tuberculosis
and
the
mmr
vaccine
against
measles
mumps
and
rubella
vaccine
make
this
way
be
know
as
live
attenuate
vaccine
but
now
that
more
type
of
vaccine
be
be
brought
into
use
it
would
be
more
helpful
to
describe
them
as
live
attenuate
replication
competent
vaccine
these
vaccine
spread
within
the
body
after
vaccination
they
do
not
cause
disease
in
a
healthy
person
and
the
immune
response
that
the
body
make
to
quickly
control
the
infection
be
what
result
in
the
formation
of
immune
memory
that
can
then
protect
against
the
pathogen
itself
however
in
people
with
severely
compromise
immune
system
when
the
vaccine
start
to
spread
through
the
body
the
immune
system
be
unable
to
control
it
and
the
infection
may
become
serious
or
even
fatal
these
vaccine
be
therefore
not
use
in
certain
group
of
people
for
example
people
with
hiv
or
people
undergo
chemotherapy
by
contrast
chadox
vectored
vaccine
be
live
but
be
replication
deficient
the
adenoviral
vector
infects
cell
in
the
body
soon
after
vaccination
and
instructs
the
cell
to
produce
the
sars
cov
spike
protein
and
then
it
have
do
its
job
it
be
not
able
to
make
any
more
copy
of
itself
and
cannot
spread
through
the
body
even
if
the
person
be
vaccinate
have
no
function
immune
system
even
severely
immunosuppressed
people
can
take
the
chadox
vectored
vaccine
with
no
risk
of
uncontrolled
infection
mrna
vaccine
like
the
pfizer
biontech
and
moderna
vaccine
be
not
live
they
be
briefly
present
in
some
cell
in
the
body
but
cannot
spread
fn
some
people
have
express
concern
that
the
vaccine
could
permanently
change
their
dna
but
this
be
not
true
the
mrna
use
in
the
vaccine
never
enters
the
cell
s
nucleus
which
be
where
your
dna
be
kept
and
the
cell
break
it
down
and
get
rid
of
it
once
it
have
use
it
another
group
of
people
for
whom
not
all
vaccine
be
safe
be
those
with
some
type
of
severe
allergy
some
influenza
vaccine
for
example
be
produce
in
chicken
egg
and
therefore
contain
tiny
amount
of
egg
protein
this
can
cause
an
allergic
or
even
anaphylactic
reaction
in
people
who
be
severely
allergic
to
egg
people
with
allergy
to
egg
or
antibiotic
should
always
ask
about
the
presence
of
trace
quantity
of
these
in
any
vaccine
they
take
neither
be
present
in
the
oxford
astrazeneca
vaccine
there
be
usually
an
alternative
that
can
be
offer
on
the
first
day
of
the
roll
out
of
the
pfizer
biontech
vaccine
two
healthcare
worker
who
have
be
vaccinate
suffer
allergic
reaction
both
of
them
have
know
allergy
and
carry
epipens
fn
this
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
happen
when
a
vaccine
that
have
only
be
use
in
clinical
trial
in
which
people
with
severe
allergy
be
exclude
be
then
use
in
a
much
wider
population
as
a
result
the
mhra
say
that
people
with
know
severe
allergy
should
not
receive
the
pfizer
vaccine
and
all
others
should
be
observe
for
fifteen
minute
after
vaccination
and
as
already
discuss
vaccine
should
not
be
give
to
pregnant
woman
until
appropriate
trial
have
be
conduct
an
exception
would
be
when
there
be
a
high
risk
of
infection
in
this
case
there
should
be
a
discussion
about
the
risk
and
benefit
for
that
individual
there
be
low
take
up
of
covid
vaccine
amongst
people
from
some
ethnic
minority
background
the
reason
be
complex
and
it
be
important
not
to
be
simplistic
in
assign
reason
for
vaccine
hesitancy
to
large
and
diverse
group
of
people
however
in
a
review
of
vaccine
acceptance
in
the
uk
one
of
the
concern
raise
be
that
vaccine
might
not
have
be
test
in
people
from
different
ethnic
minority
lead
to
fear
that
vaccine
have
be
developed
for
one
enthnic
group
and
might
not
be
safe
or
effective
for
others
it
be
important
for
that
reason
that
clinical
trial
of
vaccine
do
include
people
from
a
range
of
different
ethnic
background
this
be
address
in
the
sars
cov
vaccine
trial
that
take
place
in
and
the
second
kind
of
risk
to
consider
be
that
vaccine
have
side
effect
most
side
effect
or
adverse
event
be
mild
occur
very
soon
after
vaccination
and
be
over
within
a
few
day
these
sore
arm
a
fever
fatigue
headache
will
be
picked
up
during
clinical
trial
and
fully
document
more
severe
adverse
event
also
tend
to
occur
soon
after
vaccination
if
at
all
and
also
will
be
picked
up
in
a
trial
at
that
point
the
trial
may
be
pause
while
the
event
be
investigate
follow
thorough
investigation
the
trial
may
be
stop
completely
it
may
be
start
but
only
for
certain
group
of
people
or
it
may
continue
but
there
be
also
a
possibility
of
some
very
rare
side
effect
which
because
they
be
so
rare
do
not
occur
during
the
trial
and
be
only
identify
after
million
of
people
have
be
vaccinate
this
be
true
of
the
h
n
influenza
vaccine
produce
for
the
swine
flu
pandemic
of
study
eventually
show
that
the
vaccine
be
likely
to
have
be
responsible
for
three
case
of
narcolepsy
a
chronic
sleep
disorder
where
people
fall
asleep
at
inappropriate
time
for
every
child
and
young
people
vaccinate
in
northern
europe
the
effect
wasn
t
found
in
the
rest
of
the
world
because
narcolepsy
be
induced
only
in
those
with
a
particular
gene
that
be
more
common
in
northern
europe
no
phase
iii
trial
would
ever
have
be
large
enough
to
detect
that
effect
once
a
vaccine
be
license
and
use
widely
there
be
a
safety
reporting
scheme
which
do
then
pick
up
very
rare
problem
and
take
the
necessary
action
this
be
what
happen
in
march
and
april
when
report
start
emerge
of
a
very
small
number
of
people
develop
a
rare
type
of
blood
clot
soon
after
be
vaccinate
with
covid
vaccine
it
be
possible
that
these
blood
clot
have
be
cause
by
the
vaccine
but
it
could
not
immediately
be
establish
for
certain
because
these
event
be
so
rare
and
could
occur
naturally
even
if
vaccination
hadn
t
happen
it
be
very
difficult
to
understand
what
be
go
on
and
why
fn
what
be
clear
be
that
the
risk
if
there
be
one
be
vanishingly
small
indeed
it
be
know
that
a
confirm
risk
of
a
fatal
blood
clot
from
a
common
drug
that
people
take
for
year
at
a
time
the
contraceptive
pill
be
much
high
the
risk
of
a
fatal
blood
clot
after
be
infect
with
covid
be
much
much
high
regulator
and
policymakers
in
the
uk
and
elsewhere
take
the
new
information
about
these
very
rare
event
and
carefully
consider
the
implication
they
have
to
take
into
account
not
only
the
potential
risk
from
the
vaccine
but
also
its
know
benefit
or
to
put
it
another
way
the
risk
of
take
the
vaccine
and
the
risk
of
deprive
people
of
it
these
varied
depend
on
circumstance
for
example
how
much
virus
be
circulate
the
more
virus
circulate
the
high
the
risk
of
catch
covid
and
so
the
great
the
benefit
of
a
vaccine
what
age
group
be
be
consider
the
old
the
person
the
high
the
risk
from
covid
and
so
the
great
the
benefit
of
a
vaccine
and
be
there
alternative
vaccine
available
to
use
be
the
decision
this
vaccine
or
no
vaccine
or
be
it
this
vaccine
or
another
vaccine
both
the
uk
and
the
eu
regulator
say
that
the
risk
benefit
be
hugely
in
favour
of
continue
to
use
the
vaccine
sars
cov
have
dealt
the
world
a
terrible
blow
with
million
of
death
so
far
and
continue
misery
for
those
suffer
from
long
covid
that
we
be
only
just
start
to
understand
and
vaccine
be
our
way
out
lockdown
could
reduce
infection
but
come
with
their
own
cost
to
people
s
health
and
well
be
case
number
be
still
rise
in
europe
latin
america
and
south
asia
covid
be
still
kill
one
in
every
people
infect
and
the
vaccine
that
protect
against
it
be
do
vastly
more
good
than
harm
the
day
after
the
mhra
announce
that
nineteen
people
have
die
from
rare
blood
clot
in
the
uk
that
might
have
be
due
to
vaccination
the
late
analysis
show
that
vaccination
in
the
uk
be
save
hundred
of
life
every
day
the
more
difficult
analysis
be
whether
the
risk
benefit
remain
clear
for
all
part
of
the
population
and
in
every
country
in
early
april
base
on
a
calculation
that
there
might
be
a
in
chance
of
develop
a
rare
blood
clot
after
vaccination
and
a
in
million
chance
of
die
from
it
the
same
risk
as
drive
mile
in
a
car
the
uk
decide
to
offer
an
alternative
vaccine
to
adult
under
the
reason
be
not
that
the
risk
to
under
s
be
high
it
be
that
the
benefit
of
the
vaccine
to
this
age
group
who
be
much
less
likely
than
old
people
to
die
from
covid
be
low
particularly
now
that
there
be
low
case
rate
and
alternative
vaccine
available
fn
trial
of
the
vaccine
on
child
be
also
pause
not
because
of
any
specific
safety
concern
but
on
the
basis
that
this
would
allow
time
for
far
information
about
safety
in
adult
to
be
assess
and
advice
be
provide
about
symptom
of
these
very
rare
blood
clot
so
that
anyone
experience
symptom
could
alert
their
doctor
and
receive
treatment
as
circumstance
change
and
as
we
learn
more
about
these
rare
blood
clot
event
it
may
be
that
far
adjustment
need
to
be
make
i
cycle
to
work
every
day
on
a
route
that
i
consider
to
be
safe
however
for
the
past
few
month
this
route
have
take
me
past
a
white
paint
bike
mark
the
spot
where
a
young
woman
cyclist
be
kill
in
a
collision
with
a
bin
lorry
even
know
about
this
distress
event
i
continue
to
cycle
to
work
and
my
child
also
often
cycle
that
route
for
me
the
benefit
to
my
health
and
my
mood
and
to
my
ability
to
get
where
i
want
outweigh
the
very
small
risk
of
death
as
circumstance
change
though
so
do
my
risk
assessment
when
it
be
icy
i
walk
or
drive
instead
when
there
be
snow
i
walk
rare
and
dramatic
event
like
blood
clot
or
plane
crash
can
make
people
very
worried
but
as
discuss
above
nothing
in
life
can
ever
be
completely
risk
free
not
even
sit
quietly
in
your
house
do
nothing
the
final
theoretical
safety
concern
be
that
some
vaccine
have
result
in
a
severe
form
of
the
disease
when
the
vaccinate
person
be
later
expose
to
the
pathogen
as
discuss
in
chapter
now
that
scientist
know
about
this
concern
and
understand
what
kind
of
immune
response
be
involve
we
be
able
to
conduct
preclinical
animal
trial
to
ass
this
risk
we
cannot
however
be
absolutely
certain
that
we
have
rule
it
out
in
human
until
some
of
the
volunteer
who
have
be
vaccinate
have
be
expose
to
the
virus
as
part
of
their
normal
life
thanks
to
the
very
large
phase
iii
trial
that
we
have
carry
out
that
too
have
now
be
thoroughly
study
all
of
those
people
on
our
trial
who
receive
the
vaccine
but
still
become
infect
which
happen
on
all
the
trial
because
no
vaccine
be
effective
experienced
only
mild
disease
take
a
vaccine
be
not
risk
free
because
nothing
be
but
not
take
a
vaccine
be
also
not
risk
free
you
risk
get
the
disease
yourself
and
also
passing
it
on
to
others
many
people
face
with
all
the
difficulty
weigh
up
these
risk
prefer
to
trust
their
healthcare
professional
that
be
a
very
reasonable
approach
the
regulatory
authority
when
decide
whether
to
approve
a
vaccine
for
general
use
or
in
a
pandemic
for
initial
emergency
use
will
have
do
their
own
very
thorough
risk
benefit
analysis
and
provide
comprehensive
guidance
to
healthcare
professional
include
about
whether
there
be
particular
risk
or
benefit
for
particular
group
of
people
such
as
the
elderly
or
the
young
pregnant
woman
or
people
with
severe
allergy
the
expert
will
continue
to
update
their
analysis
and
guidance
as
new
information
becomes
available
for
example
in
relation
to
rare
side
effect
others
decide
to
find
out
more
for
themselves
that
be
also
a
very
reasonable
approach
but
if
you
be
go
to
do
this
think
about
where
your
information
be
come
from
if
you
volunteer
to
take
part
in
a
vaccine
clinical
trial
all
of
the
information
that
be
give
to
you
will
have
be
carefully
checked
and
approve
by
the
regulatory
authority
and
an
ethic
committee
who
be
qualify
to
check
both
the
information
and
the
way
it
be
present
if
you
search
for
a
summary
of
product
characteristic
sheet
online
the
document
you
will
find
describe
a
give
vaccine
its
risk
and
benefit
and
who
should
not
take
it
will
be
long
and
tedious
but
it
will
have
be
approve
by
the
regulator
with
every
statement
review
and
verify
it
will
never
of
course
simply
say
this
vaccine
be
completely
safe
because
to
labour
the
point
absolutely
nothing
be
next
time
you
take
paracetamol
have
a
good
look
at
the
information
sheet
provide
in
every
pack
there
be
a
long
list
of
risk
document
there
fn
but
most
of
us
rarely
even
unfold
the
piece
of
paper
if
you
rely
on
friend
and
family
or
social
medium
instead
for
your
information
there
be
no
tell
what
you
will
find
when
the
information
come
from
someone
we
know
and
who
we
think
have
our
best
interest
at
heart
or
whose
other
view
we
respect
we
might
be
tempt
to
accept
it
without
question
it
even
to
send
it
on
to
all
of
our
friend
and
family
but
it
be
always
worth
ask
where
their
information
come
from
and
then
make
your
own
assessment
there
be
virtually
no
check
on
what
people
can
say
on
social
medium
some
people
will
post
misinformation
in
good
faith
genuinely
believe
they
be
right
we
have
all
probably
receive
this
kind
of
thing
from
well
meaning
friend
and
family
member
others
often
celebrity
or
influencers
with
big
following
do
so
because
they
be
paid
to
or
be
after
click
still
others
sometimes
hostile
state
or
their
proxy
maliciously
post
false
information
to
deliberately
confuse
and
mislead
people
one
group
of
people
who
may
be
act
in
good
faith
but
be
wrong
about
vaccine
be
those
who
promote
natural
immunity
not
all
natural
therapy
be
dangerous
or
without
value
exercise
and
a
well
diet
will
often
be
of
benefit
to
people
present
with
say
a
kidney
problem
or
a
bad
knee
breathing
exercise
and
talk
therapy
can
be
good
for
mental
health
but
natural
health
do
not
provide
all
the
solution
to
treat
or
prevent
illness
aromatherapy
massage
may

offer
to
cancer
patient

chemotherapy
and
they
can
provide
pain
relief
by
trigger
pleasant
sense

and
promote
relaxation
but
it
be
the
chemotherapy
that

provide
the
cure
not
the
massage
vaccine
may
be
dismiss
by
proponent
of
natural
health
as
be
non
natural
unfortunately
the
only
way
to
naturally
gain
immunity
to
an
infectious
disease
be
to
become
infect
with
that
specific
disease
and
that
be
not
necessarily
a
safe
thing
to
do
maintain
our
general
health
include
a
function
immune
system
be
a
worthy
aim
but
we
cannot
develop
the
specific
immunity
need
to
protect
us
from
an
individual
pathogen
without
either
be
infect
with
it
or
be
vaccinate
against
it
another
message
do
the
round
on
social
medium
in
and
be
that
covid
vaccine
would
cause
infertility
this
be
sometimes
back
up
by
a
quasi
scientific
sound
claim
that
the
covid
spike
protein
be
similar
to
a
protein
found
on
the
placenta
and
that
antibody
against
the
spike
protein
would
therefore
also
attack
the
placenta
result
in
infertility
there
be
no
ground
for
this
claim
to
think
through
its
implication
if
it
be
true
any
woman
infect
with
sars
cov
would
develop
antibody
to
the
spike
protein
and
become
infertile
this
have
not
happen
there
be
also
four
other
coronaviruses
that
infect
human
circulate
mainly
in
the
winter
month
each
with
their
own
spike
protein
there
be
no
evidence
that
infection
with
these
seasonal
coronaviruses
result
in
infertility
as
be
standard
practice
we
ask
all
woman
of
childbearing
age
to
use
effective
contraception
during
our
trial
and
then
test
them
before
each
vaccination
to
make
sure
that
they
be
not
pregnant
we
therefore
do
not
expect
any
pregnancy
in
our
trial
participant
and
do
not
expect
to
be
able
to
get
any
information
from
our
trial
about
the
effect
of
the
vaccine
on
fertility
however
because
real
life
doesn
t
always
go
as
plan
there
have
be
quite
a
few
pregnancy
during
the
trial
these
have
be
evenly
split
between
the
vaccine
group
and
the
placebo
group
if
the
vaccine
really
do
affect
fertility
we
would
have
see
few
pregnancy
in
the
vaccine
group
the
claim
that
vaccine
would
affect
fertility
worried
many
people
but
it
be
completely
false
if
you
be
go
to
do
your
research
about
vaccine
yourself
be
prepared
to
spend
a
bit
of
time
on
it
and
be
careful
where
you
get
your
information
don
t
inadvertently
become
part
of
the
infodemic
of
false
and
mislead
information
about

take
a
look
at
the
vaccine
knowledge
project
website
which
be
run
by
academic
at
the
university
of
oxford
and
provide
independent
advice
about
vaccine
and
infectious
disease
base
on
the
late
research
with
no
funding
from
pharmaceutical
company

entirely
separate
from
the
risk
and

some
people
be

to
some

because
of
the
way
they
be
manufacture
use
a
cell

from
human
foetal

the

large
quantity
of

vaccine
that
now
save

this
have
be
of
grave
concern
for
the
religious
right
in
the

who
want
to
ban
all

all
use
of
anything

it
have
also
be
of
concern
to
devout
catholic
the
vatican
s
position
since
have
be
that
it
be
wrong
to
make
vaccine
use
a
human
cell
line
derive
from
a
foetus
and
there
be
a
moral
duty
to
continue
to
fight
against
the
use
of
such
vaccine
and
to
campaign
for
alternative
but
that
if
a
population
be
expose
to
considerable
danger
to
their
health
then
such
vaccine
may
be
use
on
a
temporary
basis
and
although
only
this
one
legally
aborted
foetus
be
use
to
generate
all
the

the
impression
usually
give
be
that

carry
out
to
order
to
generate
the
material
need
this
understandably
make
some
people
uncomfortable
but
it
be
not
the
case
and
after
decade
of
deliberate
falsehood
and
misinformation
a
strange
sequence
of
event
have
help
to
make
that
clear
in

right
as
her
replacement
i
be
not
go
to
say
that
abortion
be
a
good
thing
but
it
be
sometimes
a
necessary
thing
and
in
a
free
society
a
woman
should
be
able
to
choose
if
she
be
go
to
have
an
abortion
or
not
in
an
ideal
world
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
very
many
abortion
ever
to
be
carry
out
so
an
ideal
world
be
what
legislator
should
be
look
to
create
if
they
want
to
reduce

from
happen
include
the
rape
of

they
need
to
make
effective
contraception
freely
available
for
anybody
who
want
it
and
they
need
to
provide
good

they
need
to
educate
and
empower
woman
to
take

not

they
should
do
with
their
body
the
world
i
want
to
live
in
be
one
in
which
very
few
abortion
be
ever
need
because
woman
be
not
put
in
the
situation
where
they
would
want
to
have
an
abortion
however
we
will
never
have
an
ideal
world
there
will
always
be
mistake
people
will
get
thing
wrong
contraception
will
fail
there
will
always
be
some
circumstance
in
which
an
abortion
be
the
right
thing
for
a
woman
and
when
that
be
true
then
it
should
be
available
president
trump
chose
amy
coney
barrett
as
his
nomination
to
the
supreme
court
and
within
day
of
the
event
in
the
rise
garden
of
the
white
house
to
confirm
that
nomination
not
only
president
trump
but
many
other
people
who
be
present
that
day
have
be
diagnose
with
coronavirus
the
detail
of
the
subsequent
treatment
that
president
trump
receive
raise
some
question
we
be
told
that
he
receive
oxygen
briefly
at
home
when
his
blood
oxygen
level
drop
we
know
he
be
then
transfer
to
the
presidential
suite
at
the
walter
reed
hospital
where
a
team
of
doctor
take
care
of
him
he
be
we
be
told
give
the
antiviral
drug
remdesivir
at
an
early
stage
at
the
time
this
have
be
license
for
emergency
use
in
the
united
state
but
its
performance
have
not
be
particularly
impressive
the
recovery
trial
in
the
uk
found
that
there
be
some
benefit
in
speed
recovery
but
that
this
be
not
clinically
significant
he
be
also
give
another
drug
that
have
not
yet
be
license
and
be
still
undergo
clinical
trial
this
be
a
cocktail
of
two
different
monoclonal
antibody
that
bind
to
the
coronavirus
spike
protein
produce
by
a
company
call
regeneron
monoclonal
antibody
be
clone
in
the
lab
from
a
single
antibody
and
they
be
potentially
useful
for
people
who
because
of
their
age
or
other
deficiency
in
their
immune
system
be
not
make
a
strong
immune
response
we
then
heard
that
the
president
be
be
treat
with
dexamethasone
this
be
a
cheap
and
widely
available
steroid
that
have
be
show
in
the
uk
s
recovery
trial
earlier
in
the
year
to
dampen
down
the
immune
response
which
can
be
damage
in
the
second
phase
of
covid
disease
in
the
early
part
of
infection
with
coronavirus
the
body
be
try
to
use
the
immune
system
to
control
the
virus
but
for
some
patient
there
be
a
second
stage
of
disease
where
the
immune
system
start
do
more
harm
than
good
and
these
patient
can
go
into
quite
a
sudden
decline
dexamethasone
have
be
show
to
be
effective
in
reduce
death
in
people
who
require
oxygen
and
particularly
in
people
who
be
on
mechanical
ventilation
it
have
also
be
show
that
it
do
more
harm
than
good
in
people
who
didn
t
require
oxygen
so
the
news
that
president
trump
be
on
dexamethasone
be
interest
we
be
be
told
that
he
have
only
require
oxygen
briefly
and
that
he
wasn
t
on
it
anymore
that
would
mean
that
he
should
not
have
be
receive
dexamethasone
which
could
actually
cause
him
harm
on
the
other
hand
if
he
be
repeatedly
require
supplemental
oxygen
to
maintain
his
blood
oxygen
level
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
give
dexamethasone
but
it
would
mean
the
disease
then
be
much
more
severe
than
anybody
be
admit
dexamethasone
also
have
side
effect
it
affect
mood
and
it
can
give
a
false
sense
of
energy
when
president
trump
return
to
work
he
announce
that
all
american
should
have
access
to
the
same
drug
that
he
have
receive
free
of
charge
include
the
monoclonal
antibody
from
regeneron
which
have
not
yet
give
any
indication
of
efficacy
in
clinical
trial
the
food
and
drug
administration
fda
do
grant
emergency
use
authorisation
on
november
for
mild
to
moderate
case
but
not
for
patient
who
have
be
hospitalise
or
require
oxygen
it
also
become
clear
that
hek
cell
have
be
use
to
test
the
regeneron
monoclonal
antibody
that
president
trump
have
be
treat
with
despite
this
the
religious
right
explain
that
this
drug
be
acceptable
because
president
trump
have
not
require
the
abortion
in
question
to
take
place
but
the
only
person
that
ever
require
the
abortion
that
lead
to
the
generation
of
the
hek
cell
line
be
the
pregnant
woman
who
make
the
choice
to
have
an
abortion
in
the
s
it
be
never
require
by
anybody
else
fn
it
be
ironic
that
an
event
at
which
president
trump
nominate
a
judge
who
many
hop
would
ban
abortion
in
the
united
state
may
well
have
lead
to
him
be
treat
by
a
monoclonal
antibody
cocktail
that
require
the
use
of
a
cell
line
derive
from
human
foetal
cell
which
may
in
turn
lead
to
great
public
understand
of
how
vaccine
be
make
it
be
logical
nonetheless
to
ask
why
we
need
to
carry
on
use
this
particular
cell
line
after
all
there
be
some
vaccine
that
be
make
use
different
cell
line
for
example
some
inactivate
viral
vaccine
be
make
use
vero
cell
which
originate
from
the
kidney
of
an
african
green
monkey
the
short
answer
be
that
switch
to
a
different
non
human
cell
line
be
on
our
wish
list
partly
because
if
we
do
we
could
potentially
make
other
improvement
to
the
production
process
but
it
would
involve
a
huge
amount
of
expensive
time
consume
work
include
reassess
and
recalibrating
almost
every
part
of
cath
s
five
step
that
no
one
to
date
have
be
prepared
to
pay
for
in
an
ideal
world
we
would
have
start
this
work
ten
year
ago
in
there
be
no
alternative
to
use
hek
cell
if
we
want
to
make
a
vaccine
on
december
the
vatican
told
roman
catholic
that
it
be
morally
acceptable
for
them
to
receive
covid
vaccine
even
if
their
production
employ
cell
line
drawn
from
tissue
of
an
aborted
foetus
to
return
to
the
subject
of
vaccine
hesitancy
it
be
natural
to
be
concerned
about
the
unknown
or
the
new
and
with
drug
and
vaccine
there
be
a
history
that
can
feed
into
this
concern
however
scientist
have
learnt
from
their
historic
mistake
and
put
in
place
measure
to
prevent
them
from
happen
again
nonetheless
no
one
can
ever
assure
you
that
take
a
vaccine
or
do
anything
at
all
be
completely
risk
free
nothing
be
completely
risk
free
we
therefore
need
to
weigh
up
the
risk
and
benefit
when
decide
what
to
do
which
be
not
easy
because
we
tend
not
to
be
very
good
at
understand
risk
many
of
us
be
happy
to
trust
our
doctor
to
guide
us
others
prefer
to
do
our
own
research
both
be
reasonable
approach
so
long
as
your
information
be
come
from
a
reliable
source
covid
be
a
devastate
disease
that
be
kill
million
of
people
and
leave
million
of
others
with
long
term
health
problem
the
vaccine
be
offer
have
be
produce
with
enormous
care
and
attention
to
safety
test
to
establish
the
risk
benefit
ratio
in
ten
of
thousand
of
people
and
will
continue
to
be
monitor
for
rare
side
effect
do
nothing
be
a
decision
too
and
one
that
can
have
consequence
just
as
much
as
a
positive
action
get
yourself
vaccinate
will
protect
you
and
those
around
you
from
fall
ill
with
covid
and
be
the
best
mean
we
have
to
bring
an
end
to
lurch
from
lockdown
to
economic
failure
via
overwhelmed
health
service
my
advice
would
be
to
accept
a
covid
vaccine
as
soon
as
you
be
offer
one
that
s
what
i
do
cath
chapter
vogue
robert
peston
itv
news
at
ten
july
what
i
ve
learn
be
that
this
very
important
peer
review
of
the
work
that
s
go
on
at
oxford
back
by
the
pharmaceutical
giant
astrazeneca
show
response
from
antibody
and
so
call
t
cell
or
killer
cell
that
we
all
have
have
be
as
good
as
the
researcher
could
possibly
have
hop
so
it
be
good
news
there
be
evidence
that
this
vaccine
may
work
those
close
to
it
think
that
there
could
well
be
this
vaccine
in
mass
production
as
soon
as
the
autumn
i
think
i
actually
spat
out
my
wine
wtf
all
of
us
involve
with
the
project
who
have
have
even
a
whiff
of
the
trial
data
be
under
strict
instruction
not
to
talk
about
it
we
be
not
allow
to
save
copy
to
our
computer
or
send
it
in
email
we
be
certainly
not
allow
to
tell
our
friend
there
be
people
who
have
actually
make
the
vaccine
who
have
not
yet
be
told
what
the
data
be
look
like
and
yet
there
be
robert
peston
on
twitter
and
on
the
national
news
article
immediately
appear
in
the
time
and
the
telegraph
repeat
some
of
this
other
paper
be
major
on
whether
we
be
go
to
have
to
wear
mask
in
pret
or
not
the
university
even
tweet
a
link
to
one
of
them
which
seem
like
madness
we
weren
t
allow
to
talk
about
our
finding
but
science
by
leak
be
ok
i
don
t
think
we
ever
work
out
where
the
leak
have
come
from
speculation
be
rife
be
it
someone
from
the
vaccine
taskforce
or
have
a
government
minister
want
a
good
news
story
out
on
a
particular
day
but
it
make
us
even
more
careful
in
the
future
and
it
drove
home
to
us
if
we
hadn
t
understood
it
already
how
bright
a
spotlight
be
be
shone
on
everything
we
be
do

when
i
be
i
kid
i
dream
of
be
famous
that
i
would
be
on
the
tv
and
my
photo
would
be
in
the
daily
mail
so
i
decide
to
become
a
scientist
say
nobody
ever
throughout
everyone
on
the
team
be
step
up
to
the
task
of
their
life
at
the
same
time
because
thing
weren
t
already
hard
enough
we
be
on
a
steep
and
sometimes
scary
learn
curve
develop
a
whole
new
skill
set
work
thing
out
as
we
go
along
we
be
learn
how
to
navigate
the
communication
challenge
of
be
part
of
the
only
story
in
the
world
we
be
try
to
work
out
how
to
communicate
complexity
when
people
want
simple
answer
how
to
maintain
patient
confidentiality
and
avoid
insider
trading
but
also
be
open
and
transparent
how
to
be
truthful
about
our
work
but
not
undersell
it
how
to
balance
the
desire
to
discus
the
caveat
and
unknown
and
uncertainty
around
our
data
with
the
need
to
reassure
and
persuade
and
we
be
try
to
promote
understand
of
the
science
while
maintain
some
boundary
around
our
personal
life
sometimes
the
medium
traditional
and
social
help
us
to
manage
these
tension
like
us
most
journalist
be
do
their
best
in
difficult
circumstance
and
many
do
an
excellent
job
at
communicate
emerge
and
complex
science
at
other
time
it
seem
like
the
medium
be
actually
create
the
tension
sometimes
we
be
frustrate
at
the
way
information
get
distort
or
sensationalised
in
the
reporting
some
journalist
have
an
agenda
and
others
do
not
take
care
to
check
the
truth
and
simply
present
as
fact
what
another
journalist
have
say
at
the
same
time
this
be
our
opportunity
to
reach
audience
that
normally
would
take
no
interest
in
our
work
and
to
get
verify
and
accurate
information
out
into
the
world
we
be
always
conscious
that
our
found
father
edward
jenner
s
big
achievement
be
not
vaccinate
against
smallpox
that
be
not
his
idea
and
like
most
scientist
he
be
building
on
the
work
of
others
what
he
do
that
others
didn
t
be
publicise
his
finding
and
push
for
the
widespread
uptake
of
vaccination
the
medium
as
double
edge
sword
be
not
a
new
idea
but
since
we
be
not
influencers
or
member
of
the
royal
family
i
suppose
it
be
not
something
to
which
most
of
us
work
anonymously
in
our
lab
and
happy
if
our
late
finding
get
publish
in
a
highly
specialise
scientific
journal
have
previously
give
much
thought
anyway
we
have
no
choice
but
to
pick
up
the
sword
and
wield
it
as
best
we
could
what
we
be
do
be
important
and
people
want
to
know
about
it
we
couldn
t
choose
not
to
engage
even
if
we
want
to
throughout
the
early
month
of
there
be
quite
a
gradual
build
up
of
attention
pressure
and
clanger
by
the
end
of
january
the
world
be
start
to
get
worried
and
we
be
get
a
lot
of
request
for
statement
in
february
we
do
our
first
of
several
photo
shoot
in
the
research
lab
not
the
cbf
i
couldn
t
risk
contamination
or
disruption
of
the
vaccine
production
process
while
we
be
still
make
it
have
photographer
and
film
crew
in
the
lab
be
always
disruptive
three
or
four
people
would
tramp
through
create
trip
hazard
with
their
trail
cable
dump
their
kit
on
lab
bench
and
ask
stress
people
to
explain
what
they
be
do
one
more
time
and
then
one
last
time
and
then
one
final
time
at
least
once
it
end
in
tear
such
as
when
a
crew
have
decide
that
the
office
they
be
suppose
to
be
film
in
wasn
t
suitable
because
of
scaffold
visible
through
the
window
set
up
to
film
an
interview
in
the
busiest
part
of
the
immunology
lab
and
destroyed
a
whole
morning
s
work
by
march
i
and
member
of
my
team
be
get
request
all
the
time
to
do
press
interview
about
the
vaccine
i
remember
do
a
phone
interview
with
a
journalist
from
the
express
i
spoke
with
him
for
about
half
an
hour
and
i
thought
that
i
have
take
him
carefully
through
the
story
how
we
make
the
vaccine
how
we
test
it
for
safety
and
our
plan
for
the
trial
imagine
my
surprise
when
the
result
headline
be
coronavirus
vaccine
oxford
university
scientist
fear
uk
put
egg
in
one
basket
the
stupid
thing
be
i
have
say
those
word
right
at
the
end
he
have
ask
me
what
be
you
most
worried
about
this
be
now
i
look
back
at
it
an
obvious
journalist
technique
we
d
be
chat
i
felt
relaxed
so
i
answer
off
the
cuff
what
i
meant
be
and
it
be
bury
in
the
article
which
be
actually
pretty
good
clear
and
accurate
that
because
we
have
to
work
so
fast
sarah
hadn
t
spent
year
test
different
version
of
the
vaccine
before
commit
to
the
final
design
we
just
go
for
the
simple
option
of
repeat
the
strategy
that
have
be
effective
for
mers
but
that
wasn
t
really
what
the
headline
imply
a
lesson
learnt
by
april
there
have
be
report
of
paparazzo
on
campus
i
think
someone
be
spot
carry
a
camera
with
telephoto
lens
in
the
hospital
car
park
we
weren
t
use
to
this
kind
of
attention
the
event
around
the
fake
story
of
the
suppose
death
of
elisa
granato
make
it
clear
that
we
be
go
to
need
to
be
more
strategic
and
control
about
our
interaction
with
the
medium
the
medium
have
be
useful
to
us
in
various
way
the
coverage
have
probably
be
a
big
part
of
why
we
be
able
to
recruit
to
the
trial
so
quickly
and
it
have
also
raise
our
profile
with
people
who
end
up
generously
donate
to
the
project
but
now
we
need
to
protect
the
privacy
and
security
of
the
volunteer
and
the
trial
process
and
give
ourselves
the
space
to
get
on
with
the
work
we
put
a
note
on
the
website
we
have
set
up
for
the
vaccine
trial
say
we
be
aware
there
have
be
and
will
be
rumour
and
false
report
about
the
progress
of
the
trial
we
urge
people
not
to
give
these
any
credibility
and
not
to
circulate
them
we
will
not
be
offering
a
run
commentary
about
the
trial
but
all
official
update
will
appear
on
this
site
we
also
start
send
all
request
from
journalist
to
the
university
press
office
who
would
decline
most
of
them
on
our
behalf
the
press
office
organise
for
us
to
do
a
few
background
briefing
with
select
journalist
these
discuss
general
issue
such
as
the
difficulty
of
compare
the
result
from
two
different
clinical
trial
and
how
we
might
deal
with
that
or
how
we
measure
antibody
as
part
of
a
clinical
trial
rather
than
give
any
kind
of
run
commentary
other
than
that
we
would
communicate
when
we
have
data
to
publish
and
something
to
say
and
not
before
of
course
that
do
not
stop
the
request
from
come
i
be
still
relatively
anonymous
despite
my
adventure
on
twitter
but
sarah
have
to
ditch

about

we

some

with

whatever
they
do

certainly
do
not
filter
out
all
the
perhaps
well
meaning
but
ultimately
distract
approach
our
new
strategy
essentially
keep
our
head
down
until
we
publish
our
first
peer
review
paper
be
go
pretty
well
until
robert
peston
s
big
reveal
it
be
a
shock
but
unlike
in
april
when
we
be
deal
with
fake
news
at
least
his
summary
be
correct
the
vaccine
be
do
exactly
what
we
have
hop
for
it
be
fooling
the
immune
system
into
mount
a
defence
to
the
sars
cov
spike
protein
and
it
be
not

any
problematic

occasionally
a

and
sometimes
an
elevate

all
easily
treat
with
paracetamol
just
like
in
april
though
the
demand
for
comment
go
through
the
roof
this
would
be
the
first
of
many
time
we
be
put
in
an
impossible
position
any
small
piece
of
information
even
if
leak
by
someone
elsewhere
lead
to
us
be
question
about
it
if
we
didn
t
say
anything
we
be
criticise
for
lack
of
transparency
and
fail
in
our
duty
to
inform
the
public
and
if
we
do
we
be
criticise
for
conduct
science
by
press
release
after
that
there
seem
to
be
something
every
month
there
be
report
in
august
that
president
trump
be
go
to
fast
track
our
vaccine
that
create
brief
mayhem
in
september
the
trial
be
stop
because
someone
become
ill
and
we
have
to
look
into
whether
it
be
because
of
the
vaccine
mayhem
again
in
october
the
russian
launch
a
disinformation
campaign
complete
with
image
meme
and
video
aim
at
convincing
people
that
our
vaccine
would
turn
them
into
monkey
the
science
medium
centre
a
charity
whose
philosophy
be
brilliantly
the
medium
will
do
science
well
when
scientist
do
the
medium
well
become
a
crucial
part
of
our
life
in
normal
time
they
organise
event
at
which
scientist
with
newsworthy
finding
can
speak
to
journalist
and
answer
their
question
they
also
advise
scientist
on
how
to
get
their
science
across
clearly
and
accurately
after
lockdown
they
start
organise
online
event
for
us
often
at
incredibly
short
notice
and
they
have
be
tireless
in
collect
quote
from
expert
whenever
there
be
a
new
development
that
have
be
really
important
for
help
journalist
to
make
sense
of
it
all
and
to
sift
out
some
of
the
nonsense
the
reporting
of
the
efficacy
result
from
our
phase
iii
trial
in
november
illustrate
almost
every
one
of
the
tension
we
be
manage
when
try
to
communicate
about
our
work
our
result
be
complex
unlike
when
pfizer
and
moderna
have
announce
their
result
we
have
not
one
simple
efficacy
number
but
three
the
group
who
have
have
a
half
dose
then
a
standard
dose
the
group
who
have
have
two
standard
dos
and
both
group
together
and
the
result
come
from
a
combination
of
trial
in
different
country
our
result
like
the
result
of
all
the
trial
be
also
market
sensitive
this
meant
they
have
to
be
announce
by
press
release
immediately
they
be
know
with
the
full
peer

as
quickly
as
possible
afterwards
fn
some
of
those
comment
on
the
situation

us
of
do
science
by
press
release
as
a
way
to
get
data
out
without
proper
scrutiny
do
not
understand
this
and
until
the
paper
be
write
up
peer
review
and
publish
we
could
not
defend
ourselves
beyond
say
just
wait
it
s
come
even
once
the
paper
be
publish
there
remain
some
unknown
uncertainty
and
caveat
around
our

as
there
be
around
all
data
but
while
set
all
of
that
out
make
everything
more
transparent
so
that
s
good
focus
on
the

and
uncertainty
also
risk
undermine
confidence
in
the
most
important
find
we
have
a
very
safe
and
highly
effective
vaccine
a
particular
bugbear
of
mine
because

the
way
the

we

as
i
described
in
chapter
the
impact
of
that
half

on
our
result
be
unclear
at
that
point
we
have
to
report
the
number
that
way
because
that
be
what
we
have
pre
agree
we
would
report
but
we
need
time
and
possibly
more

to

exactly
what
they

it

your
basic

it
be

because
it
impugn
our
work
and
our
concern
for
the
safety
of
our
trial
participant
but
also
because
it
risk
undermine
public
confidence
in
our

another
example
of
the
important
and
complicate
relationship
between
science
and
the
medium
be
the
claim
make
in
a
german
newspaper
in
late
january
and
repeat
on
reuters
and
elsewhere
that
our
vaccine
be
only
effective
in
old
people
this
claim
be
completely
untrue
to
the
extent
that
we
be
all
completely
baffle
about
where
on
earth
that
number
have
come
from
but
the
truth
take
a
little
time
to
explain
at
that
point
we
do
not
know
what
the
true
figure
be
we
do
not
have
the
data
to
say
efficacy
in
over
s
be
not
it
be
x
this
be
because
we
have
not
brought
people
over
the
age
of
into
our
trial
until
we
have
gather
a
lot
of
safety
data
on
young
people
so
by
the
time
our
trial
report
its
result
in
november
not
many
of
our
old
volunteer
have
test
positive
for
covid
but
while
we
do
not
have
this
clear
simple
efficacy
data
what
we
do
have
be
extremely
strong
evidence
from
the
immune
response
we
be
see
in
our
trial
since
immune
response
be
similar
in
young
and
old
adult
it
be
to
be
expect
that
efficacy
would
also
be
similar
just
a
few
week
later
we
do
have
evidence
show
that
in
real
life
our
vaccine
be
highly
effective
not
just
in
the
over
s
but
in
the
over
s
however
by
that
time
germany
s
vaccine
policymaking
body
have
announce
that
it
would
not
authorise
the
use
of
the
vaccine
in
over
s
several
month
later
the
untrue
claim
be
still
be

article

why
the
vaccine
roll
out
be
go
so
slowly
in

that
one
bad
article
and
then
the
frequent
subsequent
cite
of
it
even
when
accompany
by
the
caveat
that
the
claim
wasn
t
true
probably
do
contribute
to
a
general
reluctance
to
take
the
astrazeneca
vaccine
in
germany
and
elsewhere
like
the
kind
of
myth
we
talk
about
in
chapter
it
have
be
thoroughly
debunked
but
it
linger
in
people
s
mind
and
refuse
to
die
and
of
course
this
isn
t
just
about
my
hurt
feeling
that
my
work
be
misrepresent
it
s
not
even
just
about
the
importance
of
truth
in
journalism
this
kind
of
misinformation
and
this
be
just
one
example
although
it
be
a
particularly
bad
one
will
have
cost
life
people
who
could
have
be
vaccinate
be
not
vaccinate
and
some
of
those
people
will
have
die

we
have
agree
to
make
a
bbc
panorama
programme
about
our
year
though
we
do
slightly
curse
that
decision
a
few
time
afterwards
however
by
december
we
be
pleased
that
this
at
least
would
give
us
a
chance
to
put
our
story
across
accurately
i
be
also
happy
to
have
the
opportunity
to
showcase
my
part
of
the
story
manufacturing
be
not
particularly
sexy
and
with
my
business
head
on
i
have
to
fund
my
very
expensive
facility
from
project
so
it
s
important
that
academic
scientist
and
new
biotech
company
know
we
exist
and
what
we
can
do
for
them
a
mention
on
panorama
hopefully
in
a
positive
light
would
be
great
marketing
i
be
very
nervous
though
i
felt
the
same
stress
as
when
i
have
do
james
o
brien
s
radio
show
and
every
public
face
interview
since
will
i
say
something
daft
or
wrong
will
he
ask
me
slippery
question
try
to
catch
me
out
only
now
there
would
be
camera
and
light
as
well
my
interview
with
the
bbc
s
medical
editor
fergus
walsh
be
schedule
for
december
at
st
cross
college
in
the
centre
of
oxford
the
day
dawn
cold
and
wet
i
have
a
lot
of
zoom
meeting
slot
into
my
calendar
for
the
morning
and
i
need
to
go
into
the
cbf
too
i
be
also
in
the
process
of
sell
my
house
a
consequence
of
get
divorce
and
need
to
drop
off
some
document
with
my
solicitor
i
usually
cycle
everywhere
but
so
as
not
to
arrive
at
the
film
all
sweaty
i
have
book
a
car
share
for
the
afternoon
i
grabbed
my
make
up
bag
and
hairbrush
put
on
a
clean
jumper
i
m
as
vain
as
the
next
person
and
set
off
after
a
temperature
check
at
the
porter
lodge
and
lot
of
hand
sanitise
i
be
allow
into
the
college
the
film
crew
be
run
a
bit
late
themselves
so
i
instal
myself
in
a
side
room
the
room
be
full
of
kit
big
carry
case
for
equipment
odd
light
rig
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
imagine
exist
on
a
film
set
not
my
comfort
zone
i
have
my
ipad
and
plenty
of
email
to
be
get
on
with
though
so
i
just
sat
down
and
try
not
to
stare
at
fergus
walsh
who
be
quietly
work
in
the
corner
the
interview
seem
to
go
ok
the
last
question
fergus
ask
me
be
be
your
vaccine
safe
and
would
you
take
it
i
say
that
i
didn
t
expect
to
be
at
the
front
of
the
queue
but
i
would
be
encourage
my
parent
to
accept
a
vaccine
from
any
manufacturer
as
soon
as
it
be
offer
and
as
soon
as
i
be
offer
one
i
would
do
the
same
the
point
of
vaccination
be
not
just
to
protect
me
but
to
protect
the
vulnerable
in
the
community
and
i
would
always
want
to
assist
with
that
afterwards
the
team
come
to
do
a
morning
of
film
at
the
cbf
during
the
actual
manufacturing
of
the
vaccine
earlier
in
the
year
i
hadn
t
allow
any
camera
crew
in
as
we
have
to
work
in
a
very
clean
and
regulate
way
and
it
isn
t
easy
to
sterilise
a
camera
but
now
we
be
between
manufacturing
campaign
and
slightly
less
busy
so
although
it
be
a
disruption
i
give
it
the
ok
my
daughter
ellie
be
normally
very
keen
to
stay
up
past
nine
o
clock
especially
if
tv
be
involve
but
a
couple
of
week
later
when
i
say
she
be
allow
to
stay
up
because
mum
be
go
to
be
on
tv
talk
about
make
vaccine
she
seem
less
than
impressed
however
it
be
testament
to
the
producer
that
right
from
the
first
she
be
hooked
not
because
i
be
on
whatever
but
this
be
the
first
time
she
have
see
the
number
of
case
and
death
around
the
world
so
vividly
and
clearly
portrayed
i
think
it
make
her
realise
how
serious
what
we
be
do
be
and
maybe
she
felt
a
little
proud
she
also
love
the
footage
of
the
machine
fill
the
dos
on
the
production
line
and
ask
whether
i
have
a
cool
machine
like
that
as
you
know
have
read
chapter
i
sadly
do
not
we
do
it
by
hand
i
get
equally
positive
response
from
family
friend
and
mum
on
the
school
run
everyone
say
that
they
have
learn
something
and
felt
reassure
about
the
vaccine
there
be
a
lot
of
press
coverage
in
response
to
the
programme
too
and
it
all
felt
positive
the
daily
mail
described
me
to
my
mum
s
delight
as
have
a
ribald
sense
of
humour
and
an
earthy
kentish
accent
fn

if
we
be
unprepared
for
the
level
of
interest
the
medium
would
show
in
our
work
this
year
we
be
even
more
unprepared
and
surprised
by
the
interest
show
in
us
personally
at
the
begin
there
be
a
lot
of
interest
in
us
be
woman
scientist
i
know
that
sarah
found
this
particularly
annoy
she
be
on
record
as
say
something
like
this
be
why
be
we
even
discuss
woman
scientist
i
m
not
a
woman
scientist
i
m
a
scientist
and
more
than
half
my
colleague
be
woman
and
we
do
the
job
however
i
think
that
with
our
increase
public
profile
our
attitude
have
become
more
nuanced
we
realise
that
we
be
be
see
as
role
model
and
that
be
i
think
important
woman
be
still
under
represent
in
so
call
stem
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
subject
at
school
at
university
at
work
and
in
senior
position
at
work
there
be
still
a
pay
gap
and
the
reason
for
that
be
complex
but
it
be
partly
because
woman
be
less
likely
to
reach
senior
position
there
be
some
thing
about
be
a
woman
in
science
that
be
still
particularly
challenge
attempt
at
quick
fix
can
be
counterproductive
for
example
in
the
past
decide
to
have
a
senior
woman
on
every
committee
impose
huge
burden
on
the
few
senior
woman
around
prevent
them
from
get
on
with
their
research
but
mentorship
allyship
and
structural
change
particularly
around
parental
leave
and
fix
term
contract
which
would
also
benefit
our
male
colleague
would
help
and
clearly
there
be
still
some
work
to
do
on
the
public
perception
of
woman
in
public
role
it
be
strike
that
the
male
scientist
who
be
equal
part
of
this
project
tend
not
to
be
introduce
in
term
like
irish
brunette
mother
of
two
te
serious
redhead
mother
to
triplet
sarah
or
not
your
stereotypical
oxford
boffin
me
i
be
pretty
sure
andy
have
never
be
described
as
male
scientist
andy
pollard
for
the
record
andy
s
hair
be
grey
adrian
s
be
strawberry
blond
and
sandy
be
a
brunette
so
while
sarah
s
initial
response
why
be
we
still
talk
about
this
be
valid
the
reality
be
that
we
should
still
be
talk
about
this
and
not
just
talk
about
it
but
actually
do
something
about
it
until
we
don
t
have
to
anymore
it
be
an
honour
to
be
held
up
as
a
role
model
and
if
our
position
in
the
public
gaze
mean
more
young
people
consider
option
that
otherwise
they
would
not
have
do
that
can
only
be
a
good
thing
there
be
also
lot
of
documentary
maker
who
all
want
to
film
us
rid
our
bike
because
it
s
the
clich
of
the
oxford
academic
isn
t
it
i
admit
in
this
case
it
s
a
clich
that
be
true
both
of
us
do
cycle
to
work
sarah
told
me
that
the
trick
which
she
have
learn
the
hard
way
be
not
to
let
them
persuade
you
to
cycle
down
the
big
hill
next
to
the
campus
because
then
you
have
to
get
back
up
again
also
they
like
film
us
walk
through
door
go
downstairs
and
opening
freezer
we
become
quite
practise
at
it
one
of
the
more
surreal
moment
of
this
year
be
sarah
s
high
fashion
photoshoot
in
the
basement
of
the
jenner
institute
sarah
have
already
be
to
a
london
studio
for
a
shoot
for
vogue
s
woman
shape
earlier
in
the
year
she
say
she
thought
it
would
be
fun
and
not
something
she
be
likely
to
be
ask
to
do
ever
again
but
not
long
after
vogue
she
be
approach
by
harper
s
bazaar
she
describes
their
shoot
in
the
basement
which
be
part
of
their
woman
of
the
year
series
as
all
slightly
ridiculous
the
sleeve
of
the
jacket
be
too
long
which
be
why
my
arm
be
in
such
strange
position
although
it
be
slightly
ridiculous
the
magazine
be
make
an
important
point
in
highlight
sarah
s
achievement
in
a
forum
where
scientist
would
not
normally
get
exposure
or
recognition
and
i
suspect
she
slightly
enjoy
it
there
be
other
pinch
yourself
moment
throughout
the
year
the
line
between
reality
and
fiction
almost
disappear
for
me
one
even
in
may
when
i
sat
down
to
watch
tv
i
have
always
love
charlie
brooker
s
brand
of
darkly
satirical
comedy
and
thought
his
antiviral
wipe
would
be
a
welcome
distraction
then
up
popped
andy
pollard
be
interviewed
by
philomena
cunk
he
hadn
t
told
me
he
be
do
it
and
it
be
such
a
shock
he
have
a
very
serious
and
professional
air
at
work
but
this
give
away
his
secret
sense
of
humour
my
whatsapp
message
to
te
allude
to
laugh
so
much
we
wet
ourselves
we
have
sometimes
felt
that
the
medium
attention
be
too
much
and
that
we
would
give
anything
just
to
return
to
our
previous
unobserved
life
but
step
back
i
think
that
even
if
us
put
ourselves
out
there
for
examination
have
increase
the
understand
of
just
a
small
number
of
people
it
will
have
be
worth
it
the
hassle
and
the
intrusion
and
the
lose
morning
will
have
be
worth
it
if
there
be
one
more
person
who
can
see
through
conspiracy
theory
and
who
might
then
be
confident
to
persuade
a
frail
elderly
person
that
it
s
ok
when
their
vaccination
date
come
round
one
kid
inspire
to
do
triple
science
gcse
meaning
one
more
potential
future

one
girl
brave
enough
to
put
her
hand
up
in
class
to
ask
a
question
one
more
volunteer
for
a
trial
one
more
donor
to
the
cause
maybe
what
i
have
really
take
on
board
be
that
science
itself
need
to
be
see
then
it
will
be
understood
then
it
will
be
trust
not
blindly
some
scientist
make
mistake
and
some
cheat
but
with
robust
challenge
and
this
engagement

will
make

in

we

an

of
wasp
the

have
be
there
in
a
side
wall
of
our

all
summer

it
be
out

we

left
the

one
saturday
in

heavily
all

the

decide
not

venture
out
into

the
wasp
seem
to
play
by
the
rule
age
around
i
be
lie
on
a
camp
bed
in
a
tent
in
our
back
garden
quietly
reading
when
a
wasp
announce
its
presence
by
sting
me
on
the
leg
i
ran
into
the
house
cry
not
just
from
the
pain
but
also
from
the
injustice
i
most
certainly
have
not
be
do
anything
to
attract
its
attention
but
have
be
stung
anyway
i
be
give
a
cold
wet
flannel
to
put
over
the
sting
and
sent
back
out
into
the
garden
my
mother
s
style
of
parent
require
that
we
should
entertain
ourselves
when
at
home
preferably
outside
not
in
our
bedroom
and
most
definitely
not
under
my
foot
despite
have
be
stung
i
be
still
not
particularly
afraid
of
wasp
we
all
get
ant
sting
repeatedly
during
the
summer
while
play
in
the
garden
and
the
wasp
sting
wasn
t
so
much
bad
later
that
year
though
or
possibly
the
next
my
mother
suffer
an
allergic
reaction
to
a
wasp
sting
the
wasp
have
land
on
the
back
of
the
kitchen
tap
and
she
didn
t
see
it
as
she
grasped
hold
of
the
tap
firmly
to
give
it
the
wrench
that
be
necessary
to
turn
it
on
the
wasp
trap
give
her
a
sting
that
go
deep
into
her
finger
shortly
afterwards
she
begin
to
feel
unwell
my
brother
my
sister
and
i
be
all
in
the
garden
as
per
her
request
but
fortunately
my
brother
be
within
earshot
and
be
dispatch
to
fetch
our
strong
and
capable
neighbour
mr
mansfield
my
father
arrive
home
for
his
lunch
though
we
call
it
dinner
to
see
mr
mansfield
carry
my
mother
out
to
the
wait
ambulance
there
be
no
last
physical
effect
of
this
encounter
but
whenever
my
mother
saw
a
wasp
after
that
she
would
engage
in
the
panic
and
flap
about
that
be
forbidden
to
the
rest
of
the
family
repeat
in
a
high
pitch
voice
oh
wasp
i
m
allergic
unfortunately
she
pass
on
the
panic
response
to
my
child
when
they
be
at
an
impressionable
age
along
with
oh
wasp
grandma
s
allergic
so
when
the
wasp
begin
invade
our
house
the
child
be
far
from
impressed
on
that
wet
saturday
we
have
about
thirty
wasp
in
the
kitchen
over
the
next
week
we
count
about
ten
new
wasp
a
day
some
turn
up
dead
on
the
windowsill
some
wait
quietly
to
be
scoop
up
and
eject
others
buzz
about
inside
the
lampshade
i
be
reluctant
to
call
pest
control
because
any
poison
sprayed
into
the
nest
would
have
make
its
way
into
the
house
instead
we
kept
door
shut
and
remove
the
intruder
with
as
little
fuss
as
possible
occasionally
their
incessant
buzzing
do
get
to
me
though
a
week
after
they
first
broke
through
into
the
house
rob
have
go
out
to
fetch
fish
and
chip
for
supper
i
be
set
the
table
in
the
kitchen
when
i
saw
a
dead
wasp
on
the
windowsill
as
i
remove
it
i
found
two
more
either
dead
or
comatose
trap
inside
the
blind
and
fetch
the
hand
held
vacuum
cleaner
to
remove
them
then
the
buzzing
inside
the
lampshade
start
up
as
rob
pull
up
in
the
driveway
i
be
dispatch
the
last
of
three
more
wasp
with
a
vacuum
cleaner
in
one
hand
and
a
fly
swatter
in
the
other
use
a
badminton
style
forehand
to
swat
and
the
vacuum
cleaner
to
collect
over
the
summer
and
through
the
autumn
as
the
uk
gradually
open
up
and
close
back
down
again
and
the
wasp
go
from
be
something
outside
that
didn
t
bother
us
to
something
inside
that
do
we
be
wait
we
all
knew
that
every
day
might
be
the
day
we
could
unblind
our
trial
and
find
out
whether
and
how
well
our
vaccine
work
in
the
meantime
the
us
trial
get
caught
up
in
politics
we
mostly
manage
to
look
on
all
the
buzzing
as
harmless
irritation
that
we
should
just
ignore
but
occasionally
it
get
to
us
and
sometimes
even
when
you
be
not
flap
about
you
get
stung
anyway
in
the
end
all
we
could
do
with
the
wasp
and
the
trial
be
wait
with
as
much
patience
as
possible
for
this
to
pas

all
year
i
be
constantly
be
ask
by
journalist
by
friend
by
colleague
when
will
we
know
when
will
we
know
whether
the
vaccine
be
safe
when
will
we
know
whether
it
work
i
be
always
confident
because
of
the
work
we
have
do
on
similar
vaccine
before
that
it
would
be
safe
and
in
july
we
have
publish
the
data
that
demonstrate
that
i
be
also
pretty
confident
from
the
outset
that
it
would
work
but
until
enough
people
in
our
trial
have
test
positive
for
covid
and
the
trial
be
unblinded
we
couldn
t
know
for
sure
unfortunately
for
the
many
people
include
me
who
be
desperate
for
information
it
wasn
t
possible
to
keep
a
run
score
the
problem
with
do
so
be
that
it
be
then
tempt
to
choose
to
end
the
trial
at
a
point
where
the
number
favour
the
outcome
you
be
hop
for
imagine
that
the
first
positive
case
be
in
someone
who
have
receive
the
chadox
vaccine
the
vaccine
group
at
that
point
the
vaccine
look
ineffective
then
imagine
the
next
three
case
be
in
people
who
have
receive
the
placebo
injection
the
placebo
group
now
the
vaccine
look
much
well
if
the
next
six
case
be
all
in
the
placebo
group
the
vaccine
would
look
really
good
it
would
be
tempt
to
stop
the
trial
there
but
what
if
the
next
ten
case
be
all
in
the
vaccine
group
we
would
have
stop
the
trial
on
a
vaccine
that
be
now
look
no
well
than
a
placebo
so
it
be
important
for
the
scientific
integrity
of
the
trial
that
there
be
no
opportunity
for
those
conduct
it
to
know
how
thing
be
go
add
to
that
uncertainty
over
the
summer
and
the
early
autumn
we
and
astrazeneca
be
have
lot
of
discussion
with
multiple
regulatory
authority
the
mhra
in
the
uk
the
fda
in
the
us
and
several
others
about
exactly
how
many
positive
covid
case
there
need
to
be
in
our
trial
before
we
could
unblind
it
the
more
case
in
the
trial
before
we
unblind
it
the
more
confidence
we
can
have
in
its
result
on
the
other
hand
the
more
case
we
need
the
longer
it
be
go
to
take
and
in
the
meantime
people
be
die
another
discussion
we
be
all
have
with
the
regulator
be
whether
it
be
go
to
be
acceptable
to
pool
result
from
trial
be
carry
out
in
different
country
it
s
a
good
thing
to
have
data
from
different
country
for
a
vaccine
that
we
hope
will
be
use
worldwide
but
the
different
pattern
of
the
outbreak
in
different
country
meant
that
we
might
see
different
level
of
efficacy
report
this
be
because
the
vaccine
be
likely
to
be
and
do
turn
out
to
be
very
effective
against
hospitalisation
and
severe
disease
but
less
effective
against
mild
disease
in
a
country
with
high
level
of
severe
disease
the
vaccine
would
therefore
look
more
effective
this
be
illustrate
very
clearly
later
on
when
another
vaccine
manufacturer
announce
efficacy
of
then
modify
that
to
say
it
be
when
take
all
mild
disease
into
account
it
be
also
unclear
at
this
point
what
might
happen
when
the
first
vaccine
ours
or
someone
else
s
report
its
trial
result
almost
every
vaccine
under
development
be
base
on
the
same
spike
protein
many
have
already
publish
the
data
from
their
phase
i
safety
trial
show
that
the
vaccine
be
well
tolerate
only
result
in
the
kind
of
thing
we
would
expect
to
see
after
receive
a
vaccine
short
live
pain
at
the
injection
site
fatigue
and
so
on
some
be
also
reporting
the
data
from
their
phase
ii
immune
response
trial
show
that
they
be
induce
neutralise
antibody
against
sars
cov
but
what
we
didn
t
know
be
what
level
of
antibody
response
we
need
to
protect
against
disease
what
the
phase
iii
trial
be
try
to
establish
be
primarily
whether
the
immune
response
induced
by
a
give
vaccine
be
protective
do
the
antibody
stop
people
expose
to
covid
from
get
ill
we
be
also
very
interested
in
other
question
like
do
the
vaccine
prevent
asymptomatic
infection
because
if
it
do
that
would
be
really
important
in
reduce
virus
transmission
if
we
be
able
to
compare
the
immune
response
of
different
vaccine
that
be
in
phase
iii
trial
could
we
assume
once
one
vaccine
have
be
show
to
be
protective
that
this
meant
any
vaccine
that
induced
a
comparable
immune
response
would
be
protective
as
well
might
it
make
sense
to
unblind
a
trial
early
in
those
circumstance
rather
than
wait
another
month
or
two
month
for
it
to
gather
enough
case
fn
so
as
the
summer
turn
to
autumn
and
the
day
grow
shorter
only
a
small
group
of
statistician
work
on
the
project
actually
knew
how
many
positive
case
we
have
accumulate
in
our
trial
and
even
they
didn
t
know
how
many
of
those
have
receive
our
vaccine
and
how
many
the
placebo
for
everyone
else
it
be
a
macabre
wait
game
played
in
the
dark
we
have
to
agree
how
many
case
in
which
trial
would
be
need
before
we
unblinded
and
under
what
circumstance
to
combine
data
from
trial
in
different
country
then
we
just
have
to
wait
for
that
number
of
people
to
fall
ill
and
test
positive
for
covid
in
august
with
people
enrol
and
vaccinate
into
phase
iii
trial
in
the
uk
and
brazil
and
a
small
phase
i
ii
study
in
south
africa
plus
another
separate
trial
underway
in
india
we
knew
that
it
could
in
theory
be
any
day
but
thought
it
would
probably
not
be
before
october
transmission
in
the
uk
have
drop
to
a
very
low
level
since
the
march
lockdown
which
be
great
for
the
population
as
a
whole
but
a
problem
for
our
trial
right
at
the
end
of
august
the
astrazeneca
lead
us
trial
finally
get
underway
it
be
schedule
to
recruit
people
very
fast
in
a
country
where
case
number
be
high
and
rise
the
data
from
this
trial
would
not
be
pool
with
the
data
from
the
uk
brazil
south
africa
trial
because
it
be
be
run
with
a
slightly
different
protocol
however
for
licensure
in
the
us
it
be
go
to
be
important
to
get
efficacy
data
from
the
us
trial
and
then
almost
as
soon
as
it
have
start
it
come
to
a
halt
again
the
us
government
under
president
trump
have
from
the
outset
stood
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
on
its
approach
to
tackle
covid
despite
repeat
warning
from
scientist
and
international
organisation
that
no
one
be
safe
until
we
be
all
safe

despite
the
obvious
fact
that

do
not

the

of
covid
vaccine
for
the
united
state
by
january
i
have
have
many
dealing
with
barda
over
the
year
through
my
work
on
influenza
and
emerge
pathogen
and
i
have
not
gain
the
impression
that
it
be
an
organisation
well
suit
to
operating
at
warp
speed
when
i
have
visit
its
headquarters
in
washington
dc
to
give
a
seminar
on
influenza
vaccine
development
i
have
spent
most
of
the
day
traipse
in
and
out
of
building
each
time
go
through
airport
style
security
measure
coffee
have
to
be
bought
from
a
local
starbucks
outside
the
building
because
barda
staff
could
not
accept
anything
that
might
be
consider
a
bribe
nor
give
away
anything
for
free
as
i
be
not
a
us
citizen
i
be
not
allow
to
give
a
talk
in
the
barda
building
so
out
through
security
we
go
again
as
do
most
of
the
people
who
have
turn
up
to
listen
to
me
around
the
time
that
ows
be
announce
rick
bright
barda
s
director
be
reassign
to
another
post
and
moncef
slaoui
be
appoint
as
head
of
ows
rick
bright
have
be
director
of
barda
since
and
with
year
of
experience
in
the
field
be
well
qualify
to
lead
its
pandemic
response
he
have
be
frustrate
by
the
lack
of
attention
be
paid
to
sars
cov
in
the
us
and
then
have
refuse
to
back
hydroxy
chloroquine
as
a
treatment
for
covid
in
the
absence
of
trial
data
and
fda
approval
fn
moncef
slaoui
also
have
a
long
history
of
work
in
vaccine
development
although
he
have
never
work
on
vaccine
for
emerge
pathogen
at
the
time
of
his
appointment
he
resign
from
his
position
on
the
board
of
us
company
moderna
who
be
develop
an
mrna
vaccine
against
sars
cov
but
retain
stock
option
worth
million
and
a
seat
on
a
board
of
lonza
who
have
partner
with
moderna
to
produce
the
vaccine
follow
criticism
about
his
conflict
of
interest
he
later
give
up
the
stock
option
and
resign
from
lonza
and
other
position
ows
award
billion
of
funding
to
our
vaccine
almost
immediately
but
from
there
it
take
some
month
to
get
the
us
trial
start
with
the
fda
take
thing
rather
more
slowly
than
the
mhra
have
do
in
the
meantime
president
trump
hop
for
re
election
that
november
be
take
the
line
that
everything
be
go
to
be
fine
because
a
vaccine
would
be
here
to
save
everyone
very
soon
scientist
health
professional
and
regulator
become
concerned
about
the
political
pressure
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
fda
to
improperly
rush
a
vaccine
through
fda
director
make
it
clear
that
they
would
resign
if
pressure
to
approve
a
vaccine
before
it
have
be
properly
test
some
vaccine
whose
trial
have
start
later
than
ours
have
not
yet
amass
very
much
safety
data
no
regulator
be
go
to
license
any
vaccine
until
the
safety
data
have
accumulate
we
do
have
a
great
deal
of
safety
data
accumulate
for
our
vaccine
we
have
already
vaccinate
thousand
of
people
and
most
vaccine
related
adverse
event
occur
very
soon
after
vaccination
but
we
still
need
to
continue
with
our
phase
iii
trial
in
order
to
establish
how
effective
the
vaccine
be
go
to
be
in
particular
we
need
to
establish
how
effective
it
be
go
to
be
in
old
people
who
as
we
know
be
more
at
risk
from
covid
and
who
often
produce
weaker
immune
response
to
vaccine
there
be
also
a
concern
that
rush
the
vaccine
approval
even
for
a
vaccine
like
ours
where
the
trial
have
already
amass
enormous
amount
of
safety
data
could
put
people
off
be
vaccinate
either
with
this
vaccine
or
with
other
important
vaccine
like
mmr
it
be
almost
everyone
work
in
the
field
felt
undesirable
to
have
a
situation
in
which
a
vaccine
have
be
rush
to
licensure
because
a
politician
want
to
get
re
elect
on
august
the
financial
time
report
that
president
trump
be
consider
bypassing
normal
standard
and
fast
track
approval
of
the
oxford
astrazeneca
vaccine
so
that
it
could
be
roll
out
before
the
country
go
to
the
poll
in
early
november
our
phase
iii
trial
start
in
the
united
state
less
than
a
week
later
it
wasn
t
great
timing
because
it
come
just
before
the
labor
day
holiday
so
lot
of
trial
centre
decide
not
to
get
go
until
after
the
long
weekend
by
the
time
america
come
back
to
work
after
the
long
weekend
however
our
trial
have
be
pause
there
have
be
what
we
call
a
susar
a
susar
be
a
suspect
unexpected
serious
adverse
reaction
in
a
clinical
trial
an
adverse
event
be
something
that
happens
after
take
a
drug
or
receive
a
vaccine
which
may
or
may
not
have
be
cause
by
the
drug
or
vaccine
everything
have
to
be
record
even
if
it
be
pretty
obvious
that
the
vaccine
be
not
the
cause
a
serious
adverse
event
be
one
that
result
in
death
be
life
threaten
result
in
long
term
or
significant
disability
or
be
bad
enough
to
require
a
person
to
be
hospitalise
for
every
serious
adverse
event
it
be
necessary
to
ass
whether
it
be
cause
by
the
vaccine
or
not
and
the
outcome
of
that
assessment
may
be
that
it
be
not
associate
possibly
probably
or
definitely
associate
depend
on
the
level
of
certainty
of
the
clinician
who
make
the
assessment
an
adverse
event
that
be
cause
by
the
vaccine
be
know
as
an
adverse
reaction
in
the
clinical
trial
protocol
for
a
particular
vaccine
there
will
be
a
list
of
expect
adverse
reaction
for
example
have
a
sore
arm
be
a
know
adverse
reaction
to
get
a
vaccination
an
unexpected
serious
adverse
reaction
be
one
that
we
didn
t
previously
know
be
associate
with
the
drug
or
vaccine
in
question
and
a
suspect
unexpected
serious
adverse
reaction
which
be
the
susar
be
something
that
might
be
an
unexpected
serious
adverse
reaction
or
it
might
not
it
might
just
be
something
bad
that
would
have
happen
anyway
an
adverse
event
unrelated
to
vaccination
and
just
happen
to
occur
shortly
after
take
the
drug
or
vaccine
sometimes
it
be
immediately
very
clear
that
a
serious
adverse
event
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
vaccine
and
so
be
not
a
susar
one
volunteer
on
moderna
s
covid
vaccine
trial
get
struck
by
lightning
this
have
to
be
record
as
a
serious
adverse
event
but
no
one
thought
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
vaccination
in
other
case
thing
be
less
clear
and
have
to
be
investigate
there
be
a
case
early
on
in
its
roll
out
in
which
an
apparently
healthy
teenage
girl
very
sadly
die
hour
after
receive
an
hpv
vaccine
which
protects
against
cervical
cancer
after
investigation
it
be
found
that
she
have
have
a
very
large
very
rare
tumour
which
no
one
have
know
about
and
it
be
this
that
cause
her
death
not
the
vaccination
which
she
just
happen
to
have
on
the
day
she
die
or
imagine
year
old
mr
smith
go
to
his
local
pharmacy
for
his
routine
flu
vaccination
when
he
get
there
though
and
before
he
have
a
chance
to
have
the
vaccine
he
start
to
feel
unwell
the
pharmacist
recognises
sign
of
a
stroke
and
call
an
ambulance
while
he
be
be
treat
mr
smith
s
wife
call
several
friend
very
upset
and
warns
them
not
to
have
the
flu
vaccine
because
it
have
just
cause
her
husband
to
have
a
stroke
the
story
get
picked
up
by
the
local
paper
and
it
be
only
when
mr
smith
s
condition
have
stabilise
that
he
be
able
to
tell
his
wife
that
the
stroke
be
nothing
to
do
with
the
vaccine
because
he
hadn
t
actually
receive
it
but
have
the
vaccination
go
ahead
mr
smith
would
have
have
a
vaccine
and
then
immediately
afterwards
a
stroke
the
point
be
sometimes
thing
that
happen
after
a
vaccine
be
give
be
nothing
to
do
with
the
vaccine
they
happen
around
the
same
time
but
that
be
a
coincidence
the
one
thing
have
not
cause
the
other
so
a
susar
be
a
serious
event
that
might
or
might
not
be
an
adverse
reaction
to
a
drug
or
vaccine
during
a
clinical
trial
and
that
need
to
be
investigate
it
could
have
be
cause
by
the
vaccine
or
it
could
just
be
something
that
happen
around
the
same
time
any
trial
in
which
a
susar
have
take
place
may
be
put
on
a
voluntary
pause
by
the
chief
investigator
which
in
this
case
be
andy
or
sometimes
a
clinical
hold
will
be
impose
by
the
regulator
in
both
case
volunteer
who
have
already
be
vaccinate
will
continue
to
be
follow
up
but
no
far
vaccination
will
be
give
until
the
investigation
be
finish
we
wouldn
t
want
to
be
vaccinate
more
people
who
could
then
potentially
go
on
to
have
the
same
adverse
reaction
sometimes
the
diagnosis
be
simple
and
sometimes
it
be
more
complex
as
illness
can
be
remember
it
take
eight
month
for
me
to
get
a
diagnosis
of
bile
acid
malabsorption
if
i
have
be
part
of
a
trial
and
this
have
be
a
susar
i
would
have
get
the
test
more
quickly
but
it
still
would
have
take
several
week
this
be
not
the
trial
s
first
susar
susars
be
a
frequent
and
normal
occurrence
in
large
phase
iii
trial
because
the
more
people
involve
in
a
trial
the
more
likely
it
be
that
one
of
those
people
will
fall
ill
quite
by
chance
we
be
also
recruiting
old
people
into
the
trial
and
we
know
that
old
people
have
a
high
risk
of
illness
than
young
people
by
this
time
we
have
people
essentially
a
small
town
s
worth
of
people
in
the
trial
worldwide
and
in
any
small
town
over
a
period
of
week
and
month
people
be
go
to
get
ill
reporting
a
susar
be
actually
a
sign
of
good
safety
oversight
it
imply
the
investigator
be
do
their
job
properly
the
trial
s
first
susar
have
be
in
july
when
we
have
go
through
the
correct
process
of
pause
the
trial
investigate
the
situation
and
present
the
evidence
to
independent
assessor
and
the
regulator
who
carry
out
their
own
independent
review
and
decide
that
the
adverse
event
have
not
be
cause
by
vaccination
the
trial
have
then
restart
without
fanfare
or
fuss
the
expectation
be
that
we
would
go
through
a
similar
process
now
the
investigation
would
last
for
a
few
day
and
then
it
be
likely
that
the
trial
would
start
up
again
but
whereas
the
medium
hadn
t
notice
the
first
time
the
trial
have
stop
in
july
the
second
time
they
blew
it
up
into
a
big
story
there
be
journalist
hound
every
member
of
the
oxford
team
what
have
happen
who
do
it
happen
to
how
be
they
now
what
do
this
mean
for
this
vaccine
and
other
vaccine
a
lot
of
what
they
want
though
be
still
be
investigate
a
trial
volunteer
have
become
unwell
and
the
detail
be
confidential
between
that
individual
and
the
team
look
after
them
meaning
the
principal
investigator
at
the
trial
site
and
the
other
clinical
professional
brought
in
to
care
for
them
and
try
to
get
them
a
diagnosis
and
full
return
to
health
the
university
put
out
a
statement
that
simply
say
there
be
a
pause
no
more
people
to
be
vaccinate
due
to
a
susar
that
be
be
investigate
which
be
the
right
thing
to
say
and
left
it
at
that
we
simply
didn
t
have
immediate
answer
this
be
a
case
where
true
transparency
meant
acknowledge
uncertainty
in
the
medium
conclusion
be
jumped
to
very
readily
be
this
the
end
for
hope
of
an
early
breakthrough
say
the
guardian
while
the
sun
announce
vaccine
blow
coronavirus
trial
put
on
hold
in
major
setback
reuters
say
that
suspension
of
global
trial
cast
a
doubt
on
prospect
for
an
early
roll
out
of
one
of
the
most
advanced
covid
vaccine
in
development
none
of
this
be
correct
but
in
some
way
the
potential
implication
be
more
far
reach
than
these
headline
imply
if
this
be
indeed
a
genuine
adverse
reaction
to
this
vaccine
then
it
might
be
because
of
the
spike
protein
that
all
of
the
vaccine
developer
be
use
to
induce
an
immune
response
in
which
case
all
vaccine
in
development
would
be
affected

be
in
many
way
the
year
that
my
whole
career
have
be
building
towards
but
there
be
day
when
i
woke
up
and
wish
it
wasn
t
happen
i
be
very
aware
of
how
fortunate
i
be
to
have
a
secure
job
finally
and
my
child
all
safely
at
home
with
me
yes
they
be
all
grown
ups
now
and
i
probably
shouldn
t
worry
about
them
but
it
be
still
comfort
to
know
where
they
be
and
that
they
would
be
look
after
if
they
become
ill
i
be
pleased
not
to
have
to
travel
for
work
so
much
and
rob
and
i
be
go
for
a
long
walk
with
friend
every
weekend
so
i
still
have
almost
as
much
social
life
as
before
the
pandemic
but
i
miss
be
able
to
take
a
whole
day
off
without
check
in
to
see
what
new
problem
have
come
up
i
miss
have
some
control
over
what
i
work
on
and
i
be
very
tire
of
talk
endlessly
to
the
medium
and
always
have
to
be
the
adult
in
the
room
in
fact
while
the
trial
be
on
hold
and
this
late
medium
storm
be
rag
my
son
who
like
my
daughter
have
be
study
at
home
since
march
do
go
back
to
university
to
start
his
new
term
i
be
pleased
for
him
but
a
bit
sad
for
myself
i
would
miss
him
he
be
very
sensible
and
doesn
t
need
me
fret
over
him
but
as
many
parent
will
know
once
you
have
have
to
pick
up
a
child
from
a
pool
of
blood
after
his
ill
judged
attempt
to
rollerblade
down
a
bumpy
pavement
or
found
out
several
month
later
about
a
bus
crash
in
quito
you
remember
i
told
you
about
it
it
be
hard
not
to
conclude
that
you
will
only
truly
know
that
that
child
be
safe
when
he
be
actually
visible
to
you
it
be
probably
a
good
thing
i
have
work
to
distract
me
when
he
left
in
the
event
the
investigation
be
complete
and
the
uk
regulator
give
the
go
ahead
to
restart
six
day
after
the
trial
have
pause
this
unleashed
yet
more
question
from
journalist
why
have
it
only
partially
restart
why
have
it
not
restart
in
the
us
the
answer
be
that
this
be
a
develop
situation
and
each
regulatory
authority
have
to
make
its
own
decision
brazil
restart
two
day
later
and
south
africa
three
day
after
that
although
someone
could
always
be
found
to
give
a
quote
along
the
line
of
it
take
five
to
ten
year
to
make
a
vaccine
it
isn
t
safe
to
rush
most
of
the
coverage
do
become
more
sensible
explain
that
a
pause
to
investigate
illness
in
a
volunteer
be
a
perfectly
routine
part
of
a
clinical
trial
conveniently
the
uk
trial
resume
a
couple
of
day
after
a
group
of
nine
major
pharmaceutical
company
include
astrazeneca
jointly
sign
a
declaration
pledge
that
regardless
of
pressure
from
politician
none
of
them
would
submit
a
vaccine
for
approval
before
it
have
be
fully
test
for
safety
and
efficacy
as
determine
by
the
relevant
regulatory
authority
in
the
us
this
be
the
fda
this
give
commentator
an
opportunity
to
point
out
that
our
pause
have
be
a
demonstration
of
good
clinical
trial
oversight
and
careful
attention
to
the
safety
of
the
volunteer
in
the
trial
we
have
always
say
that
we
would
go
quickly
but
prioritise
safety
and
the
fact
that
we
have
be
prepared
to
pause
the
trial
across
the
world
to
investigate
a
participant
s
illness
be
see
as
a
good
thing
the
timing
of
our
susar
be
chance
of
course
but
the
timing
of
the
declaration
aim
at
ensure
public
confidence
in
the
science
and
ethic
behind
covid
vaccine
just
a
few
day
after
it
have
be
report
that
president
trump
want
to
fast
track
a
vaccine
to
roll
it
out
before
election
day
be
not
the
fda
response
be
to
publish
new
guidance
in
early
october
on
its
requirement
for
approve
any
vaccine
include
a
requirement
for
follow
up
data
for
a
median
of
at
least
two
month
after
final
vaccination
in
phase
iii
trial
that
effectively
put
an
end
to
any
chance
of
a
vaccine
in
a
us
trial
be
license
before
the
election
in
early
november
no
us
trial
would
have
two
month
of
safety
data
on
enough
participant
by
then
however
there
be
still
the
possibility
that
the
oxford
astrazeneca
vaccine
could
be
license
in
the
uk
by
the
mhra
and
we
have
start
our
uk
clinical
trial
in
april
and
continued
through
the
summer
so
we
have
more
than
two
month
of
safety
data
on
large
number
of
people
there
be
a
possible
scenario
in
which
our
uk
trial
report
its
efficacy
result
and
that
trial
met
the
fda
s
two
month
safety
data
criterion
and
the
fda
decide
it
be
happy
to
review
the
vaccine
on
that
basis
this
seem
to
lead
to
some
far
concern
in
the
us
over
the
weekend
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representative
nancy
pelosi
put
out
a
statement
say
that
she
would
not
trust
the
uk
regulator
the
mhra
to
license
a
vaccine
because
their
procedure
be
not
as
stringent
as
those
of
the
fda
this
be
unhelpful
and
unfair
from
my
experience
of
deal
with
them
both
i
do
know
that
the
two
regulator
work
in
different
way
the
fda
approach
be
more
process
driven
whereas
the
mhra
s
approach
be
more
interactive
and
more
focus
on
gathering
the
evidence
need
to
ass
the
risk
and
answer
the
scientific
question
by
way
of
illustration
many
year
previously
we
have
be
ask
to
collaborate
with
a
us
group
work
on
malaria
vaccine
development
we
have
already
complete
a
phase
i
clinical
trial
on
a
vaccine
it
have
be
well
tolerate
but
as
happens
a
lot
in
vaccine
development
the
immune
response
be
not
as
high
as
we
have
hop
and
we
be
not
planning
to
proceed
any
far
with
it
but
we
do
still
have
some
of
the
batch
left
and
the
us
group
want
to
do
a
trial
use
our
vaccine
in
combination
with
another
one
to
see
if
that
might
improve
the
immune
response
the
issue
we
come
up
against
be
that
although
we
have
complete
a
clinical
trial
successfully
in
the
uk
the
fda
require
toxicology
study
to
have
be
complete
in
two
different
specie
whereas
in
the
uk
we
only
have
to
complete
a
toxicology
study
in
one
specie
we
have
do
that
and
proceed
to
human
trial
and
show
no
safety
concern
on
a
call
with
the
fda
we
explain
that
we
have
safety
data
from
mouse
and
also
from
human
which
be
a
specie
after
all
so
would
that
work
for
them
the
answer
be
no
they
need
toxicology
study
from
another
animal
specie
a
rat
or
a
rabbit
the
problem
be
that
if
we
do
a
toxicology
study
in
rat
or
rabbit
it
would
use
up
the
limited
amount
of
vaccine
that
be
remain
and
we
wouldn
t
then
be
able
to
do
the
clinical
trial
we
be
stuck
if
we
do
the
toxicology
study
the
fda
require
we
wouldn
t
be
able
to
do
the
clinical
trial
and
if
we
didn
t
do
the
toxicology
study
they
require
we
wouldn
t
be
able
to
do
the
clinical
trial
my
colleague
professor
adrian
hill
who
be
lead
the
malaria
vaccine
programme
come
up
with
what
i
thought
be
a
very
pragmatic
solution
he
point
out
that
normally
a
toxicology
study
would
be
do
in
equal
number
of
male
and
female
animal
to
prepare
for
do
a
phase
i
safety
trial
in
male
and
female
human
he
suggest
that
if
we
only
do
half
of
the
toxicology
study
in
either
male
or
female
we
would
only
use
half
of
the
remain
vaccine
we
would
then
have
enough
vaccine
to
do
a
phase
i
trial
in
whatever
sex
of
human
the
toxicology
study
have
be
do
in
it
be
not
something
we
would
normally
propose
but
it
would
untie
the
knot
we
be
however
unable
to
come
to
an
agreement
so
the
clinical
trial
be
never
carry
out
it
be
frustrate
but
regulatory
authority
be
complex
organisation
whose
operation
have
developed
independently
out
of
the
need
of
the
country
in
which
they
operate
they
all
have
very
similar
aim
they
each
pursue
those
aim
with
integrity
stringency
and
rigour
but
their
way
of
work
and
precise
requirement
can
be
different
during
the
pandemic
we
want
the
vaccine
to
be
make
available
in
as
many
country
as
possible
which
meant
engage
with
a
multitude
of
regulatory
authority
and
their
different
requirement
fn
as
our
trial
continued
in
the
uk
brazil
south
africa
india
and
japan
they
remain
on
hold
in
the
us
apparently
it
be
very
rare
for
the
fda
to
impose
a
clinical
hold
on
a
trial
that
have
already
be
pause
by
the
trial
sponsor
in
this
case
astrazeneca
and
it
can
be
a
slow
procedure
to
get
it
lift
october
roll
on
case
number
in
the
uk
be
on
the
rise
especially
in
university
town
and
the
north
and
a
new
tiering
system
of
escalate
restriction
come
into
force
despite
the
high
stake
the
mundane
day
to
day
continued
we
still
have
wasp
in
the
shower
room
and
in
an
unrelated
incident
our
dishwasher
broke
finally
on
october
after
seven
week
of
delay
the
us
trial
restart
when
it
have
be
pause
people
have
be
enrol
at
nineteen
separate
site
six
day
after
the
hold
be
lift
that
number
be
already
and
recruitment
continued
rapidly
reach
a
total
of
volunteer
mainly
in
the
united
state
but
also
in
chile
and
peru
trial
participant
be
ethnically
diverse
about
be
old
than
and
have
condition
such
as
diabetes
severe
obesity
or
heart
disease
that
put
them
at
increase
risk
of
severe
covid
because
of
difference
in
trial
design
positive
covid
case
be
define
slightly
differently
for
example
and
the
placebo
be
saline
rather
than
the
meningitis
vaccine
the
us
trial
data
would
be
analyse
separately
from
the
data
from
the
oxford
lead
uk
south
africa
and
brazil
trial
however
since
it
be
in
itself
a
large
trial
which
have
start
later
and
would
therefore
likely
reach
its
conclusion
later
we
hop
that
it
would
not
only
allow
us
to
achieve
emergency
use
approval
in
the
united
state
but
also
provide
independent
confirmation
of
the
result
from
the
oxford
lead
trial
by
the
end
of
october
with
case
number
continue
to
rise
we
felt
like
we
be
win
against
the
wasp
we
be
down
to
one
or
two
per
day
in
quiet
moment
my
mind
start
to
turn
to
christmas
and
how
to
safely
gather
in
my
son
and
mother
in
law
who
be
over
and
live
on
her
own
over
an
hour
s
drive
away
however
quiet
moment
be
not
easy
to
come
by
rise
case
number
be
bad
for
the
country
but
good
for
the
trial
on
hallowe
en
a
second
month
long
lockdown
be
announce
to
try
to
get
the
case
number
down
with
more
people
across
the
uk
get
infect
and
plenty
of
infection
in
brazil
south
africa
and
the
us
as
well
the
day
we
have
be
wait
for
since
the
summer
be
surely
get
closer
we
be
confident
we
would
have
result
before
the
end
of
the
year
whenever
we
do
get
the
result
though
there
would
still
be
a
lot
to
do
before
the
vaccine
could
start
go
into
people
s
arm
we
would
need
to
provide
all
the
data
to
the
regulator
who
would
need
to
review
it
and
decide
whether
to
license
the
vaccine
for
emergency
use
and
in
which
part
of
the
population
usually
a
trial
would
complete
all
the
expect
follow
up
perhaps
a
year
for
all
participant
report
its
efficacy
result
and
then
the
task
of
prepare
the
data
for
the
regulator
to
review
would
begin
but
as
we
have
throughout
the
year
we

that
would
usually
be
do
in
sequence
we
do
not
know
exactly
when
we
would
need
to
have
all
the
analysis
ready
but
as
if
prepare
to
take
an
exam
to
be
sat
on
an
unknown
date
or
run
a
race
with
an
unknown
finish
line
we
be
work
hard
to
prepare
there
be
about
half
a
million
page
of
data
to
check
it
be
not
a
small
task
every
interaction
between
a
volunteer
and
a
clinic
of
which
there
be
ten
of
thousand
have
to
be
review
and
the
data
extract
every
report
of
a
sore

a

have
to

manner
every
immune
response
of
every
volunteer
test
follow
vaccination
have
to
be
log
and
checked
there
be
also
a
complex
process
in
which
an
independent
adjudication
panel
have
to
review
every
positive
covid
case
to
decide
whether
it
qualify
to
be
include
in
the
primary
the
most
important
analysis
when
someone
in
the
trial
developed
symptom
that
might
be
covid
they
have
to
contact
the
clinic
where
they
have
be
vaccinate
and
arrange
to
go
in
for
a
test
at
the
clinic
a
doctor
would
record
their
symptom
and
do
a
swab
test
the
volunteer
could
then
leave
with
instruction
to
follow
whatever
local
guidance
be
in
place
at
the
time
for
those
wait
for
a
test
result
however
this
be
not
enough
for
someone
to
be
count
as
a
case
the
adjudication
panel
have
to
review
the
record
of
symptom
to
check
that
they
include
at
least
one
of
cough
shortness
of
breath
fever
above
degree
and
loss
of
smell
or
taste
the
covid
test
result
have
to
be
a
clear
positive
use
a
recognise
pcr
test
and
it
have
to
have
occur
at
least
fifteen
day
after
the
second
vaccination
fn
additionally
for
the
primary
analysis
the
case
only
count
if
the
volunteer
have
be
seronegative
meaning
they
didn
t
already
have
antibody
to
sars
cov
when
vaccinate
when
our
trial
have
start
there
have
be
no
way
of
check
this
because
there
be
no
antibody
test
this
be
fine
because
we
need
to
collect
some
safety
data
in
people
who
be
seropositive
but
since
they
couldn
t
be
include
in
the
efficacy
analysis
we
didn
t
want
too
many
of
them
later
the
staff
in
our
immunology
lab
developed
a
test
we
could
use
in
the
lab
we
begin
to
test
blood
sample
from
the
volunteer
before
we
vaccinate
them
and
only
accepted
those
with
a
negative
antibody
result
into
the
trial
as
the
trial
expand
around
the
country
some
sent
us
blood
sample
to
test
for
antibody
and
others
do
their
own
test
the
test
be
a
bit
of
a
mixture
but
they
allow
us
to
get
on
with
the
trial
use
volunteer
who
be
probably
seronegative
however
for
the
regulatory
submission
this
wasn
t
good
enough
blood
sample
that
we
have
store
from
the
day
of
vaccination
in
all
the
volunteer
who
have
go
on
to
develop
covid
symptom
and
have
a
positive
pcr
test
have
to
be
found
from
our
many
freezer
and
sent
to
a
lab
in
the
us
to
be
test
again
shipment
of
those
sample
have
to
include
temperature
tracker
so
that
we
knew
they
hadn
t
thawed
out
in
transit
the
result
be
then
sent
back
by
secure
data
transfer
to
the
statistician
who
match
them
up
with
that
particular
volunteer
s
other
information
for
the
adjudication
panel
to
review
although
i
knew
that
all
of
this
be
go
on
i
be
not
personally
involve
with
it
it
be
a
strange
time
wait
for
the
case
to
mount
up
and
be
judged
so
that
we
could
do
the
analysis
and
work
out
how
effective
our
vaccine
be
it
be
in
some
way
the
goal
we
have
be
work
towards
all
year
but
we
also
knew
it
would
be
the
begin
of
something
much
big
we
didn
t
know
when
it
would
happen
and
we
didn
t
know
what
would
happen
next
we
just
have
to
carry
on
work
and
carry
on
wait

sunday
november
be
remembrance
sunday
and
the
village
church
be
ring
the
bell
for
the
service
i
have
not
slept
well
that
week
and
by
the
weekend
i
be
very
tire
and
not
feel
very
productive
non
work
issue
be
get
to
me
more
than
work
the
us
election
for
one
like
many
others
i
expect
i
found
myself
more
than
once
wake
and
check
the
news
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
don
t
normally
take
much
interest
in
the
politics
of
the
us
any
more
than
i
would
the
politics
of
other
country
that
i
don
t
live
in
but
this
year
with
the
pandemic
rag
out
of
control
across
the
us
cause
death
every
day
the
outcome
of
the
election
meant
a
lot
more
than
usual
another
source
of
stress
for
the
last
two
week
have
be
my
daughter
take
their
postpone
final
exam
for
their
degree
it
be
much
bad
for
them
than
for
me
of
course
but
some
of
the
stress
rubbed
off
and
i
be
concerned
that
our
home
internet
might
let
them
down
when
they
need
to
download
or
upload
the
exam
paper
thought
about
how
to
get
the
family
together
for
christmas
be
also
on
my
mind
on
friday
i
be
too
tire
to
work
well
and
i
spent
saturday
in
the
office
catch
up
on
a
lot
of
thing
i
should
have
already
do
on
sunday
i
decide
to
give
myself
a
day
off
before
return
to
the
fray
on
monday
i
do
the
last
day
of
the
thirty
day
upper
body
challenge
i
have
be
do
it
have
take
me
a
lot
longer
than
thirty
day
because
i
kept
add
in
unscheduled
rest
day
but
i
be
determine
to
finish
and
then
sat
down
with
a
coffee
after
that
my
mind
spun
off
into
a
pattern
i
be
familiar
with
from
when
my
child
be
baby
and
i
have
no
free
time
it
go
if
i
have
or
now
that
i
have
a
few
free
hour
what
would
i
what
shall
i
do
with
them
there
be
so
much
i
have
neglect
what
would
it
be
my
garden
need
attention
as
do
my
hair
and
nail
i
want
to
be
creative
to
cook
knit
or
sew
but
all
of
those
require
some
preparation
and
i
didn
t
have
enough
time
for
that
maybe
i
should
just
try
to
get
some
more
sleep
or
light
a
fire
and
find
a
film
to
watch
with
a
cup
of
tea
i
might
not
have
another
day
off
for
a
long
time
so
how
should
i
best
make
use
of
this
one
in
the
end
i
recognise
the
pattern
for
what
it
be
put
on
a
wash
and
then
force
myself
out
for
a
run
i
be
still
cycling
to
work
but
i
hadn
t
be
out
run
since
the
summer
when
i
have
struggle
with
my
fitness
it
wasn
t
great
but
it
wasn
t
terrible
either
and
in
the
last
stretch
which
be
a
gentle
downhill
i
do
feel
that
i
be
get
into
my
stride
i
reach
my
front
door
and
be
bending
down
to
undo
my
run
shoe
start
to
feel
very
pleased
with
myself
for
a
good
effort
that
morning
when
i
heard
a
buzzing
to
my
right
and
then
felt
a
sharp
jab
of
pain
on
my
ear
i
have
not
even
be
allow
five
second
of
self
congratulation
before
the
wasp
intervene
i
felt
robbed
but
there
be
nothing
to
do
but
head
back
into
the
house
ear
throb
sarah
chapter
to

and
beyond
november
january
confirm

million
million
confirm
death
million
million
on
november
after
day
of
knife
edge
uncertainty
it
become
clear
that
joe
biden
have
won
the
us
presidential
election
the
follow
day
more
fog
lift
as
biontech
and
pfizer
announce
the
efficacy
result
of
their
phase
iii
trial
as
they
have
to
they
report
their
result
by
press
release
and
there
would
be
a
lot
more
detail
to
come
nonetheless
their
efficacy
number
look
sensational
and
it
be
a
wonderful
moment
of
hope
for
the
world
no
one
on
my
team
felt
that
because
we
have
not
get
there
first
we
have
lose
a
race
be
fast
be
enormously
important
but
be
first
be
incidental
instead
we
felt
a
huge
sense
of
relief
we
now
knew
that
it
be
possible
to
make
a
vaccine
to
protect
people
against
sars
cov
something
we
have
not
know
for
certain
the
day
before
a
week
later
on
monday
november
come
another
sensational
announcement
from
moderna
their
result
look
if
anything
slightly
well
than
pfizer
s
at
the
time
we
be
release
a
paper
on
safety
and
immune
response
in
old
people
which
be
somewhat
overshadow
in
the
medium
by
all
the
other
good
vaccine
news
nonetheless
what
we
be
show
in
this
paper
be
yet
another
real
cause
for
celebration
vaccination
don
t
always
work
as
well
in
old
people
but
the
blood
test
from
our
trial
participant
show
that
even
in
the
old
volunteer
the
vaccine
be
induce
good
level
of
the
right
kind
of
antibody
and
t
cell
with
no
apparent
difference
in
immune
response
between
age
group
because
old
people
be
so
prone
to
serious
illness
and
death
from
covid
this
be
a
crucially
important
find
these
be
of
course
healthy
old
people
because
this
be
a
phase
ii
study
and
perhaps
not
fully
representative
of
the
general
population
of
over
s
in
the
uk
but
with
the
study
show
no
drop
off
in
immune
response
even
in
those
age
over
at
least
we
now
knew
that
age
itself
be
not
a
barrier
to
strong
immune
response
the
wait
for
our
efficacy
result
be
finally
over
the
follow
monday
november
it
be
a
moment
we
have
be
dream
of
and
wait
for
it
be
an
enormous
achievement
and
yet
like
so
many
other
big
moment
that
year
it
be
not
an
end
it
be
just
the
begin
of
the
next
phase
we
be
one
step
closer
to
the
time
when
the
devastation
cause
by
sars
cov
would
be
brought
to
an
end
but
we
be
not
there
yet
we
enjoy
the
celebratory
headline
we
bit
our
tongue
at
the
confuse
or
critical
one
and
we
try
to
stay
focus
on
our
next
task
review
all
the
data
in
detail
again
before
publishing
it
for
scrutiny
by
the
scientific
community
in
the
lancet
and
submit
it
to
the
regulator
in
the
uk
the
mhra
and
the
eu
the
ema
it
would
then
be
up
to
the
regulator
to
decide
whether
to
give
the
vaccine
emergency
use
licensure
so
it
could
be
use
in
the
real
world
there
be
small
but
important
detail
in
the
data
that
take
time
to
iron
out
for
example
a
couple
of
severe
adverse
event
have
be
cod
as
no
adverse
event
which
clearly
didn
t
make
sense
after
investigation
it
turn
out
that
the
event
in
question
be
both
be
admit
to
hospital
for
plan
surgery
these
should
not
have
be
record
as
severe
adverse
event
saes
so
the
record
be
correct
this
matter
because
the
total
number
of
saes
must
be
report
as
well
as
what
they
be
as
we
discuss
in
the
previous
chapter
the
saes
that
occur
during
a
clinical
trial
usually
follow
the
same
pattern
as
in
the
general
population
but
if
there
be
an
unexpected
increase
in
any
type
of
adverse
event
it
could
be
a
consequence
of
vaccination
and
that
then
need
to
be
look
into
and
of
course
we
also
need
to
do
more
work
to
dig
into
the
data
and
try
to
understand
the
unexpected
aspect
of
our
trial
result
be
it
really
the
first
half
dose
before
a
standard
dose
that
result
in
high
efficacy
or
something
else
what
be
the
science
drive
it
what
be
its
implication
through
the
follow
week
there
be
in
some
way
a
please
sense
of
symmetry
that
a
project
i
have
first
consider
on
the
first
day
of
when
i
have
read
of
the
sars
like
pneumonia
case
in
wuhan
china
could
be
reach
a
climax
at
the
very
end
of
december
with
the
anticipate
emergency
use
licensure
of
the
vaccine
by
the
mhra
but
that
perspective
be
difficult
to
keep
hold
of
on
the
whole
the
snip
from
the
us
biotech
press
parrot
by
some
in
the
uk
the
increasingly
anxious
mood
in
the
country
as
case
number
continued
to
rise
and
the
logistically
challenge
roll
out
of
the
pfizer
vaccine
get
underway
and
the
usual
end
of
year
activity
be
create
a
rise
sense
of
pressure
within
the
team
we
be
worn
out
and
we
all
need
to
plan
our
covid

i
have
to
be
in
the

at
noon
about
the

and
then
for
an
online
talk
i
be
give
that
even
i
felt
guilty
about
the
number
of
similar

have
turn
down
over
the
past
week

him
to
be
with
us
for
christmas
he

i
be
delighted
when
he
finally
walk
through
the
front
door
we
hug
and
i
admire
his
new
haircut
which
one
of
his
flatmate
have
give
him
the
day
before
my
family
be
safely
gather
but
the
atmosphere
in
the
country
be
get
increasingly
feverish
a
new
variant
of
sars
cov
know
as
the
kent
variant
seem
to
be
responsible
for
soar
case
number
the
government
be
make
confuse
new
announcement
seemingly
every
day
about
different
part
of
the
country
move
into
more
restrictive
tier
each
tier
have
different
and
complicate
rule
about
how
many
people
could
meet
indoors
in
the
garden
or
in
public
space
and
there
be
more
rule
about
move
between
part
of
the
country
in
different
tier
over
the
weekend
the

temporary
christmas
bubble
be
finally
scrap
and
a
new
tier
lockdown
by
any
other
name
be
introduce
by
the
follow
monday
with
christmas
fast
approach
france
have
close
its
border
to
lorry
from
the
uk
cause
supermarket
to
warn
there
might
soon
be
food
shortage
and
the
daily
mail
be
call
for
the
mhra
to
hurry
up
and
approve
our
vaccine
as
it
be
reveal
that
only
people
have
be
vaccinate
since
the
begin
of
the
pfizer
roll
out
nearly
two
week
earlier
although
there
be
report
of
gp
practice
struggle
with
the
logistics
of
book
in
patient
and
then
run
the
clinic
with
all
the
necessary
social
distance
the
limit
factor
be
not
the
nh
s
ability
to
vaccinate
people
but
the
number
of
dos
available
at
this
rate
it
would
take
more
than
a
year
to
vaccinate
just
the
million
people
in
the
top
four
priority
group
that
monday
before
christmas
we
make
our
final
data
submission
to
the
mhra
it
be
page
long
and
the
mhra
say
it
would
take
a
minimum
of
seven
day
to
review
we
would
be
check
our
phone
all
through
christmas
in
case
of
any
news
but
i
didn
t
expect
to
hear
anything
for
a
while
i
also
didn
t
think
anyone
at
the
mhra
would
be
get
much
of
a
christmas

that
same
day
i
begin
the
work
to
produce
two
new
version
of
our
vaccine
i
have
hop
that
we
could
wait
until
before
start
all
over
again
but
with
report
of
rapidly
spread
mutant
strain
i
felt
we
have
to
start
straightaway
over
the
last
couple
of
week
news
of
variant
of
sars
cov
that
behave
differently
from
the
original
virus
have
be
come
in
as
always
data
arrive
piecemeal
to
be
put
together
into
a
full
understand
and
as
always
we
need
to
take
action
before
we
have
the
perfect
data
set
and
as
always
section
of
the
press
demand
certainty
immediately
what
become
clear
quite
quickly
be
that
a
variant
variously
know
as
the
kent
variant
the
english
variant
or
b
be
more
transmissible
than
the
original
virus
and
be
rapidly
move
through
england
the
spike
protein
of
the
virus
have
mutate
and
become
well
able
to
bind
to
the
relevant
receptor
on
the
surface
of
human
cell
than
the
original
virus
this
be
not
a
particularly
surprising
development
it
be
how
evolution
work
random
mutation
follow
by
the
natural
selection
of
version
with
advantageous
trait
a
virus
that
have
randomly
mutate
so
that
it
can
no
longer
infect
people
will
disappear
a
virus
that
have
randomly
mutate
so
that
it
infects
people
more
easily
will
have
an
advantage
and
will
quickly
take
over
two
other
potentially
concern
variant
be
also
identify
b
the
so
call
south
african
variant
which
also
involve
change
to
the
spike
protein
and
p
the
so
call
brazilian
variant
although
the
spike
protein
be
what
we
use
in
our
vaccine
it
do
not
look
as
though
the
new
variant
with
slightly
change
spike
protein
would
completely
evade
the
immune
response
our
vaccine
produce
in
other
word
it
seem
our
vaccine
would
still
work
against
the
new
variant
if
not
as
well
as
against
the
original
virus
then
well
enough
not
to
require
a
switch
to
an
update
version
quite
yet
but
just
as
nearly
a
year
earlier
in
january
if
there
be
a
possibility
we
might
need
it
we
have
to
start
make
it
at
risk
and
immediately
so
we
have
to
work
out
the
new
gene
sequence
to
drop
into
the
adenovirus
vector
a
relatively
easy
and
quick
part
of
the
job
we
also
have
to
work
out
how
we
could
move
as
fast
as
possible
at
every
stage
make
the
new
start
material
conduct
new
clinical
trial
switch
over
large
scale
manufacturing
from
the
original
vaccine
to
the
new
one
and
get
the
new
vaccine
license
this
all
need
to
have
be
work
through
in
advance
so
that
if
and
when
we
need
to
switch
we
have
the
best
and
fast
possible
process
plan
out
and
ready
to
go
i
place
order
for
some
new
dna
sequence
and
cath
and
i
start
planning
again

my
family
have
a
quiet
christmas
which
i
for
one
be
very
happy
with
we
have
a
film
night
cocktail
before
dinner
on
christmas
eve
and
on
christmas
day
my
daughter
cooked
an
absolutely
splendid
christmas
lunch
with
all
the
trimming
i
watch
some
tv
do
a
bit
of
knit
and
a
bit
of
the
christmas
jigsaw
lit
the
woodburning
stove
and
snooze
on
the
sofa
but
always
keep
my
phone
close
in
case
of
any
news
case
number
kept
rise
hospital
number
be
rise
too
the
paper
continued
to
be
full
of
impatient
speculation
about
when
our
vaccine
would
be
license
with
prediction
that
it
would
be
a
game
changer
as
there
would
then
be
so
many
more
dos
of
a
vaccine
that
be
so
much
easy
to
deliver
there
be
obviously
a
tension
between
get
people
vaccinate
as
soon
as
possible
and
allow
the
mhra
time
to
complete
their
review
i
felt
it
like
everyone
else
on
the
th
i
give
up
on
obey
everyone
s
instruction
to
enjoy
some
downtime
while
i
could
and
go
into
the
office
i
knew
my
inbox
have
continued
to
fill
up
over
christmas
and
i
be
find
it
difficult
to
switch
off
while
we
wait
for
news
it
be
i
imagine
like
wait
for
the
birth
of
a
grandchild
there
s
nothing
you
can
do
but
you
can
t
just
forget
about
it
and
carry
on
as
normal
my
mother
always
complain
about
how
stressful
it
be
for
her
wait
to
hear
about
my
triplet
be
born
when
she
do
i
always
thought
to
myself
that
however
hard
it
be
to
be
wait
give
birth
be
bad
twenty
two
year
earlier
i
have
go
into
labour
ten
week
early
at
thirty
week
that
meant
all
three
baby
be
probably
go
to
need
ventilator
to
help
them
breathe
but
the
hospital
only
have
one
that
be
suitable
there
be
discussion
about
deliver
one
baby
and
then
transfer
me
with
the
first
baby
on
the
portable
ventilator
to
a
different
hospital
with
more
ventilator
by
this
point
there
be
no
chance
of
transfer
me
before
any
of
the
baby
be
born
if
we
try
i
be
warn
the
baby
will
be
deliver
in
the
ambulance
so
there
be
a
real
risk
of
me
be
separate
from
one
or
more
of
the
baby
and
they
might
not
all
survive
the
first
baby
be
deliver
breathe
without
need
a
ventilator
and
be
whisk
off
to
the
special
care
baby
unit
i
spent
the
next
sixteen
hour
on
intravenous
drug
to
try
to
stop
my
labour
and
hooked
up
to
multiple
monitor
to
keep
track
of
my
contraction
and
the
baby
heartbeat
but
the
high
dose
of
the
drug
start
to
affect
my
heart
and
when
it
be
reduce
my
contraction
start
again
eventually
a
plan
to
take
me
to
visit
my
firstborn
be
abandon
and
i
be
instead
take
back
to
the
operating
theatre
to
deliver
the
other
two
baby
they
also
breathe
without
assistance
and
be
admit
to
the
high
dependency
unit
for
baby
in
a
less
critical
condition
than
those
in
the
special
care
baby
unit
where
they
be
join
by
their
old
sibling
the
next
day
this
time
it
be
me
in
the
role
of
the
grandmother
wait
for
the
mhra
to
approve
our
vaccine
and
that
be
fine
i
remind
myself
that
however
hard
it
be
to
be
wait
all
around
the
world
others
healthcare
worker
struggle
to
cope
with
the
influx
of
covid
patient
and
patient
struggle
to
breathe
be
go
through
bad
by
the
end
of
the
day
i
knew
that
licensure
be
come
the
announcement
would
be
make
by
the
mhra
on
the
morning
of
wednesday
december
and
that
be
the
end
of
the
story
and
we
all
live
happily
ever
after

if
only
life
could
be
so
simple
of
course
it
wasn
t
over
astrazeneca
have
million
of
dos
ready
but
would
need
to
make
hundred
of
million
more
the
vaccine
still
have
to
be
roll
out
and
put
into
people
s
arm
throughout
the
world
a
task
just
as
huge
as
make
the
vaccine
and
prove
it
work
and
the
virus
be
still
out
there
as
transmission
continued
there
be
potential
for
more
worry
mutation
to
arise
you
might
have
expect
though
that
for
the
oxford
team
who
be
not
oversee
global
manufacturing
or
the
vaccine
roll
out
the
time
between
the
vaccine
be
approve
by
the
mhra
on
december
and
the
first
vaccination
be
administer
on
january
would
have
be
fairly
quiet
a
chance
to
reflect
on
a
full
year
of
hard
work
with
success
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
the
prospect
of
lot
of
people
be
vaccinate
very
soon
perhaps
a
moment
to
finally
congratulate
ourselves
on
what
we
have
accomplish
that
wasn
t
how
thing
turn
out
instead
just
as
i
be
metaphorically
undo
my
trainer
with
that
post
run
sense
of
achievement
and
pride
a
wasp
stung
me
on
the
ear
we
do
receive
some
congratulation
but
the
medium
be
also
full
of
anxiety
and
criticism
over
various
aspect
of
the
vaccine
roll
out
the
decision
to
license
two
full
dos
twelve
week
apart
the
speed
of
the
roll
out
whether
the
vaccine
would
work
against
new
variant
and
so
on
this
be
all
a
bit
irritate
but
the
anxiety
be
understandable
a
record
new
case
be
record
in
the
uk
on
december
hospital
be
close
to
become
overwhelmed
and
it
be
not
clear
whether
even
another
lockdown
would
bring
thing
under
control
and
we
have
do
our
job
so
the
criticism
wasn
t
too
hard
to
ignore
that
be
just
buzzing
then
come
the
real
sting
which
could
have
derail
the
entire
vaccination
programme
potentially
roll
out
of
our
vaccine
be
about
to
be
halt
before
it
have
even
begin
as
cath
explain
in
chapter
our
vaccine
be
manufacture
use
a
human
cell
line
hek
cell
after
we
have
grown
the
vaccine
in
the
cell
we
then
separate
out
the
bit
we
want
to
keep
the
adenoviral
vectored
vaccine
from
the
component
of
the
cell
that
we
don
t
need
any
more
each
batch
be
then
test
to
make
sure
that
have
happen
however
there
be
other
viral
vectored
vaccine
that
be
make
use
different
type
of
virus
that
be
surround
by
a
lipid
fat
envelope
as
those
viral
vectored
vaccine
be
also
produce
inside
cell
during
manufacturing
some
of
the
protein
from
the
production
cell
will
be
incorporate
into
the
virus
s
lipid
envelope
and
remain
as
part
of
the
vaccine
even
after
purification
if
the
production
cell
be
of
human
origin
then
those
protein
will
include
human
leukocyte
antigen
or
hlas
hlas
be
part
of
the
immune
system
and
there
be
lot
of
different
version
of
them
we
inherit
our
own
particular
combination
of
them
from
our
parent
and
that
combination
be
what
we
be
look
at
when
we
look
at
someone
s
tissue
type
before
they
receive
an
organ
transplant
it
be
the
job
of
the
immune
system
to
distinguish
between
self
thing
that
be
part
of
us
and
be
suppose
to
be
there
and
non
self
thing
that
be
foreign
and
should
be
attack
if
a
kidney
transplant
take
place
between
identical
twin
there
will
be
no
rejection
of
the
donate
kidney
because
identical
twin
have
identical
hla
molecule
in
their
cell
include
in
the
cell
of
the
donate
kidney
between
stranger
it
be
necessary
to
find
as
close
a
match
as
possible
and
the
recipient
will
probably
still
need
to
stay
on
immunosuppressive
drug
to
prevent
rejection
if
someone
be
vaccinate
with
an
envelop
viral
vectored
vaccine
manufacture
on
a
human
cell
line
then
it
be
possible
they
could
become
sensitise
to
the
hla
molecule
from
that
cell
line
which
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
receive
a
transplant
should
they
ever
need
to
it
be
point
out
to
us
and
to
the
mhra
that
this
have
in
fact
happen
in
a
small
clinical
trial
of
a
candidate
vaccine
against
hiv
this
have
end
the
development
of
that
particular
vaccine
in
between
the
mhra
give
approval
for
use
of
the
vaccine
and
the
initiation
of
the
vaccination
campaign
we
suddenly
found
ourselves
be
ask
to
prove
that
this
be
not
go
to
happen
with
our
vaccine
of
course
this
be
a
purely
theoretical
concern
although
an
important
one
adenovirus
be
not
envelop
virus
they
contain
no
lipid
at
all
also
one
of
the
final
test
on
each
batch
of
vaccine
be
to
measure
the
amount
of
host
cell
protein
remain
and
it
have
to
fall
below
a
very
low
limit
so
there
be
no
reason
to
expect
that
intact
hla
molecule
might
be
present
and
might
result
in
sensitisation
we
search
the
scientific
literature
for
any
publication
relate
to
this
but
there
be
none
no
one
have
ever
report
on
the
absence
of
hla
sensitisation
after
adenoviral
vectored
vaccination
probably
because
there
be
no
reason
to
expect
that
it
might
happen
so
no
one
have
be
motivate
to
find
out
but
since
there
be
nothing
in
the
literature
that
meant
there
be
nothing
reassure
in
the
literature
the
other
approach
that
we
could
take
be
to
measure
the
reactivity
to
hla
molecule
in
the
blood
of
some
of
our
volunteer
to
see
if
there
be
any
sign
that
this
could
have
be
increase
by
vaccination
so
on
new
year
s
day
staff
be
in
the
lab
find
and
pack
up
blood
sample
to
send
off
for
test
since
woman
who
have
be
pregnant
will
become
sensitise
to
the
hla
molecule
that
their
baby
have
inherit
from
their
father
it
be
simplest
to
stick
to
sample
from
male
trial
participant
six
hundred
sample
take
at
twenty
eight
day
after
the
second
vaccination
when
the
response
if
it
exist
would
have
be
strong
be
packed
up
along
with
match
sample
from
the
day
the
same
volunteer
receive
the
first
vaccination
for
comparison
it
be
quite
a
contrast
from
my
new
year
s
day
of
when
i
be
relax
at
home
and
browsing
a
few
science
website
to
see
if
there
be
anything
interest
go
on
may
you
live
in
interest
time
be
of
course
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
amazingly
by
lunchtime
the
next
day
of
the
pair
of
sample
have
be
analyse
in
an
nh
lab
everything
look
normal
there
be
no
evidence
of
hla
sensitisation
which
be
what
we
have
expect
but
be
now
support
by
data
in
the
follow
twenty
four
hour
the
rest
of
the
sample
be
analyse
and
the
result
present
to
the
mhra
the
theoretical
but
important
issue
be
now
definitely
back
in
the
realm
of
non
issue
in
the
meantime
i
have
be
back
in
the
realm
of
go
into
the
office
regardless
of
weekend
or
bank
holiday
and
keep
secret
from
my
family
which
be
something
i
have
hop
to
be
put
behind
me

wednesday
january
i
felt
a
mix
of
giddy
elation
and
frustration
i
hadn
t
quite
know
what
to
do
with
myself
all
morning
after
much
not
very
patient
wait
i
be
finally
go
to
be
vaccinate
throughout
january
there
have
be
increase
tension
in
the
vaccine
team
there
have
of
course
be
no
happy
end
yet
i
be
now
work
very
hard
on
planning
the
route
to
make
new
version
of
the
vaccine
three
of
them
now
kent
south
africa
and
brazil
along
with
cath
and
her
team
andy
s
team
be
still
follow
up
clinical
trial
participant
with
covid
symptom
to
add
to
the
efficacy
data
and
take
blood
sample
to
ass
how
well
immunity
be
be
maintain
over
time
others
in
te
s
team
be
still
in
the
lab
every
day
measure
immune
response
and
prepare
sample
for
shipping
out
to
other
lab
for
more
test
there
have
be
no
let
up
no
chance
to
take
stock
or
celebrate
and
the
long
day
in
the
lab
that
have
felt
like
a
fun
sprint
in
the
optimistic
day
of
early
summer
have
become
a
marathon
like
slog
the
healthcare
worker
meaning
the
doctor
and
nurse
in
andy
s
team
who
met
the
clinical
trial
volunteer
face
to
face
be
be
vaccinate
follow
a
covid
outbreak
at
one
of
the
site
manufacturing
the
uk
s
supply
of
the
oxford
astrazeneca
vaccine
people
there
be
be
vaccinate
too
fn
this
make
complete
sense
no
one
would
want
supply
of
the
vaccine
to
be
held
up
because
the
people
who
be
suppose
to
be
make
it
be
off
sick
or
quarantine
but
those
who
work
in
cath
s
cbf
make
new
vaccine
to
cope
with
new
variant
and
in
the
immunology
lab
deal
with
swab
from
symptomatic
volunteer
be
not
be
vaccinate
with
case
number
still
very
high
we
all
felt
at
risk
for
ourselves
but
also
for
the
work
we
need
to
do
we
explore
many
avenue
to
try
to
get
vaccine
for
the
team
and
finally
an
email
have
drop
into
my
inbox
invite
me
to
book
an
appointment
join
the
socially
distance
queue
outside
the
clinic
i
felt
elate
because
i
be
about
to
receive
the
vaccine
i
have
start
to
plan
just
over
a
year
ago
i
have
receive
a
vaccine
of
my
own
design
before
but
that
have
be
as
part
of
a
phase
i
safety
trial
this
time
the
vaccine
be
license
for
widespread
use
and
instead
of
be
part
of
a
clinical
trial
i
would
be
receive
it
along
with
everyone
else
i
recognise
some
of
my
colleague
behind
their
mask
also
queue
and
we
exchange
some
muffle
word
about
what
a
great
day
it
be
i
felt
frustrate
because
this
be
not
the
end
after
vaccination
there
would
be
more
wait
two
week
for
immunity
to
kick
in
and
then
much
more
wait
for
transmission
to
drop
dramatically
before
we
could
start
lift
lockdown
restriction
and
return
to
anything
close
to
normality
i
fill
in
my
form
state
and
restate
my
nh
number
roll
up
my
sleeve
and
receive
my
vaccine
i
felt
fine
go
to
bed
that
even
but
at
one
in
the
morning
i
woke
up
feel
nauseous
and
freeze
cold
despite
winter
pyjama
and
a
thick
duvet
my
foot
be
like
block
of
ice
i
get
a
glass
of
water
and
some
woolly
sock
handknitted
by
my
father
thanks
dad
still
look
after
me
get
back
into
bed
and
begin
to
shiver
violently
if
i
tense
my
muscle
i
could
make
the
shiver
stop
but
as
soon
as
i
relaxed
to
try
to
go
back
to
sleep
it
start
up
again
then
i
begin
to
feel
very
hot
i
drank
more
water
take
some
paracetamol
and
eventually
drop
off
when
the
alarm
go
off
at
seven
o
clock
i
felt
normal
again
though
weary
after
a
broken
night
i
felt
grateful
though
i
have
experienced
a
few
hour
of
discomfort
and
now
i
be
tire
but
i
have
know
what
be
happen
the
expect
reaction
to
the
vaccine
and
how
long
it
be
likely
to
last
a
few
hour
this
be
so
much
well
than
start
to
experience
covid
symptom
and
as
have
already
be
the
case
for
more
than
million
people
not
know

thursday

exactly
one
year
after
we
have
kick
off
the
classic
plus
method
to
make
the
start
material
for
the
first
batch
of
our
vaccine
i
be
once
again
wait
to
receive
a
small
empty
look
tube
hold
billion
strand
of
dna
the
dna
be
the
construct
for
the
new
south
african
variant
and
my
team
would
once
more
be
make
it
into
a
vaccine
i
be
as
have
become
the
norm
worried
this
time
we
knew
a
lot
more
about
how
to
make
the
vaccine
and
we
would
be
work
closely
with
astrazeneca
from
the
start
rather
than
try
to
bring
them
on
board
mid
flight
which
would
make
a
big
difference
nonetheless
the
pressure
felt
strangely
similar
to
the
last
time
what
be
the
trial
design
go
to
be
how
many
dos
would
we
need
how
fast
could
we
go
also
there
be
new
anxiety
for
this
year
how
many
more
variant
vaccine
would
we
have
to
make
we
expect
to
be
make
at
least
two
more
but
that
number
would
only
go
up
as
more
variant
of
concern
be
identify
although
it
felt
like
an
end
to
the
pandemic
could
be
in
sight
with
the
rapid
vaccine
roll
out
it
also
felt
like
misstep
over
new
variant
could
set
us
back
again
i
be
not
sure
the
team
could
take
that
our
resilience
be
close
to
crumble

there
will
be
a
next
time
the
next
global
pandemic
will
come
and
well
before
the
start
of
we
be
think
about
what
we
need
to
do
to
be
ready
for
it
but
it
also
become
clear
in
the
early
month
of
as
the
world
start
to
roll
out
our
vaccine
and
others
that
we
be
not
finish
with
sars
cov
and
it
be
not
finish
with
us
there
be
a
lot
that
we
be
still
learn
about
this
tiny
pathogen
that
have
turn
the
world
upside
down
how
could
we
prevent
spread
most
effectively
how
could
we
treat
the
disease
who
be
most
susceptible
how
effective
be
the
various
license
vaccine
go
to

severe

death
mild

how
long
would
the
immunity
from
the
vaccine
last
might
one
dose
of
two
different
vaccine
for
example
pfizer
and
astrazeneca
be
more
effective
than
two
dos
of
the
same
vaccine
while
scientist
continued
to
learn
everything
we
could
about
the
original
virus
and
as
the
good
news
about
the
real
world
effectiveness
of
our
vaccine
and
others
start
to
build
up
we
be
also
have
to
react
to
the
unwelcome
news
of
new
variant
of
concern
slightly
alter
version
of
sars
cov
that
be
now
circulate
and
in
some
case
begin
to
take
over
from
the
original
virus
new
variant
be
inevitable
and
we
have
expect
them
but
we
have
not
perhaps
anticipate
that
they
would
emerge
quite
as
fast
as
they
do
at
the
cbf
we
have
even
allow
ourselves
to
relax
a
little
think
that
our
job
with
covid
be
do
and
we
could
start
to
go
back
to
normal
we
have
possibly
be
lull
into
a
false
sense
of
security
by
the
knowledge
that
coronaviruses
do
not
have
a
very
high
mutation
rate
that
be
they
don
t
make
many
mistake
as
they
make
more
copy
of
themselves
or
replicate
this
be
because
coronaviruses
have
the
ability
to
proofread
to
detect
and
correct
copying
error
by
comparison
hiv
have
a
high
mutation
rate
because
the
hiv
virus
lack
proofread
capability
influenza
be
the
same
and
this
be
what
have
make
it
so
very
challenge
to
create
effective
hiv
and
flu
vaccine
we
do
not
have
this
problem
with
sars
cov
however
we
do
at
the
end
of
have
a
very
large
amount
of
virus
march
through
the
population
of
the
world
and
particularly
high
level
in
the
uk
brazil
and
south
africa
in
that
situation
even
a
statistically
unlikely
event
be
go
to
occur
many
time
most
mutation
result
in
faulty
version
of
the
virus
that
don
t
work
and
so
no
more
copy
can
be
make
and
they
just
disappear
with
no
evidence
they
ever
happen
mutation
that
give
a
virus
some
kind
of
advantage
though
will
start
to
take
over
this
might
not
necessarily
matter
if
the
variant
that
take
over
be
still
susceptible
to
the
immune
response
induced
by
exist
vaccine
but
it
very
much
do
matter
if
the
new
variant
be
able
to
evade
exist
vaccine
in
late
and
early
we
knew
of
three
variant
of
concern
in
reality
there
be
probably
more
because
variant
be
only
be
picked
up
in
the
country
do
a
lot
of
viral
sequence
include
the
uk
the
kent
b
variant
be
more
infectious
than
the
original
virus
because
of
a
change
in
its
spike
protein
that
allow
it
to
be
transmit
more
effectively
because
it
be
be
transmit
more
than
the
original
virus
it
quickly
become
common
in
the
uk
and
seed
itself
around
the
world
in
fact
what
we
call
the
original
virus
be
probably
not
the
original
a
mutation
call
d
gfn
happen
very
early
in
the
pandemic
and
become
the
major
global
variant
that
should
have
be
a
warn
however
by
early
february
we
have
good
evidence
that
the
antibody
induced
by
infection
with
the
original
virus
or
by
vaccination
with
the
original
vaccine
still
neutralise
the
kent
variant
the
initial
cbf
work
to
make
a
vaccine
specifically
target
this
variant
be
therefore
deprioritised
in
favour
of
two
other
variant
of
concern
the
south
african
b
and
brazil
p
variant
these
variant
appear
to
be
less
well
neutralise
by
antibody
induced
by
exist
vaccine
the
mutation
these
variant
have
accumulate
be
stop
the
antibody
generate
by
infection
with
the
original
virus
or
by
vaccination
from
binding
to
the
new
version
of
the
spike
protein
a
phenomenon
call
immune
escape
it
be
not
that
vaccine
would
not
work
against
the
south
africa
and
brazil
variant
at
all
the
sign
be
good
that
the
vaccine
would
still
prevent
death
and
severe
disease
but
it
look
like
they
be
unlikely
to
do
as
well
in
prevent
mild
and
asymptomatic
case
because
all
the
original
vaccine
have
be
make
use
platform
technology
we
happily
do
not
need
to
start
make
new
vaccine
from
scratch
instead
we
could
make
several
potential
new
vaccine
use
the
method
we
have
use
in
replace
the
original
gene
sequence
for
the
original
spike
protein
with
gene
sequence
for
the
new
mutate
version
although
some
part
of
the
process
would
take
just
as
long
as
they
have
in
we
have
not
found
a
quicker
way
to
grow
production
cell
other
part
could
be
speed
up
considerably
with
astrazeneca
fully
involve
throughout
the
process
for
example
the
cbf
would
only
have
to
make
the
initial
start
material
step
from
chapter
the
manufacturing
of
the
vaccine
itself
could
be
do
by
astrazeneca
who
be
now
hugely
experienced
in
production
of
the
vaccine
and
be
capable
of
produce
much
much
large
quantity
than
us
in
almost
the
same
amount
of
time
andy
would
not
need
to
be
knock
on
our
door
every
five
minute
ask
us
how
many
dos
we
be
go
to
make
for
his
trial
and
could
we
please
double
that
number
also
the
clinical
trial
that
we
have
conduct
over
the
last
year
would
not
all
need
to
be
repeat
for
our
annual
flu
vaccine
the
strain
to
be
include
be
decide
on
every
year
and
the
vaccine
be
then
produce
in
the
same
way
as
previously
the
new
version
go
through
a
small
phase
i
ii
clinical
trial
to
demonstrate
that
it
induces
the
expect
immune
response
at
the
same
time
as
million
of
dos
of
the
vaccine
be
be
produce
we
would
probably
be
able
to
follow
a
similar
approach
with
our
covid
vaccine
have
demonstrate
the
safety
immune
response
and
efficacy
of
the
first
version
we
could
probably
simply
test
the
new
vaccine
s
ability
to
induce
antibody
that
neutralise
the
new
coronavirus
variant
as
well
as
the
old
one
in
a
few
hundred
people
we
would
look
at
t
cell
response
as
well
assume
the
vaccine
behave
as
expect
we
should
be
able
to
have
it
ready
for
use
as
a
booster
shot
by
the
autumn
of
as
we
go
forward
we
will
also
need
to
test
how
the
new
variant
vaccine
work
in
people
who
have
previously
be
infect
with
the
original
variant
or
previously
be
immunise
with
the
original
vaccine
we
need
to
make
sure
that
when
the
body
see
a
slightly
modify
version
of
the
vaccine
it
recognises
the
difference
and
make
the
new
kind
of
b
and
t
cell
against
the
new
variant
and
we
will
have
to
work
out
the
best
combination
of
vaccine
for
particular
population
with
particular
combination
of
variant
circulate
we
might
be
able
to
design
one
vaccine
that
work
well
against
both
the
brazil
and
the
south
africa
variant
not
forget
that
the
exist
vaccine
do
still
work
against
them
to
some
extent
we
might
be
able
to
design
pre
emptive
vaccine
against
variant
that
we
have
not
yet
see
but
that
we
can
predict
might
arise
and
might
cause
problem
if
they
do
but
none
of
these
issue
feel
insurmountable
we
also
think
it
be
unlikely
that
the
virus
could
mutate
in
a
way
that
keep
it
function
but
make
our
vaccine
completely
ineffective
that
s
because
a
change
in
the
spike
protein
that
be
radical
enough
to
make
our
vaccine
completely
ineffective
would
also
almost
certainly
be
so
extreme
as
to
make
the
virus
non
functional
so
although
it
feel
like
groundhog
day
and
although
we
be
all
exhaust
and
wonder
when
it
will
ever
end
we
be
tackle
the
new
variant
situation
with
our
teeth
grit
and
the
fortify
knowledge
that
we
know
more
about
what
we
be
do
and
where
we
be
head
we
don
t
know
how
many
more
variant
we
might
be
ask
to
make
over
the
next
year
but
as
global
vaccination
programme
get
go
the
pool
of
circulate
sars
cov
will
decline
make
the
chance
of
new
variant
emergence
decline
too
respond
to
variant
as
they
emerge
will
just
become
a
routine
process
part
of
astrazeneca
s
and
other
vaccine
manufacturer
normal
product
development
we
will
teach
astrazeneca
the
method
of
make
the
very
first
start
material
too
so
that
they
don
t
have
to
rely
on
us
at
all
then
we
can
start
to
get
back
to
our
real
job
make
innovative
medicine
for
disease
that
cause
global
problem
perhaps
now
with
even
great
urgency
only
now
we
can
cross
disease
x
off
our
list
and
move
on
to
disease
y

disease
y
be
come
there
will
be
a
next
time
it
be
inevitable
epidemiologist
and
specialist
in
zoonotic
meaning
animal
to
human
transmission
have
already
warn
about
how
the
trade
in
wildlife
and
the
pressure
create
by
intensive
farm
on
industrial
scale
be
create
the
opportunity
for
disease
y
to
emerge
it
make
sense
the
more
frequently
human
be
in
close
proximity
with
other
specie
especially
if
those
animal
be
kept
in
unsanitary
condition
the
more
likely
it
be
that
a
naturally
occur
variant
of
an
animal
virus
be
that
chicken
pig
bat
or
mink
that
have
randomly
mutate
in
a
way
that
make
it
able
to
infect
a
human
actually
come
in
contact
with
a
human
to
infect
and
of
course
if
that
infect
person
happens
to
live
in
crowd
or
unsanitary
condition
themselves
the
chance
of
onward
transmission
be
increase
but
it
s
easy
for
people
like
me
who
get
our
food
plastic
wrap
from
tesco
or
deliver
to
the
door
in
a
veg
box
to
yell
just
ban
the
market
the
fact
be
that
this
would
affect
the
life
of
real
people
with
kid
to
feed
it
s
one
of
those
problem
that
i
know
i
need
to
learn
more
about
before
criticise
others
and
come
up
with
simple
solution
we
know
there
will
be
a

just
as
sarah

i
didn
t
know
when
we

that
it

we
don

know
what

y
will
be
we
can
make
some
educate
guess
though
it
could
be
another

have
see
three

there
be
a

about

that
we
still
have
no

vaccine
like
pfizer
s
and
moderna
s
both
cheaper
and
more
thermally
stable
in
the
future
but
it
be
possible
and
it
s
tough
to
say
after
more
than
a
million
death
that
the
next
time
thing
could
be
bad
there
be
aspect
of
sars
cov
that
make
this
pandemic
particularly
difficult
to
contain
aerosol
transmission
asymptomatic
transmission
and
a
long
infectious
period
before
the
onset
of
symptom
be
the
main
one
but
compare
to
other
disease
we
already
know
about
like
nipah
lassa
and
ebola
its
case
fatality
rate
be
low
it
be
certainly
possible
to
envisage
a
future
scenario
in
which
a
highly
contagious
and
much
more
fatal
disease
appear
if
it
also
have
the
transmissibility
characteristic
of
covid
it
could
be
extremely
difficult
to
tackle
so
there
be
an
enormous
imperative
for
us
to
learn
as
much
as
we
can
from
our
experience
of
the
last
year
this
pandemic
be
not
unexpected
in
my
line
of
work
we
have
be
expect
it
and
worry
about
it
for
year
but
it
be
not
properly
prepared
for
it
would
be
terrible
to
have
go
through
everything
we
have
all
go
through
and
then
find
that
the
economic
loss
that
have
be
sustain
and
they
will
be
enormous
mean
that
there
be
still
no
funding
for
pandemic
preparedness
we
need
to
make
sure
that
when
disease
y
arrives
we
be
well
prepared
for
it
than
we
be
for
x
it
seem
to
me
that
there
be
three
broad
area
that
limited
our
response
to
covid
and
that
we
need
to
improve
in
order
to
be
in
a
well
place
the
next
time
infrastructure
include
research
and
manufacturing
system
include
surveillance
stockpile
and
travel
ban
and
global
cooperation
and
collaboration
the
solution
be
not
necessarily
cheap
or
easy
but
nor
be
deal
with
a
pandemic
we
invest
heavily
in
arm
force
and
intelligence
and
diplomacy
to
defend
against
war
in
the
same
way
we
need
to
invest
in
pandemic
preparedness
to
defend
against
pandemic
while
we
have
have
some
funding
in
oxford
for
research
and
development
of
our
platform
technology
before
we
have
not
be
able
to
secure
fund
to
work
on
speed
up
the
process
or
to
work
out
how
to
manufacture
at
scale
academic
vaccine
project
that
attract
funding
be
almost
always
to
make
a
vaccine
for
a
specific
disease
not
to
do
the
underpin
work
on
more
general
improvement
which
every
funding
body
think
a
different
funding
body
should
finance
this
work
could
have
cut
month
off
our
response
time
and
the
amount
we
be
ask
for
a
few
million
pound
look
laughably
tiny
compare
with
the
hundred
of
billion
we
have
have
to
spend
on
fight
this
pandemic
it
be
also
important
to
point
out
that
a
significant
chunk
of
the
uk
funding
sarah
and
others
at
the
university
have
receive
for
vaccine
development
in
recent
year
have
come
from
the
uk
s
official
development
assistance
budget
a
budget
that
have
just
be
cut
of
course
there
be
always
something
else
to
spend
the
money
on
but
it
should
now
be
apparent
that
vaccine
be
a
very
cost
effective
and
powerful
way
to
save
life
i
hope
it
be
also
apparent
that
the
belief
that
we
in
the
uk
do
not
need
to
worry
about
disease
affect
population
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
that
research
on
vaccine
against
these
disease
only
benefit
other
people
be
wrong
and
dangerous
there
be
also
improvement
we
could
make
to
the
funding
mechanism
that
kick
in
once
we
be
in
a
pandemic
situation
in
ukri
take
a
very
successful
approach
to
funding
covid
research
via
a
rapid
mechanism
it
be
base
on
exist
process
and
form
but
cut
out
anything
that
wasn
t
vital
a
committee
of
expert
review
and
approve
application
and
the
detail
of
award
be
make
public
to
maintain
oversight
and
transparency
without
cause
delay
other
funders
remain
wed
to
their
complex
and
slow
application
process
which
must
now
be
overdue
for
a
review
it
be
also
time
to
look
back
at
which
gap
need
to
be
fill
if
we
be
to
be
best
place
to
produce
a
vaccine
the
next
time
we
need
to
and
then
plan
to
fill
those
gap
the
world
must
improve
and
spread
out
its
capacity
to
manufacture
vaccine
at
scale
the
pressure
on
sandy
and
the
astrazeneca
team
to
deliver
a
process
capable
of
manufacturing
million
of
dos
start
from
the
exist
labour
intensive
small
scale
lab
base
work
be
enormous
find
facility
around
the
world
able
to
take
on
the
challenge
of
production
at
scale
have
be
an
extraordinary
achievement
and
this
be
certainly
something
that
we
need
to
improve
for
next
time
in
the
uk
the
government
have
already
identify
before
the
pandemic
that
its
vaccine
manufacturing
capacity
be
extremely
limited
as
a
result
the
vaccine
manufacturing
innovation
centre
vmic
be
currently
be
built
this
facility
will
once
complete
be
available
for
manufacturing
of
vaccine
in
an
emergency
situation
and
would
have
be
a
vital
resource
if
it
have
be
ready
in
time
for
this
crisis
i
be
sure
that
the
uk
will
not
be
alone
in
look
to
develop
our
own
robust
local
manufacturing
capability
facility
be
nothing
without
the
scientist
and
technician
who
work
in
them
the
uk
bioindustry
association
whose
help
be
so
instrumental
in
get
the
manufacturing
project
off
the
ground
right
back
at
the
start
have
identify
that
skill
shortage
be
a
major
risk
for
the
bioindustry
sector
it
be
vital
that
we
train
and
retain
the
next
generation
of
scientist
and
engineer
and
that
mean
support
not
only
for
stem
subject
at
university
but
also
for
training
via
apprenticeship
and
reskilling
scheme
we
also
need
to
enable
the
basic
research
that
allows
the
development
of
the
new
technology
and
new
understand
by
support
our
university
and
have
flexible
science
funding
scheme
that
allow
creativity
and
diversity
of
think
to
flourish
we
have
proven
with
this
vaccine
project
that
the
uk
can
be
a
global
driver
of
innovation
and
we
should
build
on
that
success
if
the
underpin
work
in
technology
development
and
vaccine
manufacturing
have
be
do
in
advance
then
the
production
of
a
new
vaccine
against
disease
y
at
speed
becomes
the
final
flourish
the
cherry
on
top
of
the
cake
the
problem
be
that
people
be
prepared
to
pay
for
the
cherry
but
they
won
t
pay
for
the
cake
you
don
t
have
to
have
be
work
in
vaccine
development
to
have
understood
that
the
system
to
respond
appropriately
to
a
global
pandemic
be
not
as
good
as
they
could
or
should
have
be
whether
it
be
stockpile
essential
ppe
for
healthcare
worker
or
ensure
supply
chain
security
for
vaccine
production
we
need
well
system
implement
at
both
national
and
international
level
before
disease
y
hit
us
the
who
s
early
warn
system
for
disease
emergence
must
also
continue
as
an
international
effort
we
must
surely
have
learnt
that
no
corner
of
the
globe
can
consider
itself
safe
when
a
new
infectious
disease
get
a
hold
i
expect
that
there
will
be
a
global
reassessment
of
process
to
limit
international
travel
or
mitigate
its
effect
through
quarantine
since
it
do
seem
clear
now
that
act
early
on
this
front
save
life
and
protects
economy
and
society
from
some
of
the
impact
of
prolong
harsh
lockdown
learn
lesson
from
country
that
successfully
implement
track
and
trace
system
to
prevent
disease
spread
like
south
korea
vietnam
taiwan
and
japan
will
also
be
crucial
we
need
to
devise
well
system
to
support
people
who
need
to
isolate
we
need
to
think
in
advance
about
how
we
will
financially
support
those
whose
livelihood
be
suddenly
lose
because
of
pandemic
response
and
how
we
continue
to
make
available
public
space
and
service
church
playground
school
meal
rather
than
withdraw
them
often
from
very
vulnerable
people
just
when
they
be
most
need
in
term
of
vaccine
we
could
streamline
and
pre
plan
both
vaccine
trial
and
vaccine
deployment
in
both
case
we
could
pre
register
volunteer
regulatory
body
could
issue
pre
agree
guidance
on
trial
design
to
speed
up
the
trial
approval
process
global
recognition
of
trial
design
could
streamline
licensure
and
global
roll
out
these
thing
sound
tedious
and
bureaucratic
even
as
i
write
them
but
the
consequence
of
get
them
right
be
enormous
there
be
vaccine
stock
sit
in
fridge
not
be
use
because
we
have
fail
on
this
front
and
we
know
that
delay
cost
life
run
through
all
of
this
be
international
cooperation
and
collaboration
as
tedros
ghebreyesus
the
director
general
of
the
who
and
many
others
have
say
no
one
be
safe
until
we
be
all
safe
if
the
disease
be
run
wild
in
other
country
then
even
once
we
have
vaccinate
everyone
in
the
country
we
live
in
we
remain
at
risk
from
someone
hop
onto
a
plane
unknowingly
carry
an
emerge
variant
that
can
escape
exist
vaccine
so
for
once
the
self
interested
thing
to
do
and
the
altruistic
thing
to
do
be
the
same
it
would
be
to
everyone
s
benefit
if
we
could
distribute
vaccine
more
evenly
across
the
world
so
that
the
most
vulnerable
could
be
vaccinate
and
the
pool
of
virus
could
be
shrunk
the
situation
in
india
in
the
spring
of
when
a
huge
surge
in
case
threaten
to
overwhelm
health
service
after
another
highly
transmissable
variant
of
the
virus
emerge
have
show
us
there
be
no
room
for
complacency
globally
the
covax
scheme
be
enable
richer
country
to
pledge
financial
support
for
vaccine
purchase
for
poorer
country
which
be
a
good
start
it
would
be
even
well
if
vaccine
rich
country
start
give
a
proportion
of
their
vaccine
stock
right
now
if
every
vaccine
rich
country
provide
of
its
stock
to
rapidly
support
vaccination
in
transmission
hotspot
it
could
have
a
phenomenal
global
effect
on
disease
reduction
there
be
plenty
of
thing
we
as
a
society
can
do
to
be
well
prepared
for
a
future
outbreak
or
pandemic
at
least
in
term
of
have
vaccine
ready
quicker
next
time
but
what
next
for
sarah
and
me
sarah
will
return
to
the
vaccine
project
she
be
work
on
before
covid
she
have
have
to
leave
them
to
one
side
for
more
than
a
year
but
at
least
she
will
now
be
able
to
use
what
we
learn
in
to
help
accelerate
them
for
example
might
it
be
cost
effective
give
how
much
flu
cost
the
economy
to
work
on
flu
vaccine
development
with
as
much
urgency
as
we
apply
to
the
covid
vaccine
it
would
require
more
funding
upfront
and
the
acceptance
that
not
everything
that
be
try
would
work
but
it
might
be
the
way
to
make
some
real
progress
rather
than
continue
to
limp
along
as
we
have
in
the
past
with
small
project
and
no
join
up
approach
i
will
continue
make
vaccine
for
my
colleague
at
the
university
not
just
against
virus
we
be
also
work
on
a
project
to
tackle
gonorrhoea
among
others
and
i
want
to
try
to
get
the
capital
investment
to
bring
my
facility
into
the
twenty
first
century
the
dream
be
a
new
large
facility
where
we
can
make
more
innovative
medicine
not
just
vaccine
but
protein
and
gene
therapy
too
to
tackle
cancer
and
blindness
and
lung
disease
and
not
just
for
my
oxford
colleague
but
for
academic
across
the
uk
there
be
still
a
lot
of
disease
out
there
that
need
cure
and
my
team
want
to
help
but
first
we
both
need
some
time
to
recover
from
the
whirlwind
of
the
last
eighteen
month
or
so
it
have
be
an
honour
and
a
privilege
to
work
on
this
project
but
it
have
also
take
its
toll
andy
who
have
also
kept
go
without
pause
through
all
of
it
say
it
have
age
him
ten
year
when
an
interviewer
ask
him
and
sarah
recently
and
what
do
you
look
forward
to
do
once
the
pandemic
be
over
they
both
just
star
blankly
at
their
screen
before
andy
say
he
couldn
t
really
remember
what
life
use
to
be
like
te
say
to
me
around
the
end
of
february
be
we
do
yet
another
colleague
say
he

experience
i
know
how
he
feel
we
have
all
kept
go
because
we
have
to
but
now
we
be
look
forward
to
the
ebb
away
of
the
adrenaline
and
cortisol
that
have
kept
us
move
all

sarah
need
to
potter
in
her
garden
and
dust
off
her
run
shoe
i
need
to
buy
a
round
of
drink
dance
in
a
crowd
and
see
my
daughter
hug
my
mum
we
both
need
to
experience
some
day
off
without
constant
check
of
email
then
battery
recharge
we
will
be
ready
for
the
next
challenge

we
have
all
spoken
about
get
back
to
normal
but
maybe
we
don
t
want
to
return
to
exactly
the
way
thing
be
at
the
start
of
a
pandemic
of
misinformation
have
accompany
the
spread
of
sars
cov
how
on
earth
do
we
end
up
in
a
situation
in
which
thousand
of
people
decide
they
didn
t
want
to
be
vaccinate
because
they
have
receive
a
message
that
the
vaccine
contain
a
microchip
that
could
track
their
movement
ironically
most
of
the
time
they
receive
these
message
on
their
smartphones
with
location
service
enable
we
need
to
help
people
to
become
more
thoughtful
and
discern
about
where
they
get
their
information
and
whose
message
they
trust
scientist
do
not
always
agree
with
each
other
but
we
argue
our
case
base
on
data
and
the
paper
we
publish
be
peer
review
and
make
publicly
available
we
be
prepared
to
back
up
our
claim
with
evidence
and
to
change
our
mind
if
the
evidence
change
if
you
be
think
of
buying
a
new
pair
of
legging
the
late
teen
millionaire
on
tiktok
or
a
former
actor
sell
smelly
candle
may
be
an
excellent
source
of
advice
if
you
be
concerned
about
your
health
you
need
to
hear
from
someone
who
can
back
up
what
they
be
tell
you
with
solid
data
more
positively
the
pandemic
have
also
driven
an
interest
in
and
respect
for
science
and
scientist
that
i
hope
will
endure
i
would
love
to
think
that
once
the
immediate
crisis
have
subside
we
will
continue
to
see
scientist
held
up
as
inspirational
role
model
and
photograph
in
fancy
clothes
for
our
list
of
woman
and
men
of
the
year
and
although
there
be
still
a
long
way
to
go
with
communicate
science
to
the
general
public
my
impression
be
that
people
now
want
to
know
more
the
medium
have
a
role
to
play
here
and
so
do
scientist
themselves
we
have
to
do
well
in
provide
information
that
be
well
explain
without
be
dumbed
down
it
do
though
also
come
back
around
to
money
while
scientist
be
struggle
with
short
term
contract
and
under
pressure
to
publish
research
quickly
in
order
to
keep
their
job
tick
the
public
engagement
box
be
rarely
go
to
be
their
high
priority
only
when
scientific
career
be
well
support
and
less
precarious
can
we
expect
scientist
to
do
more
to
help
others
understand
what
we
do
in
the
wider
world
many
people
who
work
in
office
in
city
will
not
return
to
exactly
the
same
way
they
live
and
work
before
the
pandemic
some
will
look
for
alternative
to
the
time
consume
and
expensive
commute
the
pret
lunch
and
latte
and
the
frequent
update
to
their
work
wardrobe
as
we
have
learn
that
we
can
live
without
frequent
fly
and
fast
fashion
we
have
learn
too
how
much
we
value
our
school
and
hospital
both
will
need
extra
resource
to
recover
from
the
damage
and
neglect
incur
during
the
pandemic
perhaps
as
society
begin
to
open
up
again
some
of
that
support
will
come
from
people
who
have
want
to
volunteer
to
do
something
positive
during
the
pandemic
whether
help
at
vaccination
centre
or
support
those
in
need
in
their
local
community
people
want
their
community
to
recover
and
be
prepared
to
take
action
to
achieve
that
we
should
look
for
way
to
help
people
to
contribute
since
the
pandemic
begin
we
have
be
remind
forcefully
and
painfully
on
a
daily
basis
that
a
microscopic
virus
spill
over
from
one
specie
to
another
in
one
corner
of
the
planet
can
have
a
catastrophic
effect
on
the
whole
world
equally
from
one
university
campus
on
the
outskirt
of
a
small
city
in
one
year
a
very
safe
highly
effective
low
cost
vaccine
now
save
life
around
the
world
be
create
test
and
license
for
use
however
we
choose
to
impose
national
boundary
and
to
join
or
leave
international
organisation
we
cannot
ignore
the
fact
that
we
all
share
one
planet
as
we
face
into
the
future
and
turn
our
attention
back
to
climate
change
poverty
war
and
other
intractable
problem
that
never
go
away
the
pandemic
should
act
as
a
timely
reminder
of
the
global
nature
of
both
our
big
challenge
and
our
most
powerful
solution
