by
the
time

i
have
live
through
a
hungarian
fascist
dictatorship
german
military
occupation
the
nazi
final
solution
the
siege
of
budapest
by
the
soviet
red

a
period
of
chaotic
democracy
in
the
year
immediately
after
the

a
variety
of
repressive
communist
regime
and
a
popular
uprise
that

put
down
at
gunpoint
this
be
the
story
of
that
time
and
what

to
my
family
and
me
before
i
tell
my
story
it
may
be
helpful
to
provide
some
historical
context
when
i
be
born
hungary
be
govern
by
the
right
wing
dictatorship
of
admiral
miklos
horthy
horthy
government
be
align
with
nazi
germany
but
it
be
more
independent
than
nazi
germany
other
ally
this
may
have
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
hungary
be
situate
between
the
country
under
germany
influence
and
the
soviet
union
during
the
early
year
of

ii
hungary
maintain
a
policy
of
arm
neutrality
however
when
hitler
germany
attack
the
soviet
union
in
june
hungary
abandon
that
policy
and
declare
war
against
the
ally
for
all
intent
and
purpose
this
meant
declare
war
against
the
soviet
union
on
the
side
of
nazi
germany
by
the

to
work
its
way
through

concerned
that
horthy
might
try
to
negotiate
a

with
the
advance
russian
to
preempt
that
possibility
they
occupy
hungary
in

and
in
october
instal
an
extreme
fascist

while
the
horthy

have
discriminate
against
hungarian
jew
the
severity
of
the
discrimination
and
persecution
skyrocket
with
the
arrival
of
the
german
gestapo
official
adolf

anything
about

until
one
day
when
i
be
four
year
old
and
found
myself
lie
on
my
back
look
out
of
the
window
of
a
strange
room
i
look
upward
and
saw
a
leaden
sky

first
thought

i
be
a
little
sad
that
i
might
not
see
those
people
up

away
and
become
aware
of
my
surroundings
and
realize
that

notice
that

either

be
a
big
bandage

be
the
only
object
that
be
familiar
to
me
that
coat
stand
be
just
like
one
we
have
at
home
but
i
could
not
have
be
home
because
everything

after
a
while
some
men
and
woman
in
white

of
them

told
me
that

himself
there
when

after
some
time

me

up
in

and
i
could
actually

other
than
the
sky
there
be
a
courtyard
with
some
bush
and
tree
in
it
he
take
the
tube
out
of
my
arm
that

but
not
as
much
as
when
they
change
the
bandage
on
my
head
when
it
be
time
to
change
the
bandage
i
always
beg
him
please

not
hurt
me
he
always
promise
that
he
would
not
but
he
always

and
wheel
me
outside
into
the

there
in
the

a
long
time
i
be
look
around

and
go
on
the
path
between

and
at
one
point
i
notice
a
pair
of
foot
in
blue
and
white
woman
shoe
under
one
of
the
bush
in

they
told
me
that
i
should
calm
down
it
be
not
good
for
me
to
get

but
the
weight
of
the
turban
kept
me
from
turn
to
her
so
she
held
my
hand
and

nurse
thought
that

mother
would
get
me
all
work
up
and
that
would
be
bad
for
my
heart
so

told
to
keep
out
of
my
sight
after
that

where

a
leathery
smell
i
love
taxi
and
the
ride
home
be
too
short
for
my
taste
when
i
get
home
a
present
be
wait
for
me
it
be
a
little
toy
car
track
you
put
the
car
on
the
top
of
the
track
and
it
would
zoom
down
twist
around
and
jump
over
a
break
in
the
track
to
the
other
side
my
father
show
me
how

until
i
complain

father
by
his
nickname
ever
since

blood
clot
start
to
travel
toward
my
heart
but
the
surgeon

this
and
interrupt
the
operation
they
cut
a
vein
in
my
neck
and
get
rid
of
the
clot
before
it
could
do
any
harm
all
in
all
i
be
told
i
have
spent
six
week
in
the
hospital
now
i
would
have
to
stay
in
bed
for
nine
month
i
do
not
know
how
long
nine
month
be
go
to
be
but
i
be
so
happy
to
be
at
home
with
my
family
and
in
familiar
surroundings
that
i
do
not
care
my
bed
at
home
be
a
large
crib
in
the
big
room
in
short
order
it
be
equip
with
a
board
that
ran
from
one
side
to
another
if
i
sat
up
the
board
serve
as
a
table
my
food
be
place
on
it
but
more
important
so
be
my
toy
because
i
like
the
jungle
book
so
much
my
parent
give
me
little
animal
figure
tiger
wolf
giraffe
and
a
wonderful
lion
that
i
call
lion
bacsi
child
be
expect
to
call
adult
bacsi
or
uncle
and
neni
or
aunt
as
a
sign
of
respect
lion
bacsi
be
clearly
a
figure
of
great
respect
i
played
with
my
animal
for
hour
on
end
i
also
have
a
set
of
very
realistic
modern
toy
soldier
i
played
with
them
too
but
i
like
the
animal
well
from
time
to
time
i
have
to
endure
the
torture
of
my
bandage
be
change
but
otherwise
i
be
comfortable
and
feel
increasingly
frisky
during
my
long
confinement
in
bed
i
discover
an
activity
that
make
the
time
go
faster
i
start
play
with
myself
i
found
that
it
felt
good
and
my
mind
always
roam
when
i
do
that
little
fantasy
scene
ran
in
my
mind
usually
involve
my
blond
nurse
my
mother
caught
me
in
the
middle
of
one
of
my
revery
one
day
and
ask
me
rather
harshly
what
i
be
do
i
be
startle
but
told
her
i
be
tell
myself
story
my
mother
grabbed
my
hand
put
them
by
my
side
on
top
of
the
cover
and
in
a
tone
of
unusual
disapproval
told
me
to
stop
i
be
take
aback
after
that
i
told
myself
story
only
at
night
when
it
be
dark
that
do
not
work
all
the
time
either
because
as
i
move
the
crib
move
with
me
and
make
a
telltale
creak
sound
my
mother
would
emerge
from
nowhere
and
yell
andris
stop
that
so
i
learn
that
i
could
only
tell
story
to
myself
very
very
quietly
luckily
for
my
mother
peace
of
mind
i
have
another
playmate
a
real
one
my
grandmother
have
die
before
i
get
sick
but
my
grandfather
be
very
much
alive
he
have
infinite
patience
which
make
him
the
perfect
playmate
we
played
the
same
game
over
and
over
and
each
time
he
participate
with
as
much
excitement
as
if
it
be
the
first
time
we
would
ever
played
that
game
my
favorite
game
be
to
play
the
conductor
on
a
streetcar
he
would
play
the
passenger
and
hand
me
a
ticket
which
i
would
carefully
punch
with
my
toy
puncher
we
also
played
barber
and
once
he
actually
let
me
cut
his
hair
after
month
have
pass
i
be
allow
out
of
bed
for
a
few
hour
at
a
time
but
i
have
to
stay
home
in
our
apartment
or
nearby
then
finally
the
day
come
when
dr
rothbart
cheerfully
told
me
that
he
would
take
the
turban
off
one
last
time
and
i
would
not
have
to
deal
with
it
again
this
turn
out
to
be
only
partly
true
because
while
the
turban
be
go
he
cover
the
wound
behind
my
ear
with
a
sticky
bandage
that
hurt
almost
as
much
when
it
be
remove
for
cleaning
but
eventually
that
too
go
away
however
even
though
my
turban
and
the
bandage
be
go
i
still
do
not
hear
as
well
as
i
use
to
i
could
understand
people
only
if
they
talk
directly
to
me
after
a
while
people
around
me
learn
to
speak
louder
so
i
never
felt
i
miss
anything
i
understood
woman
voice
well
than
men
ear
and
ear
trouble
preoccupy
me
for
a
long
time
my
mother
brought
me
a
hand
puppet
a
little
bear
that
you
slip
over
your
hand
and

around
with
your
finger

a
hole
in
its
skull

i
disliked
the
smell
of

fascinate
by
the
ritual
of
smoking
one
day
as
i
watch
my
mother
chat
and
smoke
with

i
sidle
up
to

they
laugh
at
me
which
just
make
me
dig
in

and
insist
that

in
one
puff
immediately
my
stomach
get
queasy
i
drop
the
cigarette

my
playground
with
my
interest
in

old
boy
in
our

of
southeast
asia
that
he
have
study
the
two
of
us
would
go
island
hop
we
would
start
on
the
rug
designate
as
borneo
we
would
put
lion
bacsi
on
the
rug

the
south
china
sea
of
the
polished
hardwood
floor
from
borneo
to
sumatra
to
kowtow
to
lion
bacsi
and
ask
for
his
friendship
then
we

other
far
off

that
my
friend
cull
from
his
map

until

it
be
time
for
him

one
day

that
but
by
then

an
hour
sometimes
an
hour
nobody
talk
much
i
huddle
against
my
mother
drift
back
to
sleep
for
little
bit
of
time
jerking
awake
on
the
hard
bench
then
drift
back
to
sleep
again
we
wait
either
for
the
bomb
to
hit
us
or
for
the
steady
siren
sound
that
signal
the
end
of
the
air
raid
we
never
do
get
hit
but
an
apartment
house
maybe
half
a
dozen
block
from
us
do
it
look
like
a
big
knife
have
slice
off
the
front
half
of
every
floor
you
could
see
into
the
apartment
on
all
four
story
like
a
doll
house
in
the
back
part
of
each
room
the
furniture
be
still
in
place
and
the
picture
be
still
on
the
wall
the
front
part
have
fall
into
a
big
heap
of
brick
stone
and
unidentifiable
rubble
rumor
abound
some
people
say
the
plane
that
cause
the
destruction
be
english
someone
told
my
mother
that
the
air
pressure
from
the
bomb
blew
goose
down
from
a
storage
area
into
the
air
raid
shelter
next
to
it
and
it
suffocate
a
lot
of
the
people
hiding
there
my
mother
and
i
pass
the
ruin
building
every
time
we
go
to
the
city
park
the
sight
make
me
very
uneasy
but
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
park
i
usually
have
forgotten
all
about
it
my
favorite
place
to
play
be
near
a
statue
of
george
washington
the
statue
be
a
big
bronze
figure
of
a
soldier
on
a
rear
horse
i
thought
this
statue
be
make
of
iron
because
the
hungarian
word
for
iron
be
va
pronounce
vash
so
i
assume
that
the
soldier
name
be
vashington
and
he
be
name
for
the
material
his
statue
be
make
from
there
be
a
sandy
area
near
the
statue
one
day
a
little
girl
be
play
there
we
have
never
see
each
other
before
but
i
have
sand
toy
and
she
have
a
doll
so
we
start
to
play
together
we
be
busily
building
sand
castle
and
put
the
doll
next
to
them
when
she
suddenly
turn
to
me
and
say
very
seriously
jesus
christ
be
kill
by
the
jew
and
because
of
that
all
the
jew
will
be
thrown
into
the
danube
my
mother
be
sit
on
a
bench
nearby

jumped
up
and
ran
to
her
bawling
my
head
off
i
told
her
what
the
little
girl

just
say

mother

her
arm
around
me

embarrass
about

salmas
that
be
why
he
go
down
there
to
bring
me
back
this
be
only
one
of
the
strange
thing
that
happen
that
summer
before
that
summer
listen
to
the
radio
be
an
ordinary
thing
now
it
become
a
complicate
ceremony
the
radio
sat
on
a
table
in
a
prominent
position
in
the
little
room
it
be
a
large
wooden
box
with
shiny
black
knob
on
it
the
sound
come
through
a
cloth
that
be
stretch
over
the
front
by
turn
the
knob
you
could
listen
to
all
kind
of
foreign
language
program
mixed
with
mysterious
squeak
and
whistle
i
knew
that
these
strange
language
and
the
noise
signify
that
the
program
be
come
from
far
away
so
i
always
be
a
little
awestruck
when
i
listen
to
the
sound
emanate
from
the
box
before
that
summer
listen
to
the
radio
be
an
occasional
thing
now
friend
come
over
almost
every
even
to
listen
people
start
pay
a
lot
more
attention
to
the
radio
than
they
have
before
but
at
the
same
time
my
mother
do
not
want
anyone
outside
our
apartment
to
see
or
hear
us
listen
to
it
she
would
pull
down
the
blind
and
draw
the
curtain
then
turn
the
radio
on
at
a
very
low
volume
she
and
her
friend
would
huddle
around
it
with
very
serious
expression
i
think
they
be
listen
to
hungarian
program
transmit
from
england
the
program
always
start
with
four
rhythmic
thud
dit
dit
dit
dah
i
could
not
hear
anything
else
but
the
adult
must
have
heard
something
they
like
because
occasionally
they
would
cheer
silently
i
be
confuse
by
all
these
going
on
and
annoyed
that
i
be
kept
away
from
the
radio
the
radio
use
to
be
my
toy
i
use
to
have
access
to
it
any
time
i
want
now
the
adult
have
take
over
my
radio
and
it
be
no
longer
available
for
me
to

in
the
summer
the

a
radio
now
i
miss
the

to
symbolize
the
end
of
each
day
certain

that
we

all
require
to

of
my

outside
the
jewish
house
without
wear
one
it
be
just
one
more
of
those
thing
to
accept
numbly
and
silently
one
day
a
friend
of
mine
also
jewish
and
about
my
age
show
up

also
impressed
by
his
cocky
courage
whenever

do
not

avoid
look
at
us
even
people
whom
we

but
though

to
her

i
sat
in

and
read
my
book
over
and
over
one
of

very
very
ill
i
read
it

time
my
heart
would
break
over
the
kitten
that
be
go
to
die
even
though
i
knew
it
would
get
well
i
would
have
to
finish
the
book

a
great
deal
of
attention

because
they
be
so
interest
after
all
i
would
read
them

lot
of
time

but
because
that
way
i
could
avoid

who
might
be
look

about
my

displace
from

because
of
the
fight
there
be
more
woman
than

mostly
old
all

we
do
not
spend
much
time
with
each

sense
of
belonging
to
the
apartment
unit
my
mother
help
with
cleaning
the
apartment
and
cooking
i

the
same
dry
bean

day
we
generally
wore
our

even
inside

there
and
that
make
me
feel
there
be
something
warm
and
normal
at
the
center
of
this
strange
existence
her
constant
presence
reassure
me
enough
so
that
i
could
have
fun
with
jozsi
my
day
consist
of
play
outside
with
my
friend
come
in
from
time
to
time
to
warm
up
a
little
then
go
outside
again
our
friendship
be
the
only
spark
in
this
dreariness
i
be
not
go
to
school
and
jozsi
have
no
school
either
there
be
not
much
else
to
do
but
play
in
the
courtyard
every
once
in
a
while
my
friend
and
i
would
go
outside
the
courtyard
and
play
in
the
street
we
be
told
not
to
go
very
far
that
be
fine
with
me
because
i
do
not
feel
comfortable
be
far
from
my
mother
i
notice
big
poster

on
the
wall

and
blew
her
hand

the
little
girl
be
look
toward
the
plane
a
question
print
next
to
her
face
why
but
that
be
not
the
poster
that
make
the
big
impression
on
me
that
one
warn
in
big
bold
black
letter
what
would
happen
to
people
who
harbor
jew
or
communist
the
warn
state
that
people
found
do
that
would
be
and
then
come
a
word
that
i
do
not
recognize
but
that
sound
very
very
scary
one
night
i
whisper
to
my
mother
mama
what
do
folkoncoljak
mean
my
mother
put
her
finger
on
my
lip
later
when
no
one
be
in
the
apartment
she
told
me
it
meant
to
slaughter
somehow
it
sound

bad
to
me
i
never
say
anything
about
these
poster
jozsi

some
morning

would
notice
that
somebody
have

rubber
stamp
to
stamp
red
communist
star
all
over
these
poster
of
course
i
do
not
know
who
it
might
have
be
but
the
appearance
of
those
red
star
give
me
a
warm
feel
they
suggest
i
be
not
alone
but
i
never
look
at
the
poster
for
more
than
a
second
because
i
be
afraid
that
i
would
give
myself
away
to
my
friend

a
jew
and
whatever

christmas
be
fun
a
few
day
later
i
woke
up
to
a
strange
sound
it
sound
like
someone
be
drop
plank
of
wood
on
top
of
each
other
three
or
four
plank
would
drop
with
loud
thud
then
there
would
be
some
minute
of
quiet
then
the
thud
would
start
again
when
the
plank
be
drop
the
adult
around
me
stop
talk
it
look
to
me
almost
as
if
they
be
hold
their
breath
my
mother
told
me
that
what
we
be
hearing
be
the
sound
of
russian
artillery
i
be
fascinate
and
go
outside
with
jozsi
to
be
able
to
listen
well
to
the
sound
of
the
big
gun
one
morning
shortly
after
i
come
back
from
the
toilet
there
be
an
explosion
outside
in
the
courtyard
it
do
not
sound
like
a
plank
drop
at
all
it
sound
the
way
i
imagine
an
explosion
would
sound
a
big
long
loud
reverberate
bang
follow
by
the
random
rattle
noise
make
by
the
debris
of
roof
tile
brick
and
piece
of
wood
fly
around
the
silence
after
the
explosion
be
deep
people
sat
frozen
in
place
as
if
wait
for
more
explosion
to
come
after
a
while
when
nothing
else
happen
we
go
out
and
notice
that
fragment
of
a
shell
have
torn
into
the
door
lead
into
the
toilet
i
star
at
the
fragment
i
have
go
through
that
door
just
a
few
minute
earlier
the
adult
decide
it
be
time
for
us
to
move
to
the
wood
cellar
where
we
would
be
safer
from
shell
like
this
as
in
ki
raly
street
there
be
a
central
cellar
area
and
each
apartment
also
have
its
own
storage
cellar
people
drag
their
cot
and
belonging
down
from
their
apartment
and
set
up
housekeep
we
share
a
cellar
with
the
redheaded
woman
who
the
german
soldier
thought
might
have
be
a
jew
and
another
woman
it
be
just
as
well
that
we
move
because
thing
be
get
bad
by
the
day
first
the
electricity
go
out
then
a
day
or
two
later
the
water
stop
flow
it
would
come
back
on
from
time
to
time
then
go
out
again
when
it
do
come
on
everyone
stockpile
water
in
every
pan
and
bucket
they
could
find
the
only
reason
people
left
the
apartment
building
be
to
attempt
to
get
bread
or
other
food
most
of
these
trip
be
unsuccessful
but
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
the
woman
would
find
an
open
bakery
that
have
just
finish
baking
bread
and
would
rush
home
to
tell
the
others
to
get
some
before
it
ran
out
the
cellar
be
dark
with
wood
and
coal
pile
up
on
the
side
the
coal
dust
cover
everything
include
our
clothes
and
belonging
each
cellar
have
a
naked
light
bulb
hang
from
a
wire
in
the
ceiling
but
since
there
be
no
electricity
the
cellar
be
lit
by
kerosene
lamp
the
smoke
from
the
lamp
add
to
the
grime
most
people
have
small
stove
to
cook
the
bean
that
make
up
our
diet
but
the
stove
do
not
do
much
to
combat
the
cold
and
damp
so
we
wore
our
overcoat
all
the
time
even
to
bed
we
have
no
choice
we
adjust
with
numbed
resignation
time
go
by
slowly
in
the
cellar
there
be
not
enough
light
to
read
some
of
the
men
played
card
the
woman
look
after
the
necessity
of
eat
scrounge
up
supply
and
cooking
the
few
kid
there
be
just
hung
around
underfoot
we
be
not
allow
to
go
outside
the
sound
of
the
artillery
be
a
continuous
backdrop
at
first
it
be
a
shock
but
within
a
few
day
we
be
so
use
to
it
that
we
hardly
paid
it
any
attention
one
day
the
father
of
one
of
the
child
decide
to
engage
us
in
a
useful
activity
he
gather
all
the
kid
together
in
a
corner
of
the
cellar
where
a
stove
be
lit
so
it
be
fairly
pleasant
and
told
us
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
us
to
practice
our
catechism
all
the
kid
nod
i
do
too
but
i
be
frighten
out
of
my
wit
all
i
knew
about
catechism
be
that
it
have
something
to
do
with
the
catholic
religion
but
that
be
about
it
and
i
be
sure
that
my
lack
of
knowledge
would
give
me
away
in
an
instant
the
man
start
question
one
of
the
child
i
avoid
look
at
him
so
that
i
would
not
catch
his
attention
the
answer
be
satisfactory
so
the
man
move
on
to
the
next
child
one
closer
to
me
when
the
question
move
to
the
third
child
i
would
have
be
next
i
get
up
and
excuse
myself
and
say
i
have
to
go
to
the
bathroom
the
man
nod
then
turn
his
attention
to
the
child
he
be
question
i
ran
to
my
mother
bury
my
face
in
her
neck
and
whisper
to
her
what
be
go
on
she
hug
me
firmly
and
say
you
will
not
go
back
then
out
loud
she
told
me
that
it
be
about
time
i
give
her
a
hand
and
start
bossing
me
around
i
never
make
it
back
to
the
catechism
this
experience
make
me
avoid
the
other
kid
a
bit
more
i
do
not
want
to
get
caught
in
another
educational
exercise
a
week
or
two
after
we
settle
into
the
cellar
a
group
of
russian
soldier
show
up
at
our
apartment
house
there
be
no
shoot
or
fight
they
just
walk
into
the
house
and
found
their
way
down
into
the
cellar
they
come
in
casually
but
each
of
them
carry
a
machine
gun
the
russian
machine
gun
be
different
from
the
german
kind
they
be
like
a
rifle
but
the
bullet
be
store
in
a
circular
drum
that
be
attach
to
the
barrel
of
the
rifle
the
russian
soldier
have
stubble
on
their
face
and
look
rumple
and
tire
there
be
maybe
ten
or
fifteen
of
them
the
soldier
who
be
in
charge
do
not
seem
much
different
from
the
rest
he
spoke
german
which
make
it
possible
for
some
of
the
tenant
to
communicate
with
him
several
of
the
other
russian
soldier
also
spoke
a
little
german
one
old
man
in
the
apartment
building
come
from
a
part
of
hungary
where
they
spoke
a
dialect
of
russian
so
he
become
something
of
a
translator
for
the
russian
who
do
not
speak
any
german
the
soldier
checked
out
the
cellar
then
they
settle
in
the
vacate
apartment
upstairs
they
be
not
too
friendly
but
they
be
not
unfriendly
either
they
left
us
some
of
their
bread
it
be
different
from
hungarian
bread
it
be
shape
like
a
brick
be
very
dark
and
have
a
sourish
taste
but
we
be
very
happy
to
have
it
after
this
initial
encounter
they
pretty
much
left
us
alone
they
left
the
apartment
house
very
early
each
morning
and
come
back
late
in
the
even
it
be
just
as
if
they
go
to
work
the
artillery
fire
continued
and
we
be
still
living
in
the
cellar
but
i
felt
a
little
more
secure
now
that
the
russian
be
there
they
be
not
german
and
they
have
push
the
german
out
the
soldier
in
charge
my
mother
told
me
he
be
a
sergeant
often
chat
with
my
mother
in
german
and
come
down
a
number
of
time
to
visit
with
us
in
the
cellar
i
have
never
heard
my
mother
speak
anything
but
hungarian
before
so
i
be
very
impressed
by
how
fluently
she
seem
to
be
able
to
talk
with
him
at
one
point
my
mother
the
sergeant
and
i
be
alone
in
our
cellar
and
my
mother
after
exchange
some
word
with
him
turn
to
me
she
say
andris
do
you
remember
modim
anachnu
lach

phrase
be
the
begin
of
the
hebrew
prayer
i
have
learn
the
year
before
in
first
grade
and
recite
every
morning
at
school
i
froze
i
be
not
suppose
to
remember
thing
like
that
my
mother
say
just
for
now
it
be
okay
if
you
remember
it
tell
it
to
the
sergeant
i
do
a
big
smile
spread
on
the
sergeant
face
and
he
pat
me
on
the
head
that
night
my
mother
and
i
snuggle
up
in
our
cot
and
she
whisper
to
me
that
the
sergeant
be
a
jew
and
his
family
have
be
kill
by
the
german
in
russia
his
name
she
say
be
haie
another
night
we
be
settle
in
our
cot
and
i
be
asleep
when
someone
come
into
the
cellar
i
drowsily
saw
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
that
it
be
the
old
man
who
occasionally
act
as
a
translator
the
old
man
say
something
to
my
mother
and
the
two
other
woman
an
argument
ensue
i
could
not
follow
it
but
i
could
tell
that
the
woman
be
very
upset
a
russian
soldier
come
in
and
wave
the
old
man
and
the
two
other
woman
out
of
the
cellar
he
close
the
door
and
fasten
it
from
the
inside
and
propped
his
machine
gun
against
it
he
sat
down
at
the
side
of
our
bed
he
be
grin
my
mother
be
tell
him
thing
in
hungarian
then
in
german
but
he
just
continued
to
grin
he
poked
his
forefinger
against
my
mother
chest
then
point
it
at
himself
and
say
andrei
as
if
his
name
be
andrei
my
mother
point
to
me
and
also
say
andrei
i
figure
that
andrei
must
be
the
russian
version
of
andris
the
russian
soldier
kept
grin
and
again
poked
his
finger
against
my
mother
chest
my
mother
get
out
of
bed
and
picked
me
up
the
soldier
move
his
gun
and
open
the
door
and
let
my
mother
carry
me
out
she
hand
me
to
one
of
the
woman
in
another
cellar
then
she
go
back
to
our
cellar
the
neighbor
woman
take
me
into
her
bed
and
put

of
apprehension
i

pressure
in

too
big
for

i
knew
well
than
to
argue
she
grabbed
me
by

and
take
me
out
of
the

and

be
shot
on

his
comrade
for
sure
would
have
thrown
hand
grenade
into
the
cellar
and
kill
us
all
so
she
have
decide
not
to
recognize
him
after
a
while
the
artillery
exchange
subside
the
russian
move
on
and
we
move
back
upstairs
it
be
mid
january
one
day
i
be
alone
in
the
courtyard
building
a
snowman
when
my

come
out
of
the

and
beckon
me
over
to
her
she
look
different

side
and
blown
up
all
the
bridge
over
the
danube
after
they
left
this
be
intend
to
make
it
hard
for
the
russian
to
chase
after
them
but
it
also
make
it
very
unlikely
that
the
german
would
come
back
the
wave
of
relief
that
swept
through
me
be
so
strong
that
i
felt
dizzy
it
be
as
if
after
hold
my
breath
for
a
long
time
i
could
start
breathing
again
but
i
could
see
in
my
mother
face
that
there
be
something
else
she

for
a
moment
then
the
significance
of
be
free
to
use
my
real
name
engulfed
me
just
then
i

behind
from
the

a
dream
kept
me
from
feel
fatigue
and

just
kept
walk
numb
after

by
anything
we

break
in

any
of
the

but
the
apartment
house
be
still
stand
we
knock
on
the

be
genuinely
glad

not
expect
you

my

some
of

day
before
i

he

and
he
let
me
ride
on
the
crossbar
as
he
pedal
down
kiraly
street
sinko
like
to
go
fast
the
street
be
rut
and
full
of
pothole
from
the
fight
and
on
every
bump

crossbar
bit
into
my
bottom
but
i
do
not

i
have
no
friend
my
age
and
sinko
do
not
qualify

so
we
just
rode
around
bumping
along

the
unpaved
path
i
desperately
want
to
learn
how
to
ride

in
a
while
sinko
let
me
sit
on

entire
year
and
make
it
up
later
my
mother
and
i
have
decide
that
i
would
have

the
novelty
of
have
my

room
wore
off

pretty
much
left
alone

little
lonely

and
gawked
at
the
damage
building
return
to
our
apartment
only
to
grab
a
bite
to
eat

permanent
vacation
meanwhile
all
of
the
adult
be
preoccupy
with
get
their
life
back
to

so
they
do
not
pay
much
attention
to
us
one
day
gabi
take
me
to
a
little
general
store
that
have
sprung
up
in
a
bombed
out
storefront
a
few
block
from
home

glass
have
be
blown
out
from

and
other
staple
and
there
be
also
some
candy

i
look
in
through
the
chicken
wire
then
while
the
store
owner
be
busy
with
a
customer
gabi
nudge
me
with
his
elbow
quickly
reach
in
through
the
chicken
wire
and
grabbed
a
handful
of
candy
i
do
likewise
nobody
saw
us
but
we
pound
off
down
the
street
as
if
we
be
be
chase
when
we
ran
out
of
breath
we
stop
and
ate
some
of
the
candy
the
rest
we
stash
away
in
our
pocket
it
be
not
very
good
candy
not
as
good
as
i
remember
from
before
the
war
but
be
steal
give
it
extra
flavor
then
we
saunter
home
my
mother
be
home
when
we
arrive
she
have
an
uncanny
ability
to
know
when
i
be
up
to
something
or
when
i
be
tell
less
than
the
truth
and
this
case
be
no
different
she
eyeball
us
sternly
and
with
a
few
point
question
quickly
found
out
what
we
have
do
she
erupt
then
still
breathing
fire
she
order
us
to
take
back
the
candy
we
have
left
and
apologize
to
the
storekeeper
she
give
us
some
money
to
pay
for
what
we
have
eat
we
go
back
to
the
store
much
more
slowly
than
we
have
come
my
mother
follow
at
a
distance
close
enough
to
ensure
that
we
do
as
we
be
suppose
to
but
far
enough
away
to
let
the
storekeeper
speak
her
mind
to
us
freely
it
do
not
take
a
lot
of
explanation
for
the
shopkeeper
to
get
the
picture
she
knew
the
whole
story
as
soon
as
we
open
our
grubby
hand
and
hand
her
the
candy
and
the
change
she
accepted
them
and
our
apology
and
we
left
that
be
the
end
of
my
life
as
a
criminal
but
not
the
end
of
my
adventure
in
the
absence
of
school
organize
activity
or
much
in
the
way
of
toy
we
have
to
be
inventive
to
entertain
ourselves
sometimes
it
do
not
take
much
the
main
staircase
in
our
building
spiral
all
the
way
from

ground
floor
to

top
one
rainy
day
gabi
and
i
go
up
the
main
staircase
to
the
top
floor
and
we
peed
down
the
stairwell
marvel
at
the
shape
of
the
fall
stream
and
the
way
the
drop
hit
the
stone
floor
two
story
below
when
my

night

her
what
we
have
do
she
call
me
into
the
bathroom
and
yell
at
me
and
before
i
knew
what
she
be
do
she
start
beating
my
bottom
with
the
handle
of
a
wooden
spoon
although
i
would
have
an
occasional
slap
i
have
never
be
beaten
before
it
hurt
it
hurt
a
lot
i
start
bawling
and
try
to
make
myself
as
small
a
target
as
possible
by
cling
to
the
towel
rod
and
plaster
myself
against
the
wall
but
my
mother
kept
yell
and
the
wooden
spoon
continued
to
find
me
finally
she
stop
no
one
say
anything
after
her
yell
and
my
bawling
the
silence
throbbed
as
painfully
as
my
bottom
i
go
to
my
room
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
try
to
find
a
position
in
which
my
bottom
do
not
hurt
i
do
not
succeed
i
try
to
read
i
read
the
same
paragraph
over
and
over
many
time
before
i
give
up
i
put
my
head
down
on
the
pillow
feel
very
sorry
for
myself

i
go
to
sleep

and
red

hard
time

in
the
stairwell

weather

and
i
would
go

onto
an
airshaft
which

climb
out
through
the
bathroom
window
and
pretend
that
i
have
a
private
little
courtyard
but
i
have
to
be
very
careful
that
i
do
not
fall
out
of

maybe
six
foot
square
with

bathroom
window
be
loose
i
picked
at
it
with
my
finger

to
dislodge
a
chunk

a
hole
under
the
window
the
cartridge
fit
perfectly
i
slid
it
in
then
replace
the
mortar
to
hide
it
after
that
i
snuck
out
of
the
bathroom
window
periodically
to
examine
my
treasure
i
be
always
very
careful
there
be
all
kind
of
rumor
about
kid
play
with
unexploded
munition
and
blowing
their
hand
off
i
do
not
want

lot
of
deep

that
my

it
would
be
wrong
to
bring
a
child
into
the
chaotic
world
we

in
so
they

my
mother
might

have
a
baby
somehow
and
for
no
particular
reason
i

a
girl
a

much
covet
treasure

in
our

as
more
and
more
chestnut

and
fell
to
the
ground
they
lose
their
intrigue
and
currency
i
go
home
and
toss
my
precious
collection
of
chestnut
into
the
garbage
sometimes
after
school
a
group
of
us
would
head

be
no
question
that
the
communist

everyone

and
scar
the
russian

close
in
on
us
and
start
push
us
around
the
kid
be
no
big
than
we
be
but
they
be
russian
none
of
us
dare
to
push
back
we
kept
move
and
eventually
we
broke
away
from
them
after
that
every
time
we
go
to
city
park
i
be

some
of
the
time
or

at
all
it
be
not
uncommon
for
us
to
sit
at
our
desk
fully
bundle
in
winter
coat
hat
scarf
and
glove
with
our
breath
visible
in
the
cold
air
at
time
like

i
hat

cold
but
on
the
way
home
at
least
we
could
play
in
the
snow
snowball

be
common
once
one
of
the
snowball
go
astray
it
flew
through
the
open
door
of
a
passing
streetcar
and
hit
the
driver
in
the
face
to
our
amazement
the
streetcar
screech
to
a
halt
and
a
very
angry
driver
come
tear
after
us
i
be
the
one
he
caught
he
grabbed
my
hat
and
yell
at
me
then
get
back
on
his
tram
with
my
hat
in
his
hand
and
drove
off
again
it
be
the
only
hat
i
have
and
it
be
not
easy
to
get
another
one
i
trudge
home
upset
and
shiver
when
i
get
home
i
sheepishly
report
what
have
happen
i
stress
that
i
be
not
the
one
who
have
thrown
the
offend
snowball

father
nod
matter
of
factly
and
say

can
get
your
hat
back
he
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
the
two
of
us
trudge
back
out
into
the
snow
to
try
to
retrieve
my
hat
from
the
streetcar
driver
that
particular
streetcar
line

house
so
we
have
to
walk
to
its
terminal
it
be
a
long
way
and
it
be
get
darker
and
colder
by
the
minute
when
we
finally
get
there

put
it
on
my
head
and
my
father
and
i
trudge
home
i
held
his
hand
part
of
the
way
it
felt
good
to
have
him
with
me
another
time
some
of
my
friend
be
talk
about
a
whorehouse
i
do
not
know
what
it
be
so
i
decide
to
ask
my
mother
she
be
comb
her
hair
in
front
of
the
bathroom
mirror
and
i
be
crouch
on
the
close
toilet
when
i
ask
my
question
my
mother
continued
to
comb
her
hair
very
deliberately
and
do
not
look
at
me
for
a
while
then
address
her
response
directly
to
her
image
in
the
mirror
she
rapped
out
in
a
no
nonsense
tone
that
a
whorehouse
be
where
men
go
to
put
their
penis
in
woman
and
pay
them
some
money
after
which
they
close
their
pant
and
go
home
i
sat
on
the
toilet
seat
dumbfound
i
felt
that
i
have
be
thwart
somehow
but
i
do
not
even
know
what
other
question
to
ask
a
few
day
later
a
couple
of
school
friend
and
i
be
hang
out
in
the
doorway
to
my
apartment
house
on
our
way
home
from
school
one
of
them
be
hold
forth
about
how
baby
be
make
he
say
knowingly
that
baby
be
make
when
a
man
put
his
thing
into
a
woman
and
shot
one
of
his
ball
into
her
i
consider
this
thoughtfully
on
the
one
hand
this
match
my
mother
description
of
what
people
do
in
a
whorehouse
on
the
other
hand
something
do
not
add
up
i
knew
for
a
fact
that
some
people
have
more
than
two
kid
but
all
of
us
boy
have
only
two
ball
i
ask
my
friend
about
this
inconsistency
he
clearly
have
not
thought
of
it
and
be
stun
these
matter
remain
confuse
for
some
time
to
come
in
the
spring
of
my
father
decide
that
it
would
be
good
for
me
to
learn
english
he
quote
a
hungarian
say
you
be
worth
as
many
men
as
the
language
you
speak
he
told
me
that
one
of
his
big
regret
be
that
as
a
child
he
have
never
learn
another
language
he
believe
that
this
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
learn
language
as
an
adult
during
the
war
he
have
try
to
pick
up
german
and
russian
but
have
not
succeed
he
particularly
want
me
to
learn
english
because
he
figure
that
since
both
the
english
and
american
spoke
it
it
might
in
time
become
the
most
widely
spoken
language
in
the
world
my
mother
found
a
middle
age
spinster
who
spoke
english
fluently
and
taught
it
as
well
she
live
by
herself
in
a
once
grand
but
now
old
and
decrepit
apartment
house
on
the
ring
road
my
mother
negotiate
for
a
series
of
lesson
she
paid
with
link
from
a
gold
necklace
that
she
broke
up
for
this
purpose
english
be
boring
and
i
do
not
like
the
teacher
or
her
decay
apartment
i
thought
she
be
weird
and
her
apartment
depress
i
be
always
eager
to
escape
back
to
the
street
but
my
parent
have
their
heart
set
on
my
participate
in
this
stupid
activity
so
there
be
no
alternative
but
to
go
along
with
it
even
though
i
do
not
like
it
english
lesson
become
a
regular
part
of
my
life
and
continued
so
for
many
year
to
come
as
if
the
english
lesson
be
not
bad
enough
a
bit
later
a
big
black
piano
appear
in
our
living
room
my
parent
sofa
bed
be
move
under
the
window
to
accommodate
the
piano
my
mother
explain
that
it
be
time
for
me
to
learn
to
play
at
first
i
be
intrigue
i
picked
out
a
few
simple
melody
and
played
them
endlessly
but
then
an
old
lady
piano
teacher
appear
carry
an
enormous
purse
big
enough
to
put
a
loaf
of
bread
in
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
start
to
coach
me
in
the
mystery
of
scale
she
make
me
play
the
stupid
scale
over
and
over
then
after
she
left
my
mother
make
me
practice
them
again
and
again
after
a
lot
of
scale
i
get
as
far
as
beethoven
turkish
march
but
i
never
become
very
good
i
detest

late
in

and
make
contact
print
the
print
be
not
very
good
not
only
be
they
gray
all
over
but
we
do
not
know
how
to
flatten
them
so
they
dry
curl
up
still
we
form
a
firm
name
unfleigro
a
contraction
of
our
three
last
name
ungar
fleiner
and
grof
we
go
around

offer
to
take
picture
of
them
we
have
a
few
taker
but
even

be
embarrass
about
the
product
ungar
be
a
very
handy
boy

have
a
movie

that
someone
have
manage
to
salvage
from
a
cut
room
floor
the
three
of
us
would
darken
a
room
and
project
these
movie
onto
a
wall
the
strip
be
short
so
the
segment
be
only
a
few
second
long
but
we
rewound
the
strip
and
watch
them
over
and
over
again
in
fascination
fourth
grade
be
very
similar
to
third

even
a
little
easy
because
the
school
routine
be
well
establish
and
i
do
not
have
to
make
up
any
lose
year
i
be
with
the
same
group
of
kid
and
i
have
plenty
of
friend
to
talk
to
i
talk
to
them
so
often
in
class
that
i
be
frequently
reprimand
for
be
a
chatterbox
once
again
i
get
good
grade
without
have
to
work
hard
the
only
subject
in
which
i
be
marked
down
be
behavior
the
teacher
commentary
that
accompany
me
throughout
school
be
andris
be
too
lively
at
first
my
parent
do
not
react
they
might
even
have
be
a
little
amuse
by
these
comment
but
as
the
comment
kept
come
the
amusement
give
way
to
serious
disapproval
i
dread
the
occasion
when
my
mother
would
go
to
school
and
talk
with
my
teacher
once
i
ran
into
her
in
the
school
hallway
after
such
a
meeting
i
be
surprised
to
see
her
and
greet
her
with
a
big
smile
she
glare
back
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
seriously
consider
not
go
home
after
school
but
i
do
not
know
where
else
to
go
so
i
drag
myself
home
the
inevitable
lecture
follow
i
be
not
take
life
seriously
and
would
pay
for
my
casual
attitude
later
and
so
on
i
would
heard
this
lecture
many
time
before
i
would
quiet
down
for
a
while
then
inevitably
drift
back
to
be
too
lively
in
class
again
but
if
i
be
immune
to
the
lecture
message
i
be
not
immune
to
the
unpleasant
atmosphere
that
its
delivery
generate
i
do
not
generally
have
a
lot
of
run
in
with
my
parent
but
when
i
do
misbehave
my
parent
be
a
united
pair
my
mother
lecture
and
my
father
yell
my
mother
never
beat
me
again
after
the
stairwell
incident
my
father
never
beat
me
at
all
he
use
a
different
method
of
keep
me
in
line
he
have
a
favorite
pair
of
leather
slipper
that
he
kept
by
his
bed
the
slipper
be
there
even
when
the
bed
be
fold
into
a
sofa
during
the
daytime
whenever
i
do
not
mind
him
he
would
wave
one
of
his
slipper
at
me
in
a
threaten
manner
if
i
still
do
not
respond
he
actually
threw
his
slipper
at
me
although
he
never
hit
me
with
it
i
never
knew
if
he
purposefully
avoid
me
or
if
his
aim
be
bad
they
also
express
their
approval
in
their
own
different
way
when
my
mother
like
something
i
do
she
would
hug
me
and
look
at
me
with
a
warm
expression
in
her
eye
my
father
would
come
behind
me
and
gently
whack
the
back
of
my
head
three
time
say
good
son
while
pat
my
head
as
i
get
pudgier
kid
at
school
start
to
call
me
pufi

my
aunt
iren
my
mother
be
the
second
after
iren
chapter
seven
gymnasium
fourth
grade
be
the
end
of
grammar
school
now
it
be
time
to
decide
how
and
where
i
would
continue
my
education
those
child
who
want
to
go
on
to
university
typically
attend
gymnasium
a
traditional
institution
that
taught
an
eight
year
curriculum
of
liberal
art
and
science
about
half
the
kid
at
the
fasori
school
go
on
to
gymnasium
the
other
half
go
to
technical
school
that
train
them
for
more
specific
job
related
employment
people
say
that
gymnasium
affiliate
with
a
religious
order
be
the
well
one
my
parent
decide
to
send
me
to
the
evangelikus
gymnasium
an
institution
run
by
the
second
large
protestant
branch
in
hungary
hungary
be
an
overwhelmingly
catholic
country
so
even
a
large
protestant
branch
represent
a
small
minority
evangelikus
have
a
very
good
academic
reputation
and
have
the
add
benefit
of
be
locate
just
a
couple
of
block
from
the
fasori
elementary
school
within
easy
walk
distance
of
our
home
this
would
be
my
first
experience
go
to
school
with
non
jewish
kid
but
evangelikus
have
a
reputation
for
keep
reli
gion
to
the
religious
instruction
course
and
not
force
its
belief
down
student
throat
when
the
protestant
kid
attend
their
religion
class
i
would
attend
jewish
religious
instruction
along
with
the
other
jewish
boy
other
than
that
no
distinction
be
make
among
the
student
body
i
start
at
evangelikus
in
september
shortly
after
my
eleventh
birthday
there
be
a
few
significant
difference
between
grammar
school
and
gymnasium
for
one
thing
the
student
body
be
all
boy
consequently
i
lose
all
contact
with
girl
my
age
i
do
not
really
miss
them
and
soon
forgot
all
about
them
the
teacher
also
be
all
men
there
be
a
seriousness
to
the
class
that
distinguish
gymnasium
from
grammar
school
evangelikus
be
all
business
all
student
go
to
gymnasium
wore
a
special
cap
every
gymnasium
have
its
own
particular
design
the
evangelikus
cap
be
dark
blue
peaked
at
the
front
and
back
like
a
soldier
cap
with
a
special
school
badge
on
it
i
be
very
proud
to
attend
the
school
and
proud
of
my
cap
i
wore
it
all
the
time
one
day
i
be
chase
around
on
my
way
home
from
school
with
a
couple
of
friend
we
be
cut
up
on
the
sidewalk
near
our
house
when
an
old
boy
come
by
he
be
wear
the
evangelikus
cap
and
must
have
be
an
upperclassman
he
stop
me
and
in
a
very
serious
tone
told
me
that
as
a
student
at
evangelikus
i
represent
the
school
wherever
i
go
and
that
i
give
people
the
wrong
impression
of
the
school
by
behaving
like
a
wild
man
on
the
street
i
be
quite
humiliate
by
this
comment
and
quiet
down
at
least
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
once
again
my
ear
give
me
a
front
row
seat
in
my
class
my
ear
still
drain
and
i
do
not
hear
very
well
but
if
i
sat
in
the
front
row
and
the
teacher
stood
right
in
front
of
me
and
spoke
loudly
enough
for
the
whole
class
to
hear
he
be
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
him
as
well
my
schoolmate
my
par
ents
and
my
parent
friend
already
knew
to
speak
louder
than
normal
to
me
and
accord
to
a
theory
put
forward
by
jani
i
may
even
have
benefit
from
my
bad
hearing
jani
hypothesize
that
i
compensate
for
my
deafness
just
as
a
blind
man
compensates
for
the
loss
of
sight
by
develop
other
sens
i
have
to
be
quicker
at
processing
nonverbal
sign
and
more
attentive
to
signal
and
most
important
because
i
often
understood
only
part
of
sentence
i
have
to
exercise
my
mind
constantly
i
take
it
to
mean
that
jani
thought
my
bad
hearing
make
me
smarter
i
like
this
theory
i
be
a
good
student
i
like
my
teacher
i
like
my
class
and
i
like
most
of
the
subject
we
study
hungarian
literature
geography
history
math
and
one
foreign
language
i
chose
to
study
english
i
particularly
like
my
english
teacher
mr
endrodi
he
be
an
elegant
man
always
well
dress
and
neat
with
a
pleasant
round
face
he
spoke
with
great
confidence
but
always
have
a
gentle
manner
he
impressed
me
tremendously
even
though
i
have
be
take
english
lesson
privately
for
a
couple
of
year
now
i
be
lackadaisical
about
study
but
enough
have
rubbed
off
so
that
i
make
a
good
start
in
mr
en
drodi
class
because
i
like
him
i
want
to
impress
him
that
inspire
me
to
do
even
well
and
my
performance
in
english
picked
up
mr
endrodi
become
my
ideal
with
great
disappointment
i
realize
that
i
could
not
emulate
him
in
look
diction
or
dress
but
i
notice
that
he
sign
his
name
with
a
special
curlicue
on
the
e
so
i
adapt
that
curlicue
to
the
g
when
i
sign
my
name
mr
endrodi
be
my
favorite
teacher
but
the
others
be
good
too
they
be
not
particularly
formal
but
they
expect
discipline
in
class
and
they
usually
get
it
although
not
always
good
student
though
i
be
much
to
my
mother
chagrin
i
remain
as
they
put
it
in
parent
teacher
conference
lively
in
my
mind
i
do
not
deserve
such
criticism
i
just
exchange
an
occasional
comment
with
my
deskmate
two
boy
share
a
bench
and
a
double
desk
or
with
the
boy
behind
me
my
mother
thought
differently
she
thought
that
i
should
have
left
my
rambunctious
behavior
behind
in
elementary
school
parent
teacher
conference
continued
to
be
the
same
tense
event
that
they
have
be
in
elementary
school
my
grade
continued
to
be
the
same
too
straight
s
on
a
scale
of
to
with
be
a
fail
grade
in
all
the
academic
class
and
s
in
behavior
with
the
ever
present
comment
about
my
lively
nature
the
only
class
i
disliked
be
religion
i
never
take
to
it
it
struck
me
as
a
bunch
of
fairy
tale
and
i
resent
have
to
listen
to
and
believe
in
them
i
start
push
back
one
time
the
teacher
be
tell
us
how
joshua
stop
the
sun
during
the
siege
of
jericho
i
raise
my
hand
yes
grof
our
teacher
always
call
us
by
our
last
name
and
for
the
most
part
we
call
each
other
by
our
last
name
as
be
proper
etiquette
i
slid
out
from
behind
my
desk
and
stood
in
the
aisle
to
respond
how
could
joshua
stop
the
sun
if
the
sun
be
not
move
i
ask
after
all
we
know
that
it
be
the
earth
that
orbit
the
sun
and
the
sun
be
stationary
the
teacher
glare
at
me
if
the
sun
have
be
move
his
look
might
have
stop
it
he
open
his
mouth
and
close
it
then
bark
at
me
this
be
religion
grof
you
either
believe
it
or
you
do
not
you
never
ever
argue
with
it
the
other
student
snicker
which
make
the
teacher
even
madder
i
sat
down
inwardly
pleased
with
myself
i
thought
i
would
score
a
point
grof
religion
when
i
get
home
i
told
my
father
what
i
have
do
he
pat
ted
me
on
the
back
of
my
head
his
usual
sign
of
approval
well
do
kid
he
say
before
i
could
get
a
grade
in
religion
which
might
have
cool
my
self
satisfaction
new
rule
come
down
religious
instruction
be
no
longer
compulsory
i
be
out
of
that
class
as
soon
as
i
be
allow
as
i
say
most
kid
call
each
other
by
their
last
name
unfortunately
i
be
in
a
minority
in
the
year
after
the
war
i
have
gain
weight
first
i
get
pudgy
then
i
get
even
pudgier
kid
at
school
start
call
me
a
variety
of
nickname
range
from
pufi
which
mean
fatso
to
rofi
the
sound
a
pig
make
i
do
not
like
be
call
these
name
but
the
more
i
protest
the
louder
the
other
kid
shout
them
at
me
across
the
schoolyard
so
i
resign
myself
to
be
pufi
or
rofi
they
become
my
name
even
in
my
own
thought
a
big
problem
be
that
i
be
not
particularly
athletic
in
the
first
place
and
the
heavier
i
get
the
less
athletic
i
become
whenever
team
be
chosen
i
be
always
the
last
kid
to
be
picked
the
game
we
played
most
often
in
exercise
period
and
after
school
be
soccer
i
be
not
particularly
skillful
and
i
be
slow
i
come
up
with
a
convenient
excuse
for
my
poor
performance
it
have
be
seven
year
since
my
bout
with
scarlet
fever
but
i
do
not
know
whether
my
heart
have
fully
recover
i
declare
that
it
would
be
bad
for
my
heart
if
i
strain
it
i
be
exempt
from
strenuous
exercise
and
consequently
be
perennially
relegate
to
the
role
of
goalie
in
our
soccer
match
goalie
do
not
have
to
run
around
much
i
be
a
mediocre
goalie
i
neither
help
nor
harm
our
team
in
any
big
way
but
my
career
as
a
goalie
be
soon
cut
short
one
time
when
we
be
play
soccer
in
the
schoolyard
i
tripped
over
the
metal
rod
that
serve

i
thought
they
would
straighten

piece
of
bent
wire
instead
i
be
told
i
would
have
to
be
put
to
sleep
so
the
doctor
could
set

scar
me
my
mother

that
set
my
arm
would
hurt
but
i
would
not

if
i

i
do
not

a
choice
as
she
be
explain
this
the
nurse
take
me
into
another

my
entire
face
with
a
tentlike
mask
they
told
me
to
start
counting
from
one
to
ten
a
sweetish
smell
be
come
through
the
mask
before
i
could
get
to
ten
my
tongue
stop
move
and
i
be
unconscious
i
come
to
with
a
combination
of
sensation
as
i
open
my
eye
i
could
see
daylight
through
the
mask
over
my
face
and
i
could
feel
something
warm
move
up
on
my
arm
i
have
a
flash
of
terrible
sadness
i
thought
they
must
have
decide
to
amputate
my
arm
and
that
be
my
mother
kiss
it
good
bye
then
somebody
remove
the
mask
and
i
could
see
that
a
white
cloth
soak
in
warm
water
and
wet
with
plaster
be
be
wrap
around
my
arm
my
arm
be
straight
once
again
the
doctor
told
me
that
once
the
cast
be
completely
hard
it
would
make
an
excellent
weapon
to
elbow
other
kid
with
then
my
mother
and
i
walk
home
i
immediately
put
the
doctor
advice
into
practice
and
whack
my
classmate
with
the
cast
whenever
i
could
but
the
best
part
about
break
my
arm
be
that
i
could
not
play
the
piano
i
hat
piano
lesson

i
could
not
get
out
of
them
until
i
have
the
good
fortune
of
trip
over
the
goalpost
six
week
later
when
the
cast
be
cut
off
i
use
the
excuse
of
the
break
in
my
practice
to
stop
piano
lesson
for
good
to
my
surprise
my
parent
do
not
protest
a
lot
it
turn
out
that
they
have
want
to
get
some
new
furniture
in
the
big
room
anyway
a
short
while
later
they
sell
the
piano
and
it
be
go
from
the
room
and
from
my
life
the
new
furniture
make
the
big
room
more
attractive
even
before
it
be
the
best
look
room
in
our
apartment
while
my
father
be

war
his
partner
in
the
dairy
business
have
expand
into
an
undertaking

persian
rug
and
later
painting
by
hungarian
artist
it
be
never
more
than
a
sideline
to
the
dairy
business
there
be
no
display
area
the
canvas
and
roll
up
rug
be
house
in
a
storefront
adjacent
to
the
dairy

to
much
and
some
time
after
my
father
return

and
his
partner
liquidate
it
as
part
of
the
liquidation
some
new

in
our
apartment

much
of
the
floor
in
the
big

they
be
like
the
oriental

big
in
addition
half
a
dozen
painting
appear
on
our
wall
the
painting
capture
my
imagination
one
be
of
an
old
man
sit
in
a
doorway
of
an
alley
in
a
small
town
that
remind
me
of
kiskoros
there
be
a
small
country
scene
that
remind
me
of
the
countryside
that
i
would
see
from
the
train
go
to
and
from
kiskoros
there
be
a
couple
of
big
work
too
one
be
of
a
young
woman
sit
on
a
wheelbarrow
as
if
wait
to
participate
in
a
picnic
judging
from
the
way
she
be
dress
with
a
colorful
hat
with
a
wide
brim
she
must
have
live
long
ago
the
picture
that
attract
me
the
most
be
a
painting
of
a
ballerina
lace
up
her
toe
shoe
the
ballerina
be
very
pretty
she
look
a
little
bit
like
my
mother
she
lit
up
the
room
and
attract
my
eye
every
time
i
enter
the
painting
be
hung
on
the
wall
so
that
i
face
it
when
i
played
the
piano
have
it
there
do
not
help
my
concentration
during
the
few
month
that
i
take
lesson
fortunately
the
ballerina
survive
after
the
piano
go
unfortunately
the
dairy
business
do
not
while
i
be
struggle
with
piano
lesson
religion
class
and
a
broken
arm
there
be
a
grow
din
of
political
event
go
on
around
us
even
though
the
hungarian
communist
party
have
the
support
of
the
russian
it
be
just
one
of
many
party
that
make
up
the
political
scene
after
the
war
it
do
not
gain
a
majority
in
either
of
the
first
two
postwar
election
in
and
in
august
however
the
communist
won
and
take
charge
of
the
government
soon
private
company
be
take
over
by
the
state
first
large
company
be
nationalize
then
they
move
on
to
small
company
in
short
order
our
dairy
be
nationalize
the
immediate
impact
on
my
life
be
the
disappearance
of
the
ready
supply
of
fresh
cottage
cheese
butter
and
yogurt
that
we
be
accustom
to
even
before
the
dairy
be
nationalize
my
father
have
start
a
new
job
work
for
a
state
own
department
store
and
he
be
able
to
continue
to
work
there
after
the
nationalization
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
he
do
but
he
be
some
kind
of
a
bigwig
i
could
tell
because
whenever
i
visit
him
at
his
office
it
seem
that
people
be
overly
nice
to
me
they
paid
too
much
attention
to
me
and
compliment
me
when
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
reason
for
it
this
make
me
uncomfortable
i
do
not
like
it
once
i
go
to
a
winter
party
thrown
by
the
department
store
for
its
employee
there
be
so
many
people
that
i
be
able
to
get
lose
in
the
crowd
mostly
i
sat
with
the
drummer
of
the
band
and
watch
the
celebration
i
have
the
feel
that
my
father
be
be
treat
with
special
attention
he
seem
to
be
have
a
good
time
dance
very
energetically
with
my
mother
and
also
with
other
woman
he
dance
to
both
western
dance
music
and
hungarian
song
but
i
have
the
impression
that
people
be
watch
him
all
the
time
sometime
after
this
party
my
father
be
promote
he
become
the
director
of
a
state
company
in
charge
of
livestock
breeding
and
export
now
he
have
even
more
sign
of
importance
he
have
an
elegant
secretary
and
a
car
with
a
driver
my
mother
never
like
his
secretary
consequently
i
have
an
uneasy
feel
about
her
when
i
visit
my
father
the
secretary
be
awfully
sweet
and
attentive
to
me
but
i
have
a
feel
that
her
smile
and
interest
as
well
as
everything
else
about
her
be
for
show
the
driver
on
the
other
hand
be
a
lot
of
fun
he
let
me
ride
up
front
and
answer
my
question
about
the
working
of
the
car
seriously
and
patiently
even
as
the
nature
of
my
father
work
change
thing
be
change
at
home
too
gizi
have
to
leave
us
increasingly
employ
somebody
be
consider
the
same
as
exploit
them
it
be
something
the
communist
government
frown
on
so
my
father
felt
we
could
no
longer
have
a
maid
gizi
and
sinko
go
back
to
her
hometown
i
miss
them
both
very
much
my
mother
first
continued
work
at
the
dairy
then
when
the
dairy
be
nationalize
she
get
a
job
as
a
bookkeeper
at
a
state
own
company
that
manage
the
distribution
of
coal
and
heating
oil
with
gizi
go
she
now
have
to
take
over
in
the
kitchen
too
my
mother
cooking
be
a
very
simple
affair
she
mostly
make
simple
dish
such
as
potato
with
paprika
and
sausage
my
father
love
lecso
a
concoction
of
tomato
red
pepper
green
pepper
and
sausage
so
my
mother
make
a
lot
of
that
and
she
make
goulash
a
soup
make
of
the
same
ingredient
but
with
a
lot
more
liquid
the
advantage
of
these
dish
be
that
she
could
make
a
big
batch
and
warm
up
little
portion
of
it
for
quite
some
time
i
get
into
the
routine
of
come
home
from
school
warm
up
some
leftover
and
cleaning
up
after
myself
this
be
my
main
meal
of
the
day
big
family
dinner
have
always
be
rare
and
with
gizi
go
they
become
even
less
frequent
when
they
happen
they
usually
happen
in
a
restaurant
on
a
sunday
some
sunday
my
parent
visit
with
friend
either
at
our
house
or
at
a
restaurant
or
they
get
together
with
my
father
old
sister
iren
and
her
husband
sanyi
sometimes
they
go
on
an
out
in
the
hill
surround
budapest
always
take
care
to
stick
near
the
streetcar
line
because
my
father
hat
walk
sometimes
i
would
go
with
them
other
time
i
would
stay
home
and
hang
around
with
gabi
i
do
not
see
a
whole
lot
of
my
parent
my
mother
and
father
return
home
from
work
at
different
time
and
it
be
our
custom
that
everyone
ate
whenever
they
arrive
home
by
the
time
my
parent
come
home
i
would
usually
be
cooped
up
in
my
room
reading
or
do
my
homework
they
would
always
ask
me
how
school
be
and
i
would
give
them
a
report
either
detailed
or
not
depend
on
my
mood
i
rarely
need
help
with
my
homework
but
whenever
i
write
an
interest
composition
i
show
it
to
my
parent
they
be
often
helpful
and
i
would
frequently
rewrite
my
composition
as
a
result
of
their
comment
have
nationalize
all
business
the
government
turn
its
attention
to
the
school
system
the
communist
do
not
approve
of
parochial
school
and
close
them
down
so
two
year
into
what
be
suppose
to
be
an
eight
year
sequence
at
gymnasium
i
have
to
change
school
come
the
fall
of
i
would
not
return
to
evangelikus
but
would
have
to
go
to
a
neighborhood
school
even
though
i
have
no
feeling
about
the
new
school
one
way
or
another
i
be
sorry
to
be
uprooted
i
like
it
at
evangelikus
i
like
the
school
the
student
and
the
teacher
but
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
the
communist
government
call
all
the
shot
i
have
mixed
feeling
about
the
communist
on
the
one
hand
i
felt
that
they
save
my
mother
life
and
my
own
i
be
very
grateful
for
this
and
my
gratitude
make
me
want
to
believe
in
them
and
what
they
stood
for
on
the
other
hand
since
they
have
take
power
they
increasingly
interfere
with
our
daily
life
they
take
away
my
parent
business
they
uprooted
me
from
my
school
they
force
gizi
and
sinko
to
leave
all
in
the
name
of
some
political
philosophy
that
i
do
not
really
understand
there
be
other
strange
going
on
with
the
government
in
the
spring
of
everybody
be
talk
about
the
arrest
of
one
of
the
top
communist
minister
a
man
name
laszlo
rajk
the
newspaper
and
the
radio
have
previously
described
him
as
a
heroic
freedom
fighter
so
it
be
a
shock
when
that
may
he
be
arrest
he
be
charge

be
finally
fulfil
i

an
air
gun
i
have
want

time
i
ogle
the
one
displayed
in
the
shop
window
of
sport
good
store
and
imagine
myself
hold
one
in
my
hand
my
father
have
say
that
he
would
let
me
buy
one
if
i
save
my
allowance
that
spring
after
a
year
of
diligent
save
skip
numerous
movie
and
many
ice

only
half
the
money
i
need
my
father
take
pity
on
me
and
agree
to
match
my
saving
at
last
the
air
gun
would
be
mine
we
go
to
the
store
together
the
gun
i
chose
have
a
polished
wood
stock
and
a
gleam
steel
barrel
you
broke
the
barrel
open
insert
the
pellet
in
a
recess
inside
then
close
the
barrel
opening
and
closing
the
barrel
pumped
up
the
air
pressure
until
the
gun
be
ready
to
shoot
i
walk
out
of
the
store
carefully
clutch
my
new
treasure
it
be
the
most
valuable
thing
i
would
ever
own
i
take
my
gun
everywhere
i
take
it
to
city
park

i
also
practice
at
home
from
the
airshaft
window
shoot
across
the
empty

little
puff
of
dust
as
they
hit
the
plaster
on
the
wall
of
the
opposite
building
my
father
taught
me
never
to
point
the
gun
at
anyone
even
when
it
be
empty
so
i
would
mount
the
tram
with
the
gun
casually
slung
on
my
shoulder
but
i
always
make
sure
that
the
barrel
point
to
the
ground
my
real
opportunity
to
learn
how
to
use
it

also
unlike

he
call
me
andris
never
pufi
or
rofi
we
have
the
run
of
the
place
we
dug
hole
and
turn
them
into
cave
we
go
hunt
for
frog
something
i
do
with
a
vengeance
since
i
hat
frog
and
want
to
kill
every
one
of
them
and
we
hung
around
with
the
kehls
son
adam
who
be
eighteen
year
old
and
a
man
of
the
world
adam
be
very
capable
with
tool
bicycle
and
girl
all
of
which
gabi
and
i
found
fascinate
once
we
tag
along
with
adam
and
come
upon
a
group
of
girl
who
work
on
a
neighborhood
plot
adam
go
off
to
chat
with
them
then
told
us
to
wait
while
he
disappear
with
one
of
the
girl
into
a
grove
of
tree
a
while
later
he
reappear
look
very
smug
he
slap
gabi
and
me
on
the
back
and
say
let
go
to
work
as
if
nothing
have
happen
i
often
wonder
about
what
adam
and
that
girl
do
in
the
tree
but
i
never
have
the
nerve
to
ask
most
of
the
time
gabi
and
i
be
left
to
entertain
ourselves
a
key
item
be
the
air
gun
unfortunately
i
could
not
use
it
as
much
as
i
would
have
like
because
the
pellet
be
expensive
and
i
would
already
use
up
all
of
my
allowance
the
pellet
come
in
box
of
five
hundred
but
i
be
concerned
that
we
would
run
out
so
gabi
and
i
make
every
shot
count
i
be
a
well
shot
than
gabi
i
shot
at
can
and
piece
of
wood
then
eventually
at
sparrow
perch
on
the
branch
of
tree
after
a
while
i
get
to
be
good
enough
so
that
i
could
sometimes
hit
a
sparrow
and
knock
it
down
i
felt
very
powerful
when
it
fell
dead
to
the
ground
once
i
shot
a
pigeon
it
fell
down
but
it
be
not
dead
when
i
go
to
look
at
it
it
look
back
at
me
it
could
not
move
i
felt
awful
i
picked
it
up
and
take
it
back
to
the
house
make
it
a
nest
give
it
water
and
seed
and
nurse
it
back
to
health
eventually
it
flew
away
after
that
i
do
not
shoot
at
pigeon
but
somehow
i
thought
it
be
okay
to
shoot
at
sparrow
once
a
week
on
wednesday
kehl
bacsi
and
adam

the

vegetable
be
weigh
in
handheld
scale
then
people
put
them
directly
in
their
shopping
basket
after
the
isolation
of
the
farm
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
lot
of
people
talk
and
bargaining
be
excite
but
it
be
also
hot
and
dusty
and
noisy
i
be
usually
ready
to
go
home
after
a
few
hour
but
i
have
to
wait
until
kehl
bacsi
be
do
with
his
business
the
ride
back
always
seem
twice
as
long
the
road
from

to
the
farm
go
past
what
have
be
my
grandparent
house
i
always
have
a
tight
feel
in
my
chest
when
we
go
by
because
by
now
i
knew
my
relative
have
be
take
from
that
house
to
be
kill
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
there
be
great
excitement
in
the
town
they
be
go
to
pave
the
sidewalk
from
the
train
station
at
the
edge
of
town
to
the
square
in
the
middle
people
talk
about
nothing
but
this
impend
project
it
take
a
few
week
and
lot
of
start
and
stop
but
when
it
be
do
there
be
in
fact
a
pave
sidewalk
separate
from
the
dirt
road
by
a
rain
ditch
people
from
kiskoros
felt
that
they
have
make
a
major
step
forward
in
progress
i
myself
make
two
major
step
forward
that
summer
i
learn
to
swim
and
i
learn
to
ride
a
bike
there
be
an
irrigation
ditch
about
a
mile
or
so
from
the
farm
it
be
maybe
ten
or
twelve
foot
wide
and
one
hundred
foot
long
and
fill
with
brackish
water
it
have
a
slippery
mucky
bottom
and
shallow
slop
side
but
it
be
deep
enough
in
the
middle
so
that
i
could
not
stand
the
summer
be
hot
so
gabi
and
i
go
there
often
the
walk
make
us
definitely
hotter
but
we
could
look
forward
to
cool
off
in
the
water
and
the
cool
feel
last
almost
until
we
get
home
again
gabi
knew
how
to
swim
and
show
off
by
swim
the
length
of
the
irrigation
ditch
i
really
want
to
learn
not
only
because
this
be
a
skill
i
want
to
acquire
but
also
because
i
be
embarrass
to
be
splash
around
on
the
shallow
side
of
the
ditch
while
gabi
be
paddle
away
across
the
middle
my
ear
be
go
to
be
a
problem
i
be
not
allow
to
let
water
in
them
that
be
the
main
reason
i
have
not
learn
how
to
swim
i
even
have
to
be
very
careful
when
i
take
bath
however
i
would
found
that
if
i
cut
waxy
earplug
to
just
the
right
size
and
warm
them
up
by
endless
knead
i
could
mold
them
to
seal
my
ear
canal
even
then
i
do
not
dare
put
my
head
underwater
but
at
least
i
could
go
in
in
anticipation
i
have
brought
earplug
from
budapest
as
well
as
a
swim
belt
make
out
of
block
of
cork
strap
together
when
i
strap
the
belt
around
my
waist
it
kept
me
from
sinking
and
give
me
confidence
after
i
realize
that
i
would
not
end
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
i
work
up
the
courage
to
stand
on
one
side
of
the
ditch
i
count
one
two
three
then
i
push
myself
off
hold
my
head
high
out
of
the
water
to
keep
the
water
out
of
my
ear
a
push
like
that
get
me
halfway
to
the
other
side
i
paddle
furiously
imitate
gabi
breaststroke
and
keep
my
head
out
of
the
water
to
keep
my
ear
dry
to
my
amazement
my
body
only
inched
forward
i
be
gasp
for
air
before
i
get
close
enough
to
the
other
side
that
i
could
reach
the
bottom
with
my
foot
and
stand
up
again
still
i
have
make
it
across
i
be
elate
i
look
for
recognition
and
an
acknowledgment
of
my
feat
but
there
be
no
one
to
give
it
gabi
be
off
someplace
else
i
stood
in
the
shallow
part
of
the
irrigation
ditch
catch
my
breath
then
when
i
be
breathing
normally
again
i
set
out
again
for
the
other
side
i
practice
day
after
day
week
after
week
and
bit
by
bit
i
manage
to
cross
the
ditch
with
a
lot
less
effort
and
a
lot
less
panic
near
the
end
of
our
stay
i
gather
enough
confidence
to
try
it
without
the
cork
belt
to
my
surprise
i
found
it
be
even
easy
i
start
swim
the
length
of
the
ditch
i
be
slow
much
slow
than
gabi
but
give
enough
time
i
could
cover
the
same
distance
i
be
very
proud
of
myself
i
be
not
good
at
physical
activity
and
it
give
me
great
pleasure
to
master
one
i
felt
especially
distinguish
because
many
of
my
friend
and
schoolmate
do
not
know
how
to
swim
the
other
activity
that
i
master
that
summer
be
learn
to
ride
a
bike
every
once
in
a
while
with
great
patience
kehl
bacsi
or
adam
put
me
in
the
saddle
of
their
big
bike
and
push
me
on
the
rut
road
so
i
could
get
a
feel
for
how
to
steer
i
could
not
really
get
a
feel
for
pedal
because
my
foot
do
not
reach
the
pedal
they
would
let
go
of
the
bike
for
a
few
second
at
a
time
and
with
heart
pound
i
manage
to
keep
the
bike
upright
most
of
the
time
when
i
start
to
teeter
they
be
there
to
right
the
bike
before
i
crashed
next
we
go
to
the
top
of
a
small
grassy
slope
i
climbed
onto
the
bike
one
of
them
give
me
a
push
and
i
glide
down
to
the
bottom
where
the
other
one
caught
me
before
i
crashed
then
i
push
the
bike
back
up
the
slope
and
do
it
again
and
again
until
i
get
comfortable
in
the
saddle
later
kehl
bacsi
borrow
a
woman
bike
and
give
it
to
me
not
only
be
this
bike
small
than
his
but
it
do
not
have
the
center
bar
so
i
could
low
myself
to
pedal
the
glide
exercise
on
the
big
bike
have
taught
me
how
to
balance
and
soon
i
be
pedal
myself
along
the
rut
road
gabi
join
me
on
adam
bike
he
be
too
short
to
sit
on
the
seat
and
reach
the
pedal
but
he
be
able
to
ride
it
stand
up
i
crashed
a
few
time
but
it
never
dampen
my
enthusiasm
unfortunately
there
be
no
question
of
my
rid
a
bike
in
budapest
for
one
thing
i
do
not
have
one
for
another
my
parent
would
not
hear
of
me
pedal
down
the
street
alongside
car
and
truck
and
streetcar
they
be
concerned
that
with
my
bad
ear
i
would
be
run
over
by
an
unheard
vehicle
before
i
get
a
block
away
from
home
swim
be
a
different
story
this
i
could
continue
in
budapest
there
be
a
public
pool
in
city
park
the
pool
be
much
big
than
the
irrigation
ditch
about
twenty
five
yard
wide
and
fifty
yard
long
it
be
a
perfect
place
for
me
to
practice
what
i
have
learn
there
be
a
couple
of
week
before
school
start
again
i
would
go
to
the
pool
every
morning
when
it
first
open
and
before
it
fill
up
with
people
whose
splash
and
play
around
distract
me
at
first
it
be
a
struggle
to
make
it
across
the
width
of
the
pool
but
as
the
day
go
on
it
get
easy
and
easy
within
a
couple
of
week
i
be
able
to
swim
back
and
forth
many
many
time
the
pool
be
the
center
of
my
day
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
later
in
the
morning
other
kid
i
knew
would
show
up
and
we
would
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
there
i
could
not
participate
in
most
water
play
because
i
fear
get
water
in
my
ear
earplug
notwithstanding
but
it
be
still
fun
still
the
most
important
part
of
the
day
for
me
be
the
first
hour
when
i
practice
my
swim
i
kept
hop
that
the
swim
would
help
me
lose
some
of
my
pudginess
but
that
do
not
happen
i
would
start
a
new
year
at
a
new
school
but
i
would
still
be
pufi
when
i
come
home
after
swim
i
often
hung
around
the
warm
dusty
apartment
and
listen
to
the
rajk
trial
the
trial
be
broadcast
on
the
radio
every
day
much
of
the
day
and
everyone
who
could
be
glue
to
their
radio
set
i
listen
to
rajk
examination
with
morbid
fascination
i
could
not
understand
how
a
man
who
fought
against
the
german
and
be
a
member
of
the
underground
could
turn
against
his
cause
and
his
country
but
there
it
be
he
have
confess
it
himself
he
be
sentence
to
death
just
as
the
new
school
year
begin
my
mother
look
over
my
shoulder
i
be
pretty
diligent
about
do
what
i
have
to
do
chapter
eight
dob
street
school
istarted
the
school
year
not
just
with
a
new
school
but
also
with
a
new
address
we
do
not
move
the
communist
government
have
decide
to
rename
all
the
significant
street
in
budapest
with
name
of
famous
russian
the
part
of

after
the
soviet
poet
mayakovsky
dob
street
where
my
new
school
be
locate
be
not
important
enough
to
get
a
new
name
it
be
a
narrow
nondescript
street
in
a
nondescript
neighborhood
about
two
block
back
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
kiraly
street
there
be
a
small
post
office
some
humdrum
shop
and
a
neighborhood
school
as
shabby
and
run
down
as
its
surroundings
dob
street
school
be
a
comedown
after
the
polish
and
order
of
the
evangelikus
gymnasium
on
the
surface
the
school
be
run
the
same
as
evangelikus
the
curriculum
cover
the
same
subject
and
the
class
be
the
same
size
a
number
of
kid
like
me
have
be
funnel
in
from
other
school
but
most
of
the
student
have
attend
dob
street
school
all
along
neither
they
nor
the
teacher
have
the
same
seriousness
of
purpose
that
be
so
fundamental
to
evangelikus
there
be
no
question
of
be
proud
of
a
school
cap
from
dob
street
in
any
case
we
do
not
have
one
there
be
girl
at
dob
street
but
they
be
in
separate
classroom
in
a
separate
wing
of
the
building
we
saw
them
only
in
the
hall
as
we
come
and
go
to
class
and
during
recess
period
to
my
surprise
i
ran
into
eva
the
girl
who
would
have
a
crush
on
me
in
first
grade
if
it
be
not
for
her
name
i
would
not
have
recognize
her
she
look
very
grown
up
and
even
wore
stocking
to
school
which
be
very
intrigue
but
beyond
a
pert
smile
hello
she
paid
no
attention
to
me
i
wonder
if
her
lack
of
interest
be
a
punishment
for
how
i
have
behave
to
her
in
first
grade
eventually
i
conclude
that
it
be
more
likely
that
my
pudginess
put
her
off
initially
the
grade
system
at
dob
street
school
be
the
same
as
it
have
be
at
evangelikus
then
one
day
it
change
another
manifestation
of
the
increase
soviet
influence
on
our
life
whereas
before
the
top
grade
be
and
the
fail
grade
be
from
one
day
to
the
next
the
grade
scheme
be
turn
around
now
become
the
top
grade
and
the
fail
grade
this
be
how
school
operate
in
the
soviet
union
we
be
told
so
it
would
be
how
school
operate
in
hungary
but
the
big
change
from
evangelikus
be
the
teacher
a
number
of
the
dob
street
teacher
be
obviously
new
to
the
profession
what
get
them
there
be
not
their
teach
skill
but
their
ability
to
represent
the
communist
government
point
of
view
we
figure
that
they
be
loyal
cadre
who
have
be
plucked
from
position
as
minor
party
functionary
give
some
quick
training
in
a
subject
and
immediately
assign
to
one
class
or
another
a
prime
example
be
our
geography
teacher
his
name
be
gonci
the
word
sound
a
bit
like
the
hungarian
slang
word
for
sperm
so
after
the
first
class
we
all
call
him
that
behind
his
back
i
do
not
know
what
mr
gonci
do
before
he
show
up
at
our
school
but
he
seem
to
have
acquire
his
knowledge
of
geography
by
skim
the
chapter
he
be
about
to
teach
just
before
he
taught
them
to
us
our
lesson
dealt
predominantly
with
the
geography
of
the
soviet
union
and
its
ally
the
other
communist
bloc
country
mr
gonci
developed
favorite
among
the
country
we
study
these
include
of
course
the
soviet
union
and
for
some
reason
romania
the
rest
of
the
world
get
only
cursory
attention
i
do
not
remember
study
anything
about
england
or
the
united
state
mr
gonci
be
very
predictable
so
predictable
that
the
class
make
a
stand
joke
of
it
whoever
be
call
upon
to
recite
stood
at
the
blackboard
and
start
listing
the
fact
and
figure
about
the
country
we
be
study
even
before
mr
gonci
ask
him
to
do
so
the
rest
of
the
class
have
a
fun
time
watch
to
see
if
mr
gonci
realize
what
be
go
on
he
never
do
he
merely
nod
his
head
as
the
recitation
continued
the
class
express
its
contempt
of
mr
gonci
by
act
up
more
and
more
my
tendency
to
chat
in
class
no
longer
get
me
in
trouble
i
have
not
change
the
environment
be
less
discipline
so
i
do
not
stand
out
as
much
as
before
we
act
in
way
that
would
have
be
unthinkable
at
evangelikus
just
a
few
month
ago
but
some
of
these
way
be
fun
someone
have
accidentally
kick
a
soccer
ball
into
the
classroom
window
and
broken
the
glass
the
window
be
repair
by
set
new
pane
in
the
window
frame
with
triangular
nail
then
wedge
a
soft
putty
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
when
the
putty
solidify
in
a
day
or
so
it
form
an
airtight
seal
between
the
glass
and
the
frame
as
at
evangelikus
our
class
stayed
in
the
same
room
all
day
and
the
teacher
come
to
us
the
break
between
the
change
in
teacher
give
us
the
opportunity
to
get
to
the
putty
some
student
waste
no
time
in
scrap
out
the
putty
while
it
be
still
soft
they
wad
it
into
ball
and
immediately
the
ball
be
fly
back
and
forth
across
the
room
then
someone
make
a
great
discovery
if
you
threw
a
ball
of
putty
against
the
ceiling
it
stuck
for
a
while
then
suddenly
fell
down
and
splatter
all
over
the
floor
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
person
sit
below
it
meanwhile
the
putty
thrower
studiously
bent
over
his
book
get
away
unidentified
it
be
too
good
a
discovery
to
go
to
waste
just
before
mr
gonci
class
some
of
the
boy
threw
putty
ball
where
they
would
stick
on
the
ceiling
right
above
mr
gonci
desk
when
mr
gonci
come
in
we
be
all
sit
sedately
in
our
place
hold
our
breath
expectantly
mr
gonci
take
his
position
at
the
desk
he
actually
seem
a
little
take
aback
by
the
silence
of
the
class
but
the
quiet
be
broken
when
the
first
putty
ball
fell
from
the
ceiling
and
explode
on
the
paperwork
in
front
of
him
he
erupt
in
anger
shout
who
do
that
who
do
that
he
glare
at
the
class
his
eye
terrorize
us
then
another
ball
splatter
on
his
desk
and
another
we
could
not
contain
ourselves
anymore
and
broke
out
in
laughter
even
mr
gonci
furious
shout
could
not
stop
us
we
do
not
learn
much
geography
history
class
be
strange
also
although
for
a
different
reason
in
the
early
part
of
the
year
we
have
study
the
history
of
hungary
and
its
place
in
the
austro
hungarian
empire
toward
the
end
of
the
year
we
start
study
modern
history
with
most
of
the
focus
on
world
war
ii
the
story
of
the
end
of
world
war
ii
be
told
differently
from
what
i
remember
accord
to
our
history
book
and
our
teacher
the
japanese
surrender
to
the
invade
russian
army
there
be
a
one
sentence
mention
of
the
atom
bomb
which
be
described
as
a
desperate
attempt
by
the
american
to
gain
credit
for
the
japanese
defeat
yet
i
remember
the
newsboy
run
up
and
down
the
street
in
august
shout
about
what
i
heard
as
the
auto
bomb
judging
from
the
reaction
of
the
people
around
me
at
the
time
everyone
thought
the
american
atom
bomb
end
the
war
i
be
die
to
raise
my
hand
and
point
this
out
to
my
teacher
but
i
thought
well
of
it
this
be
not
religion
class
at
evangelikus
contradict
a
position
that
be
even
vaguely
associate
with
the
communist
party
do
not
seem
like
a
wise
thing
to
do
i
kept
my
hand
down
i
have
one
very
good
teacher
mr
feldman
taught
physic
with
great
energy
and
enthusiasm
despite
have
a
bad
leg
that
make
him
walk
with
a
limp
unlike
many
of
my
other
teacher
he
knew
his
subject
thoroughly
and
really
enjoy
teach
i
like
physic
well
enough
but
then
something
happen
that
make
me
like
it
much
more
one
day
mr
feldman
call
on
me
to
explain
how
a
siphon
work
he
put
a
tall
pot
of
water
on
his
desk
and
an
empty
pot
on
a
chair
seat
next
to
it
then
he
loop
a
rubber
tube
from
the
pot
on
the
desk
down
to
the
pot
on
the
seat
he
suck
on
the
end
of
the
tube
go
into
the
empty
pot
to
get
the
water
flow
then
step
away
to
the
class
amazement
the
water
kept
flow
up
the
tube
over
the
side
of
the
tall
pot
and
down
into
the
empty
pot
on
the
chair
it
seem
impossible
to
have
water
climb
over
a
wall
against
the
force
of
gravity
mr
feldman
call
on
me
to
explain
what
make
the
water
climb
uphill
i
star
at
the
experiment
then
in
a
flash
the
explanation
become
clear
i
enthusiastically
explain
that
the
water
have
to
climb
up
because
it
have
no
choice
once
the
flow
be
start
if
the
water
do
not
continue
to
climb
up
the
tube
and
over
the
rim
of
the
pot
a
bubble
of
vacuum
would
be
create
the
vacuum
would
then
suck
the
water
up
so
water
have
to
continue
to
flow
upward
it
be
the
need
to
fill
the
would
be
vacuum
that
make
the
water
climb
over
the
edge
of
the
pot
this
all
make
perfect
sense
to
me
and
i
be
quite
pleased
with
myself
then
i
look
at
mr
feldman
his
face
be
radiant
with
approval
as
he
say
what
i
like
about
you
grof
be
that
when
you
figure
something
out
you
really
understand
it
thoroughly
i
felt
as
if
i
have
discover
a
new
law
of
physic
from
then
on
physic
be
my

they
barely
kept

chapter
ahead
of
the

there
be
a
feel
of
grow
resentment
toward
thing

be
not
anything
i
ever
heard
say
but
i
could

in
my
classmate
surly
reaction

about

chore
of

and
setback
at

the
silence
on

replace
what

an
optimistic
air
about
a
new
era
in

fear
gradually
dissipate
when

for
some
time
his

continued
to
visit

on
the

ongoing
series
of
witty
intellectual
conversation

before
his
illness

to
know
through
his
various
job
these
new
friend
brought
their
friend
it
get
to
the
point
where
i
could
not
keep
track
of
who
have
come
with
whom
the
conversation
be
not
so
much
discussion
as
heat
argument
where
people
shout
interrupt
each
other
and
wave
their
hand
about
a
lot
at
first
the
loudness
of
the
argument

then
i
realize
that
while
they
be
excite
nobody
ever
get
really
mad
at
anyone
else
sometimes
i
would
sit
in
the
big
room
try
to
follow
the
line
of
argument
my
hearing
be
not
an
impediment
because
everyone
be
yell
at
the
top
of
his
lung
but
the
subject
be
too
complicate
for
me
to
follow
the
argument
be
about
detailed
point
of
law
under
the
communist
regime

ability
to
argue

be
even
more
impressed

corner

mountain
of
buda
then
we
would
sit
at

my

the
exact
same
dish
his
favorite
stew
and
the
argument
continued
at
the
end
of
a
meal
it
usually
be
my
task
to
figure
out
how
much
of
a
tip
to
leave
my
father
who
be
very
quick
with
math
would
watch
me
do
this
chore
sometimes
i
be
fast
enough
to
win
his
approval
sometimes
he
be
impatient
he
would
glance
over
to
see
if
i
have
do
it
right
which
i
usually
have
and
nod
his
approval

enjoy
it
my
father
be
an
outgo
man
i
be
impressed
and
also
a
little
envious
at
how
easily
he
struck
up
conversation
even
with
complete
stranger
he
be
able
to
find
a
common
bond
with
everyone
he
encounter
the
waiter
at
the
restaurant
the
conductor
on
the
streetcar
or

at
the
table
next
to
him
he
seem
genuinely
interested
in
these
other
people
every
once
in
a
while
in
his
enthusiasm
he
get
me
involve
in
these
conversation
most
of
the
time
i
would
listen
for
a
while
but
i
would
soon
get
impatient
to
go
home
as
i
get
old
i
stop
go
on
these
outing
and
hung
out
with

one
positive
result
of
the
nationalize
of
all
the
school
district
be
that
gabi
and
i
end
up
in
the
same
class
at

continued
to
spend

and

ice
cream
and
the
way
it
be
serve
in
silvery
metal
dish
bead
with
condensation
but
it
be
a
treat
i
could
rarely
afford
from
my
small
allowance
caf
s
be
mostly
for
people
with
money
and
i
do
not
have
much
money
the
caf
s
be
part
of
the
backdrop
as
gabi
and
i
walk
and
talk
one
of
our
favorite
destination
be
margaret
island
an
island
in
the
danube
that
be
a
large
recreational
area
with
restaurant
sport
facility
boathouse
swim
pool
and
such
in
the
summer
the
bench
around
the
island
be
fill
with
couple
make
out
add
another
bit
of
interest
to
the
scenery
of
our
walk
gabi
be
interested
in
music
particularly
opera
a
lot
of
people
be
there
be
two
opera
house
in
budapest
operating
almost
year
round
and
opera
be
regularly
broadcast
on
the
radio
my
piano
lesson
have
left
bad
memory
of
classical
music
and
after
i
stop
take
lesson
i
be
perfectly
happy
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
i
have
even
less
interest
in
opera
i
thought
it
be
silly
for
people
to
sing
through
an
entire
story
it
take
a
lot
of
prod
for
gabi
to
get
me
to
agree
to
accompany
him
to
an
open
air
concert
on
margaret
island
even
then
he
have
to
drag
me
along
the
concert
program
include
a
combination
of
musical
number
dance
number
and
selection
from
opera
we
sat
close
up
so
i
could
hear
the
singer
one
be
a
man
with
a
big
voice
who
sang
the
toreador
song
from
carmen
the
man
energy
and
boom
voice
and
the
audience
enthusiastic
reaction
swept
me
up
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
much
to
gabi
amusement
i
be
on
my
foot
with
everyone
else
yell
for
an
encore
afterward
i
sheepishly
admit
to
gabi
that
i
would
like
to
see
the
whole
opera
that
be
easy
enough
to
do
as
long
as
i
be
willing
to
sit
in
cheap
seat
high
up
and
to
the
side
i
could
afford
the
ticket
we
soon
found
a
production
of
carmen
and
go
to
see
it
with
that
one
experience
i
be
hooked
on
opera
my
voice
be
begin
to
change
my
sing
voice
which
i
try
only
when
i
be
sure
i
be
alone
in
the
apartment
seem
to
be
a
deep
one
i
declare
myself
a
bass
baritone
consequently
my
interest
be
drawn
to
opera
where
the
bass
baritone
have
a
big
part
carmen
with
escamillo
the
toreador
be
one
faust
with
mephistopheles
be
another
i
become
increasingly
fascinate
by
hungarian
bass
and
bass
baritone
opera
singer
particularly
mihaly
szekely
who
rumor
have
it
once
sang
at
the
metropolitan
opera
in
new
york
city
my
all
time
favorite
singer
be
gyorgy
losonczy
who
while
he
do
not
have
szekely
voice
be
an
excellent
dramatic
actor
i
decide
that
he
make
a
good
all
round
role
model
for
me
even
though
he
have
married
a
large
shrill
soprano
whom
i
do
not
like
my
parent
have
recently
replace
the
old
wind
up
phonograph
with
an
electric
record
player
it
be
connect
to
the
loudspeaker
of
the
radio
and
do
not
sound
as
good
as
the
wind
up
phonograph
but
it
could
play
record
after
record
without
my
have
to
jump
up
to
crank
up
the
motor
my
father
taste
ran
toward
gypsy
music
and
popular
song
not
opera
so
whatever
record
we
have
be
of
that
type
my
aunt
iren
found
out
about
my
grow
interest
and
told
me
i
could
have
her
old
opera
record
one
saturday
afternoon
gabi
and
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
her
dusty
phonograph
record
and
take
them
home
to
listen
to
them
we
be
eager
to
examine
our
hoard
work
through
the
pile
we
slap
each
record
on
the
phonograph
sample
it
then
take
it
off
and
replace
it
with
another
most
of
them
be
not
very
interest
and
we
be
gloomily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
our
expedition
would
not
yield
any
treasure
without
even
bother
to
look
at
the
label
i
put
on
the
next
record
an
incredible
voice
sing
a
dynamic
powerful
song
fill
the
room
gabi
and
i
froze
and
listen
as
if
hypnotize
when
the
song
be
over
i
take
off
the
record
to
see
who
it
be
and
what
he
sang
the
singer
be
the
russian
bass
feodor
chali
apin
and
the
opera
be
mussorgsky
boris
godunov
i
learn
everything
i
could
about
chaliapin
he
be
a
workingman
not
musically
train
accord
to
the
story
he
never
really
read
music
and
improvised
beyond
what
the
composer
have
in
mind
he
be
i
thought
just
like
me
in
my
fantasy
i
picture
myself
as
an
opera
singer
when
i
grow
up
my
other
fantasy
be
to
become
a
writer
i
go
through
fit
of
reading
there
be
period
of
time
when
i
read
a
lot
and
period
of
time
when
i
do
not
read
much
at
all
these
reading
spurt
be
always
trigger
by
the
discovery
of
a
writer
whose
book
make
a
big
impression
on
me
karl
may
be
one
of
those
jules
verne
be
another
around
the
time
i
start
go
to
the
dob
street
school
i
discover
c
s
forester
book
about
the
nineteenth
century
british
navy
captain
horatio
hornblower
something
about
the
character
really
intrigue
me
although
i
would
not
tell
anyone
this
i
fancy
myself
as
a
latter
day
captain
hornblower
a
man
of
few
but
deeply
thought
out
word
carry
the
weight
of
the
world
on
my
shoulder
pace
an
imaginary
deck
with
my
hand
behind
my
back
living
a
rich
inner
life
that
my
classmate
never
suspect
have
they
know
what
i
be
really
like
i
imagine
they
would
be
a
lot
more
respectful
nobody
would
call
a
hornblower
pufi
or
dare
to
push
him
around
i
borrow
the
hornblower
book
from
my
neighborhood
library
whenever
i
get
close
to
finish
one
i
start
worry
that
the
next
one
would
not
be
available
after
i
finish
the
entire
series
i
go
back
and
read
them
all
over
again
partly
because
of
these
book
i
start
to
think
of
become
a
writer
i
have
ambition
of
express
what
i
thought
of
as
my
rich
and
multifaceted
self
in
write
the
thought
really
appeal
to
me
to
be
able
to
display
what
i
be
really
like
by
transpose
myself
into
an
imaginary
person
set
in
an
imaginary
scene
undertaking
imaginary
adventure
excite
me
however
this
be
a
fantasy
i
share
with
no
one
it
be
a
part
of
that
rich
inner
life
that
i
be
determine
to
keep
to
myself
yet
i
like
write
and
want
people
to
pay
attention
to
my
composition
so
i
come
up
with
a
compromise
answer
when
people
ask
me
what
i
want
to
do
when
i
grow
up
they
be
ask
more
and
more
frequently
these
day
because
it
be
customary
for
kid
my
age
to
start
think
seriously
about
their
future
career
as
some
of
my
friend
have
already
declare
their
intention
of
become
mechanical
engineer
or
physician
i
felt
pressure
to
name
a
profession
too
i
told
my
parent
some
teacher
and
a
few
of
my
friend
that
i
want
to
become
a
journalist
i
actually
have
the
opportunity
to
be
a
journalist
at
least
in
a
modest
way
my
school
sponsor
a
gathering
where
student
participate
in
a
discussion
of
current
event
afterward
a
woman
introduce
herself
to
me
she
say
that
she
be
the
editor
of
a
weekly
newspaper
for
young
people
and
that
she
like
the
way
i
express
myself
that
i
seem
to
have
an
easy
time
with
word
would
i
be
interested
in
write
about
my
daily
experience
for
her
publication
perhaps
i
would
like
to
visit
the
editorial
office
to
see
what
they
be
like
i
could
barely
contain
my
excitement
the
editorial
office
consist
of
two
room
of
an
apartment
clutter
with
stack
of
paper
and
back
issue
of
the
newspaper
the
editorial
staff
consist
of
two
middle
age
men
each
of
whom
have
a
typewriter
on
which
he
be
busily
clack
away
i
do
not
know
what
a
newspaper
office
should
look
like
this
look
good
enough
to
me
shortly
after
i
submit
my
first
composition
it
be
five
or
six
paragraph
about
what
i
do
during
my
summer
vacation
it
be
accepted
the
paper
be
not
one
either
i
or
my
friend
read
in
truth
it
be
not
very
interest
but
that
change
for
me
once
i
could
look
forward
to
see
my
own
word
in
print
i
become
an
avid
reader
and
brandish
the
newspaper
wherever
i
go
my
parent
be
very
proud
of
me
and
show
my
article
to
my
aunt
iren
who
take
it
home
to
show
to
her
husband
sanyi
the
real
life
journalist
i
eagerly
await
sanyi
praise
but
to
my
disappointment
i
never
heard
from
him
one
way
or
another
from
time
to
time
i
submit
new
composition
all
brief
and
all
deal
with
my
daily
observation
every
one
of
them
get
print
usually
with
very
little
modification
i
be
give
a
little
identification
card
with
my
picture
paste
in
it
that
identify
me
as
correspondent
i
proudly
carry
it
wherever
i
go
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
flash
the
official
proof
that
i
be
a
work
journalist
the
opportunity
never
come
but
that
do
not
diminish
my
pride
most
of
the
time
i
come
up
with
the
idea
for
my
story
but
one
time
my
editor
the
woman
who
recruit
me
have
be
succeed
by
one
of
the
middle
age
men
give
me
an
assignment
he
ask
me
to
report
on
our
school
participation
in
budapest
first
may
day
parade
all
the
student
be
require
to
gather
at
the
school
on
the
first
of
may
and
join
a
huge
citywide
parade
of
people
factory
worker
office
worker
and
other
student
as
well
as
ordinary
people
attendance
be
mandatory
worker
be
grouped
accord
to
their
place
of
employment
student
by
their
school
and
people
who
do
not
work
by
their
apartment
house
block
the
parade
be
suppose
to
be
a
happy
celebration
of
thing
communist
and
soviet
in
fact
it
be
a
slow
shuffle
flow
of
unenthusiastic
people
through
the
street
lead
to
hero
square
a
big
square
near
city
park
there
we
shuffle
by
a
review
stand
where
the
leadership
of
the
hungarian
communist
party
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
wave
as
the
mass
of
people
ooze
past
it
be
hot
and
dusty
and
we
be
thirsty
as
practically
the
entire
city
have
to
march
the
parade
take
forever
and
since
everyone
be
march
there
be
no
spectator
loudspeaker
be
hung
from
lamppost
along
the
parade
route
throughout
the
city
they
blare
energetic
cheer
long
live
the
communist
party
long
live
matyas
rakosi
long
live
stalin
i
get
the
impression
that
the
cheer
and
enthusiastic
applause
emanate
from
hero
square
and
come
from
all
the
marcher
who
have
arrive
there
before
us
however
when
we
arrive
at
the
square
the
only
people
stand
and
wave
be
the
party
member
on
the
review
stand
none
of
the
previous
marcher
have
stuck
around
to
watch
no
other
marcher
be
cheer
none
of
us
be
cheer
yet
the
loudspeaker
continued
to
blare
the
same
shout
and
cheer
over
and
over
i
realize
the
cheer
be
a
record
gabi
and
i
look
at
each
other
surreptitiously
later
we
speculate
that
army
unit
must
have
be
call
up
and
order
to
cheer
and
it
be
their
taped
voice
we
heard
over
the
loudspeaker
i
do
not
submit
an

a
collection
of
enthusiastic
report
about
how
much
fun

and
how
the
energetic

show
the
support
of
the
young
people
of
budapest
for
the
leadership
of
the
communist
party
the
follow
month
in
june
of
scary
news
broke
we
heard
that
the
south
korean
army
puppet
of
the
american
have
invade
north
korea
without
notice
the
war
in
korea
become
the
centerpiece
of
everything
we
read
in
the
newspaper
and
heard
on
the
radio
it
become
the
subject
of
formal
discussion
at
workplace
and
at
school
where
all
of
us
be
exhort
to
demonstrate
our
opposition
to
this
act
of
imperialist
aggression
poster
of
the
korean
peninsula
be
displayed
all
over
budapest
with
sticker
show
the
movement
at
the
front
wherever
i
walk
in
the
city
i
saw
poster
about
the
war
as
well
as
poster
demand
hand
off
korea
the
fortune
of
the
war
turn
quite
quickly
the
line
separate
the
north
korean
army
from
the
south
korean
start
move
southward
the
north
korean
repel
the
south
korean
aggressor
then
take
over
the
initiative
and
rapidly
squeeze
the
south
korean
and
their
american
protector
farther
and
farther
south
toward
the
tip
of
the
korean
peninsula
i
be
puzzle
a
few
year
earlier
i
have
see
the
red
army
defeat
the
german
and
push
them
out
of
budapest
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
north
korean
be
train
by
the
red
army
and
be
equally
proficient
and
dedicate
yet
i
knew
that
the
siege
of
budapest
take
quite
some
time
and
that
even
after
the
german
be
defeat
in
budapest
it
take
three
more
month
before
the
last
german
troop
be
chase
out
of
hungary
hungary
be
a
much
small
country
than
korea
how
could
the
north
korean
who
be
caught
in
a
surprise
attack
by
the
south
korean
rally
this
rapidly
and
defeat
an
army
that
have
the
advantage
of
deliberately
prepare
for
an
attack
for
some
time
beforehand
for
some
reason
i
be
remind
of
my
religion
class
at
evangelikus
while
i
want
to
believe
what
i
be
told
i
could
not
put
aside
my
doubt
however
i
felt
uncomfortable
about
openly
discuss
my
doubt
with
anyone
i
finally
brought
up
the
subject
to
my
father
he
seem
reluctant
to
acknowledge
that
thing
might
not
be
the
way
they
be
suppose
to
be
he
cut
me
short
snap
do
not
be
silly
andris
and
turn
away
the
only
other
person
i
voiced
my
doubt
to
be
gabi
on
one
of
our
long
walk
around
the
city
he
say
maybe
it
be
the
north
korean
who
attack
rather
than
the
other
way
around
i
look
straight
ahead
at
the
pavement
and
kept
walk
neither
of
us
say
anything
a
bit
later
our
walk
take
us
by
the
headquarters
of
the
security
police
on
stalin
road
this
building
have
an
ominous
reputation
people
say
that
this
be
the
place
you
be
take
to
if
you
be
arrest
by
the
security
police
a
couple
of
uniformed
policeman
be
guard
the
gate
without
a
word
we
stop
our
conversation
and
cross
to
the
other
side
it
do
not
seem
wise
to
walk
our
doubtful
thought
right
by
this
building
as
time
go
on
the
front
line
reverse
itself
again
american
troop
land
on
the
korean
peninsula
and
the
course
of
the
war
turn
in
favor
of
the
south
the
poster
all
over
the
city
acquire
a
new
and
ominous
element
big
ugly
bug
appear
next
to
the
map
of
the
front
portray
the
use
of
bacterial
warfare
by
the
american
and
south
korean
against
the
north
cry
of
brutal
murder
accompany
the
picture
of
the
bug
eventually
these
replace
the
map
altogether
as
part
of
his
job
my
father
inspect
breeding
facility
for
cow
and
pig
in
the
countryside
around
budapest
during
the
week
he
have
a
driver
take
him
on
these
visit
sometimes
however
he
go
on
a
sunday
and
then
he
drove
himself
and
would
take
my
mother
and
me
along
for
the
ride
these
be
rare
treat
the
visit
to
the
breeding
facility
be
boring
hot
and
very
smelly
but
the
ride
themselves
be
excite
and
fun
i
would
sit
up
in
the
front
watch
the
road
and
watch
my
father
drive
i
felt
like
an
adult
one
time
we
stop
in
a
little
village
near
kiskoros
at
the
house
of
an
old
man
who
use
to
be
my
father
math
teacher
when
my
father
be
a
child
he
have
not
see
my
father
for
many
many
year
but
he
recognize
him
instantly
and
greet
him
with
great
warmth
we
stayed
for
an
hour
or
so
at
the
end
of
the
visit
the
old
man
ask
me
whether
i
be
good
at
math
i
told
him
that
i
like
math
but
be
not
particularly
good
at
it
he
told
me
that
my
father
be
a
math
whiz
i
hope
you
be
go
to
be
just
as
good
as
he
be
i
do
not
think
i
could
ever
be
as
good
as
my
father
i
shrug
sheepishly
on
another
trip
i
be
again
sit
up
in
front
my
mother
be
sit
in
the
back
reading
the
newspaper
then
oh
my
god
listen
to
this
my
mother
exclaim
she
proceed
to
read
an
article
that
report
on
a
speech
by
a
party
functionary
in
which
he
accuse
my
father
among
others
of
bending
the
official
rule
in
favor
of
bourgeois
element
my
father
have
be
put
in
charge
of
the
government
animal
breeding
program
but
he
do
not
know
anything
about
the
subject
so
he
hung
on
to
people
who
be
expert
in
their
field
even
if
they
be
holdover
from
the
previous
regime
and
not
party
cadre
now
it
seem
that
my
father
have
recommend
someone
for
a
particular
post
and
the
government
do
not
approve
criticism
in
the
newspaper
be
something
to
be
take
very
seriously
it
usually
signify
trouble
ahead
my
father
gripped
the
wheel
and
star
straight
ahead
on
the
road
he
kept
on
drive
but
be
clearly
in
a
state
of
shock
worried
or
possibly
very
angry
i
could
not
tell
which
this
out
turn
out
to
be
not
much
fun
at
all
in
early
my
uncle
sanyi
and
his
son
in
law
be
arrest
in
the
middle
of
the
night
my
aunt
show
up
at
our
house
the
next
morning
frighten
and
utterly
helpless
nobody
would
say
where
they
be
take
or
why
there
be
no
charge
and
no
one
to
inquire
to
they
be
just
go
none
of
it
make
sense
there
be
nothing
we
could
do
except
wait
to
see
what
would
happen
next
a
few
day
later
my
father
be
fire
from
his
job
he
be
also
told
that
in
any
future
job

would
not
be
allow
to
earn
more
than
one
fourth
of
his
previous

people
stop
drop
by
our
apartment
to
visit
my
father
jani
and
romacz

stuck
around
but
most
of
the
others
disappear
life
at
school

not
change
but
after
a
while
it
dawn
on
me
that

last
several

stun
and
embitter
walk
home

editorial
office

be
struck
by
an
incredible
thought

because
my
uncle
be
in
jail
it
do
not

connection
could
be
possible
but
when

go
to
my
mother

if
she
thought
this
might
be
true

up
in
formation
four
across
with
the
teacher
in
the
lead
we
start
out
in
an
orderly
fashion
soon
however
the
rank
broke
down
and
we
cluster
into
group
shuffle
along
poke
each
other
and
take
up
most
of
the
sidewalk
when
we
get
to
the
zoo
our
teacher
left
us
alone
while
he

to
the
ticket
booth
to
arrange
for
our
admission
we
be
milling
around
the
entrance
restless
and
barely
control
suddenly
a
few
boy
broke
rank
and
ran
toward
the
zoo
fence
in
an
instant
they
be
over
the
top
and
inside
the
zoo
run
out
of
sight
for
a
brief
moment
the
rest
of
us
be
paralyze
by
indecision
then
like
a
herd
of
wild
horse
we
too
broke
and
ran
we
scatter
along
the
fence
until
we
be
out
of
sight
of
the
main
gate
then
clamber
over
the
iron
rail
i
be
apprehensive
about
get
caught
on
the
metal
spike
of
the
fence
but
i
manage
to
avoid
them
by
boost
myself
up
on
one
of
the
stone
pillar
that
held
the
fence
in
place
some
frantic
scramble
a
big
jump
and
i
be
in
once
inside
i
be
caught
up
in
the
same
exhilaration
that
have
infect
the
rest
of
the
class
with
a
group
of
three
or
four
other
boy
i
ran
from
exhibit
to
exhibit
pant
and
flush
with
excitement
people
turn
to
stare
at
us
as
we
go
hurtle
past
here
and
there
we
saw
other
small
group
of
our
classmate
all
wildly
chase
around
the
cage
some
run
to
the
left
some
to
the
right
until
we
be
disperse
throughout
the
zoo
none
of
us
paid
any

be
told
to
line
up
in
the

in
the
subject
we

more
difficult

math
wizard
of
the
class
he
be
always
way
ahead
of
what
we
be
study
and
genuinely
fascinate
by
advanced
and
abstract
mathematics

look
repulsive

order

in
comparison
with

i
do
not
play
the

or
any
instrument
for

a
good
student
i
be
not
particularly
outstanding
in
any
one
area
and
i
be
still
bad
at
all
sport
except
swim
but
they
accepted
me
as
their
equal
i
think
that
the
main
asset
i
brought
be
that
i
be
more
comfortable
with
the
rest
of
the
class
than
they
be
i
serve
as
their
bridge
to
the
wild
bunch
we
have
something
else
in
common
all
five
of
us
be
jewish
we
be
not
the
only
jew
in
the
class
there
be
a
few
more
whom
we
have
not
become
friendly
with
but
as
we
gravitate
to
each
other
company
and
hung
around
with
each
other
at
recess
and
after
school
a
subtle
wall
form
around
us
no
explicit
act
of
anti
semitism
be
ever
express
toward
us
but
the
separation
be
real
we
never
discuss
the
fact
that
we
be
jewish
we
just
knew
that
we
be
just
as
the
other
member
of
the
class
knew
it
too
hungarian
almost
always
knew
who
be
or
be
not
jewish
kid
or
adult
it
become
a
sixth
sense
for
all
of
us
never
a
subject
of
explicit
discussion
but
one
of
constant
tacit
awareness
the
class
at
madach
operate
pretty
much
the
same
way
as
at
dob
street
student
be
settle
into
a
particular
classroom
and
never
left
it
except
for
recess
break
physical
education
and
physic
and
chemistry
lab
every
hour
a
different
teacher
would
come
to
our
room
to
teach
the
teacher
at
madach
be
well
than
the
one
at
dob
street
one
of
the
more
interest
one
be
mr
telegdi
the
hungarian
literature
teacher
he
be
a
tall
balding
stoop
old
man
while
the
other
teacher
all
wore
ordinary
street
clothes
mr
telegdi
always
wore
an
old
fashion
threadbare
black
smock
over
his
clothes
he
carry
himself
with
an
old
fashion
dignity
that
seem
as
out
of
place
as
his
smock
most
of
the
teacher
have
nickname
mr
telegdi
have
two
sometimes
we
call
him
tade
after
the
luckless
character
in
the
opera
pagliacci
which
be
popular
enough
in
those
day
in
budapest
that
a
lot
of
people
knew
the
story
if
not
the
actual
music
when
he
listen
to
a
boy
answer
a
question
he
would
tilt
his
head
inquiringly
to
the
side
tuck
his
right
hand
behind
his
back
to
grasp
his
left
elbow
and
shift
his
weight
into
an
awkward
stance
that
match
the
bemuse
and
somewhat
distant
look
on
his
face
that
give
rise
to
his
other
nickname
the
sparrow
tade
love
literature
when
he
get
go
about
hungarian
novel
or
poetry
his
face
would
start
to
glow
and
passion
would
creep
into
his
voice
most
of
the
kid
in
the
class
however
thought
his
enthusiasm
be
funny
they
cut
up
mercilessly
in
tade
class
whisper
make
face
and
drop
pencil
throughout
the
hour
the
cut
up
take
a
different
turn
one
day
when
one
of
the
boy
come
to
class
with
a
pocketful
of
little
pebble
tade
have
his
back
turn
to
the
class
write
something
on
the
blackboard
the
boy
start
throw
the
pebble
one
by
one
to
bounce
off
the
blackboard
take
care
not
to
hit
tade
but
be
sure
to
disrupt
the
lecture
each
time
a
pebble
clacked
onto
the
floor
tade
would
turn
around
shift
into
his
sparrowlike
stance
look
around
the
class
with
a
mournful
expression
on
his
face
then
wordlessly
turn
around
and
resume
write
until
the
next
pebble
hit
again
it
be
irresistible
for
the
class
cutups
the
next
day
more
boy
come
arm
with
pebble
the
day
after
more
still
on
the
fourth
day
after
more
pebble
throw
mr
telegdi
left
the
room
the
principal
return
in
his
place
he
deliver
another
intimidate
lecture
then
announce
that
we
be
confine
to
class
during
recess
until
mr
telegdi
give
our
conduct
a
passing
grade
the
pebble
throw
stop
at
once
at
the
end
of
the
class
i
be
commission
by
my
classmate
to
ask
him
whether
we
have
behave
well
enough
to
have
our
punishment
rescind
he
sternly
admonish
me
not

pebble
be
not
the
same
as
good
behavior
i
expect
much
well
class
after
class
he
do
not
waver
from
his
stand
he
do
not
release
us
until
we
have
a
totally
quiet
classroom
no
pebble
no
shuffle
no
talk
it
be
always
strange
to
see
our
teacher
outside
of
school
one
time
to
my
amazement
i
spy
mr
telegdi
in
the
opera
house
i
be
in
my
usual
place
in
the
cheapest
seat
right
under
the
roof
and
i
recognize
him
sit
with
a
group
of
people
in
the
opera
director
box
right
over
the
stage
he
be
wear
a
suit
not
his
usual
smock
coat
and
seem
to
fit
right
in
i
could
not
wait
to
talk
to
him
the
next
day
yes
he
say
he
have
be
at
the
opera
the
director
be
a
friend
of
his
i
ask
him
how
he
like
the
performance
it
be
a
hungarian
classic
that
feature
my
favorite
bass
baritone
gy
orgy
losonczy
mr
telegdi
give
a
very
sophisticated
assessment
of
the
performance
but
he
crush
me
by
not
be
as
impressed
by
losonczy
as
i
be
he
say
the
man
be
a
good
actor
but
he
sings
as
if
he
have
a
dumpling
stuck
in
his
throat
thereafter
i
thought
of
his
comment
whenever
i
heard
losonczy
and
have
to
concede
that
mr
telegdi
be
right
a
month
or
so
later
he
invite
imre
and
me
to
visit
him
at
his
apartment
to
talk
about
literature
he
live
in
a
couple
of
shabby
room
face
the
inner
courtyard
of
a
run
down
apartment
house
there
be
book
scatter
all
over
pile
on
the
floor
and
table
everything
be
cover
with
dust
mr
telegdi
sat
on
an
old
sofa
we
pull
up
two
kitchen
chair
and
we
all
talk
about
literature
the
conversation
be
very
interest
but
i
found
the
overall
atmosphere
incredibly
sad
and
depress
to
my
surprise
i
realize
that
i
felt
sorry
for
mr
telegdi
it
bother
me
even
more
that
i
a
student
in
the
disrespectful
a
class
should
dare
to
feel
sorry
for
him
after
imre
and
i
left
i
try
to
wash
the
picture
of
telegdi
sad
apartment
out
of
my
head
and
my
confuse
feeling
with
it
mr
vasarhelyi
our
history
teacher
be
quite
a
contrast
to
mr
telegdi
she
be
young
good
look
and
animate
even
though
she
be
supposedly
married
to
a
party
functionary
she
be
a
good
teacher
before
history
class
all
my
rowdy
classmate
get
busy
comb
their
hair
and
check
out
their
reflection
in
the
window
we
have
no
trouble
keep
quiet
for
mr
vasarhelyi
as
always
i
sat
in
the
first
row
because
of
my
ear
sometimes
when
the
student
whom
i
normally
share
the
bench
with
miss
class
mr
vasarhelyi
would
perch
on
his
desk
with
her
foot
on
the
seat
next
to
me
she
be
close
enough
that
i
could
smell
her
perfume
she
wore
open
necked
blouse
and
from
my
seat
i
could
see
her
neck
and
the
underside
of
her
chin
i
felt
i
be
star
at
her
but
i
do
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
my
eye
so
i
star
at
her
neck
i
be
terribly
embarrass
but
i
be
always
happy
when
my
seatmate
be
out
sick
every
once
in
a
while
during
recess
we
would
see
mr
vasarhelyi
and
mr
telegdi
chat
together
they
kept
their
voice
low
and
lean
toward
each
other
intimately
each
sight
ignite
a
speculative
buzz
in
our
class
it
be
hard
to
think
of
them
as
be
romantically
interested
in
each
other
yet
the
possibility
be
intrigue
my
favorite
teacher
of
all
be
mr
volenski
the
physic
teacher
he
be
a
small
man
old
than
most
teacher
in
the
school
with
thin
reddish
brown
hair
that
he
combed
straight
back
over
his
head
he
be
a
very
good
teacher
and
physic
be
one
of
my
favorite
class
but
above
all
he
be
a
character
he
always
regale
us
with
story
about
his
dog
muki
an
affectionate
slang
word
meaning
little
guy
the
story
often
involve
physic
as
in
i
threw
this
object
to
my
dog
muki
would
it
be
easy
for
him
to
catch
it
this
way
or
that
way
sometimes
our
performance
in
class
be
compare
unfavorably
to
the
performance
of
muki
everybody
in
the
class
get
a
kick
out
of
mr
volenski
story
perhaps
that
be
why
he
never
have
a
hard
time
keep
discipline
mr
volenski
have
a
fantastic
memory
for
thing
that
happen
twenty
year
ago
but
he
forgot
who
you
be
even
if
he
have
see
you
just
a
few
hour
earlier
i
like
him
a
lot
i
think
he
like
me
even
if
i
be
not
always
sure
he
could
identify
me
then
one
day
i
knew
that
he
could
at
a
parent
teacher
conference
that
fall
mr
volenski
told
the
assemble
parent
life
be
like
a
big
lake
all
the
boy
get
in
the
water
at
one
end
and
start
swim
not
all
of
them
will
swim
across
but
one
of
them
i
be
sure
will
that
one
be
grof
both
of
my
parent
be
there
and
when
they
return
home
they
told
me
about
it
with
great
pride
they
also
told
so
many
other
people
about
it
that
over
time
my
swim
across
the
lake
of
life
become
a
family
clich
even
though
the
story
grow
a
little
tiresome
and
i
be
embarrass
by
my
parent
insistence
on
repeat
it
i
continued
to
get
some
encouragement
from
each
tell
i
hop
mr
volen
ski
be
right
mr
telegdi
also
spoke
highly
of
me
at
the
conference
but
his
description
troubled
me
in
front
of
all
the
parent
he
say
someday
we
will
be
sit
in
grof
wait
room
wait
for
him
to
see
us
i
imagine
him
huddle
in
this
wait
room
ignore
by
the
secretary
and
other
people
and
felt
sorry
for
him
i
already
felt
sorry
for
him
anyway
because
i
knew
he
must
be
wrong
the
notion
that
someday
i
would
have
a
room
to
keep
people
wait
in
seem
inconceivable
my
uncle
sanyi
and
my
cousin
husband
be
still
in
jail
and
my
father
be
still
officially
disgrace
after
my
father
lose
his
government
job
a
friend
of
his

brave
enough
to
hire
him
to
run
a
small
accounting
group
at
the
state
dairy
organization
he
be
paid
exactly
as
order
one
fourth
of
his
previous
salary
the
loss
of
my
father
earnings
have
a
significant
impact
on
our
lifestyle
to
be
sure
we
have
never
spent
all
that
my
father
and
mother
make
before
still
the
cut
in
income
be
large
and
the
little
luxury
of
life
be
go
eat
out
on
sunday
be
go
go
to
the
theater
be
go
any
notion
of
my
get
anything
well
than
the
cheapest
seat
at
the
opera
be
go
delicacy
like
chestnut
puree
be
go
we
have
meat
only
once
a
week
now
a
few
month
after
my
father
start
work
at
the
state
dairy
this
friend
told
him
about
another
job
also
an
accounting
job
at
a
construction
company
that
paid
a
little
more
money
after
suitable
application
and
much
check
and
rechecking
with
the
authority
my
father
change
job
the
construction
company
be
locate
in
the
outskirt
of
budapest
so
my
father
have
a
long
tram
ride
to
get
to
work
he
make
the
long
commute
without
complain
i
never
heard
my
father
complain
about
the
loss
of
his
job
either
in
fact
i
never
heard
him
complain
at
all
but
he
become
very
quiet
he
be
a
man
who
use
to
thrive
on
political
discussion
now
he
refuse
to
discus
politics
and
in
any
case
there
be
no
one
to
discus
it
with
most
of
his
friend
still
stayed
away
some
of
my
classmate
have
discover
girl
at
recess
and
during
break
between
class
they
constantly
boast
about
go
out
with
this
girl
or
take
that
girl
to
the
movie
the
one
who
claimed
to
be
successful
tend
to
be
good
at
sport
and
look
more
stylish
than
the
rest
of
us
while
everyone
else
wore
ordinary
clothes
to
special
school
event
they
wore
jacket
with
carefully
pad
shoulder
and
taper
pant
they
do
not
care
much
about
get
good
grade
accord
to
them
grade
be
not
an
asset
in
attract
girl
nobody
in
my
group
of
friend
ever
talk
much
about
girl
i
do
not
want
to
admit
that
i
do
not
have
anything
to
talk
about
and
i
guess
my
friend
do
not
have
much
to
talk
about
either
however
i
want
to
be
the
first
of
our
group
to
succeed
with
girl
and
i
want
to
have
something
i
could
boast
about
with
the
other
boy
there
be
not
a
whole
lot
of
opportunity
to
get
to
know
girl
in
school
because
we
be
in
separate
class
i
have
to
figure
out
another
way
some
of
my
classmate
in
the
in
crowd
knew
how
to
dance
i
envy
them
i
do
not
want
to
compromise
my
place
among
my
brainy
friend
but
i
do
want
to
meet
girl
and
impress
them
the
way
some
of
my
classmate
do
the
whole
prospect
of
dance
seem
like
a
mystery
i
could
not
imagine
how
people
knew
what
to
do
with
their
foot
and
the
idea
of
walk
up
to
a
girl
and
ask
her
to
dance
paralyze
me
with
fear
but
the
very
fact
that
i
be
puzzle
and
scar
by
dance
push
me
to
learn
there
be
a
dance
school
on
kiraly
street
a
few
block
away
from
our
house
the
school
be
one
flight
up
from
the
street
and
at
night
when
i
walk
by
i
could
hear
the
music
through
the
open
window
and
see
the
couple
glide
by
i
work
up
my
courage
and
checked
out
what
it
would
take
to
register
basically
all
it
take
be
money
and
not
very
much
of
that
because
like
many
enterprise
the
dance
school
be
partially
sponsor
by
the
state
i
do
not
have
an
allowance
the
family
spending
money
be
stash
under
my
father
underwear
in
my
parent
wardrobe
and
whenever
i
need
some
i
be
allow
to
take
it
from
the
fold
bill
as
long
as
i
told
my
parent
that
i
do
so
i
be
very
mindful
that
i
be
dip
into
the
family
living
money
but
dance
lesson
be
not
very
expensive
and
with
my
father
new
job
we
have
a
little
money
for
extra
my
parent
agree
that
we
could
afford
it
so
in
the
spring
of
my
first
year
at
the
madach
gymnasium
i
sign
up
for
an
introductory
class
it
be
not
nearly
as
difficult
or
as
scary
as
think
about
it
have
be
the
class
be
make
up
of
kid
my
age
a
bunch
of
boy
and
a
few
girl
the
teacher
be
a
middle
age
man
lean
and
craggy
but
with
an
air
of
assurance
and
sophistication
he
wore
a
suit
and
tie
which
add
to
his
polish
few
men
in
budapest
wore
suit
and
when
they
do
their
suit
do
not
fit
well
the
dance
teacher
suit
be
obviously
old
but
it
be
so
well
cut
and
the
cloth
be
so
fine
that
it
do
not
look
at
all
old
fashion
his
dapper
elegance
remind
me
of
my
former
english
teacher
mr
endrodi
i
be
impressed
and
a
little
envious
we
form
in
straight
line
opposite
a
mirror
wall
and
the
teacher
walk
us
through
some
very
simple
step
we
all
count
one
two
three
four
and
put
our
left
foot
one
way
then
our
right
foot
another
way
it
do
not
feel
like
dance
i
avoid
look
in
the
mirror
and
focus
instead
on
put
my
foot
in
the
right
place
then
the
teacher
put
on
a
record
and
as
we
count
to
the
music
everything
start
to
make
sense
we
practice
over
and
over
to
the
same
record
play
tune
for
the
fox
trot
waltz
and
tango
i
begin
to
feel
quite
confident
at
least
when
i
be
dance
by
myself
then
the
day
come
when
we
be
pair
up
boy
and
girl
the
instructor
demonstrate
with
a
woman
who
hung
around
the
dance
school
and
serve
as
his
assistant
she
be
frumpy
look
but
when
they
dance
together
they
glide
around
the
floor
very
gracefully
we
be
expect
to
perform
the
same
transformation
there
be
more
boy
than
girl
so
we
have
to
take
turn
finally
the
magic
moment
come
when
i
put
my
arm
around
a
girl
waist
and
held
her
hand
it
be
not
all
that
magical
both
of
us
have
sweaty
hand
and
i
be
busy
counting
one
two
three
four
i
could
not
wait
for
the
dance
to
stop
i
have
the
impression
that
my
partner
be
as
relieve
as
i
eventually
the
step
come
more
naturally
i
could
do
them
without
counting
in
my
head
i
even
learn
to
tap
on
a
boy
shoulder
as
he
be
dance
with
a
girl
and
cut
in
but
the
dance
school
itself
never
deliver
any
kind
of
romantic
adventure
we
be
so
serious
about
learn
our
step
that
our
partner
be
just
object
to
practice
with
i
like
the
fox
trot
waltz
and
tango
well
enough
but
they
be
not
go
to
impress
anyone
the
rage
in
hungary
be
american
bebop
music
which
you
dance
to
with
fluid
step
swing
your
partner
out
so
that
her
skirt
swirl
up
and
do
intricate
contortion
with
your
foot
as
if
your
knee
be
make
of
jelly
because
of
its
western
origin
this
kind
of
dance
be
frown
upon
by
the
communist
authority
people
could
dance
this
way
only
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
home
to
record
that
have
be
smuggle
in
from
west
germany
or
austria
we
all
want
to
learn
this
kind
of
dance
but
of
course
it
be
not
taught
at
the
school
one
day
during
a
break
one
of
the
student
try
to
perform
a
few
bebop
step
in
class
the
instructor
frown
in
disapproval
the
student
continued
to
contort
himself
the
instructor
watch
a
little
longer
then
stop
him
curtly
and
say
if
you
have
get
to
do
those
step
at
least
do
them
right
to
our
surprise
he
replace
the
fox
trot
record
with
a
faster
contemporary
song
then
launch
into
a
private
dance
his
leg
elastic
and
his
hip
as
supple
as
putty
we
star
at
him
awestruck
after
a
few
minute
he
seem
to
come
to
his
sens
he
stop
and
say
unless
you
can
do
it
like
this
do
not
even
bother
nobody
do
after
six
week
the
dance
course
be
over
there
be
a
graduation
ceremony
that
the
whole
dance
school
attend
where
we
dance
as
couple
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
instructor
and
his
assistant
partner
now
that
i
knew
how
to
dance
or
at
least
thought
that
i
knew
how
i
dare
to
show
up
at
school
party
and
special
event
that
i
have
avoid
before
but
for
the
most
part
i
stood
against
the
wall
i
realize
that
there
be
a
lot
more
to
impress
girl
than
know
where
to
place
my
foot
meanwhile
in
addition
to
study
russian
in
school
i
have
also
sign
up
for
a
free
class
in
remedial
russian
the
russian
instruction
at
school
be
still
so
elementary
that
i
be
afraid
i
would
not
learn
anything
since
i
have
to
learn
russian
i
thought
i
might
as
well
learn
it
for
real
the
class
met
in
the
even
ironically
it
be
held
in
the
building
that
use
to
house
the
evangelikus
gymnasium
which
have
be
nationalize
and
be
now
use
for
other
purpose
the
class
be
make
up
of
all
kind
of
people
mostly
adult
but
some
other
kid
my
age
one
girl
in
particular
caught
my
attention
she
be
short
and
blond
and
have
a
spunky
personality
the
student
be
expect
to
refer
to
each
other
by
the
russian
version
of
their
first
name
this
girl
name
in
russian
be
galina
galina
walk
home
the
same
way
i
do
it
turn
out
she
live
past
my
house
and
we
fell
into
the
habit
of
occasionally
walk
back
from
class
together
i
always
look
forward
to
the
walk
in
fact
i
realize
that
i
look
forward
to
the
walk
more
than
i
look
forward
to
the
class
the
teacher
be
not
all
that
good
or
maybe
i
just
be
not
motivate
to
learn
the
main
reason
i
kept
go
to
class
be
galina
but
i
never
manage
to
work
up
my
courage
to
try
to
arrange
a
date
my
only
other
opportunity
for
socialize
with
girl
be
during
recess
at
school
it
be
not
easy
the
girl
tend
to
cluster
together
in
group
that
be
difficult
to
break
into
the
boy
hung
out
in
group
too
and
it
be
difficult
to
break
away
you
might
drift
by
a
group
of
girl
and
say
something
or
you
might
catch
a
girl
eye
on
the
stair
on
the
way
to
class
or
to
recess
but
there
be
no
place
in
the
school
courtyard
where
you
could
talk
without
everyone
notice
i
be
fifteen
and
other
boy
my
age
be
go
out
with
girl
so
at
the
end
of
my
first
year
at
madach
i
work
up
my
courage
to
ask
one
of
the
girl
if
she
would
meet
me
after
school
to
go
for
a
walk
to
my
delight
and
surprise
she
readily
agree
we
make
a
date
for
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
next
day
the
meeting
be
go
to
be
under
a
street
clock
at
the
corner
of
kiraly
street
and
ring
street
near
where
we
both
live
i
get
there
fifteen
minute
early
i
pace
up
and
down
along
the
busy
street
corner
wait
for
the
clock
to
move
forward
and
practice
what
i
would
say
when
she
show
up
how
i
would
say
hello
in
a
suave
and
self
possess
manner
as
if
i
do
this
every
day
three
o
clock
come
no
girl
i
told
myself
that
she
would
probably
be
a
few
minute
late
girl
probably
tend
to
be
a
little
late
anyway
five
minute
pass
then
ten
then
fifteen
sour
heavy
feeling
start
to
grow
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
my
thought
go
from
excitement
and
anticipation
to
a
bitter
argument
with
myself
as
i
walk
up
and
down
i
look
at
my
reflection
in
the
shop
window
how
could
i
really
expect
her
to
want
to
go
out
with
me
when
i
be
so
pudgy
and
awkward
at
half
past
three
i
look
around
one
more
time
then
head
home
i
be
very
down
on
myself
and
very
angry
at
the
girl
at
all
girl
back
in
school
the
next
day
i
force
myself
not
even
to
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
girl
i
just
hung
around
with
my
friend
from
a
there
be
only
one
piece
of
good
news
out
of
caution
i
have
never
told
anybody
of
my
would
be
encounter
so
i
do
not
have
to
tell
anybody
about
it
not
have
happen
i
never
talk
to
my
parent
about
girl
they
knew
i
have
go
to
dance
class
but
they
do
not
ask
any
question
about
it
and
i
do
not
volunteer
anything
i
be
grateful
for
their
restraint
manci
husband
miklos
on
the
other
hand
be
very
interested
in
my
experience
with
girl
i
have
the
impression
that
he
thought
of
himself
as
have
be
a
great
success
in
this
arena
as
a
young
man
and
that
he
be
die
to
share
his
story
he
would
put
his
arm
around
my
shoulder
and
with
a
professional
look
and
a
quizzical
glint
in
his
eye
ask
andris
how
be
you
do
with
girl
he
do
this
just
about
every
time
he
saw
me
i
dread
see
him
and
cringed
at
his
question
i
do
not
have
much
to
report
and
i
hat
to
admit
it
i
try
to
put
him
off
with
an
attempt
at
closemouthed
horatio
hornblower
like
solemnity
but
it
do
not
discourage
him
from
greet
me
with
the
same
wink
and
conspiratorial
backslapping
the
next
time
he
saw
me
all
of
this
left
me
with
even
more
of
a
desire
to
have
something
to
tell
miklos
and
more
frustrate
that
i
continued
to
have
nothing
that
summer
after
my
first
year
at
the
madach
gymnasium
i
spent
a
lot
of
my
time
at
the
palatinus
public
pool
on
margaret
island
it
be
farther
away
than
the
pool
in
city
park
but
i
prefer
to
go
there
for
two
reason
first
the
pool
be
enormous
and
if
i
get
there
early
i
could
swim
really
long
lap
uninterrupted
and
second
it
have
a
livelier
social
scene
people
come
with
group
of
friend
and
these
group
settle
down
on
the
large
expanse
of
neatly
groom
grass
surround
the
pool
by
the
middle
of
the
day
the
lawn
be
cover
with
colorful
cluster
of
people
picnic
play
volleyball
sunbathe
and
socialize
sometimes
i
arrange
to
meet
friend
after
i
get
my
lap
in
other
time
i
go
by
myself
but
even
then
i
be
sure
to
run
into
some
people
i
knew
and
could
settle
in
with
them
i
like
to
swim
but
the
main
attraction
be
gawk
at
girl
parade
around
in
their
bikini
bathing
suit
look
at
them
from
a
distance
be
all
i
could
and
would
do
the
notion
that
i
might
actually
talk
to
a
strange
girl
never
even
enter
my
mind
once
i
ran
into
galina
from
my
russian
class
she
seem
happy
to
see
me
i
be
certainly
happy
to
see
her
we
swam
together
for
a
while
but
then
when
she
be
ready
to
leave
the
pool
i
realize
that
i
have
get
too
excite
and
could
not
follow
her
i
energetically
threw
myself
into
swim
a
couple
of
length
of
the
pool
as
fast
as
i
could
in
order
to
distract
myself
it
work
but
by
the
time
i
be
able
to
get
out
without
embarrass
myself
galina
and
her
friend
be
long
go
it
be
the
year
of
the
summer
olympics
in
helsinki
the
hungarian
team
do
quite
well
at
these
game
and
the
hungarian
fencer
in
particular
acquit
themselves
mar
velously
i
listen
to
the
play
by
play
commentary
of
the
match
on
the
radio
and
be
mesmerize
the
sport
seem
very
hornblower
like
glamorous
and
wild
yet
something
for
a
think
man
without
ever
have
see
a
fence
match
i
decide
to
learn
to
fence
it
so
happen
that
there
be
a
fence
club
in
our
neighborhood
membership
and
the
equipment
be
free
because
the
club
be
support
by
the
state
many
sport
club
be
state
support
especially
those
that
train
athlete
who
one
day
might
participate
in
the
olympics
athletic
excellence
be
a
matter
of
pride
and
reflect
on
the
superiority
of
the
state
i
be
soon
enrol
as
a
member
of
the
beginner
class
it
start
much
like
dance
class
a
bunch
of
boy
and
a
few
girl
wear
gym
clothes
stood
in
a
line
in
front
of
a
mirror
a
coach
yell
lunge
and
we
lunge
forward
awkwardly
onto
our
right
foot
then
the
coach
explain
what
we
should
do
with
our
hand
and
our
knee
and
demonstrate
what
a
proper
lunge
look
like
then
we
do
it
again
and
again
the
next
morning
i
could
barely
move
after
a
while
though
as
with
dance
we
master
the
basic
foot
movement
and
progress
to
work
with
a
foil
the
easy
of
the
weapon
i
be
disappointed
the
hungarian
olympic
hero
be
all
saber
champion
and
that
be
what
i
want
to
be
too
but
the
progression
of
instruction
require
that
i
master
the
foil
first
and
only
then
move
on
to
the
saber
i
be
not
much
of
an
athlete
i
hat
gym
at
school
and
be
poor
at
it
but
fence
captivate
me
partly
it
be
because
of
the
draw
of
the
olympic
champion
but
partly
it
be
because
for
once
i
be
no
bad
than
any
of
the
others
in
class
and
arguably
well
than
most
i
attend
class
diligently
practice
incessantly
against
my
partner
and
work
on
my
footwork
at
home
i
even
practice
my
parry
with
my
right
arm
as
i
be
walk
down
the
street
until
a
neighbor
lady
comment
to
my
parent
in
a
concerned
tone
that
something
be
wrong
with
andris
she
have
be
follow
me
on
the
street
and
notice
me
make
weird
motion
with
my
wrist
she
thought
i
be
suffer
from
seizure
to
my
disappointment
fence
do
not
build
muscle
in
any
notable
fashion
or
reduce
my
weight
the
only
visible
impact
it
have
on
my
body
be
that
my
right
forefinger
become
thicker
than
the
left
one
and
it
be
bent
back
from
support
the
weight
of
the
foil
in
time
i
be
allow
to
represent
my
club
in
official
fence
event
these
be
the
low
class
of
competition
but
i
be
excite
about
get
ready
and
visit
other
club
and
fence
with
referee
watch
our
bout
i
soon
discover
that
i
be
not
go
to
go
to
the
olympics
any
time
soon
i
be
eliminate
either
in
the
preliminary
or
at
best
in
the
semifinal
but
i
still
fence
whenever
i
could
that
summer
at
age
fifteen
i
get
my
first
job
imre
father
work
for
a
state
publishing
company
and
get
imre
bubi
and
myself
a
job
load
and
unload
book
on
a
truck
we
manage
to
stick
together
and
work
as
a
team
most
of
the
time
we
load
a
truck
with
box
of
book
at
the
printing
plant
then
hoist
ourselves
on
top
of
the
book
for
the
ride
to
the
warehouse
where
we
unloaded
the
box
and
threw
them
down
a
chute
to
be
unpacked
and
stack
inside
then
we
go
back
to
the
printing
plant
for
more
it
be
a
physically
challenge
job
but
we
make
it
into
a
sport
form
a
chain
and
race
with
each
other
to
see
how
fast
we
could
throw
the
box
of
book
from
the
plant
onto
the
truck
then
from
the
truck
down
the
chute
of
the
warehouse
in
between
it
be
fun
rid
on
the
truck
bed
through
the
street
of
budapest
the
truck
driver
be
a
permanent
worker
a
young
man
who
watch
our
activity
with
old
brotherly
amusement
while
we
energetically
threw
the
box
of
book
around
he
lounge
against
the
side
of
the
truck
and
smoke
cigarette
chat
with
passersby
and
flirt
with
girl
he
seem
to
have
a
much
easy
job
than
we
do
i
grow
quite
envious
of
him
as
the
summer
progress
he
make
me
wonder
albeit
fleet
ingly
if
go
to
school
be
all
that
worthwhile
throughout
my
year
at
gymnasium
i
get
more
and
more
involve
with
chemistry
it
all
start
during
my
last
year
at
the
dob
street
school
i
have
come
across
a
book
of
simple
chemistry
experiment
for
kid
the
experiment
themselves
be
fun
but
i
have
additional
motivation
for
get
interested
in
science
after
the
fiasco
of
my
potential
journalism
career
i
be
eager
to
cultivate
an
interest
in
a
new
profession
that
be
less
prone
to
subjectivity
the
chemistry
experiment
be
innocent
at
first
involve
ingredient
i
could
find
at
home
i
dissolve
sugar
in
water
suspend
a
string
in
the
solution
then
let
the
water
evaporate
and
watch
the
sugar
crystal
precipitate
around
the
string
i
heat
some
sugar
over
a
little
alcohol
burner
and
watch
it
melt
change
color
and
give
off
a
caramel
like
odor
sugar
be
a
delicacy
particularly
in
cube
form
but
i
always
manage
to
appropriate
a
bit
for
my
scientific
purpose
after
the
first
simple
experiment
my
book
lead
me
to
more
complicate
one
but
for
these
i
need
more
specialized
material
the
book
be
publish
before
the
war
a
more
prosperous
time
when
chemical
supply
be
easy
to
find
after
describe
an
ingredient
the
author
would
blithely
end
the
section
with
this
compound
should
be
available
from
most
good
drugstore
i
get
increasingly
annoyed
with
this
phrase
because
in
the
world
i
live
in
even
ordinary
soap
be
available
only
intermittently
even
the
place
that
specialized
in
chemical
compound
generally
do
not
have
them
in
stock
in
an
economy
that
operate
by
central
planning
shortage
of
just
about
everything
be
commonplace
i
have
already
experienced
the
frustration
of
central
planning
when
i
try
to
buy
photographic
paper
my
aunt
manci
have
taught
me
some
photography
and
i
also
tinker
with
develop
my
own
film
and
enlarge
photo
at
home
during
the
summer
my
picture
have
strong
black
and
white
and
i
need
low
contrast
paper
to
print
them
properly
on
the
other
hand
in
the
winter
when
everything
be
in
shade
of
gray
my
picture
require
high
contrast
paper
needle
to
say
low
contrast
paper
be
always
short
in
the
summer
and
high
contrast
paper
be
unavailable
in
the
winter
i
end
up
buying
my
supply
of
paper
during
the
prior
season
and
then
hop
i
have
stock
enough
for
my
need
buying
chemical
for
my
experiment
be
also
a
hit
or
miss
affair
there
be
no
store
that
sell
chemistry
supply
so
i
go
from
drugstore
to
paint
store
to
chemical
warehouse
at
the
outskirt
of
budapest
where
i
would
plead
with
the
clerk
to
give
me
small
amount
of
whatever
i
need
people
generally
try
to
help
me
out
but
since
no
single
store
have
everything
i
have
to
go
to
a
lot
of
store
before
i
could
build
up
what
i
need
for
the
next
group
of
experiment
at
first
i
be
satisfied
just
to
mix
two
liquid
together
and
watch
them
turn
blue
or
purple
or
result
in
the
precipitation
of
a
white
powder
i
only
vaguely
understood
what
be
actually
happen
so
the
experiment
have
an
air
of
magic
but
as
my
school
chemistry
class
begin
to
cover
the
same
ground
i
begin
to
understand
the
chemical
reaction
behind
my
experiment
conversely
do
the
experiment
at
home
give
depth
to
the
formula
that
i
learn
in
class
then
i
discover
pyrotechnic
if
pour
two
liquid
together
and
see
them
change
color
be
interest
mix
two
powder
on
a
metal
plate
and
hit
them
with
a
hammer
to
trigger
a
big
boom
and
a
puff
of
smoke
be
thrill
i
have
several
favorite
experiment
which
i
demonstrate
over
and
over
to
my
friend
after
school
in
one
i
turn
a
wad
of
cotton
into
an
explosive
after
i
perform
my
magic
on
it
it
still
look
like
cotton
but
if
i
set
a
match
to
it
it
flame
up
in
a
flash
and
be
go
without
even
a
trace
of
ash
in
my
favorite
experiment
i
wad
a
bit
of
this
process
cotton
in
the
bottom
of
a
metal
tube
and
drop
a
marble
on
top
of
it
when
i
lit
the
cotton
with
a
fuse
the
marble
shot
out
of
the
tube
like
a
miniature
cannonball
another
experiment
involve
mix
a
tiny
amount
of
phosphorus
with
another
chemical
to
make
a
powder
that
explode
on
impact
with
great
care
i
would
sprinkle
a
small
amount
of
this
powder
into
the
hollow
pellet
i
use
with
my
air
gun
then
seal
it
in
with
warm
wax
when
i
fire
one
of
these
load
pellet
at
a
wall
it
explode
with
a
little
flash
and
a
crackle
sound
this
be
great
fun
one
time
i
fire
the
pellet
out
of
the
window
that
overlook
the
airshaft
where
i
be
hidden
from
sight
at
a
building
on
the
other
side
of
kiraly
street
i
hit
a
wall
not
too
far
from
where
a
romantic
mind
couple
be
look
out
of
their
window
and
i
watch
with
great
amusement
as
they
jumped
apart
and
peer
around
frantically
try
to
figure
out
what
might
have
cause
the
explosion
the
highlight
of
my
chemistry
career
be
make
real
nitro
glycerin
i
knew
that
nitroglycerin
be
use
to
make
dynamite
so
this
be
a
little
scary
the
process
involve
a
complicate
se
ries
of
step
each
of
which
have
to
be
do
just
so
and
at
the
end
there
would
be
a
small
drop
of
heavy
yellow
liquid
that
could
really
blow
thing
up
i
first
try
this
experiment
at
home
when
my
parent
be
not
around
it
do
not
work
i
flush
the
remnant
down
the
toilet
and
try
again
it
do
not
work
the
second
time
either
the
third
time
around
i
be
get
discourage
i
figure
this
would
be
the
last
time
i
try
it
i
follow
every
step
precisely
as
the
book
say
and
end
up
with
a
drop
of
viscous
yellow
liquid
just
as
the
book
say
i
would
i
put
it
on
a
metal
plate
and
hit
it
gingerly
with
a
hammer
i
be
very
nervous
nothing
happen
then
i
hit
it
again
a
little
strong
still
nothing
i
hit
it
again
this
time
like
i
meant
it
there
be
a
deafen
bang
the
force
of
the
explosion
kick
the
hammer
back
in
my
hand
when
my
ear
stop
ring
i
realize
that
my
heart
be
beating
madly
and
i
be
perspire
all
over
i
felt
like
i
have
climbed
a
mountain
when
my
parent
come
home
that
even
my
mother
immediately
start
interrogate
me
about
what
i
have
be
up
to
that
afternoon
evidently
the
superintendent
wife
have
heard
the
explosion
from
the
other
end
of
the
apartment
building
even
our
neighbor
who
have
gotten
use
to
my
occasional
hiss
and
bang
announce
that
this
be
too
much
i
get
another
chance
to
make
nitroglycerin
at
of
all
place
school
back
in
my
first
year
at
madach
gymnasium
i
have
told
the
chemistry
teacher
about
my
experiment
at
home
after
that
he
often
ask
me
to
help
set
up
and
break
down
the
experiment
in
class
when
i
be
in
my
third
year
he
ask
me
to
demonstrate
the
make
of
nitroglycerin
to
a
class
of
second
year
girl
i
be
delighted
and
polished
up
my
knowledge
of
the
process
with
thirty
girl
watch
my
every
move
i
go
through
the
complicate
process
and
produce
the
single
precious
drop
of
heavy
yellow
liquid
i
ask
for
a
volunteer
when
one
come
up
i
hand
her
the
hammer
she
close
her
eye
and
timidly
bang
at
the
liquid
nothing
happen
she
sheepishly
hand
the
hammer
back
to
me
and
like
a
proud
accomplish
scientist
i
manfully
whack
the
drop
of
nitroglycerin
bang
the
class
broke
into
shriek
and
excite
applause
i
be
on
the
top
of
the
world
flush
with
victory
i
start
up
a
conversation
with
the
volunteer
her
name
be
erzsi
and
she
be
a
cute
buxom
girl
she
continued
to
be
friendly
enough
as
we
talk
so
i
work
up
my
courage
and
ask
her
if
she
would
meet
me
after
school
one
day
to
go
for
a
walk
i
be
still
shy
and
sensitive
from
be
stood
up
a
year
ago
but
erzsi
show
up
and
we
set
off
for
our
walk
we
head
toward
city
park
it
be
an
early
winter
even
and
it
quickly
get
dark
and
cold
halfway
to
city
park
i
reach
for
her
hand
she
do
not
pull
it
away
the
feel
of
walk
with
a
girl
and
hold
hand
fill
me
with
almost
as
much
excitement
as
explode
a
drop
of
nitroglycerin
when
we
get
to
city
park
we
head
for
a
fake
castle
that
house
a
museum
the
door
be
lock
we
both
bent
forward
to
try
to
make
out
the
sign
on
the
door
only
to
discover
that
visit
hour
be
over
we
look
at
each
other
shrug
and
laugh
our
head
be
just
inch
apart
still
high
from
the
electrify
feel
of
erzsi
hand
in
mine
i
bent
over
and
kiss
her
on
the
mouth
she
kiss
me
back
i
be
stun
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
she
do
not
either
we
turn
around
and
walk
home
hold
hand
in
silence
i
walk
her
to
the
entryway
of
her
house
and
say
goodbye
then
i
turn
and
ran
home
as
fast
as
i
could
as
i
ran
my
excitement
gradually
dissipate
then
the
thought
hit
me
what
kind
of
germ
do
i
pick
up
so
when
i
get
home
i
furiously
rinse
out
my
mouth
although
i
finally
have
something
to
report
to
my
friend
and
my
uncle
miklos
i
never
say
anything
i
go
walk
with
erzsi
a
few
more
time
but
our
encounter
be
never
as
excite
again
a
few
month
later
there
be
a
school
dance
erzsi
show
more
interest
in
a
good
look
classmate
of
mine
than
in
me
soon
they
start
go
out
together
i
be
only
a
little
sad
while
i
be
feel
that
i
might
actually
have
a
future
with
girl
and
chemistry
something
bad
be
happen
to
my
friend
imre
imre
have
start
out
at
madach
gymnasium
as
a
pretty
good
student
he
be
particularly
interested
in
literature
and
history
but
as
the
year
go
on
he
slid
more
and
more
into
mediocrity
he
start
miss
class
each
time
claim
some
vague
medical
problem
but
his
medical
problem
never
get
cure
and
his
grade
slump
more
and
more
this
get
to
be
an
acute
problem
in
the
third
year
when
grade
take
on
more
and
more
meaning
as
a
key
determinant
of
the
loom
process
of
university
admission
all
of
our
circle
be
worried
at
see
imre
slip
and
i
be
particularly
frustrate
that
i
could
not
figure
out
what
be
go
on
with
him
our
friendship
falter
i
try
several
time
to
rebuild
our
relationship
we
go
for
long
walk
but
imre
do
not
tell
me
much
once
he
let
slip
that
when
he
cut
class
he
walk
all
over
budapest
explore
all
the
back
street
and
discover
old
building
all
over
town
otherwise
he
remain
mysterious
in
my
mind
i
start
to
spin
theory
and
possibility
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
few
morsel
of
information
he
divulge
my
imagination
get
go
and
suddenly
during
one
of
our
walk
i
felt
i
have
imre
story
figure
out
i
be
so
sure
about
what
be
go
on
that
i
decide
to
write
a
story
about
it
it
be
nine
or
ten
in
the
even
when
we
finish
our
walk
and
i
return
home
i
put
some
paper
into
my
father
typewriter
close
the
door
to
my
room
and
start
write
my
mind
be
race
as
i
pecked
away
at
the
typewriter
the
story
start
to
take
shape
i
finally
go
to
sleep
at
two
in
the
morning
and
could
not
wait
for
the
next
afternoon
so
that
i
could
finish
spin
imre
story
when
i
read
it
over
i
be
as
excite
as
when
my
nitroglycerin
explode
it
seem
i
have
an
honest
to
goodness
short
story
in
my
hand
i
title
it
despair
i
read
it
again
and
again
but
the
more
i
read
it
the
less
i
could
tell
whether
it
be
good
or
not
i
eagerly
await
my
parent
return
from
work
when
they
get
home
i
shyly
told
them
i
write
something
i
would
like
you
to
read
they
sat
down
next
to
each
other
on
the
sofa
my
mother
start
reading
the
story
and
as
she
finish
with
each
page
she
hand
it
to
my
father
i
sat
in
a
chair
watch
them
i
could
not
tell
anything
from
their
face
my
heart
be
race
and
i
need
to
fidget
but
i
do
not
want
to
interrupt
their
concentration
so
i
make
myself
sit
still
when
my
father
finish
the
last
page
they
look
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
then
my
mother
say
andris
this
be
serious
work
my
father
emphatically
agree
i
have
pass
the
test
with
my
parent
i
be
ready
to
raise
the
bar
there
be
a
student
literary
circle
at
school
mr
telegdi
be
in
charge
he
and
the
student
get
together
every
couple
of
week
to
discus
something
they
have
all
read
once
in
a
while
they
read
a
composition
or
some
poetry
by
a
member
of
the
lit
erary
circle
no
one
from
the
a
class
ever
attend
the
literary
circle
it
be
populate
and
run
mainly
by
kid
from
the
b
class
i
want
to
submit
my
story
but
i
want
to
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
they
would
not
know
it
be
my
story
i
be
not
sure
why
i
do
not
want
to
be
openly
associate
with
the
story
perhaps
it
be
because
i
would
never
go
to
the
literary
circle
perhaps
it
be
because
i
carry
the
stigma
of
be
a
member
of
the
rowdy
a
class
or
perhaps
it
be
because
i
be
still
sore
about
the
rejection
by
the
youth
newspaper
in
any
case
i
really
want
an
objective
reaction
so
i
work
out
an
elaborate
ruse
first
i
show
the
story
to
imre
he
deny
that
it
have
anything
to
do
with
him
in
real

wonderful
story
i
be
happy

an
enthusiastic

fold
the
story
in
an
envelope

the
typewriter
and
ask
imre
to
give
it
to
the
school
custodian
and
ask
him
to
give
it
to
mr

then
i
wait
for
something
to
happen

his
usual
awkward
stance
then
after
clearing
his
throat

quite
unusual

be

place
at
the
literary

such
an
invitation
be
highly
unusual
in

other
time
that
mr
telegdi
have
invite
the
a
class
to
the
literary
circle
i
would
have
like
to
savor
the
moment
but
i
be
too
preoccupy
with
try
to
pretend
utter
disinterest
at
the
appoint
time
on
the
appoint
day
i
show
up
at
the
literary
circle
along
with
several
a
classmate
and
imre
a
first
for
all
of
us
the
room
be
overflow
with
kid
to
the
point
that
a
number
be
stand
at
the
side
and
at
the
back
i
found
a
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
the
chairman
of
the
circle
be
a
serious
student
from
the
b
class
name
peter
he
call
the
meeting
to
order
by
way
of
introduction
he
make
a
convolute
speech
about
how
this
story
be
very
unusual
and
he
go
on
it
be
contemporary
and
interest
in
fact
he
say
he
be
so
intrigue
by
the
fact
that
it
be
write
by
one
of
the
student
that
he
could
not
resist
do
some
detective
work
about
the
identity
of
the
author
he
would
he
announce
share
his
finding
after
the
story
be
read
i
do
not
like
the
sound
of
this
i
do
not
want
to
be
identify
particularly
not
in
front
of
a
crowd
of
student
but
i
be
trap
then
peter
sat
down
one
of
the
girl
in
the
literary
circle
take
his
place
in
front
of
the
class
and
read
my
story
she
read
very
fluidly
give
it
all
the
right
inflection
the
student
listen
intently
right
up
to
the
final
paragraph
which
described
how
my
imaginary
imre
character
fought
against
the
realization
that
he
would
not
make
it
into
the
university
his
head
ache
but
he
continued
on
his
mind
turn
into
pulp
he
could
no
longer
think
when
the
clock
in
the
other
room
struck
one
he
turn
out
the
light
and
drag
himself
to
his
bed
in
the
dark
he
undressed
slowly
like
a
robot
put
on
his
pajama
and
stretch
out
on
the
bed
in
an
instant
he
be
overcome
by
the
deepest
despair
he
push
his
face
into
the
pillow
and
sobbed
until
he
fell
asleep
there
be
silence
when
she
finish
then
peter
take
center
stage
again
and
ponderously
walk
us
through
his
analysis
he
explain
how
the
psychological
insight
of
the
story
be
so
deep
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
author
to
have
such
an
understand
about
another
person
therefore
he
conclude
the
author
must
be
write
about
himself
and
since
he
go
on
the
story
be
vaguely
reminiscent
of
imre
school
career
and
the
story
hero
last
name
start
with
a
v
and
imre
surname
start
with
a
t
both
letter
occur
late
in
the
alphabet
that
just
about
clinched
the
argument
that
the
author
must
be
imre
imre
beet
red
leapt
to
his
foot
and
wave
his
hand
protest
loudly
that
he
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
story
he
have
not
write
it
and
it
be
not
about
him
peter
listen
with
condescend
tolerance
which
infuriate
imre
even
more
it
take
mr
telegdi
intervention
to
change
the
discussion
from
the
identity
of
the
author
to
the
substance
of
the
story
the
general
nature
of
the
comment
be
that
the
story
be
very
realistic
that
it
contain
bit
and
piece
of
all
of
our
life
mr
telegdi
sum
up
the
discussion
by
say
whoever
the
author
be
i
be
sure
that
this
be
not
the
last
we
have
heard
from
him
the
buzz
continued
as
people
dissect
the
story
with
great
gusto
after
a
while
i
decide
that
i
have
heard
enough
i
stood
up
and
when
all
head
have
turn
to
me
i
say
i
just
have
one
comment
to
make
i
need
to
support
imre
protest
i
know
for
a
fact
he
do
not
write
the
story
because
i
do
pandemonium
broke
out
the
meeting
dissolve
into
excite
kid
slap
me
on
the
back
congratulate
me
and
shake
their
head
in
disbelief
while
they
rehash
the
event
of
the
afternoon
mr
telegdi
shook
my
hand
and
repeat
that
he
thought
the
story
be
great
then
imre
and
a
few
other
friend
and
i
left
and
go
for
a
long
walk
we
walk
throughout
the
city
for
hour
this
be
the
most
excite
event
of
my
life
when
i
get
home
i
toss
and
turn
in
bed
not
want
to
fall
asleep
and
have
the
feel
stop
even
though
by
now
i
be
very
interested
in
continue
on
with
chemistry
it
be
satis
fying
to
realize
that
my
earlier
notion
about
become
a
writer
have
some
basis
in
reality
the
next
day
i
walk
over
to
my
aunt
iren
apartment
and
give
her
a
copy
of
my
story
after
my
uncle
sanyi
iren
be
the
most
literary
member
of
the
family
i
wish
that
i
could
show
my
story
to
sanyi
but
in
the
two
year
since
his
arrest
we
still
have
not
heard
anything
about
him
we
do
not
even
know
if
he
be
alive
or
dead
iren
read
the
story
while
i
be
there
and
thought
it
be
wonderful
she
volunteer
to
pas
it
to
a
friend
a
prominent
writer
in
the
day
that
follow
i
often
imagine
how
i
might
be
discover
as
a
seventeen
year
old
literary
prodigy
and
get
my
story
publish
in
a
real
magazine
week
go
by
i
do
not
hear
anything
eventually
i
get
a
one
paragraph
typewritten
note
from
the
famous
writer
thank
me
for
let
him
see
the
manuscript
he
write
that
he
found
the
absence
of
the
official
school
youth
organization
in
my
hero
life
surprising
clearly
in
real
life
the
youth
organization
would
have
step
in
and
help
my
hero
before
he
be
overcome
with
despair
he
suggest
that
the
story
be
modify
to
reflect
how
that
might
take
place
other
than
that
he
thought
i
would
learn
a
great
deal
by
reading
the
work
of
the
people
great
writer
i
be
glad
i
like
chemistry
one
of
the
side
benefit
of
my
short
story
be
that
it
establish
me
as
a
person
of
some
literary
merit
as
oppose
to
the
rest
of
the
a
class
rowdy
i
now
occasionally
attend
meeting
of
the
literary
circle

we
have
enough
common
interest
in
literature
our
school
and
our
classmate
to
bridge
the
difference
eventually
we
found
that

other
and
become
friend
another
person
i

after

of
it
not
even
be
a
subject
of
discussion
politics
now
begin
to
creep
into
our
daily
conversation
my
mother
and
i
saw
eye
to
eye
about
the
seamy
side
of
life
under
communism
right
from
the
begin
we
be
disgruntle
with
the
shortage
of
everything
from
sweater
to
soap
the
lack
of
some
of
the
more
basic
foodstuff
in
the
store
at
a
time
when
the
nationalize
agriculture
of
the
country
be
suppose
to
be
produce
record
harvest
the
incessant
line
you
have
to
stand
in
to
buy
from
a
limited
selection
of
inferior
item
the
pervasive
sloganeer
the
most
annoy
slogan
be
work
be
a
matter
of
honor
and
duty
it
be
post
every
where
on
factory
wall
in
store
and
even
on
street
sign
right
above
the
head
of
people
who
be
listlessly
try
to
get
away
with
the
minimum
amount
of
work
my
father
at
first
try
to
put
a
good
face
on
thing
he
once
overheard
my
mother
and
me
compare
complaint
and
with
great
annoyance
declare
us
the
village
gossip
after
that
we
make
sure
to
be
more
careful
where
and
when
we
air
our
gripe
but
his
position
whatever
it
might
have
be
have
be
seriously
shaken
by
the
disappearance
of
my
uncle
sanyi
with
whom
he
have
be
close
and
of
course
by
what
have
happen
to
himself
he
still
do
not
talk
about
the
current
political
climate
but
he
stop
defend
the
indefensible
and
no
longer
remonstrate
with
my
mother
and
me
when
we
complain
about
it
he
also
begin
to
reveal
glimpse
of
his
war
experience
he
have
never
talk
much
about
his
ordeal
during
the
war
but
now
he
let
slip
a
few
bit
and
piece
he
told
about
the
incredible
cruelty
with
which
the
hungarian
soldier
treat
the
jewish
labor
battalion
in
a
way
that
be
not
surprising
as
by
now
the
news
of
what
have
happen
in
the
concentration
camp
be
know
even
so
some
of
the
sto
ries
be
so
horrific
that
i
found
them
difficult
to
digest
but
the
clear
fact
be
that
only
percent
of
the
men
in
my
father
worker
battalion
have
survive
and
many
of
the
percent
that
die
have
be
deliberate
victim
of
their
hungarian
guard
the
story
that
be
the
most
incredible
to
me
be
how
in
the
middle
of
one
bitterly
cold
winter
night
my
father
battalion
be
make
to
strip
naked
and
climb
tree
and
the
guard
sprayed
them
with
water
and
watch
and
laugh
as
one
after
another
fell
out
of
the
tree
frozen
to
death
i
have
be
under
the
impression
that
their
suffer
stop
when
my
father
battalion
be
capture
by
the
russian
it
turn
out
that
this
be
hardly
the
case
their
life
be
no
well
in
russian
captivity
right
after
they
be
capture
they
be
lock
into
cattle
car
and
transport
for
day
with
no
food
no
water
and
no
heat
in
the
dead
of
the
russian
winter
when
they
finally
arrive
at
their
destination
only
a
handful
of
people
be
alive
in
each
cattle
car
the
survivor
be
then
march
to
a
snow
over
campsite
that
have
be
use
by
the
russian
troop
as
a
summer
training
ground
they
have
to
dig
the
snow
out
of
hole
in
the
ground
with
their
bare
hand
to
make
shelter
my
father
suffer
illness
after
illness
survive
against
all
odds
while
people
around
him
be
die
like
fly
this
explain
why
he
be
skin
and
bone
a
run
down
decrepit
shell
of
a
man
when
he
return
home
one
particular
story
be
so
awful
that
it
turn
into
a
gruesome
family
joke
it
be
winter
and
my
father
and
the
other
prisoner
be
cooped
up
inside
the
shelter
they
have
dug
in
the
snow
they
be
too
cold
and
weak
to
go
outside
to
relieve
themselves
so
they
use
the
same
metal
dish
that
they
ate
from
scrub
the
dish
with
a
handful
of
snow
in
between
us
after
my
father
told
us
this
story
my
mother
and
i
would
tease
him
about
it
whenever
he
do
not
clean
his
plate
after
a
meal
my
father
brought
home
some
picture
that
he
have
manage
to
keep
with
him
throughout
all
his
year
in
the
war
and

be
away
my
father
treasure
these
picture
they
never
left
his
body
they
give
him
strength
when
he
need
it
most
in
his
darkest
moment
when
it
look
like
he
would
not
make
it
he
use
the
back
of
the
picture
to
scribble
his
good
bye
message
to
us
i
read
these
note
over
and
over
one
of
them

gyurka
he
make
it
home
five
month
later
in
march
stalin
die
stalin
figure
have
be
indelibly
associate
with
the
image
of
the
soviet
union
in
my
mind
the
picture
of
a
uniformed
mustachioed
man
with
a
kindly
expression
have
be
everywhere
in
office
school
at
celebration
hung
on
the
side
of
building
for
it
seem
most
of
my
life
even
though
by
this
time
i
have
become
deeply
skeptical
about
the
goodness
of
thing
soviet
stalin
death
and
the
disappearance
of
that
ever
present
kindly
face
have
a
mixed
impact
on
me
i
be
glad
and
i
be
sad
at
the
same
time
it
be
very
confuse
stalin
death
be
the
occasion
for
a
citywide
march
to
hero
square
much
like
during
the
may
day
parade
loudspeaker
be
strung
up
in
the
tree
along
stalin
road
but
now
instead
of
broadcasting
cheer
the
loudspeaker
played
the
same
classical
funeral
march
over
and
over
and
over
during
may
day
march
we
fool
around
while
we
shuffle
along
we
do
not
know
how
to
conduct
ourselves
now
i
do
not
feel
comfortable
discuss
my
confuse
feeling
with
anyone
not
even
with
my
close
friend
neither
do
anyone
else
we
could
not
talk
about
other
thing
and
we
would
not
talk
about
stalin
so
we
march
largely
in
silence
at
one
point
somebody
broke
out
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
giggle
pretty
soon
a
large
number
of
us
be
try
to
suppress
giggle
our
teacher
glare
beyond
a
doubt
this
be
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
but
we
could
not
stop
perhaps
exactly
because
it
be
so
dangerous
we
eventually
regain
our
equilibrium
and
solemnly
continued
our
procession
the
funeral
march
blare
overhead
i
wonder
if
thing
be
go
to
change
and
whether
the
change
would
be
for
well
or
for
bad
we
get
no
hint
from
the
newspaper
previously
unknown
russian
politician
be
propel
into
period
of
prominence
then
fade
out
of
sight
for
a
while
not
much
happen
the
first
real
hint
of
tangible
change
come
in
the
spring
of
there
have
be
some
rumor
about
the
release
of
political
prisoner
then
one
day
without
any
prior
notice
my
uncle
sanyi
be
release
my
uncle
have
age
a
lot
while
he
be
in
jail
he
would
always
be
thin
but
now
he
look
even
more
ascetic
and
drawn
his
hair
have
turn
all
white
he
told
my
parent
that
they
would
want
him
to
confess
to
a
bunch
of
thing
that
he
have
not
do
like
foment
counterrevolutionary
activity
but
he
would
not
he
have
be
sentence
to
death
and
for
a
long
time
be
on
death
row
wait
to
be
execute
stoically
he
would
wait
for
whatever
would
happen
to
him
the
only
reaction
he
would
have
to
his
precarious
status
be
a
compulsion
to
finish
whatever
book
he
be
reading
before
he
be
execute
he
would
stay
up
all
night
reading
in
his
cell
my
cousin
husband
be
release
some
time
later
he
have
fare
far
bad
he
have
crack
under
the
pressure
of
interrogation
and
be
a
broken
man
when
he
be
release
for
one
thing
he
have
no
teeth
he
never
say
what
happen
for
another
he
now
thought
that
he
saw
secret
police
everywhere
he
remain
high
strung
and
nervous
and
have
to
be
hospitalize
in
a
mental
institution
for
a
while
but
at
least
they
be
out
and
free
to
settle
down
and
get
on
with
their
life
the
summer
before
my
last
year
at
madach
gabi
and
i
spent
a
week
at
a
fishing
cabin
at
lake
velence
a
lake
about
fifty
mile
from
budapest
the
fishing
cabin
belong
to
the
state
company
where
my
mother
work
employee
could
sign
up
to
use
it
for
a
week
at
a
time
when
my
mother
found
out
about
its
availability
she
sign
gabi
and
me
up
for
a
stay
it
would
be
just
the
two
of
us
on
our
own
without
any
adult
supervision
at
seventeen
we
be
eager
for
our
first
taste
of
independence
it
sound
very
idyllic
a
cabin
at
the
edge
of
a
lake
gabi
and
i
take
the
train
down
and
trudge
with
our
bag
the
few
mile
from
the
train
station
to
the
cabin
when
we
get
there
we
found
that
the
cabin
be
just
one
room
with
some
rough
bunk
bed
in
it
and
nothing
else
there
be
no
stove
no
table
no

and
no
run
water
outside
there
be
a
pump
and
an
outhouse
that
smell
as
if
it
have
not
be
clean
in
year
that
be
it
but
a
path
lead
to
the
lake
nearby
where
there
be
a
rickety
boat
dock
with
a
big
old
rowboat
tie
up
to
it
the
shoreline
be
a
forest
of
reed
no
other
house
or
people
be
in
sight
it
be
all
ours
we
quickly
settle
into
a
routine
every
morning
we
walk
along
a
footpath
into
town
to
pick
up
provision
we
purchase
fresh
milk
from
a
little
dairy
bought
fresh
bread
from
a
bakery
and
picked
up
sausage
and
apple
milk
bread
sausage
and
apple
make
up
our
diet
for
the
week
we
spent
the
rest
of
each
day
from
morning
to
dusk
out
on
the
lake
in
the
rowboat
return
to
the
cabin
only
to
eat
and
sleep
other
than
the
occasional
fisherman
we
do
not
see
anyone
we
rowed
mostly
the
two
of
us
at
the
oar
because
it
be
a
big
clunky
boat
and
it
take
a
lot
of
effort
to
move
it
along
when
we
get
to
the
middle
of
the
lake
one
of
us
would
jump
in
the
water
and
swim
alongside
the
boat
while
the
other
one
rowed
or
we
would
just
lie
on
our
back
in
the
rowboat
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
and
talk
and
look
up
at
the
sky
one
time
when
we
be
lie
on
our
back
aimlessly
float
around
two
military
plane
flew
by
just
above
the
water
level
they
be
follow
a
second
later
by
a
horrendous
roar
we
scramble
onto
our
knee
and
look
after
the
plane
we
have
never
see
jet
before
after
a
moment
gabi
say
the
next
war
wo
not
be
fun
we
saw
the
plane
only
that
one
time
the
rest
of
the
week
be
quiet
the
weather
be
good
and
the
surface
of
the
lake
be
usually
like
a
mirror
disturbed
only
by
our
movement
the
lake
be
about
ten
mile
long
and
a
couple
of
mile
wide
one
day
i
set
out
to
swim
across
it
it
take
me
the
well
part
of
an
afternoon
gabi
rowed
the
boat
near
me
so
i
felt
comfortable
swim
in
the
middle
of
the
big
lake
and
i
just
swam
and
swam
almost
in
a
trance
what
seem
like
hour
later
i
reach
the
reed
at
the
other
side
of
the
lake
i
clamber
into
the
boat
feel
a
little
weak
and
shaky
but
proud
of
myself
i
have
come
a
long
way
since
struggle
across
the
irrigation
ditch
at
the
vineyard
the
school
year
start
a
couple
of
week
later
as
i
face
my
fourth
year
i
become
more
and
more
focus
on
what
i
be
go
to
do
after
graduation
about
half
of
my
class
intend
to
go
on
to
university
so
do
i
get
admit
to
university
meant
the
difference
between
embark
on
a
professional
career
and
be
relegate
to
an
unskilled
job
it
meant
the
difference
between
do
only
a
month
compulsory
military
service
in
the
army
reserve
each
year
and
be
draft
into
the
infantry
for
two
year
i
do
not
know
much
about
life
in
the
army
but
after
hearing
my
father
story
i
want
to
have
as
little
to
do
with
it
as
possible
get
admit
to
university
would
make
a
huge
difference
in
all
part
of
my
life
this
be
a
crucial
year
at
the
end
of
it
i
would
take
the
final
exam
to
graduate
from
gymnasium
and
the
entrance
exam
to
enter
university
these
exam
be
a
big
deal
and
perform
well
on
both
be
a
necessary
condition
for
be
admit
to
university
but
they
be
not
the
only
factor
university
admission
be
heavily
base
on
the
student
family
background
the
high
preference
be
give
to
student
who
come
from
worker
family
or
whose
parent
be
member
of
the
communist
party
second
preference
be
give
to
those
who
come
from
peasant
stock
third
preference
be
for
those
whose
parent
be
professional
people
and
last
preference
be
for
those
whose
parent
do
not
fit
any
of
those
category
and
be
therefore
label
other
there
be
also
a
category
for
class
alien
the
son
and
daughter
of
parent
who
previously
have
business
that
employ
other
worker
employ
others
in
the
language
of
marxism
be
call
exploit
them
student
whose
parent
be
exploiter
would
have
a
very
tough
time
get
into
any
university
my
parent
do
not
fit
into
the
worker
the
peasant
or
the
professional
category
so
the
question
be
whether
i
would
be
classify
as
other
or
whether
my
father
former
dairy
ownership
would
put
me
in
the
class
alien
category
i
could
not
take
university
for
grant
there
be
nothing
i
could
do
about
my
ancestry
so
i
concentrate
on
review
four
year
worth
of
math
physic
chemistry
history
and
literature
with
an
eye
toward
the
exam
nobody
have
their
mind
on
the
fourth
year
course
neither
the
teacher
nor
the
student
the
end
be
in
sight
so
the
attention
of
those
student
who
be
university
bound
focus
on
prepare
for
the
exam
everyone
focus
on
get
ready
for
life
outside
of
madach
the
week
at
lake
velence
have
left
me
with
the
desire
to
continue
do
something
with
boat
and
water
once
i
have
settle
into
the
rhythm
of
study
for
my
final
exam
i
ask
around
and
found
out
that
there
be
a
kayak
club
locate
on
margaret
island
in
late
fall
gabi
and
i
enrol
in
their
beginner
course
i
have
lose
interest
in
fence
when
i
realize
that
i
would
never
break
out
of
the
low
echelon
of
the
competitive
rank
this
be
a
lot
less
enjoyable
than
the
rowboat
in
lake
ve
lence
we
do
not
even
get
to
sit
in
a
kayak
instead
we
perch
on
stationary
seat
in
a
trough
of
water
in
a
cold
damp
concrete
building
and
practice
paddle
six
or
eight
seat
be
line
up
in
each
trough
one
right
behind
the
other
so
at
first
we
constantly
get
our
double
bladed
paddle
tangle
up
with
that
of
the
person
in
front
or
back
while
a
coach
yell
at
us
we
quickly
learn
to
paddle
in
unison
when
we
be
not
paddle
in
the
stationary
seat
we
practice
lift
and
carry
the
kayak
from
rack
in
the
warehouse
to
the
shore
and
back
the
kayak
be
fragile
shell
of
wood
that
could
be
easily
damage
if
they
be
bang
on
the
doorway
of
the
storage
house
drop
on
the
dock
or
bumped
against
other
kayak
there
be
one
right
way
to
handle
them
and
many
wrong
way
and
we
have
to
keep
practice
under
the
watchful
eye
and
loud
comment
of
the
coach
until
we
do
it
just
the
right
way
we
learn
to
lift
single
kayak
double
kayak
and
kayak
that
would
take
four
people
we
do
not
actually
get
to
sit
in
a
kayak
and
paddle
in
the
danube
until
well
into
the
spring
one
day
at
home
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
myself
in
the
mirror
without
a
shirt
on
much
to
my
delight
i
notice
that
i
have
muscle
i
have
finally
lose
my
remain
chubbiness
in
the
spring
we
start
practice
in
the
danube
river
the
danube
be
a
big
river
with
a
strong
current
the
weather
be
cold
and
gray
and
so
be
the
water
use
the
skill
we
learn
in
the
incessant
practice
session
gabi
and
i
put
our
double
kayak
in
the
water
then
slid
into
the
seat
and
push
off
from
the
dock
immediately
the
current
grabbed
us
and
try
to
sweep
us
backward
but
once
we
start
paddle
we
overcame
the
force
of
the
current
and
start
move
upstream
there
be
great
satisfaction
in
feel
our
own
strength
a
normal
practice
consist
of
paddle
around
margaret
island
we
always
start
off
by
go
upstream
then
when
we
reach
the
tip
of
the
island
we
turn
and
let
the
river
sweep
us
downstream
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
paddle
into
the
current
past
the
tip
of
the
island
be
hard
we
be
paddle
against
the
full
force
of
the
open
river
and
make
the
turn
be
a
delicate
maneuver
we
let
the
kayak
come
to
a
stop
held
the
stern
steady
while
the
force
of
the
water
swung
the
bow
around
then
felt
a
sudden
acceleration
as
the
current
picked
us
up
and
swept
us
downstream
it
never
cease
to
be
a
thrill
moment
add
to
the
thrill
be
the
presence
of
a
skeet
shoot
range
at
the
tip
of
the
island
the
shooter
be
hidden
from
view
but
we
could
see
the
clay
pigeon
be
toss
in
the
air
and
we
could
hear
the
shot
and
watch
the
disk
shatter
above
us
the
fragment
fly
this
way
and
that
in
addition
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
current
we
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
fly
bit
of
clay
one
time
i
be
in
a
single
kayak
round
the
tip
of
the
island
and
as
i
be
about
to
turn
into
the
current
one
of
these
clay
piece
burst
right
over
my
head
i
instinctively
ducked
and
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
submerge
in
the
water
be
swept
rapidly
down
the
river
my
training
come
in
handy
even
as
i
fell
out
of
the
kayak
i
hung
on
to
my
paddle
with
one
hand
and
grabbed
the
side
of
the
boat
with
the
other
when
i
surface
i
furiously
kick
toward
shore
every
time
i
try
to
stand
up
the
current
swept
me
off
my
foot
i
finally
struggle
upright
in
water
that
barely
reach
my
knee
then
i
bail
out
my
kayak
get
back
in
and
paddle
like
a
madman
to
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
my
group
at
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
there
be
a
big
bridge
connect
the
island
to
buda
on
one
side
and
pest
on
the
other
it
be
the
bridge
where
the
bus
accident
have
occur
this
be
where
we
turn
to
complete
the
circuit
around
the
island
we
learn
to
sneak
into
an
eddy
behind
a
pillar
of
the
bridge
where
the
water
be
calm
and
the
current
practically
stationary
take
a
rest
get
set
then
punch
out
of
the
eddy
and
attack
the
current
again

be
very
excite

a
weekend
tour

cross
the
river
from
margaret

to
paddle
in
the
quieter
water
next
to
the
shore

and
passenger

their
horn
at

and
we
bounce
in
their
wake

and
his
helper
follow
along
in
a
little
motorboat
after
a
while
we
be

by
farmland
i
do
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
scenery
i
have
to
concentrate
on
not

over
after
hour
and
hour
of
paddle
upstream
we
finally
arrive
at
our
campsite

on
tarp
on
the
ground
in
the
open

generally
uneventful

one
exception
there

i
felt
a
great
rush
of
relief
i
return

a
much
well
mood
than

and
with
it
the
dread

i
accelerate

and
study
incessantly
our
apartment
be
be
paint
during
the
last
few
week
before

so
i
have
to
scurry
from

to
room
to
stay
out
of
the
painter
way
my
parent
be
both
at
work
so
it
be
only
the
painter
and
me
at
home
i
envy
the
painter
from
my
vantage
point
he
have
a
finite
job
when
he
be
do
painting
a
room
his
task
be
finish
my
task
on
the
other
hand
be
infinite
whenever
i
thought
i
have
finish
study
a
subject
i
would
start
all
over
again
and
discover
part
i
have
miss
the
painter
must
have
be
observe
me
too
at
first
he
have
ignore
me
as
if
we
be
two
stranger
do
our
job
in
a
common
space
the
only
time
we
talk
be
when
he
ask
me
to
move
so
he
could
put
a
dropcloth
over
some
furniture
but
as
the
day
progress
and
he
watch
me
study
and
worry
he
actually
grow
sympathetic
he
be
still
painting
our
apartment
the
day
of
the
actual
test
when
i
left
he
call
down
from
his
ladder
and
wish
me
kalap
szart
a
hatful
of
shit
i
look
startle
he
explain
that
this
be
the
strong
way
to
wish
someone
good
luck
his
comment
echoed
in
my
mind
all
the
way
to
school
when
i
arrive
at
school
i
found
our
classroom
completely
rearrange
a
line
of

across
the
middle
of
the
classroom
all
of

turn
some
people
affected
nonchalance
chat
about
anything
but
the
exam
i
do
not
feel
like
participate
in
their
banter
so
i
stood
away
by
myself
and
be
quiet
finally
my
name
be
call
i
be
nervous
but
once
i
face
my
teacher
i
saw
goodwill
in
their
eye
i
realize
that
they
want
me
to
do
well
and
that
help
me
immensely
i
be
ask

it
be
quite
a
job
to
find
a
sufficient
number
of
them
and
coordinate
thing
so
that
our
class
three
or

squeeze
into
each
taxi
could
arrive
at
the
beat

time
as

get
out
of

people
startle
them
and
shatter
the
solemn
decorum
of
the
occasion
much
to
the
consternation
of
the
teacher
and
our
principal
i
stole
away
for
a
minute
to
carve
my
name
on
a
brick
at
the
side
of
the
schoolyard
then
it
be
time
for
the
graduation
ceremony
somebody
holler
at
us
to
get
rid
of
the

for
once
we
obeyed
we
be
hand
the
traditional
little
six
inch
wooden
stick
with
tiny
cloth
bag
hung
on
one
end
like
a
miniature
hobo
kit
we
held
them
over
our
shoulder
as
a
sym
bol
of
set
out
into
the
world
we
be
herd
into
a
formal
line
and
all
the
graduate
class
process
around
the
courtyard
and
down
to
the
front
row
of
seat
then
we
sat
down
to
listen
to
a
bunch
of
speech
afterward
we
gather
around
with
our
teacher
for
photograph
we
solemnly
shook
hand
with
each
other
then
we
go
on
our
separate
way
gymnasium
be
officially
over
i
left
the
courtyard
with
mixed
feeling
i
have
have
many
fun
time
during
the
last
four
year
and
i
would
have
a
few
wonderful
teacher
but
for
the
most
part
i
have
not
like
my
class
or
the
school
i
be
glad
to
leave
it
the
story
of
the
a
class
be
not
quite
over
yet
though
a
few
of
the
rowdier
boy

a
night
on
the
town
to
celebrate
graduation
i
decide
not
to
join
them
that
turn
out
to
be
a
good
idea
the
next
day
i
heard
that
the
group
drank
too
much
on
their
way
home
they
be
carouse
and
sing
at
the
top
of
their
lung
and
get
picked
up
by
the
police
the
police
manhandle
and
slap
them
around
before
release
them
to
their
parent
it
be
an
experience
i
be
glad
to
have
miss
i
be
completely
preoccupy
with
whether
i
would
be
admit
to
university
shortly
after

final
exam
at

i
have
take
the
entrance

for
the
university
these
too
be
oral
test
conduct
by
a
panel
of
faculty
member
in
addition
to
ask
question
about
chemistry
physic
and
math
they
question
me
about
soviet
history
and
literature
it
be
advisable
to
know
something
of
soviet
literature
even
though
it
be
not
require
at
gymnasium
luckily
i

don
and
other
popular
novel
by
famous
soviet
author
i
thought
i

the
most
prestigious
academic
institution

pure
science
however
rumor
have
it
that
the

the
odds
of

set
out
to

that
spring
i
have
apply

during
my
repeat
visit
to

in
the
spring
i
be
enthral
by
the
chemical
smell
that
permeate
the
area
and
i
identify
them
as
a
symbol
of
my
chosen
profession
once
i
start
work
i
grow
so
accustom

a
big

a
powerful
hose

back
in
its
place
bolt
the
machine
shut
then
repeat
this
process
with

the
next
one
and
the
next
one
there
be
many
machine
when
we
finish
replace
the
filter
in
the
last
machine
the
sludge
have
built
up
again
in
the
first
machine
so
we
repeat
the
job
over
and
over
it
be
hard
and
boring
work
but
bubi
and
i
work
well
as
a
team
and
we
make
it
into
a
sport
we
happily
slop
around
in
the
sludge
throw
our
weight
into
turn
the
handle
that
tighten
the
bolt
on
the

as
if

be
some
kind
of
competition
we
be
cover
from
head
to
toe
in
rubber
coverall
suit
so
muck
around
in
the
slippery
stuff
be
actually
fun
sometimes
we
slip
off
the
handle
and
fell
backward
into
the
sludge
we
call
this
the
rubber
as
exercise
the
man
who
be
assign
to
supervise
us
and
make
sure
we
do
not
cut
corner
watch
our
enthusiasm
with
cold
condescension
like
most
of
the
other
regular
worker
he
move
slowly
and
deliberately
and
take
frequent
cigarette
break
at
first
i
thought
he
be
cold
to
us
because
we
be
student
but
then
i
learn
otherwise

have
go
on
an
errand
and
i
continued
cleaning
the
sludge
all
by
myself
our
bos
come
over
and
watch
me
work
for
a
while
then
he

not
hungarian
either
be
he
i
be
confuse
what
would
bubi
be
if
not
hungarian
then
as
i
look
at
the
man
unwavering
steady
gaze
i
get
it
what
he
be
ask
be
if
bubi
be
a
jew
like
me
i
turn
red
and
in
a
mixture
of
embarrassment
and
anger
furiously
attack
my
sludge
without
answer
the
silence
be
broken
only
when
bubi
return
after
that
i
do
not
mind
that
our
supervisor
stayed
away
from
us
i
be
hop
that
my
experience
at
chinoin
would
help
with
my
admission
to
the
university
but
my
parent
and
i
knew
that
this
be
far
from
enough
their
search
for
connection
continued
then
we
get
lucky
my
father

of
his
mate

my
bad
fear
i
have
be
classify
as

class
alien
and
be
be
reject
our
connection
do
something
i
never
actually
knew
what
it
be
that
he
do
but
i
suspect
he
remove
the
paper
that
cause
me
to
be
classify
as
a
class
alien
without
those
i
be
reclassify
as
other

know
i
be
carry

i
celebrate

this
be
the
first
time
my
parent
and
i
have
ever
go
on
vacation
together
i
be
hesitant
at
the
prospect
other
than
afternoon
outing
i
have
never
spent
much
time
with
them
be
cooped
up
at
a
resort
with
them
for
a
week
seem
like
a
long
time
to
my
relief
i
actually
enjoy
spending
the
time
with
them
we
get
room
at
the
guesthouse
own
by
my
father
company
lake
balaton
be
farther
away
than
lake
velence
but
it
be
much
big
and
much
more
developed
it
have
be
hungary
traditional
resort
area
and
be
surround
by
hotel
guesthouse
and
fancy
lodge
that
have
once
be
own
by
wealthy
people
but
now
belong
to
state
own
company
their
former
grandeur
be
dull
by
the
transformation
but
they
be
definitely
a
step
up
from
the
rickety
fishing
cabin
on
lake
velence
our
guesthouse
be
a
good
walk
from
the
lake
but
once
we
get
there
there
be
a
sandy
beach
with
a
long
shallow
bank
you
have
to
walk
a
way
out
before
the
water
be
deep
enough
for
swim
but
you
could
float
around
in
the
sun
warm
shallow
to
your
heart
delight
my
mother
be
a
good
swimmer
one
day
we
held
on
to
a
rubber
air
mattress
and
swam
far
out
into
the
lake
we
drift
talk
about
everything
and
nothing
i
felt
very
close
to
my
mother
when
we
get
back
to
the
shallow
i
saw
my
father
float
on
another
mattress
with
his
eye
close
i
snuck
up
behind
him
and
as
a
joke
flip
over
the
mattress
this
do
not
turn
out
to
be
a
good
idea
my
father
do
not
swim
at
all
furthermore
he
have
be
deeply
asleep
he
thrash
around
furiously
before
find
his
footing
then
he
steady
himself
and
slap
me
across
the
face
he
have
never
slap
me
before
i
be
stun
but
when
i
look
at
him
i
notice
that
he
be
as
stun
by
his
action
as
i
be
neither
of
us
say
anything
not
then
and
not
later
all
of
the
guest
at
the
hotel
hung
around
together
among
the
guest
be
two
old
teenage
girl
who
work
for
the
company
they
be
not
particularly
pretty
but
give
my
lack
of
exposure
to
girl
for
most
of
my
school
year
it
be
fun
to
be
in
the
company
of
girl
of
my
age
we
all
go
out
for
dinner
and
dance
every
night
my
father
and
mother
would
dance
together
they
be
good
dancer
and
i
be
quite
proud
of
them
sometimes
i
dance
with
the
girl
one
night
i
ask
my
mother
to
dance
with
me
she
be
very
pleased
when
the
week
be
over
i
take
the
train
to
lake
velence
where
i
met
gabi
for
a
few
day
at
the
fishing
cabin
after
graduate
from
the
wood
industry
technical
high
school
he
have
gotten
a
scholarship
to
a
university
in
romania
that
offer
a
special
curriculum
in
wood
technology
i
never
really
knew
what
that
be
about
this
be
our
last
summer
before
we
start
on
new
and
separate
chapter
in
our
life
i
have
brought
a
marble
size
ball
of
potassium
from
my
chemistry
stash
in
a
bottle
on
our
last
night
we
take
the
row
boat
far
out
on
the
lake
i
toss
the
ball
of
potassium
out
on
the
water
to
create
our
own
firework
it
skip
along
then
settle
on
the
surface
and
react
violently
form
big
metallic
blue
flame
that
shot
high
above
the
dark
water
make
loud
sizzle
noise
then
the
flame
sputter
out
and
we
rowed
back
to
shore
summer
military
training
we
be
hand
ill
fitting
well
worn
fade
uniform
with
no
insignia
and
a
plain
foldable
cap
i
be
the
one
stand
on
the
left
chapter
eleven
university
first
year
the
orientation
class
for
the
first
year
chemistry
student
at
the
university
of
budapest
be
held
in
a
nondescript
room
in
an
ornate
nineteenth
century
building
with
high
ceiling
and
tall
narrow
window
as
i
walk
up
the
columned
step
lead
to
the
heavy
entry
door
i
felt
i
have
arrive
at
my
promise
land
as
rumor
the
enter
class
be
small
twenty
or
so
student
about
two
third
boy
and
one
third
girl
many
be
bantering
and
chat
with
each
other
while
we
all
wait
for
the
administrator
to
come
in
and
tell
us
our
curriculum
and
schedule
i
silently
take
in
the
scene
nowhere
near
as
disinterested
as
i
pretend
to
be
as
i
sat
and
listen
to
the
excite
conversation
around
me
i
figure
that
about
half
of
the
class
be
make
up
of
kid
from
outside
budapest
they
stayed
at
a
dormitory
for
out
of
town
student
and
seem
to
know
each
other
a
number
of
the
budapest
contingent
be
graduate
of
the
chemistry
tech
nikum
and
knew
each
other
from
there
that
left
just
a
few
who
be
not
member
of
any
group
i
be
one
of
them
it
be
scary
not
to
know
or
be
know
by
anyone
it
be
even
scarier
to
think
that
the
kid
in
this
room
be
the
best
student
in
the
country
true
many
of
them
would
have
be
give
preference
for
be
descendant
of
worker
or
peasant
still
my
shaky
confidence
sag
even
far
i
notice
that
the
boy
sit
next
to
me
do
not
seem
to
belong
to
any
group
either
while
the
rest
of
the
boy
look
like
clean
cut
good
student
type
with
short
cropped
hair
and
conventional
clothes
my
neighbor
have
long
shaggy
hair
combed
to
the
side
in
what
i
assume
be
an
attempt
to
mimic
western
style
he
wore
green
tint
glass
which
he
have
let
slip
down
his
nose
and
he
gaze
out
over
them
with
an
air
of
condescend
boredom
the
administrator
come
in
and
the
orientation
process
start
as
we
fill
out
form
after
form
i
peer
over
at
my
neighbor
paper
his
surname
i
discover
be
zoltan
he
be
from
budapest
and
like
me
have
attend
one
of
the
gymnasium
rather
than
the
chemistry
technikum
in
the
break
between
fill
out
form
i
start
talk
with
him
he
have
a
sardonic
sense
of
humor
and
be
quite
ready
to
show
it
in
point
comment
about
the
various
administrator
who
parade
in
front
of
us
over
the
course
of
the
day
he
intrigue
me
i
also
suspect
he
be
not
jewish
class
start
for
real
the
next
day
the
way
the
university
work
be
that
we
would
all
have
the
same
schedule
of
class
so
the
twenty
of
us
would
spend
our
time
traipse
from
one
lecture
to
another
as
a
group
the
focus
of
the
first
year
of
study
be
inorganic
chemistry
the
lecture
take
place
every
day
and
be
give
by
the
senior
professor
a
tall
elegant
figure
whose
name
be
professor
lengyel
his
entrance
into
the
lecture
hall
be
always
precede
by
a
parade
of
assistant
professor
after
they
have
take
their
place
professor
lengyel
swept
in
his
spotless
white
lab
coat
swirl
behind
him
we
all
stood
to
greet
him
he
stack
his
paper
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
blackboard
with
dignify
precision
only
after
he
be
settle
do
we
sit
down
the
textbook
for
the
first
year
be
two
huge
volume
write
by
professor
lengyel
himself
i
have
never
know
anyone
who
be
the
author
of
a
book
the
combination
of
his
name
on
our
textbook
which
we
have
to
buy
the
deference
his
assistant
give
him
and
his
royal
bearing
fill
me
with
awe
he
lecture
in
a
deep
boom
voice
which
be
wonderful
because
i
have
no
trouble
hearing
him
the
lecture
hall
be
a
semicircular
auditorium
with
row
of
worn
wooden
bench
rise
steeply
toward
the
back
it
could
have
easily
held
one
hundred
people
our
small
class
be
scatter
among
the
first
few
row
in
the
center
while
the
assistant
professor
take
their
position
off
to
one
side
otherwise
the
room
be
empty
during
the
break
zoltan
and
i
speculate
on
why
our
class
be
so
small
relative
to
the
size
of
the
hall
zoltan
let
his
green
tint
glass
slip
down
his
nose
shot
me
a
look
over
the
rim
and
in
a
deadpan
voice
remark
the
central
planning
department
figure
that
four
year
from
now
the
country
will
need
exactly
twenty
chemist
i
quickly
look
around
swallow
hard
and
do
not
answer
but
i
begin
to
like
him
we
also
have
class
in
math
physic
and
political
education
math
be
fairly
straightforward
and
it
help
that
again
the
professor
spoke
in
a
loud
firm
voice
physic
be
another
story
this
professor
be
professor
lengyel
complete
opposite
he
dress
casually
lean
against
the
blackboard
throughout
most
of
his
lecture
and
spoke
in
an
extremely
soft
voice
the
room
be
another
large
lecture
hall
and
even
though
i
sat
in
the
front
row
my
seat
be
a
fair
distance
from
the
blackboard
i
could
not
understand
a
word
he
say
i
be
panic
stricken
to
make
my
terror
more
complete
there
be
no
official
textbook
after
class
i
caught
up
with
the
professor
and
explain
my
predicament
he
smile
and
assure
me
that
he
would
try
to
remember
to
raise
his
voice
in
the
future
his
assurance
do
not
reassure
me
at
all
i
have
long
ago
discover
that
people
speak
at
their
own
particular
sound
level
and
even
when
they
sincerely
try
to
accommodate
you
by
raise
their
voice
within
minute
their
voice
settle
back
into
its
natural
level
this
be
not
good
here
i
be
on
the
first
day
of
class
with
a
nightmare
situation
a
tough
subject
no
textbook
and
a
lecture
where
i
literally
could
not
understand
a
word
i
have
to
find
other
solution
i
described
my
problem
to
zoltan
and
ask
if
he
could
help
out
he
readily
agree
to
share
his
note
with
me
so
do
several
other
student
i
arrange
to
borrow
two
or
three
set
of
note
after
each
lecture
and
start
to
compile
my
own
note
from
the
different
point
of
view
i
do
not
know
if
it
would
work
but
at
least
it
give
me
a
plan
of
action
i
have
no
such
problem
in
political
education
our
textbook
be
the
history
of
the
soviet
communist
party
which
be
use
as
the
bible
in
political
education
course
while
i
have
never
read
it
my
parent
have
have
to
study
it
as
part
of
mandatory
seminar
held
at
their
workplace
so
i
would
see
it
around
the
house
and
be
familiar
with
it
the
book
described
who
do
what
to
whom
between
the
russian
revolution
of
and
the
year
lead
up
to
world
war
ii
with
phrase
like
the
menshevik
tremble
when
they
found
out
that
lenin
have
come
to
town
the
book
read
more
like
a
child
story
than
a
serious
history
book
the
instructor
lead
us
through
it
chapter
by
chapter
page
by
page
stick
so
closely
to
the
text
that
he
might
as
well
have
read
it
aloud
people
say
that
this
book
get
reissue
from
time
to
time
and
that
depend
on
the
late
party
dogma
new
character
appear
or
more
important
some
character
present
in
earlier
edition
disappear
i
suppose
that
not
stick
precisely
to
the
current
edition
would
have
be
a
bad
idea
and
add
extraneous
material
would
have
be
dangerous
in
any
case
my
hearing
be
not
an
issue
here
it
be
also
not
an
issue
in
labwork
analytical
chemistry
lab
be
the
centerpiece
of
our
schedule
it
be
held
every
day
and
take
up
most
of
each
afternoon
the
experiment
underscored
what
we
study
in
professor
lengyel
class
the
idea
be
that
by
do
the
experiment
we
would
get
an
in
depth
and
firsthand
understand
of
the
lecture
material
it
be
also
our
first
exposure
to
practical
chemistry
the
lab
be
supervise
by
one
of
the
assistant
professor
a
youngish
woman
whose
bouncy
jovial
demeanor
be
altogether
different
from
professor
lengyel
formality
we
call
her
by
her
first
name
hilda
she
assign
each
of
us
a
bench
space
but
encourage
us
to
move
around
freely
and
ask
each
other
for
chemical
help
or
equipment
fairly
soon
we
be
all
comfortable
with
each
other
before
the
autumn
be
over
i
felt
more
at
home
with
this
class
than
i
ever
have
at
madach
gymnasium
even
after
four
year
part
of
the
difference
be
that
i
no
longer
have
to
be
embarrass
about
be
a
good
student
at
university
we
be
all
there
to
learn
and
we
all
want
to
do
well
in
addition
to
zoltan
i
become
particularly
friendly
with
two
other
student
one
be
a
boy
call
jancsi
lanyi
like
me
he
be
very
interested
in
chemistry
like
opera
and
be
jewish
we
get
on
quite
well
nevertheless
unlike
with
zoltan
i
be
always
extremely
careful
when
make
political
comment
or
joke
as
in
gymnasium
boy
call
each
other
by
their
last
name
sometimes
we
never
even
knew
each
other
first
name
girl
however
we
call
by
their
first
name
one
be
a
pretty
lively
girl
from
budapest
name
marianne
she
be
not
a
particularly
strong
student
because
she
be
forever
distract
by
the
ups
and
down
of
her
relationship
with
her
boyfriend
none
of
us
have
ever
met
this
boyfriend
but
marianne
be
quite
clearly
more
in
love
with
him
accord
to
her
story
then
he
be
with
her
we
often
walk
part
of
the
way
home
together
after
class
and
to
my
surprise
i
found
myself
become
her
confidant
be
friend
with
a
girl
with
no
romantic
involvement
be
something
i
would
never
experienced
before
i
enjoy
it
zoltan
continued
to
intrigue
me
i
have
never
have
a
close
friend
who
be
not
jewish
before
and
zoltan
have
never
have
a
close
jewish
friend
although
about
one
third
of
our
class
be
jewish
and
the
group
as
a
whole
mixed
very
well
as
far
as
i
could
see
no
other
close
friendship
developed
across
the
jewish
non
jewish
boundary
zoltan
caustic
wit
and
his
sharp
insight
impressed
me
as
do
his
interest
in
western
literature
and
music
he
be
an
accomplish
jazz
pianist
his
attempt
to
look
western
i
soon
realize
be
not
an
act
at
all
but
be
completely
consistent
with
his
interest
i
found
all
of
this
fascinate
and
as
he
openly
make
cynical
political
comment
to
me
i
found
myself
opening
up
to
him
more
and
more
too
from
time
to
time
we
get
together
outside
of
school
sometimes
he
come
to
visit
at
my
apartment
but
more
often
we
go
for
long
walk
through
the
street
of
budapest
there
be
still
this
business
of
jew
versus
non
jew
that
hung
between
us
on
one
of
our
long
walk
i
take
a
deep
breath
and
ask
him
if
it
bother
him
to
be
friend
with
a
jew
he
sent
me
one
of
his
characteristic
glance
over
his
green
glass
and
say
with
a
straight
face
why
would
it
bother
me
that
you
be
a
stink
jew
this
be
the
epithet
that
rabid
anti
semite
hurl
at
jew
and
his
use
of
it
stun
me
then
i
collect
myself
and
shot
back
yes
and
why
should
it
bother
me
that
i
hang
out
with
a
dumb
goy
that
be
an
epithet
i
have
never
use
but
i
perceive
it
to
be
equally
nasty
without
flinch
zoltan
reply
that
be
it
then
you
be
a
stink
jew
and
i
be
a
dumb
goy
so
what
the
problem
with
that
the
uneasiness
disappear
it
even
get
to
be
a
sort
of
joke
in
keep
with
our
increase
familiarity
with
the
periodic
table
of
element
we
realize
that
the
initial
of
the
word
stink
jew
in
hungarian
almost
match
the
chemical
symbol
of
the
element
bismuth
while
the
initial
for
dumb
goy
precisely
match
the
initial
for
the
element
mercury
so
whenever
we
be
travel
together
on
the
tram
and
one
of
us
felt
like
poke
fun
at
the
other
in
public
we
would
mutter
the
word
bismuth
and
mercury
at
each
other
until
we
start
laugh
school
kept
me
so
busy
that
i
have
to
give
up
kayak
but
i
do
not
spend
all
of
my
time
study
the
franz
liszt
international
piano
competition
be
held
that
winter
and
my
mother
and
i
get
ticket
it
take
place
at
the
academy
of
music
which
be
locate
a
few
block
from
our
house
on
kiraly
street
so
we
could
just
walk
over
to
the
concert
i
have
never
be
to
a
music
competition
before
each
contestant
first
have
to
play
the
same
piece
of
music
a
sonata
by
franz
liszt
i
thought
listen
to
the
same
piece
over
and
over
would
be
boring
instead
i
become
fascinate
by
the
nuance
of
the
piece
and
i
start
to
notice
difference
in
the
performer
play
style
and
technique
by
the
end
of
this
part
of
the
competition
i
be
hum
liszt
piano
sonata
as
i
walk
down
the
street
my
mother
and
i
attend
together
we
have
good
seat
on
the
first
level
balcony
we
could
look
down
over
the
shoulder
of
the
performer
and
watch
their
hand
in
action
in
the
intermission
we
compare
note
and
ranked
our
favorite
when
the
judge
announce
their
decision
we
react
with
approval
or
horror
like
soccer
fan
react
to
the
referee
call
a
russian
pianist
won
rumor
have
it
that
he
use
his
prize
money
to
buy
a
winter
coat
right
there
in
budapest
it
seem
that
the
selection
in
our
store
be
well
than
what
he
have
at
home
i
found
this
strange
my
fascination
with
opera
also
continued
to
grow
so
much
so
that
i
decide
to
take
sing
lesson
this
be
not
the
first
time
i
have
try
to
get
involve
in
sing
some
year
before
i
have
try
out
for
a
folk
sing
group
i
like
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
and
i
fantasize
that
i
would
be
discover
as
a
latter
day
chali
apin
i
show
up
at
the
audition
but
when
i
belt
out
one
of
the
few
hungarian
folk
song
i
knew
the
chorus
director
cut
my
performance
short
and
sent
me
home
after
this
rejection
i
do
not
try
to
sing
for
a
long
time
it
take
courage
to
try
out
again
but
some
year
have
pass
and
my
voice
have
change
and
to
me
at
least
it
sound
much
well
than
before
the
audition
be
longer
this
time
i
sang
then
the
accompanist
played
some
chord
and
i
have
to
break
out
each
of
the
note
of
the
chord
to
demonstrate
that
i
have
a
measure
of
musical
aptitude
this
time
to
my
relief
i
be
accepted
the
lesson
be
half
an
hour
long
two
evening
a
week
they
be
outright
boring
the
teacher
make
me
practice
sing
scale
she
be
pretty
matter
of
fact
about
my
voice
and
paid
a
lot
more
attention
to
the
advanced
singer
i
do
not
care
i
be
learn
real
sing
so
i
persevere
with
vigor
use
the
time
when
i
be
alone
in
the
apartment
to
practice
i
would
have
be
mortify
if
anyone
at
home
heard
me
my
sing
be
not
meant
for
friend
and
family
only
for
me
and
my
teacher
after
several
month
of
scale
during
which
my
sing
voice
get
smoother
and
more
flexible
i
be
promote
to
simple
schubert
song
the
particular
song
my
teacher
chose
must
have
have
great
pedagogical
value
because
they
be
just
as
dull
as
the
scale
i
persistently
ask
to
sing
something
more
interest
and
eventually
my
teacher
take
pity
on
me
and
allow
me
to
choose
the
next
song
i
ask
to
learn
my
favorite
aria
from
mozart
opera
the
marriage
of
figaro
in
it
figaro
explains
the
re
alities
of
army
life
to
a
young
boy
who
be
anxious
to
join
up
the
music
varies
between
lyrical
and
military
melody
between
cajole
and
aggressive
tone
represent
the
variety
of
drama
that
i
crave
this
be
a
lot
more
intricate
than
the
schubert
song
and
it
take
month
to
get
it
right
not
only
do
i
have
to
control
my
voice
through
the
range
of
the
aria
but
i
have
to
learn
to
pace
the
music
just
right
i
have
never
really
learn
to
read
music
and
i
always
have
trouble
with
timing
but
i
love
every
minute
i
spent
on
it
even
when
i
have
to
sing
particular
part
over
and
over
one
winter
even
after
school
i
get
involve
in
a
deep
discussion
with
one
of
my
schoolmate
when
i
realize
it
be
time
to
go
to
sing
class
he
come
with
me
and
we
continued
our
argument
all
the
way
there
and
even
while
sit
in
the
anteroom
until
it
be
time
for
my
class
i
go
in
and
practice
the
figaro
aria
my
classmate
have
told
me
he
do
not
know
anything
about
music
and
be
not
interested
in
opera
so
i
be
surprised
that
he
be
still
there
when
i
come
out
we
resume
our
walk
but
before
we
could
resume
our
argument
about
chemistry
he
ask
what
be
that
stuff
you
sang
i
could
hear
you
through
the
door
and
it
sound
really
neat
when
my
sing
go
well
it
make
me
feel
well
about
everything
even
if
thing
at
school
be
tough
i
thought
i
have
make
an
important
discovery
i
realize
that
it
be
good
to
have
at
least
two
interest
in
your
life
if
you
have
only
one
interest
and
that
go
sour
there
be
nothing
to
act
as
a
counterbalance
to
lift
your
mood
but
if
you
have
more
than
one
interest
chance
be
something
will
always
go
okay
during
that
winter
a
friend
introduce
me
to
one
of
his
friend
who
be
a
pianist
the
pianist
love
opera
and
like
to
accompany
singer
this
be
a
rarity
most
pianist
i
knew
would
not
condescend
to
accompany
singer
i
jumped
at
this
opportunity
and
start
to
show
up
at
this
fellow
house
along
with
a
small
group
of
other
student
we
be
ambitious
and
decide
to
learn
the
first
scene
from
the
first
act
of
mozart
don
giovanni
my
voice
best
fit
the
role
of
don
giovanni
and
i
threw
myself
into
his
persona
with
relish
don
giovanni
figure
his
ease
with
woman
his
devil
may
care
attitude
capture
my
imagination
the
scene
be
only
a
few
minute
long
but
it
involve
several
singer
in
intricate
interaction
and
it
take
several
month
for
us
to
get
it
right
when
we
do
the
music
be
so
beautiful
that
it
give
me
shiver
another
song
that
i
like
and
learn
be
a
schumann
ballad
call
the
two
grenadier
it
be
the
story
of
two
of
napoleon
soldier
rise
from
the
dead
to
come
to
the
defense
of
their
embattle
emperor
the
range
of
the
music
be
just
right
for
me
allow
me
to
sing
it
quite
well
and
i
especially
like
the
drama
i
try
to
act
it
out
use
only
my
voice
but
my
face
and
arm
often
get
into
the
act
too
one
time
that
spring
my
parent
and
i
be
visit
a
friend
who
have
a
piano
somehow
it
come
up
in
the
conversation
that
i
be
learn
the
two
grenadier
and
that
i
have
the
music
with
me
my
parent
friend
persuade
my
mother
to
sit
down
at
the
piano
i
have
see
how
the
boy
who
accompany
us
on
don
giovanni
have
to
struggle
with
the
music
even
though
he
work
on
it
for
many
week
so
i
be
stun
when
my
mother
although
initially
reluctant
take
the
music
put
it
on
the
stand
and
start
play
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
sang
the
two
grenadier
and
my
mother
accompany
me
perfectly
follow
my
cadence
and
adjust
her
play
when
i
lose
my
timing
sing
while
she
played
make
me
feel
very
close
to
my
mother
even
so
i
be
never
able
to
talk
her
into
accompany
me
again
that
spring
i
have
another
chance
to
sing
it
be
for
class
night
at
the
university
class
night
be
a
tradition
where
each
class
put
on
some
entertainment
for
their
professor
snack
and
dance
would
follow
it
be
a
very
small
affair
held
in
a
room
in
the
university
building
there
be
a
piano
in
the
corner
my
classmate
and
i
put
together
a
number
of
short
skit
and
other
people
told
joke
in
addition
i
round
up
my
sing
buddy
and
the
accompanist
and
we
sang
the
first
scene
from
don
giovanni
even
though
most
of
the
class
have
never
heard
the
real
thing
or
maybe
because
of
that
our
performance
be
well
receive
to
top
off
the
even
hilda
come
over
to
us
with
a
proposition
she
have
caucus
with
some
of
the
senior
staff
and
they
have
an
idea
how
about
if
our
class
which
be
obviously
talented
in
matter
of
this
sort
put
on
an
opening
act
for
the
graduate
class
traditional
performance
at
the
end
of
the
year
this
proposition
blew
us
away
the
performance
be
held
at
a
big
theater
off
campus
and
be
the
social
high
point
of
each
university
year
it
be
attend
by
many
hundred
of
people
and
ticket
be
always
oversubscribed
low
class
student
be
not
even
invite
to
attend
so
the
notion
that
a
first
year
class
should
be
ask
to
perform
be
extraordinary
we
accepted
on
the
spot
i
suggest
that
we
work
up
a
pantomime
around
our
experience
in
the
analytical
chemistry
lab
that
would
be
familiar
to
all
chemistry
student
as
it
be
everyone
first
exposure
to
practical
chemistry
i
already
have
an
idea
so
i
volunteer
to
write
the
script
in
fact
analytical
chemistry
have
already
become
my
main
focus
and
not
just
from
the
point
of
view
of
write
the
script
in
the
fall
semester
chemistry
lab
have
start
out
as
a
place
where
we
would
merely
do
experiment
that
brought
home
the
lesson
of
what
we
have
learn
in
class
in
the
spring
semester
however
the
lab
change
and
focus
on
experiment
whose
purpose
be
to
identify
unknown
compound
that
be
what
analytical
chemistry
be
about
the
early
assignment
be
simple
and
we
could
complete
them
in
a
single
class
but
as
the
semester
progress
the
compound
that
we
have
to
look
for
become
more
complex
to
make
matter
bad
they
be
combine
with
other
compound
make
the
task
a
lot
more
complicate
sometimes
we
work
in
team
other
time
we
work
individually
more
often
than
not
we
need
several
lab
session
to
come
up
with
the
answer
just
to
ratchet
up
our
anxiety
several
more
level
we
be
told
that
our
performance
on
these
assignment
whether
we
identify
the
right
substance
and
how
long
it
take
to
do
it
count
significantly
toward
our
grade
while
some
consider
this
analytical
lab
drudgery
i
love
it
and
i
be
good
at
it
maybe
my
home
tinker
help
a
little
i
particularly
like
the
deductive
process
involve
in
figure
out
how
if
one
experiment
give
one
set
of
result
and
another
experiment
give
another
set
of
result
it
follow
that
the
compound
in
question
have
to
be
x
hilda
urge
us
on
in
her
cheerful
energetic
way
her
way
of
console
us
when
we
get
stuck
be
to
assure
us
that
this
be
a
trivial
task
particularly
compare
to
the
final
assignment
that
one
she
warn
us
be
so
very
complicate
that
nobody
have
yet
gotten
it
completely
right
the
warmth
of
late
spring
arrive
and
with
it
come
the
dread
final
assignment
we
be
each
give
a
mystery
solution
contain
half
a
dozen
or
so
compound
each
solution
be
different
our
task
be
to
identify
the
compound
the
grade
depend
on
how
many
you
could
identify
mine
be
a
clear
solution
with
absolutely
no
clue
to
its
ingredient
we
have
four
week
to
decode
it
there
be
two
different
way
of
go
about
the
analytical
process
one
be
by
follow
preordain
step
rigorously
iden
tifying
some
compound
and
eliminate
others
step
by
step
by
step
if
you
do
everything
correctly
and
interpret
your
result
correctly
this
be
bound
to
lead
to
the
correct
result
eventually
however
this
rigorous
process
be
extremely
cumbersome
and
time
consume
and
there
be
a
danger
of
run
out
of
time
alternatively
you
could
make
your
own
path
you
could
start
with
the
rigorously
mandate
conventional
process
but
as
the
result
unfolded
you
could
take
an
intuitive
leap
and
make
up
your
own
sequence
of
experiment
adjust
them
as
more
result
become
available
this
method
have
the
advantage
of
be
much
more
direct
and
faster
but
it
be
more
risky
because
if
your
experimental
flow
go
in
the
wrong
direction
you
could
blow
the
whole
assignment
i
be
confident
enough
in
my
grasp
of
inorganic
chemistry
to
choose
the
high
risk
option
after
a
few
step
i
depart
from
the
predetermine
flow
and
keep
careful
note
struck
out
in
a
direction
that
seem
logical
to
me
at
first
i
make
rapid
progress
i
identify
several
component
in
my
compound
and
eliminate
many
others
then
the
go
get
tougher
experiment
after
experiment
yield
no
new
information
i
become
increasingly
obsess
with
the
task
at
hand
it
loom
monumentally
large
i
be
completely
alone
in
this
task
each
of
us
have
a
different
compound
and
each
of
us
chose
his
or
her
own
path
and
everyone
be
completely
preoccupy
with
his
or
her
own
problem
so
i
could
not
brainstorm
with
any
of
my
classmate
nor
could
i
ask
hilda
for
advice
i
have
take
such
unorthodox
step
to
get
to
where
i
be
that
she
could
not
have
help
me
even
if
she
would
be
allow
to
increasingly
i
live
in
my
own
little
mental
cocoon
inorganic
compound
and
element
dance
in
front
of
my
eye
day
and
night
we
have
one
more
week
left
and
i
be
seriously
worried
i
be
head
home
after
a
late
afternoon
at
the
lab
i
take
the
tram
i
like
to
let
other
people
crowd
on
first
so
i
could
hang
on
the
outside
step
with
the
spring
air
blowing
in
my
face
it
be
a
slightly
dangerous
position
but
a
very
refresh
one
this
even
i
be
hang
on
the
outside
as
usual
look
ahead
in
the
gathering
may
dusk
but
i
do
not
see
the
traffic
or
the
familiar
street
go
by
my
mind
be
fill
with
atom
and
molecule
and
experimental
scheme
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
get
it
i
do
not
know
what
set
it
off
the
experimental
result
that
be
float
around
in
my
head
suddenly
jelled
and
the
confusion
of
the
previous
week
coalesce
into
a
solid
vision
of
where
i
be
and
where
i
need
to
go
i
jumped
off
the
tram
and
ran
home
i
take
out
my
note
and
checked
to
see
whether
my
recollection
of
the
past
experimental
result
be
correct
they
be
i
could
not
wait
to
get
back
into
the
lab
the
next
day
with
complete
confidence
i
plan
the
next
sequence
of
experiment
to
confirm
my
hypothesis
they
work
i
clean
up
my
note
and
write
them
up
into
finish
form
listing
all
the
inorganic
chemical
that
make
up
my
sample
early
on
the
day
of
the
final
lab
session
i
walk
up
to
hilda
and
hand
her
my
lab
paper
she
look
at
them
with
an
inscrutable
smile
then
glance
up
at
me
and
say
be
you
sure
grof
i
say
yes
but
all
of
a
sudden
i
be
not
as
sure
as
i
thought
i
sound
the
next
day
we
all
gather
around
hilda
as
she
read
out
the
correct
answer
to
each
of
the
compound
mine
be
the
only
analysis
that
be
completely
correct
in
fact
accord
to
hilda
it
be
the
first
time
that
anybody
get
all
aspect
of
this
assignment
right
my
classmate
look
impressed
hilda
look
proud
i
be
ecstatic
the
news
of
my
accomplishment
ran
ahead
of
me
in
several
of
my
other
class
the
instructor
congratulate
me
with
a
smile
it
be
a
wonderful
way
to
end
the
academic
year
there
be
still
one
more
task
to
accomplish
before
the
university
year
be
over
to
perform
our
pantomime
at
the
graduation
ceremony
i
write
and
direct
it
and
have
a
part
in
it
so
i
be
almost
as
preoccupy
with
our
skit
as
i
have
be
with
the
final
experiment
the
graduate
senior
be
perform
a
spoof
of
the
russian
opera
prince
igor
their
version
be
call
prince
szigor
which
be
the
hungarian
word
for
discipline
they
would
sing
their
way
through
their
university
experience
make
fun
of
their
course
and
teacher
the
event
usually
consist
of
only
their
performance
so
invite
us
to
open
for
them
be
a
break
with
tradition
the
eye
of
the
entire
university
would
be
on
us
and
we
want
to
do
well
our
script
be
about
the
behavior
of
chemical
element
during
the
torture
of
laboratory
analysis
each
member
of
the
class
represent
a
particular
chemical
element
to
the
accompaniment
of
classical
ballet
music
played
on
the
piano
by
my
friend
zoltan
they
mimicked
how
the
element
react
to
each
other
to
heat
to
filter
and
to
other
scientific
manipulation
the
whole
thing
be
a
big
in
joke
and
the
fact
that
our
class
have
just
be
through
analytical
chemistry
give
it
extra
spice
it
be
also
a
big
in
joke
about
our
class
for
instance
two
of
the
student
a
guy
and
a
girl
represent
two
element
that
be
almost
identical
these
element
always
act
the
same
way
and
be
very
difficult
to
distinguish
from
each
other
these
student
be
short
and
look
alike
rather
like
those
element
but
the
real
joke
be
that
they
be
actually
date
each
other
and
be
inseparable
so
when
i
tickle
their
foot
with
a
bunsen
burner
actually
a
large
than
life
paper
cut
out
of
a
flame
they
jumped
up
on
a
chair
and
sat
down
in
unison
hold
hand
with
each
other
all
the
while
the
first
time
we
rehearse
this
everyone
roar
we
held
numerous
rehearsal
squeeze
in
between
our
time
in
the
lab
even
though
we
be
all
preoccupy
with
our
lab
work
the
rehearsal
be
great
fun
everyone
have
something
to
add
to
the
script
so
the
end
product
be
a
class
effort
despite
our
enthusiasm
about
our
performance
outside
of
class
i
felt
very
awkward
about
my
prominent
role
in
it
consequently
even
though
my
parent
badly
want
to
attend
the
event
i
be
adamant
that
i
do
not
want
them
there
i
told
them
their
presence
would
make
me
even
more
self
conscious
my
parent
reluctantly
accepted
this
but
be
very
very
unhappy
about
it
the
big
day
come
and
we
all
gather
backstage
to
my
surprise
i
be
ask
to
make
a
few
introductory
remark
i
be
not
prepared
and
felt
frighten
by
the
thought
of
speak
in
front
of
a
big
crowd
but
when
i
come
out
in
front
of
the
curtain
and
saw
the
sea
of
expectant
face
i
felt
a
curious
calm
i
suddenly
have
the
impression
that
i
be
talk
to
a
group
of
people
who
be
there
because
they
be
interested
in
what
i
have
to
say
i
manage
to
describe
what
the
audience
be
about
to
see
and
they
respond
with
lively
applause
then
the
curtain
go
up
and
we
begin
our
show
zoltan
hit
the
opening
chord
of
swan
lake
and
our
class
parade
out
everyone
be
wear
similar
clothes
distinguish
only
by
the
sign
hung
around
our
neck
tell
which
element
we
represent
the
audience
many
of
them
chemist
appreciate
the
humor
and
there
be
lot
of
laughter
as
the
element
show
their
true
color
and
so
the
first
year
end
with
a
big
bang
the
pantomime
be
a
giant
success
my
academic
work
be
promising
even
more
important
for
the
first
time
i
could
remember
i
felt
at
home
in
a
group
i
be
no
longer
an
outsider
i
start
the
summer
break
on
a
real
high
i
have
be
so
happy
and
preoccupy
during
the
year
that
i
have
almost
ignore
what
be
go
on
outside
of
my
class
that
year
have
also
be
marked
by
a
series
of
traumatic
political
rumor
and
development
ever
since
stalin
die
there
have
be
a
succession
of
new
name
and
face
in
the
top
position
in
the
soviet
politburo
none
of
them
have
acquire
the
same
image
or
reputation
that
stalin
have
while
he
be
alive
and
none
stayed
in
power
very
long
but
early
in
a
rumor
start
circulate
about
one
of
the
new
russian
political
leader
a
man
name
nikita
khrushchev
accord
to
the
rumor
khrushchev
in
a
speech
at
a
big
meeting
of
the
official
of
the
soviet
communist
party
denounce
the
terror
and
cruelty
perpetrate
by
stalin
over
the
year
i
never
saw
a
detailed
description
of
khrushchev
comment
every
rumor
be
different
from
the
others
but
their
persistent
nature
make
you
believe
that
there
be
some
truth
to
them
the
change
of
the
guard
in
russia
be
mirror
in
hungary
too
rakosi
who
represent
the
hungarian
communist
regime
at
its
most
repressive
be
replace
by
imre
nagy
a
popular
political
figure
who
be
also
consider
more
independent
of
the
russian
nagy
last
only
a
short
time
before
he
too
be
depose
and
replace
by
a
member
of
the
rakosi
regime
but
this
time
even
the
rakosi
follower
seem
less
repressive
altogether
there
be
an
unmistakable
ease
of
the
political
climate
in
hungary
many
people
who
have
be
imprison
for
political
reason
be
release
but
what
make
the
most
visible
impression
on
me
be
the
change
in
the
tone
of
the
newspaper
and
radio
commentary
discussion
of
politics
and
the
economy
be
more
open
voice
of
criticism
and
analysis
appear
seemingly
with
impunity
the
trend
seem
to
have
be
driven
by
journalist
and
writer
a
number
of
these
belong
to
a
discussion
group
call
the
petofi
circle
name
after
sandor
petofi
the
poet
of
the
rev
olution
i
be
only
vaguely
aware
of
the
existence
of
this
group
then
in
june
there
be
a
buzz
about
their
organize
a
public
discussion
about
the
journalistic
practice
of
the
day
some
friend
of
mine
suggest
that
we
attend
there
be
so
much
talk
about
this
session
that
we
decide
to
go
several
hour
before
it
officially
start
this
be
a
good
thing
already
the
cavernous
hall
be
almost
completely
full
by
the
time
the
session
start
people
fill
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
auditorium
crammed
the
stairway
and
overflow
into
the
courtyard
of
the
building
loudspeaker
have
to
be
hung
so
that
the
session
could
be
broadcast
to
the
crowd
wait
outside
hundred
of
people
be
packed
in
sweat
in
the
early
summer
heat
and
occasionally
cheer
at
a
shout
remark
in
addition
to
other
university
classmate
i
ran
into
several
high
school
classmate
and
some
of
my
parent
friend
later
i
found
out
that
both
my
parent
be
there
too
but
i
never
saw
them
in
the
crowd
my
friend
and
i
manage
to
find
a
place
inside
the
auditorium
a
long
table
be
set
up
on
the
stage
at
it
sat
a
panel
of
writer
and
journalist
one
of
them
be
my
cousin
marika
husband
one
by
one
they
stood
up
and
face
the
audience
described
the
many
way
in
which
each
have
work
to
mislead
the
hungarian
public
through
lie
distortion
and
exaggeration
a
lot
of
the
discussion
involve
subject
that
do
not
mean
much
to
me
but
one
confession
that
i
understood
be
by
the
editor
of
the
major
communist
daily
newspaper
he
told
how
he
have
doctor
the
weather
forecast
to
promise
clear
sky
for
each
may
day
in
order
to
encourage
people
to
turn
out
in
large
number
for
the
annual
parade
while
a
lot
of
the
comment
may
have
be
lose
on
me
they
be
not
lose
on
much
of
the
audience
who
greet
each
confession
with
increasingly
exuberant
cheer
approve
comment
and
energetic
applause
i
be
stun
by
the
enthusiasm
but
i
also
notice
something
peculiar
about
the
applause
communist
political
speech
and
pronouncement
be
always
acknowledge
by
rhythmic
clap
slow
measure
and
always
in
unison
i
have
grown
to
expect
such
clap
at
political
meeting
now
i
found
it
ironic
that
the
speaker
be
acknowledge
by
the
same
rhythmic
clap
that
i
associate
with
the
communist
the
meeting
start
in
late
afternoon
and
go
on
for
hour
there
seem
to
be
no
end
to
the
revelation
and
confession
it
be
fascinate
to
listen
to
and
i
could
not
help
but
feel
that
i
be
witness
something
unusual
and
significant
i
sense
that
i
be
witness
history
be
make
afterward
my
friend
and
i
walk
home
talk
excitedly
about
the
event
of
the
even
none
of
us
have
see
anything
like
this
before
we
be
optimistic
about
what
it
might
mean
for
the
future
then
a
thought
occur
to
me
the
whole
thing
remind
me
of
a
pressure
cooker
whose
lid
have
be
weaken
the
danger
be
that
as
more
steam
be
generate
the
weaken
lid
might
very
well
explode
a
few
day
later
i
have
to
report
for
military
training
as
do
all
the
boy
from
my
university
class
we
take
the
train
to
a
dusty
hot
army
camp
near
a
town
call
orgovany
a
few
mile
from
kiskoros
every
summer
over
the
four
year
of
university
we
would
train
in
antiaircraft
artillery
at
graduation
we
would
become
reserve
officer
this
our
first
summer
be
devote
to
basic
training
it
be
very
basic
we
slouch
off
the
train
and
be
hand
ill
fitting
well
worn
fade
greenish
brown
uniform
with
no
insignia
and
a
plain
foldable
cap
then
we
be
greet
by
a
sergeant
a
wiry
guy
with
a
coarse
face
who
look
us
over
with
undisguised
disdain
and
announce
that
he
be
go
to
make
men
of
us
i
do
not
know
what
i
do
but
the
sergeant
somehow
single
me
out
of
the
first
lineup
later
i
wonder
what
happen
all
i
could
come
up
with
be
that
i
look
straight
at
him
when
he
lecture
us
it
help
me
understand
him
while
the
other
guy
all
look
at
their
foot
in
any
case
right
from
the
begin
i
be
assign
all
the
unpleasant
task
like
wash
dish
cleaning
latrine
peel
potato
and
the
like
the
sergeant
picked
on
me
for
several
week
then
i
guess
he
get
tire
of
it
and
spread
his
attention
more
broadly
there
also
be
student
from
other
university
at
this
base
but
our
group
from
the
chemistry
department
be
assign
to
a
small
platoon
that
train
together
the
training
consist
of
march
in
formation
learn
to
salute
and
wait
wait
and
wait
some
more
it
be
very
hot
in
orgovany
and
wait
around
in
the
sun
be
miserable
and
boring
occasionally
we
be
lecture
on
how
to
calculate
airplane
speed
so
we
could
hit
move
target
an
instructor
held
up
terribly
simplistic
chart
of
trajectory
and
formula
they
be
on
par
with
counting
one
and
two
and
three
from
the
time
you
see
lightning
to
when
you
hear
thunder
to
figure
out
how
far
away
the
strike
be
he
be
bore
and
so
be
we
and
we
be
hot
the
highlight
of
our
training
involve
load
dummy
be
munition
a
wooden
bullet
into
a
world
war
ii
vintage
antiaircraft
gun
we
do
this
over
and
over
and
over
one
person
pull
back
on
the
breech
and
the
other
load
the
ammunition
then
the
next
pair
repeat
it
and
the
next
after
that
we
do
this
hour
after
hour
after
hour
the
great
danger
be
the
possibility
that
when
the
contraption
close
it
might
take
your
thumb
with
it
so
we
be
taught
slowly
and
carefully
to
fold
our
thumb
into
our
fist
as
we
shove
the
bullet
into
the
gun
once
or
twice
we
practice
aim
the
gun
crank
away
to
track
a
model
airplane
that
be
suspend
on
a
wire
and
be
pull
back
and
forth
across
the
fire
range
even
though
the
model
plane
move
slowly
across
the
horizon
we
have
a
hard
time
keep
it
in
the
gunsight
i
remember
the
two
jet
that
have
zoom
above
gabi
and
me
at
lake
velence
and
wonder
how
we
would
keep
track
of
those
with
this
gun
in
the
four
or
five
week
of
our
military
training
we
never
do
get
to
fire
the
antiaircraft
gun
the
only
time
we
ever
get
to
fire
anything
be
in
rifle
training
we
be
each
hand
three
live
round
and
be
instruct
to
fire
at
a
target
place
against
a
hillside
some
distance
away
my
experience
with
my
air
gun
come
in
handy
to
my
sergeant
amazement
i
do
very
well
at
target
shoot
momentarily
i
have
a
bit
of
his
respect
the
single
overwhelm
element
of
our
week
of
military
training
be
abject
boredom
when
we
be
not
march
or
attend
lecture
or
practice
with
the
antiartillery
gun
we
would
drag
a
blanket
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
and
sit
and
chat
and
play
endless
game
of
twenty
question
while
watch
the
regular
soldier
lift
weight
during
their
time
off
sometimes
for
a
change
we
sat
near
the
boundary
fence
of
the
army
base
outside
the
fence
be
a
dirt
road
and
every
once
in
a
while
the
camp
commander
wife
would
walk
past
we
could
look
at
her
surreptitiously
but
it
have
to
be
very
surreptitiously
because
rumor
have
it
that
someone
in
an
earlier
group
have
wolf
whistle
at
her
and
all
hell
have
broken
loose
i
usually
hung
around
with
my
friend
zoltan
and
jancsi
lanyi
but
even
zoltan
could
not
muster
more
than
a
couple
of
halfheartedly
sarcastic
comment
as
the
august
day
grow
shorter
we
count
the
hour
to
our
liberation
unfortunately
the
end
be
not
that
crisply
define
so
the
closer
we
get
the
more
anxious
we
become
rumor
start
fly
that
because
of
some
unspecific
offense
we
have
commit
they
would
keep
us
three
day
extra
no
it
be
five
day
no
maybe
it
be
only
two
it
be
very
painful
finally
it
be
over
we
be
promote
to
the
rank
of
corporal
and
allow
to
go
home
right
hungarian
flag

very
different
walk
into
the
university
that
september
of
i
have
just
turn
twenty
i
felt
happy
and
at
ease
and
i
be
look
forward
to
see
all
my
classmate
again
even
though
i
have
just
spent
over
a
month
at
military
training
camp
with
some
of
them
it
would
be
nice
to
see
them
out
of
uniform
i
be
look
forward
to
my
class
too
the
second
year
curriculum
be
similar
to
the
previous
year
but
where
the
first
year
focus
on
inorganic
chemistry
the
second
year
would
revolve
around
organic
chemistry
once
again
the
core
chemistry
course
be
taught
by
a
chief
professor
like
professor
lengyel
another
godlike
figure
whose
textbook
would
be
our
course
bible
labwork
too
follow
a
familiar
path
the
year
before
we
have
do
labwork
in
qualitative
analysis
in
which
we
learn
to
identify
the
compound
in
our
sample
this
year
our
labwork
would
involve
quantitative
analysis
in
which
we
would
figure
out
the
amount
of
those
compound
this
promise
to
be
even
more
challenge
than
qualitative
analysis
but
have
conquer
qualitative
analysis
i
be
look
forward
to
it
i
thought
i
would
have
fun
in
this
lab
everybody
knew
of
my
achievement
in
the
first
year
qualitative
analysis
lab
include
my
teacher
in
quantitative
analysis
they
imply
that
they
expect
me
to
do
equally
well
in
their
class
i
worried
that
i
might
not
be
able
to
live
up
to
my
reputation
but
it
be
nice
to
be
famous
early
in
the
semester
our
class
organize
a
mixer
for
the
first
year

her
name
be

come
from

it
give
me
an
opportunity
to
offer
my
service

my
delight

without
hesitation

her
around
budapest
and
take
her
to
my
favorite
haunt

be
petite
quiet
unaffected
and
easy
to
be
with
i
ask
her
out
a
number
of
time
and
i
always
look
forward
to
see
her
while
the

something
magical
about
a
large
spontaneous
demonstration
i
kept
look
around
soak
it
all
in
feel
that
i
be
in
a
dream
all
of
a
sudden
a
hungarian
flag
be
unfurled
from
a
window
along
the
way
the
hungarian
flag
have
horizontal
stripe
of
red
white
and
green
the
original
flag
have
the
emblem
of
st
stephen
a
gold
crown
with
a
cross
on
top
in

during

replace
by
the
cross

have
a
hole
in
the
middle
the
communist
emblem
have
be
cut
out
pretty
soon
we
saw
more
flag
like
that
then
more
flag
until
just
about
every
building
be
decorate
with
one
all
with
a
hole
in
the
middle
the
sight
take
my
breath
away
those
flag
be
permanently
alter
the
act
seem
unequivocal
and
destine
to
provoke
a
reaction
of
some
sort
the
demonstration
have
start
as
an
act
of
support
and
celebration
but
now
i
felt
we
have
cross
a
line
of
no
return
i
begin
to
feel
a
little
nervous
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
crowd
and
amid
all
my
gawk
i
get
separate
from
my
friend
i
found
myself
be
swept
toward
the
big
square
in
front
of
the
parliament
building
every
inch
of
the
square
be
jammed
with
demonstrator
thousand
of
them
after
a
while
they
start
chant
we
want
nagy
we
want
nagy
imre
nagy
have
be
depose
as
prime
minister
the
previous
year
but
after
a
period
of
disgrace
he
have
be
include
in
the
government
again
we
stood
and
shout
then
wait
then
shout
and
wait
some
more
by
now
it
be
early
even
it
be
get
dark
but
nobody
be
leave
finally
nagy
appear
on
the
balcony
of
a
building
near

cheer
wildly

a
short
speech
i
could
not
understand
a
word
of
what
he
say
people
cheer
again
but
not
as
wildly
as
before
clearly
whatever
he
say
do
not
seem
to
be
enough
a
wave
of
excitement
swept
through
the
crowd
it
seem
that
the
student
who
originally
organize
the
march
have
formulate
a
twelve
point
program
of
political
reform
along
the
line
of
a
similar
program
formulate
during
the
revolution
the
buzz
be
that
we
should
head
to
the
main
radio
station
and
demand
that
the
twelve
point
be
read
over
radio
budapest
meanwhile
i

statue
of

so
i
join
the
stream
of
thousand
that
be
flow
slowly
in
that
direction
but
before
i
could
get
there
a
rumor
ran
through
the
crowd
that

place
over

on
our

previously
these

have
be
regularly
jammed

we
could
make
out
only
fragment
of
phrase
behind
the
static
of
the
jamming
both
these
station
give
us
a
lot
more
information
about
what

go
on
in

more
important
they
give
the
impression
that
what
happen
over
the
last
few
day
be
get
attention
all
over
the
world
the

their
scary
side
too
not
too
far
from

house
i
ran
into
a
crowd
of

that
the
person
they

unit
have
freed
him
a
few
day
earlier
even
though
mind
szenty
have
be
in
prison
for
year
he
be
still
the
top
rank
religious
figure
in
the
country
and
his
release
seem
very
significant
that
night
cardinal
mindszenty
give
a
speech
in
which
he
express
his
support
for
the
revolution
although
there
be
nothing
explicitly
threaten
in
his
speech
i
found
the
speech
vaguely
ominous
it
remind
me
of
when
i
first
saw
the
hammer
and
sickle
cut
out
of
the
hungarian
flag
like
that
act
this
speech
signal
another
escalation
in
the
revolution
i
have
mixed
feeling
about
the
whole
thing
on
the
one
hand
i
be
happy
to
see
the
communist
regime
topple
on
the
other
hand
i
worried
about
where
all
this
liberation
might
lead
the
war
year
be
not
that
far
in
the
past
i
go
to
bed
fill
with
uneasiness
and
anxiety
early
the
next
morning
i
woke
up
to
the
sound
of
wooden
plank
be
drop
it
sound
familiar
but
it
take
me
a
few
minute
to
think
why
then
i
remember
the
sound
from
eleven
year
ago
it
be
the
sound
of
heavy
artillery
fire
my
heart
start
pound
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
into
the
big
room
it
be
still
dark
outside
but
my
parent
be
already
up
and
wrap
in
their
bathrobe
my
father
be
intently
fiddle
with
the
radio
no
one
say
anything
we
all
knew
what
be
go
on
we
be
just
wait
to
hear
official
confirmation
an
announcement
come
over
radio
budapest
soon
the
announcer
say
imre
nagy
be
go
to
address
the
nation
we
dress
quickly
so
that
we
could
stay
glue
to
the
radio
imre
nagy
come
on
and
give
a
very
brief
address
he
say
that
soviet
troop
have
attack
before
dawn
but
he
assure
us
that
the
government
be
still
function
that
struck
me
as
a
bit
dubious
i
continued
to
hear
the
plank
thud
louder
and
louder
the
artillery
fire
be
get
closer
and
closer
nagy
statement
struck
me
more
like
a
call
for
help
to
the
outside
world
as
it
get
light
outside
a
strange
rumble
approach
on
ki
raly
street
i
ran
back
to
my
room
and
flung
open
the
window
so
i
could
see
what
be
happen
before
i
have
a
chance
to
lean
out
i
froze
a
vehicle
that
look
like
a
tank
without
a
cover
be
come
to
a
stop
right
in
front
of
our
house
russian
soldier
inside
the
shell
be
man
machine
gun
point
in
all
direction
i
heard
shout
in
russian
and
one
of
the
machine
gun
slowly
turn
toward
my
window
i
be
too
frighten
to
move
i
star
down
petrify
as
the
muzzle
swung
toward
me
there
be
a
moment
when
it
seem
to
stop
then
the
machine
gun
continued
to
turn
move
past
my
window
and
scan
the
other
apartment
there
be
some
more
shout
in
russian
and
then
the
vehicle
rumble
on
when
my
heart
start
beating
again
i
go
back
to
my
parent
room
and
in
a
shaky
voice
told
them
what
have
happen
we
decide
it
be
time
to
go
to
the
cellar
i
have
a
sour
taste
in
my
mouth
i
want
to
say
not
again
we
packed
a
bag
of
belonging
and
some
food
and
head
down
other
tenant
be
do
the
same
thing
without
fire
a
shot
the
troop
carrier
have
jolt
the
entire
house
the
air
raid
shelter
have
long
since
be
dismantle
so
we
settle
down
on
some
wooden
stool
in
the
coal
bin
allot
to
our
apartment
wrap
blanket
around
ourselves
and
hang
more
blanket
around
to
try
to
make
a
warm
corner
occasionally
someone
go
up
to
check
what
be
go
on
whenever
he
or
she
return
we
all
circle
around
to
get
the
late
news
of
the
world
above
us
we
do
not
learn
much
we
continued
to
hear
shoot
nearby
we
half
expect
russian
soldier
to
show
up
at
any
minute
story
of
how
the
russian
treat
people
especially
woman
during
the
war
be
on
everyone
mind
the
woman
have
bundle
themselves
in
their
old
clothes
and
wrap
their
head
in
kerchief
try
to
look
as
old
and
unattractive
as
possible
my
mother
do
too
no
one
say
anything
that
night
we
slept
in
the
coal
cellar
huddle
in
coat
and
blanket
it
turn
out
to
be
a
wise
thing
the
next
morning
i
heard
two
mortar
round
whoosh
and
crash
overhead
they
have
land
in
the
attic
of
our
building
all
the
men
ran
upstairs
grab
bucket
of
water
from
their
apartment
on
the
way
in
the
hope
of
extinguish
any
fire
that
the
shell
might
have
start
i
go
with
them
when
we
get
up
to
the
attic
we
saw
that
the
roof
be
shatter
in
two
place
broken
tile
and
splinter
of
wood
be
scatter
on
the
attic
floor
bit
of
the
shell
be
still
smolder
on
the
floor
luckily
the
floor
be
cover
with
sand
so
instead
of
throw
water
on
the
ember
we
shovel
more
sand
over
them
and
the
fire
be
quickly
extinguish
the
sand
have
be
spread
in
the
attic
in
anticipation
of
an
attack
by
the
american
imperialist
during
the
korean
war
the
irony
of
the
situation
do
not
hit
me
until
later
a
third
mortar
round
crashed
into
the
courtyard
later
that
day
one
of
the
fragment
hit
a
tenant
in
the
leg
as
he
be
on
his
way
back
to
the
cellar
a
group
of
neighbor
take
him
to
a
hospital
a
couple
of
block
away

stayed
in
the
cellar
another
night
some
people

up
at
the
house
they
come
down
to
the
cellar
with
their
machine
gun
in
hand
and
look
around
we
look
back
at
them
wait
wordlessly
they
say
something
gesticulate
toward
the
upstairs
apartment
i
remember
enough
of
my
school
russian
to
help
translate
they
want
to
get
into
the
apartment
face
the
street
one
of
the
apartment
they
have
chosen
be
ours
they
shove
some
furniture
out
of
the
way
to
set
up
their
machine
gun
in
the
window
then
they
wave
us
back
into
the
cellar
i
wish
there
be
no
mortar
fall
on
our
house
and
no
russian
soldier
in
our
apartment
i
want

a
few
day
later
the
shoot
around

subside
the
russian
soldier
left
our
house
and
we
move
back
into
our
apartment
there
be
dirty
footstep
on
the
rug
and
the
floor
in
the
big
room
and
handprints
on
the
wall
the
furniture
be
jumbled
together
where
they
have
shove
it
luckily
there
be
no
other
damage
we
could
still
hear
sound
of
fight
in
the
distance
so
we
do
not
dare
leave
the
house
the
phone
work
however
so
we
scramble
to
call
other
people
who
have
a
phone
to
find
out
what
be
happen
elsewhere
i
call
my
friend

i
have
kept
in
touch
with
through

street
and
he

by
look
out
of
the
window
of
our
respective
home

other
update
on
where
we
heard
fight
and
where
we
saw
troop
come
and
go
i
frequently
talk
with
jansci
lanyi
on
the
phone
he

outside
of
budapest
in
the
suburb

their
family
there
be
never
any
answer
my
aunt
manci
do
not
have
a
phone
so
we
have
to
wait
until
it
be
safe
to
go
out
on
the
street
to
see
how
she
be
do
to
try
to
get
real
news
we
listen
to
voice
of
america
and
radio
free
europe
mostly
they
be
jammed
again
with
so
much
static
that
we
could
not
make
out
the
word
sometimes
though
we
could
hear
them
clearly
from
the
safety
of
western
europe
their
hungarian
announcer
aggressively
urge
hungarian
in
hungary
to
continue
their
resistance
to
the
russian
they
paint
a
hopeful
picture
of
our
situation
imply
that
the
world
be
ready
to
support
us
i
found
this
irritate
i
be
sure
they
have
not
woken
up
to
a
russian
troop
carrier
aim
a
machine
gun
at
their
bedroom
window
for
a
while
i
could
see
russian
troop
stand
guard
at
the
street
corner
whenever
i
peer
out
the
window
after
some
day
the
sentry
disappear
that
be
when
we
start
forage
for
food
bread
potato
and
whatever
we
could
find
in
the
few
store
that
have
start
to
reopen
but
we
stayed
in
the
neighborhood
not
dare
to
go
very
far
as
i
walk
around
the
street
i
realize
that
we
have
be
lucky
many
house
in
the
neighborhood
be
marked
by
artillery
fire
some
house
be
completely
demolish
their
front
wall
ripped
open
so
you
could
see
everything
inside
i
notice
something
strange
about
the
window
in
other
house
often
the
rectangle
where
the
window
ordinarily
be
place
be
go
in
its
place
be
a
large
circle
cannon
fire
have
shot
into
the
house
and
all
you
could
see
be
the
rag
edge
of
brick
in
a
round
frame
around
the
window
i
thought
of
a
week
or
so
earlier
when
the
gun
on
the
troop
carrier
below
slowly
swung
past
my
window
a
huge
department
store
that
occupy
an
entire
city
block
not
far
from
us
have
collapse
into
a
heap
of
rubble
i
have
never

devastation

even
from

up
and

the
whole
structure
down

to
find
a
few
loaf
of
bread
and

one
part

these

actually
take

have
absolutely
no
reason
to
exaggerate
the
news
hit
me
at
a
time
when
i
have
be
go
back
and
forth
in
my
mind
about
whether
to
leave
the
country
ever
since
the
russian
have
return
some
three
week
ago
the
number
of
young
people
who
have
set
off
to
cross
the
border
have
grown
by
the
week
some
clearly
make
it
across
because
they
sent
back
word
from
austria
others
disappear
they
either
be
capture
and
intern
or
make
it
across
and
do
not
report
back
home
nobody
knew
which
still
as
it
become
more
and
more
commonplace
to
hear
about
acquaintance
who
have
go
the
thought
of
leave
occupy
me
more
and
more
those
thought
lead
to
endless
discussion
between
my
parent
and
me
and
between
myself
and
my
classmate
jancsi
of
all
my
friend
he
be
the
one
i
have
stayed
in
touch
with
the
most
during
the
turmoil
of
the
revolution
our
discussion
be
all
of
the
what
if
type
what
if
we
could
catch
a
ride
on
a
truck
on
its
way
back
to
austria
what
if
we
get
a
travel
permit
to
go
to
the
vicinity
of
the
border
and
so
on
none
of
them
have
a
realistic
chance
of
be
translate
into
action
still
my

obtain
the

of
the
viennese

write
a

do
everything
possible
to
help
the
bearer
of
this
note
then
he
sign
it
and
give
it
to
my
father
to
safeguard
for
me
if
and
when
i
should
need
it
i
knew
where
i
would
go
if
i
do

plenty
of
hershey

in

consideration

an
aunt
and

just
after

over
we

and
thousand
of
them
in
her
accompany
letter

express
her
hope
that
my
father
would
come
back
alive
and
explain
that
she
be
send
the
flint
as
a
way
to
help
him
get
start
in
business
again
my
father
have
laugh
contemptuously
do
lenke
want
me
to
stand
on
a
street
corner
and
sell
these
the
box
of
flint
have
disappear
someplace
but
my
parent
doubt
about
lenke
remain
in
any
case
there
be
two
more
immediate
problem
hold
me
back
from
leave
i
do
not
know
how
to
do
it
and
i
be
scar
manci
address
the
second
problem
in
a
roundabout
way
when
she
told
me
that
i
would
be
in
danger
if
i
stayed
if
i
could
be
picked
up
merely
for
be
at
the
wrong
street
at
the
wrong
time
and
take
away
to
heaven
knew
where
and
for
who
knew
how
long
i
might
as
well
take
my
chance
and
try
to
get
out
of
hungary
manci
also
propose
a
solution
to
my
first
problem
always
a
collector
of
acquaintance
and
connection
she
told
me
about
someone
she
knew
who
come
from
szombathely
a
small
town
about
fifteen
mile
from
the
austrian
border
this
woman
have
a
daughter
name
angela
who
be
about
my
age
and
be
also
look
to
get
out
angela
have
never
actually
be
to
szombathely
but
her
family
would
equip
her
with
the
name
and
address
of
friend
who
still
live
there
so
that
we
would
have
a
jumping
off
point
it
be
not
exactly
a
smooth
plan
of
get
across
the
border
but
it
be
well
than
anything
i
could
come
up
with
on
my
own
i
call
jancsi
and
told
him
my
aunt
scheme
and
ask
him
if
he
be
ready
to
strike
out
with
angela
and
me
without
hesitation
he
say
yes
we
go
over
to
the
railroad
station
that
afternoon
and
look
up
the
schedule
of
train
leave
for
szombathely
the
next
day
then
we
arrange
to
meet
angela
at
the
station
my
parent
have
encourage
me
to
leave
as
long
as
the
discussion
be
theoretical
now
that
reality
hit
they
become
extremely
somber
my
father
say
in
a
tone
of
earnest
determination
you
should
do
it
you
may
never
have
a
well
chance
he
give
me
the
note
with
the
message
to
his
friend
viennese
business
associate
as
well
as
the
name
and
address
of
viktor
a

of
his
and
manci
from
their
kiskoros
day
who
now
live
in
vienna
i
fold
them
up
as
small
as
possible
and
put
them
in
my
wallet
my
mother
agree
with
my
father
but
her
tone
be
shaky
i
felt
that
if
i
change
my
mind
she
would
have
be
elate
that
night
be
very
tense
i
be
busy
figure
out
what
clothes
i
be
go
to
wear
what
i
be
go
to
take
with
me
and
how
i
be
go
to
dispose
of
what
i
left
behind
i
ask
my
mother
to
go
to
the
university
when
it
reopen
and
find
out
what
grade
i
get
in
my
late
lab
project
despite
all
the
turmoil
in
my
life
that
organic
chemistry
lab
be
still
very
important
to
me
and
i
want
to
know
whether
my
success
in
the
first
year
lab
be
a
fluke
or
whether
i
could
repeat
it
my
mother
write
down
the
information
about
whom
she
need
to
see
and
what
she
be
to
ask
we
be
try
to
be
thorough
and
efficient
in
our
preparation
but
we
be
just
go
through
the
motion
it
be
difficult
to
concentrate
on
these
detail
when
we
be
struggle
with
the
unstated
fact
that
we
might
never
see
each
other
again
that
night
before
i
go
to
bed
i
walk
quietly
around
the
apartment
i
look
over
every
room
i
straighten
up
my
chemistry
set
i
checked
with
my
hand
under
the
windowsill
in
the
light
shaft
to
make
sure
my
prize
bullet
be
still
safely
hidden
i
silently
say
good
bye
early
the
next
morning
i
dress
in
the
warm
outfit
i
have
a
baggy
pair
of
brown
corduroy
pant
that
a
neighborhood
tailor
have
line
with
my
mother
old
pad
silk
bathrobe
and
a
jacket
also
line
with
the
remains
of
the
bathrobe
underneath
i
wore
my
best
winter
suit
it
would
get
wrinkle
but
in
the
meantime
it
would
give
extra
warmth
and
might
come
in
handy
if
i
need
another
pair
of
pant
and
a
jacket
i
packed
a
change
of
underwear
and
some
extra
sock
in
my
school
book
bag
and
put
on
a
short
winter
coat
my
father
give
me
all
the
hungarian
currency
he
could
scrounge
up
on
such
short
notice
and
i
hid
the
note
inside
my
clothes
then
jancsi
show
up
and
it
be
time
to
go
downstairs
jancsi
and
i
to
head
off
to
the
station
and
my
parent
to
go
to
work
we
say
good
bye
at
the
corner
as
if
it
be
any
normal
morning
we
do
not
dare
make
a
big
production
of
it
it
would
not
have
be
a
good
idea
to
suggest
that
i
be
do
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
we
part
then
i
stop
in
my
track
i
have
automatically
put
the
key
to
our
apartment
in
my
pocket
now
i
fish
it
out
turn
around
and
ran
after
my
parent
i
hand
it
to
my
mother
and
say
awkwardly
i
probably
wo
not
need
this
anymore
my
mother
nod
she
look
as
if
she
want
to
say
something
but
she
do
not
speak
i
saw
that
there
be
tear
in
her
eye
i
turn
and
ran
back
to
jancsi
we
set
out
for
the
station
we
met
up
with
angela
bought
our
ticket
and
with
great
self
consciousness
head
for
our
train
we
have
concoct
all
sort
of
elaborate
alibi
as
to
why
we
be
go
to
szombathely
but
when
we
get
to
the
platform
these
alibi
suddenly
appear
ridiculous
everybody
boarding
the
train
look
like
us
all
dress
in
their
heaviest
winter
clothes
and
all
seemingly
on
a
similar
mission
it
be
a
train
of
would
be
emigrant
all
head
to
the
country
but
show
their
origin
as
city
folk
the
train
ride
be
quite
long
the
train
never
go
very
fast
and
it
stop
many
time
sometimes
for
no
apparent
reason
for
a
while
people
kept
to
themselves
and
avoid
even
look
at
each
other
but
as
time
go
on
and
nobody
interfere
with
us
everybody
drop
their
guard
a
bit
people
start
make
oblique
reference
about
get
out
usually
talk
about
friend
or
acquaintance
who
have
make
it
and
the
adventure
or
misadventure
that
have
befallen
them
i
struck
up
a
conversation
with
a
girl
about
my
age
who
say
that
she
have
be
talk
with
the
conductor
who
turn
out
to
be
from
szom
bathely
and
that
for
a
small
amount
of
money
he
have
offer
to
guide
her
to
wherever
she
want
to
go
the
girl
problem
be
that
she
do
not
have
anywhere
to
go
we
do
so
we
promptly
form
an
alliance
all
four
of
us
would
have
the
conductor
guide
us
to
the
address
that
manci
friend
have
give
angela
a
little
later
i
introduce
myself
to
the
conductor
and
ask
him
how
hard
it
would
be
to
get
out
of
the
station
he
be
not
very
encourage
i
wonder
if
he
make
it
sound
bad
than
it
be
in
order
to
justify
his
fee
eventually
we
arrive
at
szombathely
station
the
sun
set
early
in
december
and
it
be
already
dark
people
get
off
the
train
and
start
head
to
the
exit
a
gate
at
the
end
of
the
platform
the
conductor
come
for
us
and
motion
for
us
to
follow
him
off
the
other
side
of
the
train
onto
the
track
he
lead
us
to
another
platform
away
from
the
budapest
passenger
he
whisper
that
there
be
soldier
at
the
main
entrance
examine
everyone
paper
but
he
would
take
us
out
a
different
way
we
held
our
breath
as
we
follow
him
through
a
series
of
back
door
and
desert
corridor
behind
the
public
part
of
the
station
then
suddenly
we
be
out
on
a
dark
street
the
conductor
told
us
which
direction
to
go
in
and
say
that
he
would
follow
us
do
not
worry
he
assure
us
he
would
keep
us
in
sight
and
tell
us
when
to
turn
it
sound
like
a
strange
arrangement
but
he
be
emphatic
so
we
follow
his
bidding
for
a
while
we
kept
glance
back
and
he
be
behind
us
then
he
be
go
we
stop
and
huddle
together
and
wait
there
be
no
conductor
other
than
an
occasional
passerby
nobody
be
on
the
street
it
be
now
seven
thirty
and
there
would
be
a
curfew
at
eight
o
clock
we
could
not
wait
any
longer
we
stop
someone
to
ask
for
direction
to
our
address
he
told
us
where
to
go
it
turn
out
that
it
be
not
very
far
away
then
he
quickly
head
off
we
start
walk
rapidly
too
just
about
eight
o
clock
we
found
the
house
we
knock
on
the
door
a
middle
age
woman
open
it
there
be
some
discussion
between
her
and
angela
the
woman
checked
the
street
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
then
quickly
motion
us
into
the
house
we
could
stay
overnight
she
say
in
fact
we
have
to
because
the
curfew
have
already
start
then
in
the
morning
she
would
take
us
to
someone
who
would
give
us
direction
to
the
border
meanwhile
she
fed
us
dinner
give
us
some
blanket
and
left
us
to
settle
down
for
the
night
we
each
take
a
corner
of
the
room
no
one
slept
much
at
daybreak
the
woman
walk
us
a
few
block
to
the
house
of
a
relative
who
be
a
railroad
engineer
for
a
spur
line
he
knew
the
area
very
well
he
have
just
come
back
from
a
night
shift
and
be
already
in
bed
but
the
woman
woke
him
up
once
he
understood
what
our
situation
be
he
agree
to
help
the
woman
motion
us
into
the
room
he
stayed
in
bed
yawn
with
tousle
hair
and
in
his
underwear
the
engineer
told
us
he
would
give
us
the
name
of
a
sequence
of
village
there
be
however
one
condition
we
have
to
commit
it
to
memory
under
no
circumstance
would
we
be
allow
to
write
it
down
quite
clearly
he
want
to
ensure
that
there
would
be
no
incriminate
evidence
against
him
if
we
be
capture
the
four
of
us
memorize
half
a
dozen
or
so
very
strange
sound
name
mutter
them
to
each
other
to
keep
the
memory
fresh
then
we
set
out
toward
the
first
town
in
the
sequence
we
take
back
road
because
the
railroad
engineer
have
told
us
that
the
main
road
be
patrol
by
russian
troop
the
back
road
be
not
pave
within
a
short
while
we
be
splatter
with
brown
mud
up
to
our
knee
in
each
town
we
ask
someone
for
direction
to
the
next
town
then
we
hurriedly
walk
on
and
on
we
may
have
walk
ten
or
fifteen
mile
but
we
be
so
tense
that
we
be
hardly
conscious
of
be
tire
by
midafternoon
we
reach
the
last
village
on
the
list
it
be
already
get
dark
and
we
quickly
left
in
the
general
direction
of
what
we
thought
be
west
pretty
soon
we
be
walk
through
an
area
of
small
wood
alternate
with
plow
field
and
pasture
it
do
not
look
like
we
be
about
to
cross
a
border
it
look
like
we
be
lose
in
one
of
the
field
a
small
man
be
plow
use
a
plow
pull
by
a
single
ox
we
approach
him
trudge
through
even
more
mud
when
he
heard
us
he
look
at
us
without
the
slightest
surprise
he
straighten
up
and
we
saw
that
he
be
a
hunchback
we
ask
for
direction
to
the
border
he
look
around
in
the
dusk
peer
at
the
surround
wood
for
any
possible
eavesdropper
then
he
gesture
in
a
particular
direction
and
in
a
quiet
voice
which
seem
unnecessary
as
nobody
be
around
us
in
the
field
say
his
house
be
over
there
and
we
should
go
in
and
wait
for
him
we
thanked
him
and
set
off
in
the
direction
he
indicate
soon
we
found
the
farmhouse
we
knock
a
voice
told
us
to
come
in
a
stunningly
beautiful
woman
be
cooking
dinner
she
be
dress
in
an
elaborate
traditional
peasant
costume
that
remind
me
of
folk
dancer
i
would
see
in
show
in
budapest
we
told
her
the
man
outside
sent
us
she
nod
and
invite
us
to
sit
down
for
dinner
in
short
order
the
man
appear
clean
up
some
and
join
us
at
the
table
they
seem
to
be
husband
and
wife
the
whole
scene
the
four
of
us
city
people
from
budapest
sit
around
a
table
in
a
small
house
with
mud
floor
and
a
tile
roof
eat
dinner
with
a
hunchback
peasant
and
be
serve
by
a
colorfully
dress
beautiful
woman
seem
like
a
fantasy
but
we
be
not
very
inclined
to
marvel
at
the
strangeness
of
the
scene
we
have
only
a
single
abide
interest
to
get
to
the
border
the
man
told
us
that
he
get
some
of
his
income
by
smuggle
and
knew
this
area
like
the
back
of
his
hand
he
could
take
us
over
he
say
but
it
would
cost
us
he
left
us
to
ponder
what
we
would
do
we
really
do
not
have
a
choice
between
the
four
of
us
we
come
up
with
the
amount
he
want
and
hand
it
over
my
share
take
half
of
what
my
father
give
me
the
man
told
us
to
settle
down
and
wait
we
would
set
off
at
midnight
time
move
slowly
the
man
and
his
wife
go
about
their
business
without
a
word
the
four
of
us
sat
deep
in
thought
as
it
get
closer
to
midnight
i
have
to
use
the
toilet
the
man
take
me
to
the
door
and
point
out
a
shack
with
a
door
hang
open
inside
be
a
hole
in
the
ground
with
a
tree
trunk
fix
horizontally
in
front
of
it
you
crouch
on
the
tree
trunk
and
do
your
business
into
the
hole
there
be
a
few
piece
of
newspaper
for
toilet
paper
i
have
never
see
that
kind
of
latrine
before
and
it
be
pitch
dark
inside
but
i
manage
i
look
up
at
the
bit
of
sky
barely
visible
through
the
doorway
and
i
thought
this
be
probably
the
last
of
me
that
i
will
leave
in
hungary
shortly
afterward
the
man
say
it
be
time
to
go
as
the
train
conductor
in
szombathely
do
he
start
us
off
in
a
particular
direction
and
told
us
he
would
stay
behind
us
and
seek
us
out
from
time
to
time
to
guide
us
to
the
next
post
give
our
experience
in
szombathely
this
be
not
very
reassure
but
again
we
do
not
have
any
choice
he
be
firm
about
how
he
want
to
do
this
and
we
need
him
we
would
walk
for
five
or
ten
minute
in
a
field
or
through
the
wood
then
he
would
materialize
from
the
dark
tell
us
to
head
in
a
slightly
different
direction
and
then
disappear
again
after
another
five
or
ten
minute
he
would
catch
up
with
us
again
and
direct
us
to
the
next
step
and
so
it
go
every
time
we
thought
he
have
abandon
us
he
would
materialize
out
of
thin
air
and
give
us
our
next
instruction
it
be
cold
and
dark
so
dark
that
sometimes
we
have
to
feel
our
way
among
the
tree
i
lose
track
of
the
time
after
a
while
we
emerge
from
the
wood
i
could
see
some
faint
light
far
across
an
open
field
the
man
come
close
to
us
those
light
be
austria
he
whisper
head
toward
them
and
do
not
take
your
eye
off
them
this
be
as
far
as
i
go
and
he
be
go
i
do
not
take
my
eye
off
those
light
i
trudge
toward
them
as
if
they
be
a
magnet
the
muddy
field
seem
endless
the
light
never
seem
to
get
brighter
we
stumble
across
some
ditch
then
cross
a
dirt
road
we
heard
dog
barking
at
a
distance
and
suddenly
a
flare
lit
up
the
sky
we
threw
ourselves
to
the
ground
hold
our
breath
then
the
flare
burn
out
and
it
be
dark
again
we
picked
ourselves
up
and
continued
after
what
seem
like
mile
and
mile
the
light
finally
come
close
have
we
make
it
we
snuck
up
to
the
first
house
that
we
could
see
dog
immediately
start
barking
in
the
dark
we
again
threw
ourselves
to
the
ground
a
man
come
out
of
the
house
hold
a
kerosene
lantern
over
his
head
and
call
out
in
hungarian
who
be
there
my
heart
stop
i
would
heard
story
of
people
who
have
attempt
to
cross
the
border
gotten
lose
and
meander
right
back
into
hungary
have
this
happen
to
us
too
who
be
there
the
man
repeat
we
hesitantly
picked
our
self
up
from
the
ground
and
force
ourselves
to
approach
when
he
saw
us
he
smile
a
big
warm
smile
and
say
relax
you
be
in
austria
for
a
moment
my
mind
go
blank
then
i
start
breathing
again
almost
pant
with
relief
my
clothes
be
suddenly
drench
with
sweat
he
invite
us
into
his
house
and
serve
us
each
a
shot
of
slivovitz
a
plum
brandy
then
he
told
us
what
would
happen
next
austrian
gendarme
patrol
the
area
regularly
they
would
soon
be
by
and
would
take
us
to
the
village
schoolhouse
for
the
rest
of
the
night
sure
enough
the
gendarme
soon
appear
we
have
be
walk
all
day
and
half
of
the
night
but
we
wearily
get
to
our
foot
and
start
walk
once
again
after
half
an
hour
or
so
we
get
to
the
village
with
the
schoolhouse
the
bench
in
the

do
not
take
long
to
find
my
father
friend
business
associate
however
his
reaction
be
not
at
all
what
we
anticipate
while
all
the
stranger
we
have
encounter
up
to
that
point
have
be
helpful
and
encourage
this
man

quite
clearly

father
friend
have
write

could
put
us
up
for
the
night
in
a
boardinghouse
he
say
but
beyond
that
we
have
to
find
our
own
way
he
told
us
how
to
get
the
gray
card
which
would
enable
us
to
ride
the
streetcar
for
free
and
told
us
about
various
refugee
organization
that
might
take
care
of
us
then
he
give
us
a
sandwich
take
us
to
the
boardinghouse
a
few
block
away
make
the
arrangement
and
left
despite
his
sour
attitude
he
book
us
each
our
own
room
after
our
experience
of
the
last
two
night
the
room
seem
incredibly
luxurious
there
be
a
bed
with
a
thick
comforter
frilly
curtain
on
the
window
that
look
out
onto
a
busy
viennese
street
and
a
sink
with
a
bar
of
soap
my
first
priority
be
to
clean
up
i
undressed
take
off
my
underwear
and
my
sock
wash
them
out
in
the
sink
and
hung
them
up
to
dry
then
i
wash
myself
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
sink
when
i
finish
i
be
reasonably
clean
except
for
the
mud
that
be
caked
on
my
corduroy
pant
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
look
around
at
what
would
be
my
home
for
the
night
and
thought
i
would
be
ecstatic
to
settle
in
a
place
like
this
and
go
to
the
university
if
i
could
just
do
that
it
would
be
more
than
i
could
possibly
want
but
the
daydream
do
not
last
very
long
we
have
to
acquire
the
all
important
gray
card
the
gray
card
be
the
identification
card
give
out
by
the
austrian
authority
to
hungarian
refugee
we
hardly
need
identification
because
hungarian
refugee
be
all
distinguish
by
dirt
cover
clothes
from
the
border
cross
but
the
gray
card
entitle
us
to
the
most
important
privilege
of
all
free
travel
on
the
tram
and
travel
be
a
must
i
stood
for
five
long
hour
in
a
long
slowly
move
line

hungarian
mainly
young
men
but
also
family
with
young
child
they
be
all
mud
splatter
and
look
tire
and
confuse
everyone
kept
ask
all
the
stranger
around
them
for
tip
and
advice
i
quickly
found
out
that
the
key
thing
be
to
register
at
every
relief
organization
that
one
could
reasonably
apply
to
for
help
i
register

be
the
nickname
for

its
ini
tials

combination
of
english
and
a
few
word
of
german
i
be
able
to
ask
direction
and
the
gray
card
allow
me
to
get
from
one
place
to
another
without
too
much
trouble
there
be
line
everywhere
some
of
these
relief
organization
give
us
food
voucher
others
give
us
little
package
of
toiletry
and
some
secondhand
clothes
and
most
important
some
give
us
voucher
for
place
to
stay
i
get
a
voucher
for
a
studentenheim

youth
hostel

be
in
the
outskirt
of

the
purpose
we
would
be
bunk

barely
adequate
toilet
facility
but
i
be
very
glad
to
get
in

so
scarce
i
heard
that
some
hungarian

put
up
by
kindly
policeman
in
the
city
jail
because
there
be

chilly

finally
make
my
way
inside

her

the
only
address

have
be
the
one

no
more
room
they
pepper
me
with
question
about
my
parent
and
manci
and
about
the
situation
in
budapest
then
they
fed
me
a
fantastic
meal
it
be
a
genuine
hungarian
meal
the
first
that
i
would
have

week
what
with

really
good
home
cooked
meal
since

put
out
a
bowl
of
orange
and
banana
to
me
these
be
incredible
delicacy
i
have
have
orange
no
more
than
two
or
three
time
in
my
life
i
love
them
banana
on
the
other
hand
i
have
never
encounter
viktor
wife
have
to
show
me
how
to
peel
them
i
eyed
them
with
some
suspicion
but
when
i
bit
into
them
i
love
them
too
i
be
off
to
a
good
start
in
the
west
viktor
have
a
ten
year
old
son
who
star
at
me
with
great
curiosity
he
spoke
hungarian
pretty
well
and
we
get
into
a
big
discussion
about
what
he
plan
to
be
when
he
grow
up
i
told
him
that
i
be
study
chemistry
and
explain
what
chemistry
be
about
viktor
overheard
our
conversation
he
offer
to
write
to
a
friend
of
his
who
be
associate
with
a
university
in
england
to
see
if
he
could
get
me
a
scholarship
i
be
grateful
for
the
offer
but
when
i
thought
of
england
it
struck
me
that
it
be
not
far
enough
now
that
i
have
escape
i
want
to
get
as
far
away
from
hungary
and
even
from
europe
as
i
could
afterward
i
go
back
to
the
studentenheim
and
write
a
letter
to
my
parent
i
do
not
address
the
letter
to
them
however
i
suspect
that
their
mail
might
be
watch
because
i
figure
that
by
now
it
would
be
know
that
their
son
have
escape
illegally
instead
i
address
the
letter
to
manci
and
in
a
bit
of
a
code
language
ask
her
to
share
my
story
with
her
nephew
meaning
my
father
i
make
sure
that
my
letter
be
resolutely
nonpolitical
i
confine
my
comment
strictly
to
describe
my
arrival
and
what
i
have
do
so
far
my
reception
by
the
surly
man
who
put
me
up
at
the
pension
and
my
warm
welcome
from
viktor
i
say
i
have
contact
lenke
and
be
wait
for
an
answer
and
that
i
would
write
again
soon
then
i
go
out
bought
a
stamp
at
a
corner
store
and
mail
the
letter
over
the
next
few
week
i
continued
to
spend
most
of
my
time
stand
in
line
to
see
if
my
case
have
move
forward
at
either
the
refugee
organization
or
at
the

many
ping
pong
ball
bounce
around
independently
of

other
when
i
be
not
stand

take
the
opportunity

be
fabulous
unlike

clean
people
be
well

and
friendly
to
my
utter
amazement
even
the

be
friendly
a
stun
contrast
to
any
expectation
i
have
of
someone
in
uniform
they
greet
us
hungarian
on
the
street
with
a
smile
and
be

struggle
with
language
barrier
to
give
us
direction
when
we
be
lose
which
be
often
in
fact
one
off

policeman
walk
about
twenty
minute
out
of
his
way
to
make

destination
then
wait
until
he
be
sure
i
have
found
the
right
address
vienna
dealt
me
only
one
disappointment
as
the
day
go
on
i
discover
i
could
buy
cheap
stand
room
ticket
to
the
vienna
staatsoper
i
saw
three
opera
fidelio
don
carlo
and
the
magic
flute
the
performance
be
good
but
i
thought
they
be
not
as
good
as
their
hungarian
counterpart
the
other
standee
be
intrigue
by
my
presence
i
suppose
i
be
easy
to
spot
as
a
refugee
since
despite
my
best
effort
my
clothes
be
still
mud
stain
even
the
pant
i
have
worn
underneath
my
corduroy
they
be
friendly
though
and
we
manage
to
have
a
rudimentary
conversation
in
a
mixture
of
german
and
english
intersperse
with
lot
of
pantomime
compare
the
opera
here
to
the
opera
in
hungary
one
of
the
people
i
chat
with
be
a
cute
girl
we
walk
out
of
the
performance
together
but
then
she
say
good
bye
i
trudge
back
to
the
hostel
a
little
sad
i
visit
viktor
and
his
family
often
their
house
be
like
a
home
away
from
home
to
me
on
one
of
my
visit
he
greet
me
happily
wave
a
telegram
it
be
from
lenke
her
answer
could
not
have
be
warmer
she
say
that
she
and
lajos
be
look
forward
to
my
become
another
son
to
them
and
add
that
their
young
son
have
put
my
frame
picture
on
his
desk
in
anticipation
of
his
brother
arrival
i
be
greatly
relieve
i
have
a
place
to
go
if
i
could
just
get
there
one
day
a
notice
be
post
on
the
bulletin
board
at
my
hostel
representative
from
one
of
the
refugee
organization
where
i
have
register
the
international
rescue
committee
be
come
the
next
afternoon
to
interview
refugee
who
want
to
go
to
the
united
state
i
sign
up
and
eagerly
await
their
arrival
the
next
day
a
group
of
young
american
arrive
i
be
surprised
by
how
young
they
all
be
they
could
easily
have
be
fellow
student
of
mine
at
the
university
they
set
up
a
long
table
in
one
of
the
room
and
begin
to
interview
the
line
of
candidate
who
have
sign
up
each
candidate
be
interviewed
by
the
whole
group
when
my
turn
come
they
be
surprised
that
i
be
able
to
conduct
my
interview
in
english
and
to
my
happiness
i
saw
one
of
the
interviewer
jot
on
my
file
good
english
then
the
question
move
to
my
activity
during
the
revolution
they
ask
me
if
i
have
fought
i
say
no
i
have
participate
in
some
demonstration
but
i
have
not
fought
they
look
at
each
other
and
at
me
with
surprise
everyone
else
whom
they
talk
with
have
fought
they
say
why
have
not
i
i
do
not
know
what
to
reply
i
have
my
doubt
about
the
others
claim
a
sarcastic
thought
come
to
mind
if
all
of
those
people
have
fought
we
would
have
won
and
i
would
not
be
here
i
do
not
say
this
however
and
i
be
reluctant
to
fabricate
a
story
for
the
occasion
the
interview
soon
end
with
a
promise
that
the
next
day
they
would
announce
who
have
be
select
i
be
tense
i
knew
from
my
visit
to
the
consulate
that
there
be
a
quota
for
admission
to
the
united
state
and
that
request
for
admission
be
already
way
oversubscribed
by
the
time
i
get
back
to
the
hostel
the
next
day
after
the
usual
stint
of
stand
in
line
the
representative
from
the
irc
have
come
and
go
they
have
read
off
a
list
of
name
accord
to
people
who
heard
the
list
i
be
not
on
it
i
felt
as
if
someone
have
sock
me
in
the
stomach
then
my
heart
start
beating
so
hard
that
i
could
barely
breathe
where
be
the
irc
people
now
i
ask
someone
say
they
be
conduct
another
series
of
interview
at
a
school
some
distance
away
i
take
off
like
a
madman
i
ran
all
the
way
through
the
cold
dark
street
my
heavy
shoe
hurt
my
foot
as
i
ran
but
i
do
not
care
sweat
be
pour
down
my
face
by
the
time
i
reach
the
school
there
be
a
familiar
long
line
of
people
wait
to
be
interviewed
i
do
not
wait
as
the
next
person
emerge
from
the
interview
room
i
brush
past
the
person
whose
turn
it
be
suppose
to
be
and
push
in
to
stand
in
front
of
the
table
the
irc
representative
be
a
different
group
of
student
than
the
one
who
have
interviewed
me
the
day
before
they
star
up
at
me
blankly
i
do
not
give
them
time
to
say
anything
i
swipe
the
sweat
off
my
face
with
my
hand
and
still
pant
start
talk
in
english
as
fast
as
i
could
i
explain
that
i
have
be
interviewed
yesterday
that
i
be
not
select
but
that
i
really
really
want
to
go
to
the
united
state
one
of
the
interviewer
ask
me
why
i
told
him
i
have
relative
in
new
york
city
who
would
take
me
in
that
i
be
a
chemistry
student
that
i
thought
i
would
become
a
good
chemist
and
that
i
belong
in
the
united
state
the
word
pour
out
not
eloquently
or
coherently
but
i
talk
and
talk
as
if
i
could
overwhelm
their
objection
by
the
sheer
volume
of
my
word
i
almost
do
not
dare
to
stop
talk
but
finally
i
ran
out
of
thing
to
say
i
stood
there
pant
slightly
and
still
sweat
profusely
the
student
look
at
each
other
and
smile
then
one
say
okay

can
go
to
the
united
state
i
be
speechless
i
could
not
believe
my
good
fortune
i
want
to
hug
every
one
of
the
young
men
sit
on
the
other
side
of
the
long
table
they
give
me
a
voucher
for
lodge
at
another
student
hostel
in
the
outskirt
of
vienna
where
the
irc
sponsor
student
be
put
up
while
wait
for
the
paperwork
to
go
through
i
stutter
my
thanks
and
clutch
my
precious
voucher
back
out
of
the
room
and
left
the
cold
air
hit
me
on
the
face
i
be
still
sweat
but
now
it
be
from
relief
the
next
day
i
move
to
the
new
hostel
there
be
some
eighty
of
us
who
have
be
accepted
for
sponsorship
by
the
international
rescue
committee
a
lot
of
us
be
student
as
it
turn
out
move
to
the
hostel
be
an
important
step
but
only
one
step
in
the
process
we
have
to
go
to
the
u
s
consulate
to
fill
out
more
form
have
a
medical
exam
get
photograph
and
fill
out
still
more
form
then
we
wait
day
after
day
for
the
paper
to
clear
when
they
finally
do
we
have
to
wait
some
more
to
find
out
when
we
be
go
to
be
flown
to
the
united
state
i
spent
the
day
wash
my
clothes
get
my
few
belonging
packed
and
ready
then
unpack
them
then
pack
them
up
again
i
drop
by
viktor
house
whenever
i
could
i
be
still
tense
with
anticipation
but
i
be
immensely
happy
to
have
gotten
this
far
it
occur
to
me
that
my
father
insistence
ten
year
earlier
that
i
study
english
be
a
critical
ingredient
in
my
good
luck
in
my
next
letter
home
i
make
sure
to
thank
him
the
notification

come
we
be
go
to
leave
the
next
day
however
instead
of
go
by
airplane
we
would
take
a
train
to
germany
that
would
take
us
to
a
ship
that
would
then
take
us
to
the
united
state
i
be
disappointed
everyone
i
knew
who
left
for
the
united
state
have
go
by
plane
the
process
be
go
to
take
a
whole
lot
longer
than
i
have
anticipate
still
i
be
glad
to
get
move
in
the
right
direction
i
take
the
opportunity
to
change
all
my
remain

into
american
dollar
it
come
out
to
the
next
morning

in
each
compartment
three
on
each
side
i
chose
a
middle
bunk
that
be
about
the
level
of
the
window
and
spent
the
time
look
out
at
the
winter
countryside
go
by
the
train
move
fast
but
it
still
take
hour
and
the
hour
go
by
excruciatingly
slowly
at
some
point
we
stop
it
be
the
german
border
uniformed
border
guard
go
from
car
to
car
look
at
all
of
our
paper
it
be
the
first
time
i
have
see
a
german
officer
since
the
war
their
cap
be
peaked
in
much
the
same
style
as
i
remember
the
cap
of
german
officer
from
wartime
my
mouth
be
dry
they
take
my
paper
look
at
them
salute
then
give
them
back
and
go
on
but
i
continued
to
feel
tense
the
tension
do
not
leave
me
until
we
get
to
the
first
stop
in
germany
the
city
of
passau
german
student
line
the
platform
cheer
us
exuberantly
and
offering
us
hot
chocolate
coffee
sweet
and
cake
they
be
kid
like

just
well

broke
the
ice
after
passau
the
train
go
at
a
good
clip
it
be
dark
outside
so
all
i
could
see
be
occasional
light
i
could
not
sleep
i
be
overwhelmed
by
the
momentousness
of
what
be
happen
to
me
i
be
truly
in
the
west
every
hour
i
be
farther
from
my
birthplace
my
family
my
world
head
toward
america
the
thought
hit
me
after
all
the
year
of
pretend
to
believe
thing
that
i
do
not
of
act
the
part
of
someone
i
be
not
maybe
i
would
never
have
to
pretend
again
the
train
go
on
and
i
finally
fell
asleep
as
we
near
land
the
ship
stop
heave
and
gradually
all
the
hungarian
regain
their
equilibrium
and
come
up
on
deck
we
stood
in
silence
and
just
star
i
thought
these
house
have
never
heard
bomb
or
artillery
not
ever
i
marvel
at
this
louis
lanouette
chapter
fourteen
aboard
ship
iwoke
up
when
the
train
stop
it
be
dawn
we
be
at
a
port
through
the
window
i
could
see
a
nondescript
gray
ship
at
the
far
end
of
the
platform
the
ship
name
be
general
w
g
haan
i
look
at
it
with
excitement
it
be
go
to
take
me
to
america
we
be
told
to
get
off
the
train
and
we
slowly
form
a
long
snake
line
to
the
gangplank
lead
to
the
ship
it
be
a
cold
damp
day
and
everything
the
ship
the
port
and
the
sky
be
shroud
in
shade
of
gray
there
be
a
strange
smell
in
the
air
i
realize
it
be
salt
water
it
be
the
first
time
that
i
have
ever
see
the
sea
it
be
not
particularly
beautiful
it
too
be
a
mass
of
gray
the
smell
however
be
mysterious
excite
and
wonderful
despite
the
early
hour
a
military
band
have
assemble
and
be
play
the
hungarian
national
anthem
but
rather
than
play
it
with
the
measure
solemnity
that
we
be
use
to
they
played
it
like
a
military
march
the
brisk
pace
of
the
music
contrast
with
the
slow
movement
of
the
line
as
we
shuffle
toward
the
gangplank
each
of
us
have
be
give
a
little
name
tag
with
our
name
and
a
number
on
it
we
be
told
to
affix
it
with
a
string
to
a
button
on
our
overcoat
as
we
reach
the
bottom
of
the
gangplank
one
sailor
look
at
the
tag
and
read
the
number
out
loud
in
english
another
sailor
make
a
note
of
it
in
a
ledger
oddly
instead
of
reading
the
entire
number
as
a
single
unit
the
sailor
read
it
digit
by
digit
one
seven
oh
seven
and
so
forth
i
wonder
if
perhaps
american
do
not
know
their
number
and
have
to
break
them
up
into
individual
digit
and
i
wonder
if
oh
be
the
same
as
zero
the
general
w
g
haan
have
be
use
as
a
troop
carrier
during
world
war
ii
and
be
very
spartan
we
be
lead
down
metal
stairway
deep
into
the
bowel
of
the
ship
to
large
enclosure
fill
with
hammock
suspend
four
deep
from
the
ceiling
i
take
a
hammock
second
from
the
bottom
the
hammock
be
very
close
to
each
other
when
we
be
all
lie
in
them
there
be
perhaps
twelve
inch
between
my
nose
and
the
bottom
of
the
hammock
above
me
sit
up
be
out
of
the
question
in
fact
sit
anywhere
be
not
something
i
be
go
to
have
much
opportunity
to
do
on
this
trip
the
recreation
room
have
table
securely
fix
to
the
wall
but
no
chair
a
sign
be
stencil
above
the
table
do
not
sit
on
the
table
someone
have
pencil
in
an
h
after
the
s
of
course
the
humor
of
this
be
lose
on
most
of
the
passenger
very
few
of
whom
knew
english
the
only
place
you
could
sit
be
in
the
toilet
which
be
row
of
stall
with
no
door
or
in
the
din
hall
where
everything
be
bolt
to
the
floor
include
the
very
narrow
bench
around
the
table
i
soon
found
out
the
necessity
of
these
arrangement
it
take
most
of
the
day
to
get
us
settle
in
in
the
afternoon
the
ship
finally
pull
in
the
gangplank
and
we
left
slowly
ger
many
recede
most
of
us
be
on
deck
look
back
as
the
continent
where
we
grow
up
disappear
nobody
say
much
as
we
move
out
into
open
water
the
ship
start
to
sway
from
side
to
side
some
people
get
seasick
refugee
clung
to
the
railing
on
deck
and
threw
up
over
the
side
or
they
huddle
miserably
in
their
hammock
down
below
luckily
the
sway
have
no
effect
on
me
in
fact
i
kind
of
enjoy
it
i
take
the
opportunity
to
roam
the
ship
from
front
to
back
and
top
to
bottom
explore
every
nook
and
cranny
and
marvel
at
the
enormous
polished
wheel
and
piston
in
the
engine
room
the
next
morning
i
notice
a
gathering
of
people
on
one
side
of
the
deck
they
be
star
at
something
white
in
the
distance
somebody
say
it
be
dover
the
thought
struck
me
i
be
look
at
england
the
momentousness
of
everything
suddenly
hit
me
leave
hungary
travel
through
germany
see
the
sea
for
the
first
time
see
england
each
event
by
itself
would
have
be
unthinkable
just
a
couple
of
week
ago
now
they
be
happen
in
quick
succession
i
be
overwhelmed
even
as
i
watch
england
slip
out
of
sight
soon
we
be
out
in
the
open
atlantic
the
ship
start
to
act
differently
in
addition
to
sway
from
side
to
side
it
now
acquire
an
up
and
down
motion
as
we
head
into
big
swell
most
of
those
who
be
not
already
seasick
get
seasick
now
in
just
a
couple
of
hour
the
ship
look
like
a
hospital
ward
i
still
felt
fine
i
tramped
all
over
the
ship
it
be
like
be
in
a
funhouse
at
an
amusement
park
i
have
to
watch
out
for
door
suddenly
swing
open
and
slam
on
me
and
i
have
to
hang
on
for
dear
life
on
the
staircase
drinking
out
of
a
water
fountain
become
a
real
challenge
the
water
flow
would
disappear
one
minute
and
shoot
six
foot
in
the
air
in
the
next
the
stench
down
below
be
unbearable
so
i
spent
most
of
the
time
up
on
deck
i
be
bundle
up
to
my
nose
against
the
cold
but
i
enjoy
the
air
and
the
motion
food
be
plentiful
but
it
be
different
from
what
i
be
use
to
the
coffee
we
get
be
make
from
real
coffee
bean
in
hungary
coffee
be
make
from
ground
roast
hickory
nut
since
coffee
be
not
produce
in
any
of
the
communist
bloc
country
we
do
not
have
it
real
coffee
taste
very
good
before
leave
hungary
i
have
eat
orange
only
two
or
three
time
on
board
the
ship
orange
juice
come
with
breakfast
along
with
half
a
grapefruit
much
as
i
love
orange
i
quickly
discover
that
i
could
not
stand
grapefruit
the
rest
of
breakfast
be
inevitably
scramble
egg
with
fry
bacon
the
smell
of
the
bacon
permeate
the
air
even
on
the
deck
as
it
come
up
through
the
air
vent
i
grow
to
associate
the
smell
of
bacon
with
the
smell
of
vomit
and
i
hurry
through
breakfast
just
to
get
it
out
of
my
nose
as
the
ship
swayed
and
heave
up
and
down
eat
also
become
an
increasingly
difficult
physical
task
there
be
little
railing
on
the
table
to
keep
the
food
tray
from
slide
into
our
lap
but
they
do
not
keep
them
from
slide
sideways
you
have
your
choice
of
try
to
steady
your
tray
or
hang
on
for
dear
life
to
the
table
or
to
the
narrow
bench
that
fortunately
be
firmly
fix
to
the
floor
the
tray
usually
lose
it
be
a
good
thing
there
be
not
too
many
people
in
the
din
hall
after
a
while
i
found
i
could
socialize
with
member
of
the
crew
i
start
to
hang
around
them
just
to
practice
my
english
this
lead
to
a
real
job
somebody
approach
me
with
a
white
helmet
that
have
the
letter
mp
paint
on
it
and
ask
if
i
would
be
willing
to
stand
guard
at
the
crew
quarter
to
keep
people
away
so
the
night
crew
could
sleep
during
the
day
i
eagerly
accepted
besides
feel
terribly
important
with
the
mp
helmet
on
my
head
i
have
a
legitimate
reason
to
camp
out
at
the
crew
quarter
in
hungary
i
have
see
black
or
asian
people
only
in
the
movie
but
the
crew
here
consist
of
white
people
and
black
people
and
in
between
people
who
be
neither
black
nor
white
but
have
unusual
facial
feature
i
later
found
out
they
be
filipino
the
crew
member
be
all
glad
to
chat
with
me
but
i
have
a
hard
time
understand
them
it
seem
as
if
they
be
talk
with
their
mouth
close
many
of
them
chewed
gum
incessantly
which
do
not
help
either
i
make
friend
with
two
crew
member
in
particular
one
be
a
wiry
dark
face
fellow
i
found
out
he
be
puerto
rican
the
other
be
a
husky
white
man
of
italian
extraction
the
puerto
rican
be
a
typist
for
the
ship
office
the
italian
be
a
mechanic
his
real
job
be
work
in
a
shipyard
but
he
have
decide
to
come
to
sea
so
he
could
see
more
of
the
world
both
of
them
live
in
brooklyn
which
i
found
out
be
near
new
york
they
take
me
under
their
wing
and
start
to
tutor
me
in
the
american
way
of
speak
english
they
could
understand
everything
i
say
i
could
not
understand
anything
they
say
it
take
me
several
day
to
figure
out
that
what
sound
like
a
single
syllable
stood
for
that
be
right
and
represent
agreement
it
seem
as
though
they
say
it
in
every
sentence
they
also
say
yeah
instead
of
yes
which
confuse
me
because
i
thought
they
borrow
that
from
the
german
ja
the
crew
quarter
be
at
the
stern
of
the
ship
which
be
my
favorite
spot
to
ride
the
wave
when
my
friend
be
not
around
i
like
to
sit
on
a
coil
of
rope
near
the
rail
as
the
ship
swoop
over
the
unending
swell
the
stern
go
up
and
down
and
my
seat
in
the
rope
coil
be
like
an
amusement
park
ride
i
be
practically
weightless
on
the
way
down
so
much
so
that
i
have
to
hang
on
to
the
rail
so
i
would
not
fly
out
then
i
would
feel
the
cold
rope
slam
into
my
rear
end
as
the
stern
kick
upward
i
love
this
ride
and
i
love
watch
the
wake
that
the
ship
left
behind
the
cold
notwithstanding
it
be
almost
hypnotic
my
new
friend
explain
to
me
that
this
ship
be
one
of
many
that
have
be
built
after
the
war
for
the
sole
purpose
of
bring
the
troop
home
from
england
it
seem
incredible
to
me
that
ship
would
be
built
for
just
one
purpose
but
they
assure
me
that
this
be
the
case
they
also
assure
me
that
the
ship
be
safe
which
be
get
increasingly
difficult
to
believe
as
the
wave
grow
big
and
big
and
the
ship
hardly
seem
to
make
any
forward
progress
it
be
just
climb
the
wave
and
slide
down
them
again
and
again
it
turn
out
we
be
in
a
major
storm
after
some
day
of
stall
progress
my
friend
told
me
we
be
alter
our
course
and
take
a
southern
route
to
try
to
get
out
of
the
storm
path
for
a
while
it
work
and
the
weather
get
well
then
we
encounter
more
storm
the
cross
be
originally
suppose
to
take
about
a
week
but
the
arrival
date
be
delayed
and
delayed
again
altogether
it
be
delayed
three
time
as
a
result
of
the
storm
and
the
longer
path
in
the
end
the
trip
take
two
week
there
be
not
much
to
occupy
us
during
the
trip
one
day
some
official
look
people
set
up
some
table
in
one
of
the
recreation
hall
and
interviewed
each
of
us
one
at
a
time
when
my
turn
come
they
ask
me
who
i
be
what
have
i
do
in
hungary
and
what
i
intend
to
do
in
america
then
they
ask
lot
of
question
about
the
revolution
and
its
aftermath
they
too
ask
whether
i
have
fought
in
the
revolution
once
again
i
told
them
i
have
not
these
people
be
as
surprised
as
the
irc
people
like
the
irc
people
they
told
me
that
i
be
the
first
person
in
all
of
their
interview
on
the
ship
to
say
that
i
have
not
fought
once
again
i
do
not
comment
another
day
we
be
all
told
to
line
up
to
get
shot
i
do
not
know
what
the
shot
be
for
but
i
line
up
along
with
the
rest
of
the
passenger
there
be
two
station
one
man
by
a
young
white
doctor
the
other
by
a
black
doctor
i
have
learn
that
there
be
a
lot
of
prejudice
against
black
in
america
i
quickly
calculate
that
the
black
man
must
be
really
good
to
have
become
a
doctor
so
i
chose
to
get
my
shot
from
him
whether
i
compute
rightly
or
not
the
shot
do
not
hurt
the
storm
the
delay
and
the
boredom
get
on
the
nerve
of
many
of
the
hungarian
anti
semitic
comment
start
to
be
heard
there
be
a
number
of
orthodox
jew
among
the
refugee
who
dress
in
their
idiosyncratic
way
and
kept
to
themselves
they
be
target
of
derisive
comment
but
soon
so
be
the
rest
of
the
jew
on
the
ship
one
of
the
men
who
bunk
near
me
say
you
jew
all
have
it
make
you
speak
english
you
have
get
rich
relative
in
america
the
rest
of
us
will
be
in
deep
trouble
then
he
pull
out
a
hunt
knife
and
start
sharpen
it
in
front
of
my
nose
an
american
minister
of
hungarian
descent
have
travel
to
austria
to
accompany
the
refugee
back
to
the
united
state
enough
such
incident
take
place
that
he
call
a
gathering
of
all
the
christian
refugee
he
give
a
sermon
and
told
them
that
as
we
enter
a
new
world
old
hatred
and
prejudice
need
to
be
left
behind
the
guy
with
the
knife
grumble
about
this
too
how
can
he
say
such
a
thing
he
say
about
the
minister
i
hate
whoever
i
want
to
hate
and
i
will
not
change
there
be
an
american
rabbi
on
board
as
well
i
notice
that
the
minister
and
the
rabbi
often
talk
together
and
seem
to
be
close
friend
i
take
that
as
a
good
omen
meanwhile
i
stayed
away
from
the
other
hungarian
as
much
as
i
could
my
mp
duty
be
a
real
blessing
one
day
to
break
the
monotony
the
authority
arrange
for
the
hungarian
woman
to
take
over
the
kitchen
they
cooked
a
meal
with
lot
of
paprika
and
seasoning
this
briefly
cheer
everyone
up
and
temporarily
change
the
smell
in
the
air
for
the
well
but
it
do
not
last
very
long
the
next
day
we
be
back
to
ordinary
food
which
as
the
day
go
on
and
on
become
more
and
more
dreary
it
get
to
the
point
where
i
welcome
any
change
in
the
menu
one
day
at
lunch
they
serve
a
dessert
of
vanilla
pudding
i
have
love
vanilla
pudding
at
home
and
eagerly
go
back
for
second
big
mistake
half
an
hour
later
my
stomach
start
to
act
up
and
shortly
after
that
i
be
draped
over
the
railing
throw
up
into
the
atlantic
ocean
i
stayed
away
from
vanilla
pudding
or
anything
else
unusual
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
and
my
stomach
behave
on
new
year
eve
the
crew
put
on
entertainment
for
us
they
played
jazz
record
and
start
dance
with
each
other
i
be
particularly
impressed
by
the
black
crew
member
who
clearly
dance
more
energetically
and
gracefully
than
the
others
some
hungarian
join
them
but
they
be
very
awkward
by
comparison
finally
after
four
storm
and
three
reschedule
arrival
date
we
arrive
in
what
we
be
told
be
brooklyn
as
we
near
land
the
ship
stop
heave
and
gradually
all
the
hungarian
regain
their
equilibrium
and
come
up
on
deck
it
be
even
and
the
light
of
the
city
be
shin
we
could
see
the
headlight
of
move
car
and
street
lamp
and
light
in
the
window
of
house
we
be
look
for
the
statue
of
liberty
but
we
could
not
see
it
i
wonder
why
we
stood
in
silence
and
just
star
i
thought
these
house
have
not
heard
bomb
or
artillery
not
ever
i
marvel
at
this
we
have
be
told
to
prepare
to
disembark
in
the
morning
i
gather
my
thing
return
my
mp
hat
and
say
good
bye
to
my
two
friend
we
exchange
address
and
the
italian
fellow
promise
that
he
would
look
me
up
at
my
uncle
place
and
invite
me
home
for
dinner
on
shore
a
military
band
be
wait
for
us
play
jazz
after
a
while
they
switch
to
a
few
bar
of
the
hungarian
national
anthem
follow
by
another
serious
sound
piece
which
i
figure
might
be
the
national
anthem
of
america
none
of
us
paid
much
attention
to
it
we
be
silent
and
tense
we
begin
to
disembark
luggage
in
hand
filing
off
the
ship
to
a
big
warehouse
our
luggage
be
take
from
us
and
sent
toward
official
on
a
conveyor
belt
i
have
never
see
such
a
contraption
before
i
wonder
if
america
be
so
advanced
that
it
be
use
machinery
to
make
even
trivial
physical
work
obsolete
the
custom
agent
be
look
for
only
one
thing
hungarian
salami
a
lot
of
hungarian
brought
some
with
them
from
hungary
or
vienna
have
be
told
that
it
be
a
precious
item
in
the
united
state
unfortunately
hungarian
salami
have
a
characteristic
smell
the
agent
unerringly
pull
out
log
of
salami
from
bag
after
bag
and
with
a
friendly
smile
confiscate
them
we
gather
our
luggage
and
pile
onto
bus
we
be
told
we
be
go
to
camp
kilmer
an
old
prisoner
of
war
camp
in
new
jersey
none
of
us
be
pleased
about
be
take
to
a
camp
let
alone
a
prisoner
of
war
camp
we
be
told
this
would
be
for
just
a
few
day
but
it
still
seem
like
a
step
in
the
wrong
direction
my
first
impression
of
the
united
state
be
not
very
good
even
though
it
be
midmorning
there
be
not
a
single
person
in
sight
all
i
could
see
be
car
park
in
an
unending
line
on
both
side
of
the
street
i
would
never
see
that
many
car
in
my
life
i
wonder
where
all
the
people
who
drove
those
car
be
because
nobody
be
in
evidence
the
street
and
the
building
be
ugly
the
building
be
peculiar
too
they
have
metal
stairway
attach
to
the
front
lead
down
to
the
first
story
level
and
then
stop
in
midair
none
of
us
could
figure
out
what
they
be
for
i
do
notice
that
every
building
have
a
television
antenna
on
the
roof
car
ugly
street
tv
antenna
and
no
people
america
be
a
strange
place
the
bus
suddenly
swoop
into
a
tunnel
the
tunnel
be
brightly
lit
and
line
with
gleam
white
tile
it
go
on
for
a
long
long
way
which
impressed
us
there
be
tunnel
in
hungary
too
but
they
be
very
short
by
comparison
on
the
other
side
of
the
tunnel
we
drove
along
a
road
that
be
elevate
above
a
gray
marshland
extend
as
far
as
i
could
see
in
both
direction
it
be
depress
we
star
at
it
in
silence
until
a
voice
from
the
back
say
this
ca
not
be
true
it
be
get
to
be
communist
propaganda
eventually
we
arrive
at
camp
kilmer
the
camp
consist
of
row
of
plain
wooden
barrack
inside
though
they
be
surprisingly
clean
neat
and
comfortable
with
only
four
bed
to
a
room
a
luxury
after
the
ship
and
the
crowd
refugee
hostel
in
vienna
as
we
be
assign
our
room
we
be
hand
a
package
of
razor
blade
and
toothbrush
and
toiletry
i
guess
we
all
look
as
though
we
could
use
them
i
have
give
up
shave
on
the
ship
the
constant
heave
motion
have
make
it
almost
suicidal
to
try
so
notwithstanding
the
profusion
of
razor
blade
that
have
be
shower
on
us
by
various
refugee
agency
in
vienna
i
and
most
of
the
other
men
have
heavy
duty
stubble
i
thought
that
i
could
open
a
drugstore
with
all
the
toiletry
i
have
be
give
as
a
refugee
we
be
told
we
would
be
process
in
a
few
day
and
then
would
be
free
to
leave
meanwhile
there
be
still
more
interview
and
paperwork
as
i
be
wait
my
turn
for
one
of
these
interview

notice
a
black
soldier

at
a
desk
with
a
phone
in
front
of
him
i
go
over
and
ask
if
he
would
help
me
make
a
phone
call
to
new
york
city
he
look
at
me
with
amusement
and
ask
whom
i
want
to
call
i
say
i
want
to
tell
my
uncle
that
i
would
arrive
he
say

why
not
with
a
big
smile
i
whip
out
the
phone
number
it
start
with
the
word
kingsbridge
and
i
watch
him
dial
ki
and
then

be
jumping
with
joy
at
the
prospect
of

funny
but
he

unlike
the
television
i
have
never
even
heard
of
it
when
i
first
put
some
garbage
down
its
chute
the
strange
strong
draft
that
hit
me
when
i
open
the
door
actually
scar
me
while
i
be
luxuriate
in
the
bath
the
phone
rang
i
heard
lajos
speak
in
excite
hungarian
then
heard
him
say
your
son
be
here
i
be
in
shock
moment
later
he
open
the
door
and
say
come
quickly
it
be
your
parent
i
jumped
out
of
the
bathtub
wrap
myself
in
a
towel
and
ran
for
the
phone
my
parent
have
manage
to
beg
their
way
to
an
international
connection
which
be
very
difficult
to
get
we
heard
each
other
voice
for
the
first
time
since
i
would
left
my
mother
be
breathing
quickly
and
i
be
so
excite
that
i
could
barely
speak
our
incoherence
be
further
by
the
fact
that
my
parent
have
to
huddle
around
the
one
telephone
receiver
we
have
so
neither
one
could
hear
me
very
well
i
have
to
repeat
myself
quite
a
bit
we
finally
calm
down
enough
to
talk
clearly
after
assure
my
parent
that
i
really
be
all
right
and
hearing
their
reassurance
in
turn
the
conversation
turn
to
day
to
day
detail
i
ask
my
mother
to
pack
up
some
of
my
chemistry
textbook
and
mail
them
to
me
she
agree
then
sheepishly
confess
that
she
have
dispose
of
my
treasure
stockpile
of
chemical
i
ask
her
how
after
a
moment
pause
she
say
she
have
flush
them
down
the
toilet
horror
flash
in
front
of
my
eye
depend
on
the
order
in
which
she
have
dumped
them
down
the
toilet
the
process
could
lead
to
disaster
sure
enough
my
mother
add
i
probably
should
not
have
do
that
the
combination
of
chemical
have
overheat
the
water
and
the
toilet
bowl
have
crack
the
minute
clicked
away
and
we
have
to
finish
the
conversation
we
promise
that
we
would
write
to
each
other
in
detail
i
have
be
write
a
diarylike
letter
on
board
the
ship
which
i
fig
ured
i
would
send
to
manci
my
parent
assure
me
that
no
harm
would
come
from
send
letter
directly
to
them
my
excitement
last
long
after
the
conversation
end
lenke
have
return
home
from
work
by
now
and
she
and
lajos
make
me
repeat
the
conversation
several
time
discuss
every
detail
while
i
celebrate
my
arrival
by
snack
myself
to
the
point
of
indigestion
in
anticipation
of
my
arrival
they
have
load
up
the
refrigerator
with
a
variety
of
food
i
particularly
like
chocolate
wafer
stick
wash
down
with
orange
juice
the
novelty
of
orange
be
still
strong
although
she
be
manci
sister
lenke
do
not
look
like
manci
at
all
she
look
like
their
mother
who
have
die
before
the
war
and
whose
picture
i
have
see
at
manci
house
lenke
be
an
exceptionally
warm
person
she
be
determine
to
become
a
substitute
mother
to
me
and
assume
this
role
with
so
much
enthusiasm
that
it
work
from
the
moment
i
met
her
i
felt
at
home
there
be
yet
another
treat
in
store
my
parent
have
be
write
to
me
in
care
of
lajos
and
lenke
before
my
arrival
and
there
be
a
pile
of
letter
wait
for
me
i
eagerly
settle
down
to
read
them
the
tone
of
their
letter
be
worry
worry
worry
about
everything
have
i
arrive
safely
in
the
united
state
be
i
eat
be
i
sleep
be
i
able
to
understand
people
do
they
understand
me
would
i
get
into
a
university
and
on
and
on
and
on
i
figure
that
the
only
way
i
could
make
them
stop
worry
be
to
let
them
know
everything
that
be
happen
to
me
i
write
a
very
detailed
addition
to
my
ongoing
letter
that
brought
them
up
to
date
with
our
phone
conversation
lajos
agree
to
mail
the
thick
wad
of
scribble
cover
paper
for
me
lajos
take
the
next
day
off
from
work
and
devote
it
to
me
the
first
thing
he
do
early
in
the
morning
be
to
march
me
down
to
the
neighborhood
doctor
who
give
me
a
polio
shot
polio
be
a
scary
disease
there
be
polio
epidemic
every
summer
in
hungary
the
common
belief
be
that
the
disease
be
transmit
primarily
in
swim
pool
so
it
always
cast
a
shadow
over
my
trip
to
the
pool
i
have
not
even
know
that
there
be
a
vaccine
i
be
very
glad
to
receive
it
then
we
take
the
subway
to
visit
lenke
at
her
workplace
there
be
a
short
underground
tram
in
budapest
but
it
be
nothing
like
the
manhattan
subway
this
be
a
huge
network
deep
in
the
ground
i
be
impressed
by
the
complexity
of
the
construction
the
escalator
the
stair
the
tunnel
and
the
distance
the
subway
cover
but
i
do
not
like
the
noise
the
dirt
and
the
cramped
and
confine
atmosphere
my
expectation
of
a
big
city
subway
system
be
shape
by
picture
of
the
moscow
subway
which
be
spacious
bright
spank
clean
and
fill
with
statue
of
heroic
figure
the
loud
decrepit
tunnel
of
the
new
york
subway
give
me
an
uncomfortable
feel
remind
me
of
my
first
impression
of
the
city
from
the
window
of
the
bus
lenke
work
as
a
saleslady
in
a
department
store
in
the
middle
of
manhattan
when
we
surface
from
the
subway
i
stop
cold
i
be
surround
by
skyscraper
i
star
up
at
them
speechless
the
skyscraper
look
just
like
picture
of
america
all
of
a
sudden
i
be
gripped
by
the
stun
realization
that
i
truly
be
in
america
nothing
have
symbolize
america
more
to
me
than
skyscraper
now
i
be
stand
on
a
street
crane
my
neck
to
look
up
at
them
which
also
meant
that
i
be
an
incredible
distance
from
home
or
what
use
to
be
my
home
the
cacophony
of
the
traffic
fill
my
ear
mob
of
people
brush
past
me
the
perspective
make
me
feel
like
an
ant
in
the
bottom
of
a
canyon
i
suddenly
felt
very
very
insignificant
in
my
new
surroundings
lenke
excuse
herself
from
her
work
area
and
she
and
lajos
take
me
to
get
outfit
with
new
clothes
most
of
them
be
on
sale
but
all
be
new
they
be
good
clothes
they
fit
well
but
they
look
and
felt
somehow
different
they
felt
american
i
left
the
department
store
my
old
clothes
bundle
up
in
a
package
under
my
arm
it
occur
to
me
that
the
package
represent
my
past
neatly
wrap
and
tie
with
string
as
easy
to
discard
as
my
corduroy
i
kept
a
firm
grip
on
it
when
lajos
and
i
get
back
to
the
bronx
we
take
my
old
clothes
to
a
place
fill
with
wash
machine
for
a
few
coin
a
person
could
wash
his
clothes
while
he
wait
and
could
dry
them
too
then
we
head
home
lajos
automatically
turn
on
the
tv
as
soon
as
we
get
back
to
the
apartment
i
be
to
discover
that
the
tv
be
on
a
lot
much
of
the
time
lenke
lajos
and
paul
just
watch
it
out
of
the
corner
of
their
eye
at
first
i
found
it
distract
but
i
soon
just
treat
it
as
background
noise
lajos
rummage
for
a
copy
of
the
sunday
new
york
time
and
the
two
of
us
spread
the
classify
section
on
the
kitchen
table
lajos
say
that
the
many
little
item
there
advertised
job
opening
we
do
not
have
this
in
hungary
we
look
up
job
for
chemist
i
be
delighted
to
find
page
and
page
of
little
box
describe
different
position
for
chemist
most
of
them
seem
to
be
in
company
make
cosmetic
even
so
lajos
and
i
be
satisfied
that
my
chosen
profession
be
a
good
one
i
be
still
full
of
nervous
and
physical
energy
from
the
day
event
i
be
excite
about
everything
that
have
happen
and
scar
of
everything
and
nothing
in
particular
i
figure
i
would
calm
down
by
write
to
my
parent
about
my
late
experience
once
i
start
it
occur
to
me
that
i
would
never
know
if
all
of
my
letter
arrive
at
my
parent
home
they
might
be
unintentionally
lose
by
the
post
office
or
purposefully
waylaid
by
some
censor
because
of
their
american
postmark
for
the
same
reason
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
get
all
of
their
letter
i
devise
a
scheme
where
i
would
number
my
letter
and
suggest
that
my
parent
do
the
same
then
each
of
us
would
start
our
response
by
acknowledge
the
number
on
the
last
letter
we
have
receive
lajos
decide
to
use
that
weekend
to
introduce
me
to
the
wonder
of
new
york
we
take
the
subway
to
manhattan
again
lajos
lenke
and
paul
be
all
dress
up
as
be
i
wear
my
new
american
clothes
on
saturday
we
watch
a
cinerama
movie
which
played
on
a
huge
wide
screen
the
like
of
which
i
would
never
see
before
on
sunday
we
go
to
see
another
movie
and
the
rockettes
at
radio
city
music
hall
in
between
we
walk
around
manhattan
with
me
continue
to
gawk
at
the
skyscraper
and
the
crowd
sidewalk
i
be
astonish
by
the
display
of
wealth
the
store
window
all
look
fancy
beyond
belief
the
mannequin
in
the
window
beautiful
and
elegant
the
people
on
the
street
although
not
as
elegant
as
the
mannequin
still
seem
well
dress
but
what
really
impressed
me
be
the
number
of
big
car
driven
by
uniformed
chauffeur
i
watch
some
of
these
car
pull
up
in
front
of
a
store
the
chauffeur
run
around
to
open
the
door
for
the
occupant
in
the
rear
seat
it
look
like
a
communist
caricature
of
capitalism
come
to
life
we
go
to
a
horn
hardart
restaurant
the
arrangement
be
highly
unusual
instead
of
a
waiter
bring
you
a
menu
and
food
there
be
a
wall
of
little
glass
front
drawer
each
drawer
contain
a
different
dish
you
put
coin
in
a
slot
then
open
the
little
glass
door
to
get
your
plate
of
stew
or
pie
or
whatever
i
thought
the
food
be
bad
and
the
surroundings
unappetizing
but
i
do
not
say
anything
because
lajos
be
so
obviously
proud
of
it
the
next
day
use
my
newfound
knowledge
of
how
to
use
token
and
navigate
on
the
subway
i
take
off
on
an
expedition
of
my
own
in
manhattan
while
look
at
the
newspaper
i
notice
that
a
new
film
version
of
don
giovanni
be
play
in
a
manhattan
movie
theater
it
feature
cesare
siepi
a
legendary
singer
whom
i
would
heard
of
but
have
never
listen
to
i
have
to
go
lajos
give
me
money
for
the
token
and
the
movie
and
i
be
off
on
my
adventure
i
easily
found
my
way
to
the
subway
station
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
be
not
sure
if
i
have
the
right
direction
i
walk
up
to
the
man
in
the
token
booth
and
in
halt
english
ask
him
if
this
be
the
right
place
to
take
the
d
train
when
he
answer
me
i
be
not
sure
i
would
understood
him
correctly
i
could
understand
the
d
but
what
follow
sound
more
like
shrain
i
ask
him
to
repeat
himself
i
still
could
not
understand
him
behind
me
people
be
get
impatient
and
begin
to
comment
loudly
i
decide
to
take
a
chance
that
this
be
the
right
train
but
i
thought
that
people
here
be
not
so
friendly
as
in
vienna
i
do
find
the
movie
theater
however
and
don
giovanni
be
spectacularly
good
what
surprised
me
though
be
that
i
be
almost
alone
in
the
movie
house
a
movie
like
this
play
in
budapest
would
have
be
mobbed
here
there
be
barely
fifteen
people
in
the
audience
i
also
take
the
opportunity
to
find
the
metropolitan
opera
house
a
place
of
mythical
status
in
my
eye
several
people
direct
me
to
a
big
blocky
building
with
a
shabby
blacken
brick
facade
i
could
not
make
peace
with
the
fact
that
the
home
of
the
legendary
metropolitan
opera
be
this
decrepit
building
that
remind

help

equipment
that
i
would
never
see
before

toothache
or
cavity
and
the
only
problem
i
would

have
with
my
mouth
be
that
my
gum
bleed
a
little
when

i
thought
i
would
be
in
and
out
in
minute
i
be
not
so
lucky
the
dentist
told
me
that
my
teeth
be
cover
with
calculus
i
be
confuse
calculus
be
what
i
study
in
math
class
he
explain
that
it
be
also
a
word
that
described
deposit
on
my
teeth
that
irritated
my
gum
and
eventually
could
cause
real
problem
then
he
proceed
to
scrape
my
teeth
my
gum
bleed
profusely
i
thought
my
teeth
would
fall
out
he
take
pity
on
me
after
an
hour
of
torture
but
only
because
i
promise
that
i
would
come
back
the
next
day
to
let
him
finish
the
job
i
dread
it
but
i
do
return
obedient
and
much
chasten
i
also
go
to
the
eye
doctor
he
prescribed
a
pair
of
wire
rim
glass
for
me
i
promptly
stuck
them
in
my
pocket
feel
quite
confident
that
i
do
not
need
them
get
the
hearing
aid
be
a
revelation
i
have
try
hearing
aid
in
hungary
they
be
bulky
contraption
make
in
russia
in
addition
to
have
to
wear
a
conspicuous
headset
i
have
to
carry
the
battery
in
my
pant
pocket
and
the
hearing
aid
in
my
coat
pocket
both
of
them
be
heavy
and
drag
on
my
clothes
but
bad
of
all
they
really
do
not
help
i
quickly
give
up
on
them
the
hearing
aid
at
the
store
here
be
astonish
there
be
an
enormous
variety
and
the
big
one
be
barely
the
size
of
a
matchbox
even
include
a
place
for
tiny
battery
i
be
help
by
a
kind
gentleman
with
a
deep
boom
voice
that
i
could
understand
perfectly
he
explain
the
different
type
of
hearing
aid
measure
my
ear
and
picked
out
a
number
of
model
that
he
thought
would
work
i
try
one
after
another
in
the
store
and
get
completely
confuse
he
suggest
that
i
take
home
the
two
i
like
best
then
come
back
in
a
day
or
two
to
make
my
selection
i
thought
i
must
have
misunderstood
hearing
aid
be
very
expensive
the
one
i
chose
be
the
most
powerful
and
cost
about
yet
this
man
would
let
me
a
stranger
out
of
the
store
with
two
of
them
but
it
turn
out
that
i
would
understood
him
correctly
i
go
home
with
two
hearing
aid
which
i
test
with
lajos
paul
lenke
and
the
tv
i
chose
the
one
that
happen
to
be
the
most
expensive
hearing
aid
in
the
store
but
when
i
report
this
to
mr
kad
mon
with
much
embarrassment
she
say
just
choose
the
one
that
work
the
best
and
do
not
worry
about
the
cost
america
kept
surprising
me
lajos
have
arrange
for
an
appointment
for
me
with
the
head
of
the
chemistry
department
at
brooklyn
college
when
the
day
come
i
get
up
very
early
so
that
i
could
take
the
subway
with
him
to
brooklyn
i
do
not
realize
what
a
long
commute
he
have
we
start
from
the
top
end
of
the
bronx
practically
the
end
of
the
subway
line
and
because
we
be
near
the
end
of
the
line
at
least
we
be
able
to
sit
down
then
we
rode
and
rode
and
eventually
change
subway
line
by
this
time
the
train
be
full
so
on
the
new
train
we
stood
sandwich
between
other
people
lajos
have
developed
a
skill
of
fold
his
newspaper
into
eighth
so
that
he
be
able
to
read
it
even
when
fully
surround
i
whiled
away
the
time
by
look
around
the
train
reading
the
advertisement
over
and
over
and
gaze
at
my
fellow
passenger
none
of
them
return
my
glance
we
get
to
brooklyn
college
a
few
minute
after
eight
o
clock
after
more
than
an
hour
of
travel
lajos
first
show
me
around
his
workplace
he
be
a
technician
in
the
botany
department
which
be
a
logical
job
for
him
because
he
have
be
a
gardener
back
in
hungary
here
he
tend
all
kind
of
exotic
plant
that
be
go
to
be
use
in
the
botany
class
his
empire
be
like
a
jungle
his
colleague
greet
me
with
great
exuberance
it
be
obvious
that
lajos
have
told
them
about
me
and
they
be
look
forward
to
meeting
me
one
of
them
show
me
around
the
chemistry
lab
there
be
no
student
around
at
the
time
because
it
be
between
semester
but
otherwise
the
room
look
just
like
the
chemistry
lab
at
the
university
of
budapest
that
be
reassure
somebody
else
show
me
around
what
he
described
as
a
language
lab
he
explain
that
this
be
where
student
learn
foreign
language
the
lab
consist
of
little
cubicle
each
equip
with
a
tape
recorder
and
a
microphone
student
could
listen
to
phrase
in
foreign
language
repeat
them
into
a
microphone
and
instantly
hear
their
own
pronunciation
of
the
phrase
so
that
they
could
compare
their
pronunciation
with
the
correct
one
i
have
never
see
anything
like
this
and
be
very
impressed
with
the
lavish
setup
i
sat
in
a
cubicle
and
repeat
an
english
phrase
into
the
microphone
when
i
listen
to
my
own
version
i
be
appalled
i
sound
like
donald
duck
with
an
accent
then
it
be
time
for
me
to
meet
the
head
of
the
chemistry
department
he
spent
a
couple
of
hour
with
me
try
to
establish
what
i
knew
about
various
subject
so
that
he
could
figure
out
which
course
to
enroll
me
in
it
be
an
informal
test
like
a
casual
version
of
the
oral
exam
i
would
have
to
take
at
the
university
in
hungary
at
the
end
of
it
the
professor
told
me
that
my
knowledge
of
chemistry
be
outstanding
and
that
i
would
do
very
well
at
brooklyn
college
i
also
met
with
a
professor
from
the
math
department
and
because
the
college
require
the
study
of
a
foreign
language
with
a
professor
from
the
russian
department
i
be
told
to
come
back
the
next
day
when
they
would
tell
me
where
i
stood
i
hung
around
until
lajos
be
ready
to
go
and
we
repeat
the
long
journey
home
the
next
day
i
again
rode
in
with
lajos
and
go
directly
to
the
chemistry
department
for
my
result
i
be
pleasantly
surprised
i
get
credit
for
a
good
number
of
chemistry
course
and
for
five
semester
of
math
even
though
i
have
take
only
two
at
the
university
of
budapest
i
be
told
that
i
do
not
need
to
take
any
more
math
at
all
i
also
get
credit
for
five
semester
of
russian
and
again
be
told
that
i
have
fulfil
the
foreign
language
requirement
the
bottom
line
be
that
i
could
graduate
as
a
chemist
in
one
and
a
half
year
i
be
stun
i
consider
myself
a
begin
student
in
chemistry
have
barely
start
my
second
year
of
university
i
could
not
picture
myself
as
a
professional
chemist
in
just
a
year
and
a
half
more
of
course
but
the
chemistry
department
chair
man
smilingly
reassure
me
that
i
have
not
misunderstood
university
education
in
hungary
be
more
advanced
than
here
he
suppose
then
he
explain
that
although
i
have
receive
credit
for
a
lot
of
science
and
math
class
i
would
need
to
take
course
in
english
literature
american
history
and
political
science
my
eye
widen
i
quickly
calculate
that
if
i
subtract
the
require
course
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
chemistry
from
the
total
number
of
course
i
could
take
in
the
year
and
a
half
left
before
get
my
degree
i
would
have
the
opportunity
to
take
only
two
or
three
more
chemistry
course
i
stutter
how
can
i
be
a
chemist
with
only
two
or
three
more
course
of
chemistry
the
professor
patiently
explain
that
i
would
be
a
chemist
but
to
be
a
real
chemist
i
would
have
to
go
on
to
far
study
for
a
master
degree
or
even
well
a
ph
d
a
master
degree
would
take
one
extra
year
a
ph
d
would
take
two
or
three
year
beyond
that
my
aim
be
to
acquire
a
profession
that
would
enable
me
to
become
self
sufficient
as
soon
as
possible
so
i
could
support
myself
and
set
aside
enough
money
to
help
my
parent
get
out
of
hungary
and
join
me
in
america
the
picture
that
be
unfold
be
not
what
i
expect
i
start
negotiate
could
i
do
away
with
the
english
literature
the
political
science
and
those
other
course
that
would
not
help
me
become
a
well
chemist
and
take
more
chemistry
instead
the
professor
shook
his
head
with
a
slight
smile
no
he
say
those
course
be
require
for
graduation
i
look
so
crestfallen
that
he
take
pity
on
me
if
you
want
to
take
more
scientific
and
technical
course
maybe
you
should
switch
your
degree
to
chemical
engineering
he
suggest
he
reach
behind
his
desk
and
pull
out
a
little
booklet
listing
the
course
require
by
some
engineering
school
for
graduation
he
flip
through
it
mutter
the
name
of
the
course
they
all
seem
strange
and
mysterious
i
take
that
as
a
good
sign
if
i
sign
up
for
a
big
list
of
such
strange
course
i
felt
i
would
learn
something
that
would
make
me
capable
of
useful
work
i
say
that
i
would
be
interested
in
switch
to
chemical
engineering
the
professor
sigh
unfortunately
he
explain
brooklyn
college
do
not
have
an
engineering
department
i
ask
who
do
well
he
say
there
be
a
school
not
far
from
here
brooklyn
poly
that
be
a
very
good
engineering
school
would
you
like
to
talk
to
them
i
quickly
say
i
would
he
scribble
some
direction
on
a
piece
of
paper
minute
later
have
say
good
bye
to
lajos
i
be
on
my
way
to
brooklyn
polytechnic
when
i
get
there
i
look
for
the
admission
office
and
in
short
order
be
sit
down
with
two
admission
officer
i
told
them
my
story
i
be
a
hungarian
refugee
a
chemistry
student
and
i
have
a
problem
they
nod
their
head
they
completely
understood
my
predicament
brooklyn
poly
they
say
be
a
private
school
where
you
have
to
pay
tuition
if
you
do
not
have
a
scholarship
the
school
have
create
two
scholarship
for
hungarian
refugee
unfortunately
both
have
already
be
give
out
i
ask
how
much
tuition
cost
they
say
two
thousand
dollar
they
might
as
well
have
told
me
it
be
two
million
i
star
at
them
speechless
one
of
them
say
maybe
i
would
want
to
consider
city
college
it
have
a
good
engineering
school
and
like
brooklyn
college
be
free
i
perked
up
where
be
city
college
a
few
minute
later
i
have
another
set
of
scribble
direction
in
my
hand
and
be
on
my
way
again
i
surface
after
a
couple
of
long
subway
ride
it
take
me
a
few
moment
to
get
my
bearing
then
i
start
walk
toward
city
college
i
have
be
told
that
the
subway
station
be
ten
city
block
from
the
college
campus
after
a
couple
of
block
i
realize
that
something
be
strange
about
my
surroundings
i
do
not
see
a
single
white
face
on
the
street
everybody
storekeeper
passersby
child
be
black
since
come
to
new
york
i
would
see
plenty
of
black
people
but
i
would
never
be
in
a
situation
where
everybody
on
the
street
block
after
block
be
black
i
be
very
self
conscious
about
be
different
but
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
me
after
fifteen
minute
of
walk
down
the
windy
wintry
street
i
arrive
at
a
group
of
ornate
old
fashion
building
i
ask
somebody
for
direction
to
city
college
i
be
there
i
be
told
i
ask
to
see
someone
in
admission
and
be
direct
to
the
office
of
the
registrar
i
told
my
well
worn
story
to
the
receptionist
and
be
sent
in
to
see
a
friendly
old
gentleman
he
invite
me
to
sit
down
and
start
ask
the
usual
litany
of
question
what
course
have
i
take
what
grade
have
i
receive
and
so
on
i
list
my
course
one
after
the
other
and
with
slight
embarrassment
told
him
that
i
have
receive
the
high
grade
equivalent
to
a
in
america
in
each
of
them
i
be
tell
the
truth
but
i
have
no
transcript
no
proof
of
any
kind
would
the
gentleman
think
i
be
make
this
up
if
he
do
he
do
not
let
on
that
same
afternoon
i
be
officially
accepted
as
a
student
of
the
city
college
of
new
york
in
the
department
of
chemical
engineering
i
be
place
in
the
category
of
upper
sophomore
which
meant
that
if
i
take
a
full
load
i
would
graduate
in
three
and
a
half
more
year
while
here
too
i
would
have
to
take
course
in
english
literature
political
science
and
such
i
could
see
that
i
would
have
plenty
of
technical
training
before
graduate
this
be
more
like
it
there
be
still
the
problem
of
money
for
book
and
to
cover
the
cost
of
living
while
get
my
degree
the
registrar
gentleman
explain
that
the
school
have
no
cash
scholarship
but
that
he
understood
that
an
organization
call
the
world
university
service
give
cash
stipend
to
hungarian
refugee
the
moment
i
left
his
office
i
be
on
my
way
again
with
yet
another
set
of
direction
this
time
to
manhattan
before
the
afternoon
end
the
world
university
service
have
grant
me
a
scholarship
for
the
semester
it
be
not
a
whole
lot
but
it
be
still
money
i
no
longer
have
to
rely
on
an
allowance
from
lajos
in
fact
by
the
time
lajos
and
lenke
arrive
home
from
work
and
sat
around
the
kitchen
table
as
i
recite
the
story
of
my
day
i
have
figure
that
i
should
give
them
a
third
of
my
scholarship
to
defray
the
cost
of
my
presence
in
their
household
the
rest
would
go
for
book
and
thing
i
would
also
be
able
to
start
save
to
help
my
parent
come
to
america
i
have
no
idea
how
they
would
get
out
of
hungary
in
the
first
place
or
if
they
do
manage
to
get
out
of
hungary
how
they
could
get
to
america
i
figure
that
money
would
be
need
in
either
case
so
i
resolve
to
save
every
dollar
i
could
altogether
it
have
be
quite
a
day
lajos
and
lenke
thought
so
too
they
be
very
proud
of
me
late
that
night
i
sat
down
to
report
all
of
this
in
a
letter
to
my
parent
i
felt
quite
proud
of
myself
too
my
timing
be
fortuitous
registration
for
class
at
city
college
be
to
start
in
a
few
day
it
take
place
in
a
gymnasium
crowd
of
young
people
mill
around
jostling
in
front
of
table
set
up
for
different
class
where
administrative
paperwork
be
be
hand
out
and
collect
the
sound
of
everyone
talk
occasionally
shout
question
and
rattle
paper
echoed
in
the
cavernous
space
add
to
the
confusion
even
though
i
be
wear
my
american
best
i
be
immediately
identify
as
a
hungarian
student
and
staff
help
me
line
up
at
the
right
place
and
fill
out
the
right
paperwork
at
one
point
a
friendly
staff
person
tripped
over
my
name
for
the
umpteenth
time
look
he
say
do
you
mind
if
i
just
call
you
andy
i
assure
him
that
i
do
not
mind
at
all
it
have
a
good
ring
to
it
come
from
american
mouth
by
the
end
of
the
day
be
call
andy
sound
as
natural
as
if
this
have
be
my
name
all
my
life
the
registrar
have
told
me
which
course
to
take
i
be
surprised
to
find
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
single
class
of
chemical
engineer
who
attend
all
the
course
together
as
we
do
in
hungary
each
student
have
a
different
list
of
course
and
we
move
from
one
class
to
another
sometimes
with
student
from
other
class
other
time
not
it
be
a
very
different
system
from
the
one
i
be
use
to
i
be
remind
of
how
i
felt
when
i
first
saw
skyscraper
everything
at
first
seem
overwhelm
but
within
a
few
day
i
be
run
from
class
to
class
just
like
everyone
else
everything
be
different
class
student
and
professor
all
be
far
more
casual
than
in
hungary
in
my
very
first
class
i
stood
up
when
the
professor
enter
the
classroom
that
be
the
custom
in
hungary
but
here
i
be
the
only
one
on
my
foot
all
the
other
student
turn
and
star
at
me
i
slump
back
into
my
seat
my
face
turn
red
once
the
class
get
go
i
peeked
around
the
other
student
be
sprawl
in
their
seat
as
if
they
be
lounge
at
a
party
every
now
and
then
they
stuck
their
hand
in
the
air
and
question
something
the
professor
say
that
be
another
difference
in
hungary
you
reserve
your
question
for
the
junior
faculty
and
you
certainly
never
interrupt
a
lecture
the
teacher
be
equally
casual
to
my
amazement
the
math
teacher
chewed
gum
all
the
time
i
have
a
hard
enough
time
understand
him
in
the
first
place
the
gum
certainly
do
not
help
the
most
important
class
one
that
alone
make
up
one
third
of
my
course
load
be
a
physic
class
unlike
his
counterpart
in
hungary
the
teacher
spoke
in
a
firm
loud
voice
have
situate
myself
in
the
front
row
i
have
no
problem
hearing
him
that
be
the
good
news
the
bad
news
be
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
class
we
be
assign
thirty
problem
to
solve
before
the
next
class
which
be
the
next
day
thirty
the
problem
be
not
terribly
hard
if
you
understood
the
language
but
the
language
of
mechanic
include
word
that
i
have
never
encounter
in
oscar
wilde
without
a
dictionary
i
do
not
know
what
word
like
vertical
horizontal
and
perpendicular
meant
let
alone
isosceles
triangle
as
an
engineering
student
i
also
have
to
acquire
an
impressively
complex
slide
rule
i
have
never
see
a
slide
rule
before
and
have
to
learn
how
to
use
it
from
scratch
i
discover
that
it
contain
an
incredible
wealth
of
information
and
once
i
be
skilled
at
it
allow
me
to
calculate
much
more
rapidly
than
i
could
with
plain
pencil
and
paper
this
turn
out
to
be
extremely
useful
with
the
many
problem
i
have
to
solve
for
physic
class
in
addition
to
my
technical
class
i
also
have
to
take
course
in
english
composition
and
american
history
to
make
up
for
what
i
have
not
study
in
what
i
still
thought
of
as
gymnasium
although
i
quickly
learn
it
be
call
high
school
here
these
course
be
give
at
night
for
adult
student
who
work
during
the
day
i
take
the
technical
course
that
be
part
of
the
regular
engineering
curriculum
in
the
morning
and
english
and
history
at
night
i
have
to
study
a
lot
for
my
technical
course
i
try
to
study
in
the
library
but
i
could
not
concentrate
with
people
milling
around
me
so
after
my
morning
class
be
over
i
would
go
back
to
the
empty
apartment
settle
down
at
paul
desk
and
work
until
it
be
time
to
return
to
city
college
for
my
seven
o
clock
even
class
after
class
end
i
would
come
back
turn
on
the
lamp
at
paul
desk
and
while
he
slept
study
some
more
the
commute
from
my
home
to
city
college
be
a
good
forty
five
minute
a
fifteen
minute
walk
to
the
subway
fifteen
to
twenty
minute
on
the
subway
then
another
fifteen
minute
walk
to
the
campus
the
three
hour
commute
add
to
my
study
time
make
for
a
long
day
i
use
every
minute
to
study
include
the
time
i
spent
come
and
go
on
the
subway
every
once
in
a
while
i
reward
myself
by
buying
a
paper
cup
fill
with
coca
cola
from
a
machine
in
the
subway
station
for
five
cent
but
i
try
not
to
do
that
too
often
because
that
would
be
five
cent
i
would
not
have
for
my
parent
the
walk
from
my
home
to
the
subway
and
from
the
subway
to
city
college
be
miserable
it
be
winter
and
it
be
damp
windy
and
cold
particularly
during
my
even
trip
sometimes
rain
or
sleet
drove
into
my
face
winter
here
felt
much
nastier
than
winter
in
budapest
in
addition
to
english
composition
and
american
history
i
have
to
take
physical
education
there
be
no
such
thing
at
the
university
of
budapest
we
start
our
first
class
by
line
up
in
single
file
in
order
of
descend
height
to
my
chagrin
i
found
myself
near
the
end
of
the
line
in
similar
lineup
in
hungary
i
be
always
in
the
middle
or
close
to
the
front
american
boy
be
taller
i
be
an
unenthusiastic
participant
throw
big
heavy
ball
to
each
other
seem
utterly
pointless
to
me
in
one
of
my
pe
class
i
heard
somebody
talk
about
a
fence
team
i
be
intrigue
and
my
intrigue
get
elevate
to
outright
enthusiasm
when
i
learn
that
if
i
join
the
fence
team
i
would
not
have
to
come
to
pe
a
couple
of
week
into
the
semester
i
go
for
a
tryout
to
my
amazement
the
coach
put
me
on
the
varsity
team
and
ask
me
to
come
to
the
next
meet
on
the
come
weekend
we
go
to
new
jersey
to
fence
against
rutgers
university
and
the
coach
have
me
lead
off
i
won
my
first
bout
but
it
be
downhill
after
that
i
do
not
win
any
more
bout
at
that
meet
and
never
get
to
lead
off
again
be
hungarian
take
you
only
so
far
in
the
fence
world
the
kid
on
my
fence
team
and
for
that
matter
most
of
the
kid
in
my
class
be
all
very
friendly
to
me
my
classmate
and
the
other
student
call
me
andy
be
call
andy
make
me
feel
that
i
be
fitting
in
at
least
until
i
open
my
mouth
my
accent
always
make
me
stand
out
i
stood
out
another
way
too
i
have
a
hearing
aid
it
be
a
bone
conduction
device
which
be
very
rare
the
hearing
aid
have
to
press
against
the
bone
behind
the
ear
so
there
be
a
headset
with
a
spring
that
push
it
against
my
skull
i
wore
it
in
class
then
take
it
off
as
soon
as
class
be
over
partly
because
the
pressure
of
the
headset
hurt
my
head
and
partly
out
of
vanity
it
be
an
odd
look

furtive
glance
one
way
i
do
not
stand
out
be
by
be
a
jew
while
i
be
visit
brooklyn

i
have
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
college
newspaper
as
i
flip
through
its
page
it
struck
me
how
many
of
the
student
and
professor
name
be
jewish
i
have
a
similar
impression
at
city
college
many
student
and
professor
either
have
jewish
name
or
look
jewish
to
my
still
train
eye
a
couple
of
the
student
even
ask
me
very
matter
of
factly
if
i
be
jewish
once
when
i
say
yes

of
boy
who
be

in
the
manner
of
orthodox
jew
start
to
talk
to
me
very
enthusiastically
invite
me
to
join
them
in
a
group
they
belong
to
i
do
not
want
to
join
i
say
i
be
overwhelmed
by
my
course
which
be
absolutely
true
one
boy
who
be
in
a
couple
of
my
engineering
class
take
a
particular
interest
in
me
his
name
be
jerry
rosenthal
he
be
fresh
from
the
army
while
in
the
military
he
have
be
station
in
germany
his
unit
be
mobilize
during
the
hungarian
revolution
when
the
united
state
be
decide
whether
it
would
participate
on
behalf
of
the
hungarian
jerry
be
very
aware
of
the
hungarian
revolution
and
its
aftermath
and
we
start
to
spend
more
and
more
time
together
study
and
talk
to
my
de
light
i
discover
that
he
like
classical
music
not
only
that
his
favorite
opera
be
don
giovanni
jerry
take
me
under
his
wing
he
start
work
on
my
pronunciation
with
a
vengeance
he
decide
to
punch
me
in
the
shoulder
every
time
i
mispronounce
a
well
know
word
i
have
to
tolerate
multiple
punch
in
my
shoulder
before
i
learn
to
pronounce
book
correctly
i
be
pronounce
it
boook
this
be
relatively
easy
learn
to
pronounce
the
th
sound
as
in
the
word
the
and
they
be
a
lot
harder
lajos
be
no
help
although
his
english
be
fluent
he
pronounce
the
and
they
as
duh
and
day
jerry
fist
have
to
work
double
time
on
the
th
sound
some
day
i
have
a
very
sore
arm
but
my
pronunciation
improve
rapidly
jerry
also
help
me
warm
to
the
american
political
system
in
spite
of
my
deep
suspicion
about
what
communist
propaganda
say
about
the
united
state
some
of
the
communist
teaching
must
have
take
root
i
horrify
jerry
when
i
casually
mention
that
of
course
the
american
government
be
in
the
pocket
of
big
business
jerry
argue
with
me
vociferously
but
could
not
convince
me
then
one
day
he
pull
out
a
copy
of
the
new
york
time
and
triumphantly
wave
an
article
in
front
of
me
it
report
on
a
supreme
court
decision
force
the
dupont
corporation
to
sell
an
interest
they
have
in
general
motor
if
the
supreme
court
be
control
by
big
business
he
argue
how
could
they
possibly
rule
against
dupont
interest
i
grumble
skeptically
but
i
do
not
have
a
good
comeback
another
young
man
i
also
get
to
be
friendly
with
be
a
veteran
of
the
korean
war
he
too
be
study
to
become
an
engineer
and
we
be
in
some
of
the
same
class
after
a
while
i
work
up
enough
courage
to
ask
him
if
it
be
true
that
american
troop
use
bacterial
warfare
in
korea
he
get
extremely
angry
with
me
and
shout
you
know
me
well
enough
to
know
that
i
could
not
possibly
do
such
a
thing
how
can
you
even
ask
such
a
preposterous
question
i
hastily
retreat
wonder
if
anything
i
have
learn
in
hungary
about
america
and
american
be
true
school
be
hard

i
thought
i
be
cop
well
until
my
first
big
exam
in
my
physic
course
i
have
do
reasonably
well
on
all
the
homework

i
be
not
concerned
but
when
the
exam
come
i
have
two
surprise
first
we
have
to
finish
the
entire

minute
and
second

be
not
allow
to
open
our
book
there
be
no
such
test
in
hungary
and
i
be
not
use
to
have
to
memorize
equation
i
knew
i
do
poorly
but
i
still
be
not
prepared
for
the
f
that
be
write
on
the
fold
over
workbook
that
the
instructor
hand
back
at
the
next
class
i
be
shock
and
embarrass

have
never

to
me
before

afternoon
i
would
like
to

grof
but
half
the
time
i
do
not

my
last
name
when
they
call
the
roll
in
hungarian

o
here

my
professor
be
worried
about
me
this
be
a
tough
course
even
for
people
who
have
all
the
right
preparation
he
told
me
it
be
the
first
serious
engineering
course
that
student
encounter
perhaps
it
be
too
soon
for
me
he
offer
that
if
i
want
to
drop
the
class
he
would
let
me
do
it
without
any
penalty
and
i
could
take
it
again
the
follow
semester
i
be
stun
it
be
bad
enough
that
i
get
an

my
test
even
bad
be
be
invite
to
drop
the
course
i
thanked
him
for
his
consideration
and
told
him
with
clenched
jaw
i
be
go
to
do
well
from
there
on
the
first
subject
i
study
every
day
while
i
be
fresh
be
physic
i
study
for
as
long
as
it
take
for
me
to
get
on
top
of
the
material
i
kept
write
to
my
parent
i
have
lot
to
report
but
i
would
have
write
even
if
i
have
not
just
to
keep
them
inform
so
they
would
not
worry
about
me
my
father
be
very
happy
about
my
shift
to
engineering
he
be
a
practical
man
and
he
thought
he
understood
what
an
engineer
do
well
than
what
a
chemist
do
i
start
hint
that
they
should
follow
me
to
america
at
first
my
parent
reaction
be
not
encourage
by
that
time
the
border
be
seal
again
get
across
as
i
have
be
no
longer
possible
furthermore
my
father
be
deathly
afraid
of
find
himself
in
a
place
where
he
do
not
speak
the
language
which
be
anywhere
but

i
start
lobbying
for
them
to
study
english
after
a
while
they
do
and
i
encourage
them
by
include
english
comment
in
my
letter
i
use
my
messy
cursive
write
when
i
write
to
them
in
hungarian
but
whenever
i
switch
to
english
i
would
print
the
phrase
to
make
it
easy
for
them
to
read
in
one
of
their
early
letter

repercussion
result
from
his

with
a
dissident
friend
my

in
the

a
lot
it
be
good
to
know
that
i
have
another
relation
in
this
huge
place
some
week
later
the
time
come
for
the
second
big
physic
exam
my
rigorous
regimen
paid
off
this
time
i
get
an
a
i
be
feel
well
about
my
academic
prospect
which
be
just
as
well
because
i
get
word
that
my
faculty
advisor
professor
kolodney
want
to
see
me
professor
kolodney
be
a
lean
middle
age
man
whose
low
key
demeanor
be
at
odds
with
the
perpetually
amuse
glint
in
his
eye
he
ask
how
i
be
do
in
my
class
i
be
glad
to
be
able
to
report
my
good
news
in
physic
then
he
ask
me
the
question
that
just
about
everybody
else
ask
how
do
you
like
america
ordinarily
my
answer
would
be
a
short
and
perfunctory
fine
i
like
it
very
much
this
time
something
make
me
go
beyond
that
have
just
brave
the
element
on
a
particularly
nasty
day
i
burst
out
america
i
love
new
york
i
hate
the
whimsical
eyebrow
raise
and
why
be
that
he
ask
calmly
because
it
be
cold
and
wet
and
ugly
i
say
professor
kolodney
thought
about
this
for
a
little
while
then
he
ask
me
about
budapest
i
described
it
as
a
beautiful
city
where
water
and
mountain
meet
where
the
sun
always
shone
and
the
wind
never
drove
rain
into
your
face
of
course
this
be
not
the
case
but
from
the
distance
of
space
and
time
it
seem
to
have
be
so
at
least
for
me
on
that
grim
gray
day
professor
kolodney
thought
again
then
offer
maybe
you
want
to
move
to
california
you
be
likely
to
find
what
you
describe
in
san
francisco
more
than
any
place
else
in
america
he
then
switch
the
subject
to
discus
which
course
i
would
have
to
take
the
next
semester
but
the
idea
of
california
buzz
in
my
brain
i
might
want
to
live
there
after
i
finish
i
thought
it
sound
excite
but
first
i
have
to
get
back
to
my
course
in
order
to
expedite
my
graduation
i
need
to
start
take
the
course
sequence
offer
by
the
chemical
engineering
department
the
first
course
in
the
sequence
be
call
chem
e
this
be
a
legendary
course
with
an
intimidate
reputation
rumor
have
it
that
half
the
student
flunk
it
only
those
who
pass
chem
e
could
continue
with
the
chemical
engineering
course
and
become
chemical
engineer
those
who
flunk
the
condescend
rumor
go
on
become
physic
or
psychology
major
i
want
to
get
go
with
my
sequence
of
course
so
i
need
to
get
into
chem
e
professor
kolodney
wonder
if
it
might
be
too
soon
for
me
to
take
it
he
say
that
the
only
way
i
would
be
allow
into
the
course
be
if
i
get
permission
from
the
chairman
of
the
department
professor
schmidt
who
taught
this
course
so
i
go
off
to
see
professor
schmidt
his
office
be
guard
by
a
secretary
who
would
not
give
me
the
time
of
day
let
alone
an
appointment
i
waylaid
professor
schmidt
after
his
class
he
be
a
short
man
middle
age
with
a
fierce
mustache
and
gray
hair
severely
combed
back
he
wore
a
gray
dress
shirt
and
a
tie
he
be
very
intimidate
i
get
straight
to
the
point
i
told
him
my
predicament
while
all
around
us
student
be
noisily
milling
about
in
the
usual
postclass
hubbub
his
pierce
eye
never
left
mine
as
he
ask
which
course
i
be
take
that
semester
when
i
mention
my
physic
course
he
ask
who
my
teacher
be
then
he
ask
about
my
grade
i
swallow
and
told
him
that
i
have
flunk
the
first
test
but
get
an
a
on
the
second
he
look
at
me
quizzically
then
say
that
if
i
continued
to
do
well
in
the
physic
course
he
would
let
me
take
his
class
i
take
a
deep
breath
and
blurt
out
professor
schmidt
i
wonder
if
you
could
help
me
with
my
other
problem
my
scholarship
from
the
world
university
service
be
only
for
the
current
semester
i
explain
i
need
to
get
another
scholarship
for
the
follow
year
he
frown
then
say
that
i
should
come
see
him
in
his
office
later
i
show
up
as
instruct
and
smugly
prance
by
the
disapprove
secretary
as
professor
schmidt
gesture
for
me
to
come
in
his
office
be
minuscule
with
barely
enough
room
for
him
and
his
desk
i
edge
my
way
onto
a
chair
professor
schmidt
ask
me
how
much
money
i
get
from
the
wu
after
i
told
him
he
pull
out
the
long
slide
rule
i
would
ever
see
it
must
have
be
more
than
two
foot
long
without
say
a
word
to
me
he
start
compute
something
and
mutter
to
himself
then
he
put
down
the
slide
rule
and
ask
how
would
you
like
a
job
instead
of
a
scholarship
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
he
explain
that
the
chemical
engineering
department
have
the
budget
for
one
student
assistant
who
would
help
him
and
his
secretary
the
job
paid
an
hour
which
be
very
good
wage
because
the
other
job
around
the
college
paid
only
an
hour
glance
at
his
slide
rule
he
figure
that
if
i
work
twenty
hour
a
week
i
would
make
as
much
as
i
get
out
of
the
scholarship
i
quickly
calculate
that
by
next
semester
i
would
no
longer
have
any
physical
education
requirement
so
i
could
drop
out
of
the
fence
team
and
gain
some
time
that
way
and
the
idea
of
work
for
this
man
really
appeal
to
me
i
say
yes
the
job
be
not
go
to
start
until
the
next
semester
but
professor
schmidt
say
it
be
mine
meanwhile
another
important
development
take
place
i
apply
for
my
green
card
my
official
status
in
this
country
be
as
a
parolee
by
order
of
president
eisenhower
that
be
signify
by
an
identification
card
a
white
piece
of
plastic
with
my
name
and
personal
data
on
it
the
white
card
give
me
the
right
to
be
in
this
country
but
it
do
not
give
me
permanent
resident
status
as
i
understood
it
i
have
be
let
in
but
be
still
in
limbo
the
green
card
would
signify
that
i
be
here
to
stay
and
would
be
on
track
to
become
a
u
s
citizen
in
five
year
time
this
be
extremely
important
from
the
standpoint
of
bring
my
parent
here
as
relative
of
an
american
citizen
they
would
have
preferential
status
in
be
admit
to
this
country
thing
be
fall
into
place
but
there
be
one
detail
that
still
bother
me
my
name
i
like
be
andy
i
hat
be
gruff
when
i
complain
to
lajos
and
lenke
about
it
they
say
i
could
change
my
name
easily
enough
if
i
want
to
they
told
me
that
a
friend
of
theirs
have
americanize
his
name
some
year
earlier
so
that
the
pronunciation
of
the
americanize
version
sound
the
same
as
the
correct
pronunciation
of
his
name
in
hungarian
i
start
doodle
with
different
spelling
the
most
obvious
thing
to
do
be
stick
an
e
after
my
name
g
r
o
f
e
i
show
this
to
a
classmate
and
ask
him
how
he
would
pronounce
it
he
say
oh
gro
fay
like
the
composer
of
the
grand
canyon
suite
i
go
back
to
the
draw
board
i
try
another
version
i
write
g
r
o
v
e
i
take
it
back
to
the
same
boy
he
say
oh
that
be
how
you
say
it
grove
it
be
a
serviceable
rendition
of
how
g
r
o
f
be
pronounce
in
hungarian
and
be
certainly
a
lot
closer
than
gruff
i
go
to
see
each
of
my
teacher
and
told
them
that
i
be
change
my
name
to
andrew
grove
for
good
measure
i
add
a
middle
initial
s
it
stood
for
stephen
the
english
version
of
ist
van
the
middle
name
that
i
have
never
use
in
hungary
nobody
have
any
problem
with
my
new
name
except
for
my
physic
teacher
who
again
ask
to
see
me
after
class
he
solemnly
told
me
that
it
be
really
not
necessary
to
change
my
name
that
i
should
hang
on
to
my
identity
and
not
give
in
to
any
pressure
to
americanize
i
explain
to
him
that
my
name
be
what
people
call
me
by
and
when
he
pronounce
grove
it
sound
more
like
me
than
when
he
pronounce
grof
as
gruff
he
shrug
and
say
okay
now
i
have
to
find
out
how
to
make
my
name
change
official
to
my
surprise
i
be
told
that
all
i
need
to
do
be
start
use
the
new
name
when
i
become
a
citizen
my
name
change
would
take
place
formally
in
the
meantime
however
no
paper
need
to
be
file
i
just
have
to
be
consistent
about
use
my
new
name
america
continued
to
amaze
me
that
night
when
i
write
to
my
parent
i
end
my
letter
by
carefully
printing
in
english
from
your
son
andy
whose
name
will
soon
be
grove
epilogue
i
have
never
go
back
to
hungary
to
be
sure
as
the
year
go
on
political
and
economic
life
both
improve
at
least
as
far
as
i
could
tell
hungary
even
end
up
become
a
member
of
nato
but
although
i
have
retain
fond
memory
of
hungarian
music
and
literature
and
i
still
look
with
some
warmth
at
picture
postcard
of
budapest
sent
to
me
by
friend
who
visit
there
i
have
never
desire
to
revisit
it
myself
i
be
not
entirely
sure
why
maybe
i
do
not
want
to
remind
myself
of
the
event
i
write
about
maybe
i
want
to
let
memory
stay
memory
or
maybe
the
reason
be
something
simpler
than
that
my
life
start
over
in
the
united
state
i
have
set
root
here
whatever
root

have
