preface
probably
in
the
life
of
everyone
there
come
a
time
when
he
be
inclined
to
go
over
again
the
event
great
and
small
which
have
make
up
the
incident
of
his
work
and
pleasure
and
i
be
tempt
to
become
a
garrulous
old
man
and
tell
some
story
of
men
and
thing
which
have
happen
in
an
active
life
in
some
measure
i
have
be
associate
with
the
most
interest
people
our
country
have
produce
especially
in
business
men
who
have
help
largely
to
build
up
the
commerce
of
the
united
state
and
who
have
make
know
its
product
all
over
the
world
these
incident
which
come
to
my
mind
to
speak
of
seem
vitally
important
to
me
when
they
happen
and
they
still
stand
out
distinctly
in
my
memory
just
how
far
any
one
be
justified
in
keep
what
he
regard
as
his
own
private
affair
from
the
public
or
in
defend
himself
from
attack
be
a
moot
point
if
one
talk
about
one
experience
there
be
a
natural
temptation
to
charge
one
with
travel
the
easy
road
to
egotism
if
one
keep
silence
the
inference
of
wrong
do
be
sometimes
even
more
difficult
to
meet
as
it
would
then
be
say
that
there
be
no
valid
defence
to
be
offer
it
have
not
be
my
custom
to
press
my
affair
forward
into
public
gaze
but
i
have
come
to
see
that
if
my
family
and
friend
want
some
record
of
thing
which
might
shed
light
on
matter
that
have
be
somewhat
discuss
it
be
right
that
i
should
yield
to
their
advice
and
in
this
informal
way
go
over
again
some
of
the
event
which
have
make
life
interest
to
me
there
be
still
another
reason
for
speak
now
if
a
tenth
of
the
thing
that
have
be
say
be
true
then
these
dozen
of
able
and
faithful
men
who
have
be
associate
with
me
many
of
whom
have
pass
away
must
have
be
guilty
of
grave
fault
for
myself
i
have
decide
to
say
nothing
hop
that
after
my
death
the
truth
would
gradually
come
to
the
surface
and
posterity
would
do
strict
justice
but
while
i
live
and
can
testify
to
certain
thing
it
seem
fair
that
i
should
refer
to
some
point
which
i
hope
will
help
to
set
forth
several
much
discuss
happening
in
a
new
light
i
be
convince
that
they
have
not
be
fully
understood
all
these
thing
affect
the
memory
of
men
who
be
dead
and
the
life
of
men
who
be
living
and
it
be
only
reasonable
that
the
public
should
have
some
first
hand
fact
to
draw
from
in
make
up
its
final
estimate
when
these
reminiscence
be
begin
there
be
of
course
no
thought
that
they
should
ever
go
so
far
as
to
appear
between
the
cover
of
a
book
they
be
not
prepared
with
the
idea
of
even
an
informal
autobiography
there
be
little
idea
of
order
or
sequence
and
no
thought
whatever
of
completeness
it
would
have
be
a
pleasure
as
well
as
a
satisfaction
to
dwell
with
some
fulness
upon
the
story
of
daily
and
intimate
companionship
which
exist
for
so
many
year
with
my
close
partner
and
associate
but
i
realize
that
while
these
experience
have
always
be
to
me
among
the
great
pleasure
of
my
life
a
long
account
of
them
would
not
interest
the
reader
and
thus
it
happens
that
i
have
but
mention
the
name
of
only
a
few
of
the
score
of
partner
who
have
be
so
active
in
building
up
the
business
interest
with
which
i
have
be
associate
j
d
r
march
chapter
i
some
old
friend
since
these
reminiscence
be
really
what
they
profess
to
be
random
and
informal
i
hope
i
may
be
pardon
for
set
down
so
many
small
thing
in
look
back
over
my
life
the
impression
which
come
most
vividly
to
my
mind
be
mental
picture
of
my
old
associate
in
speak
of
these
friend
in
this
chapter
i
would
not
have
it
thought
that
many
others
of
whom
i
have
not
spoken
be
less
important
to
me
and
i
shall
hope
to
refer
to
this
subject
of
my
early
friend
in
a
later
chapter
it
be
not
always
possible
to
remember
just
how
one
first
met
an
old
friend
or
what
one
impression
be
but
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
meeting
with
mr
john
d
archbold
who
be
now
a
vice
president
of
the
standard
oil
company
at
that
time
say
thirty
five
or
forty
year
ago
i
be
travel
about
the
country
visit
the
point
where
something
be
happen
talk
with
the
producer
the
refiner
the
agent
and
actually
get
acquaint
one
day
there
be
a
gathering
of
the
men
somewhere
near
the
oil
region
and
when
i
come
to
the
hotel
which
be
full
of
oil
men
i
saw
this
name
writ
large
on
the
register
john
d
archbold
a
bbl
he
be
a
young
and
enthusiastic
fellow
so
full
of
his
subject
that
he
add
his
slogan
a
bbl
after
his
signature
on
the
register
that
no
one
might
misunderstand
his
conviction
the
battle
cry
of
a
barrel
be
all
the
more
strike
because
crude
oil
be
sell
then
for
much
less
and
this
campaign
for
a
high
price
certainly
do
attract
attention
it
be
much
top
good
to
be
true
but
if
mr
archbold
have
to
admit
in
the
end
that
crude
oil
be
not
worth
a
bbl
his
enthusiasm
his
energy
and
his
splendid
power
over
men
have
last
he
have
always
have
a
well
developed
sense
of
humour
and
on
one
serious
occasion
when
he
be
on
the
witness
stand
he
be
ask
by
the
oppose
lawyer
mr
archbold
be
you
a
director
of
this
company
i
be
what
be
your
occupation
in
this
company
he
promptly
answer
to
clamour
for
dividend
which
lead
the
learn
counsel
to
start
afresh
on
another
line
i
can
never
cease
to
wonder
at
his
capacity
for
hard
work
i
do
not
often
see
him
now
for
he
have
great
affair
on
his
hand
while
i
live
like
a
farmer
away
from
active
happening
in
business
play
golf
plant
tree
and
yet
i
be
so
busy
that
no
day
be
long
enough
speak
of
mr
archbold
lead
me
to
say
again
that
i
have
receive
much
more
credit
than
i
deserve
in
connection
with
the
standard
oil
company
it
be
my
good
fortune
to
help
to
bring
together
the
efficient
men
who
be
the
control
force
of
the
organization
and
to
work
hand
in
hand
with
them
for
many
year
but
it
be
they
who
have
do
the
hard
task
the
great
majority
of
my
association
be
make
so
many
year
ago
that
i
have
reach
the
age
when
hardly
a
month
go
by
sometimes
i
think
hardly
a
week
that
i
be
not
call
upon
to
send
some
message
of
consolation
to
a
family
with
whom
we
have
be
connect
and
who
have
met
with
some
fresh
bereavement
only
recently
i
count
up
the
name
of
the
early
associate
who
have
pass
away
before
i
have
finish
i
found
the
list
numbered
some
sixty
or
more
they
be
faithful
and
earnest
friend
we
have
work
together
through
many
difficulty
and
have
go
through
many
severe
trial
together
we
have
discuss
and
argue
and
hammer
away
at
question
until
we
come
to
agree
and
it
have
always
be
a
happiness
to
me
to
feel
that
we
have
be
frank
and
aboveboard
with
each
other
without
this
business
associate
cannot
get
the
best
out
of
their
work
it
be
not
always
the
easy
of
task
to
induce
strong
forceful
men
to
agree
it
have
always
be
our
policy
to
hear
patiently
and
discus
frankly
until
the
last
shred
of
evidence
be
on
the
table
before
try
to
reach
a
conclusion
and
to
decide
finally
upon
a
course
of
action
in
work
with
so
many
partner
the
conservative
one
be
apt
to
be
in
the
majority
and
this
be
no
doubt
a
desirable
thing
when
the
mere
momentum
of
a
large
concern
be
certain
to
carry
it
forward
the
men
who
have
be
very
successful
be
correspondingly
conservative
since
they
have
much
to
lose
in
case
of
disaster
but
fortunately
there
be
also
the
aggressive
and
more
dare
one
and
they
be
usually
the
young
in
the
company
perhaps
few
in
number
but
impetuous
and
convincing
they
want
to
accomplish
thing
and
to
move
quickly
and
they
do
not
mind
any
amount
of
work
or
responsibility
i
remember
in
particular
an
experience
when
the
conservative
influence
met
the
progressive
shall
i
say
or
the
dare
side
at
all
event
this
be
the
side
i
represent
in
this
case
argument
versus
capital
one
of
my
partner
who
have
successfully
built
up
a
large
and
prosperous
business
be
resist
with
all
his
force
a
plan
that
some
of
us
favour
to
make
some
large
improvement
the
cost
of
extend
the
operation
of
this
enterprise
be
estimate
at
quite
a
sum
three
million
dollar
i
think
it
be
we
have
talk
it
over
and
over
again
and
with
several
other
associate
discuss
all
the
pro
and
con
and
we
have
use
every
argument
we
could
command
to
show
why
the
plan
would
not
only
be
profitable
but
be
indeed
necessary
to
maintain
the
lead
we
have
our
old
partner
be
obdurate
he
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
yield
and
i
can
see
him
stand
up
in
his
vigorous
protest
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
his
head
thrown
back
as
he
shout
no
it
be
a
pity
to
get
a
man
into
a
place
in
an
argument
where
he
be
defend
a
position
instead
of
consider
the
evidence
his
calm
judgment
be
apt
to
leave
him
and
his
mind
be
for
the
time
be
close
and
only
obstinacy
remains
now
these
improvement
have
to
be
make
as
i
say
before
it
be
essential
yet
we
could
not
quarrel
with
our
old
partner
but
a
minority
of
us
have
make
up
our
mind
that
we
must
try
to
get
him
to
yield
and
we
resolve
to
try
another
line
of
argument
and
say
to
him
you
say
that
we
do
not
need
to
spend
this
money
no
he
reply
it
will
probably
prove
to
be
many
year
before
such
a
sum
must
be
spent
there
be
no
present
need
for
these
facility
you
want
to
create
and
the
work
be
do
well
as
they
be
let
let
well
enough
alone
now
our
partner
be
a
very
wise
and
experienced
man
old
and
more
familiar
with
the
subject
than
some
of
us
and
all
this
we
admit
to
him
but
we
have
make
up
our
mind
as
i
have
say
to
carry
out
this
idea
if
we
could
possibly
get
his
approval
and
we
be
willing
to
wait
until
then
as
soon
as
the
argument
have
calm
down
and
when
the
heat
of
our
discussion
have
pass
the
subject
be
brought
up
again
i
have
thought
of
a
new
way
to
approach
it
i
say
i
will
take
it
and
supply
this
capital
myself
if
the
expenditure
turn
out
to
be
profitable
the
company
can
repay
me
and
if
it
go
wrong
i
will
stand
the
loss
that
be
the
argument
that
touch
him
all
his
reserve
disappear
and
the
matter
be
settle
when
he
say
if
that
be
the
way
you
feel
about
it
we
will
go
it
together
i
guess
i
can
take
the
risk
if
you
can
it
be
always
i
presume
a
question
in
every
business
just
how
fast
it
be
wise
to
go
and
we
go
pretty
rapidly
in
those
day
building
and
expand
in
all
direction
we
be
be
confront
with
fresh
emergency
constantly
a
new
oil
field
would
be
discover
tank
for
storage
have
to
be
built
almost
over
night
and
this
be
go
on
when
old
field
be
be
exhaust
so
we
be
therefore
often
under
the
double
strain
of
lose
the
facility
in
one
place
where
we
be
fully
equip
and
have
to
build
up
a
plant
for
store
and
transport
in
a
new
field
where
we
be
totally
unprepared
these
be
some
of
the
thing
which
make
the
whole
oil
trade
a
perilous
one
but
we
have
with
us
a
group
of
courageous
men
who
recognize
the
great
principle
that
a
business
cannot
be
a
great
success
that
do
not
fully
and
efficiently
accept
and
take
advantage
of
its
opportunity
how
often
we
discuss
those
try
question
some
of
us
want
to
jump
at
once
into
big
expenditure
and
others
to
keep
to
more
moderate
one
it
be
usually
a
compromise
but
one
at
a
time
we
take
these
matter
up
and
settle
them
never
go
as
fast
as
the
most
progressive
one
wish
nor
quite
so
carefully
as
the
conservative
desire
but
always
make
the
vote
unanimous
in
the
end
the
joy
of
achievement
the
part
played
by
one
of
my
early
partner
mr
h
m
flagler
be
always
an
inspiration
to
me
he
invariably
want
to
go
ahead
and
accomplish
great
project
of
all
kind
he
be
always
on
the
active
side
of
every
question
and
to
his
wonderful
energy
be
due
much
of
the
rapid
progress
of
the
company
in
the
early
day
it
be
to
be
expect
of
such
a
man
that
he
should
fulfil
his
destiny
by
work
out
some
great
problem
at
a
time
when
most
men
want
to
retire
to
a
comfortable
life
of
ease
this
would
not
appeal
to
my
old
friend
he
undertook
single
hand
the
task
of
building
up
the
east
coast
of
florida
he
be
not
satisfied
to
plan
a
railroad
from
st
augustine
to
key
west
a
distance
of
more
than
six
hundred
mile
which
would
have
be
regard
as
an
undertaking
large
enough
for
almost
any
one
man
but
in
addition
he
have
built
a
chain
of
superb
hotel
to
induce
tourist
to
go
to
this
newly
developed
country
far
than
this
he
have
have
them
conduct
with
great
skill
and
success
this
one
man
by
his
own
energy
and
capital
have
open
up
a
vast
stretch
of
country
so
that
the
old
inhabitant
and
the
new
settler
may
have
a
market
for
their
product
he
have
give
work
to
thousand
of
these
people
and
to
crown
all
he
have
undertaken
and
nearly
complete
a
remarkable
engineering
feat
in
carry
his
road
on
the
florida
key
into
the
atlantic
ocean
to
key
west
the
point
set
out
for
year
ago
practically
all
this
have
be
do
after
what
most
men
would
have
consider
a
full
business
life
and
a
man
of
any
other
nationality
situate
as
he
be
would
have
retire
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
labour
i
first
knew
mr
flagler
as
a
young
man
who
consign
produce
to
clark
rockefeller
he
be
a
bright
and
active
young
fellow
full
of
vim
and
push
about
the
time
we
go
into
the
oil
business
mr
flagler
establish
himself
as
a
commission
merchant
in
the
same
building
with
mr
clark
who
take
over
and
succeed
the
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
a
little
later
he
bought
out
mr
clark
and
combine
his
trade
with
his
own
naturally
i
come
to
see
more
of
him
the
business
relation
which
begin
with
the
handle
of
produce
he
consign
to
our
old
firm
grow
into
a
business
friendship
because
people
who
live
in
a
comparatively
small
place
as
cleveland
be
then
be
thrown
together
much
more
often
than
in
such
a
place
as
new
york
when
the
oil
business
be
develop
and
we
need
more
help
i
at
once
thought
of
mr
flagler
as
a
possible
partner
and
make
him
an
offer
to
come
with
us
and
give
up
his
commission
business
this
offer
he
accepted
and
so
begin
that
life
long
friendship
which
have
never
have
a
moment
interruption
it
be
a
friendship
found
on
business
which
mr
flagler
use
to
say
be
a
good
deal
well
than
a
business
found
on
friendship
and
my
experience
lead
me
to
agree
with
him
for
year
and
year
this
early
partner
and
i
work
shoulder
to
shoulder
our
desk
be
in
the
same
room
we
both
live
on
euclid
avenue
a
few
rod
apart
we
met
and
walk
to
the
office
together
walk
home
to
luncheon
back
again
after
luncheon
and
home
again
at
night
on
these
walk
when
we
be
away
from
the
office
interruption
we
do
our
think
talk
and
planning
together
mr
flagler
drew
practically
all
our
contract
he
have
always
have
the
faculty
of
be
able
to
clearly
express
the
intent
and
purpose
of
a
contract
so
well
and
accurately
that
there
could
be
no
misunderstand
and
his
contract
be
fair
to
both
side
i
can
remember
his
say
often
that
when
you
go
into
an
arrangement
you
must
measure
up
the
right
and
propriety
of
both
side
with
the
same
yardstick
and
this
be
the
way
henry
m
flagler
do
one
contract
mr
flagler
be
call
upon
to
accept
which
to
my
surprise
he
at
once
pass
with
his
o
k
and
without
a
question
we
have
conclude
to
purchase
the
land
on
which
one
of
our
refinery
be
built
and
which
be
held
on
a
lease
from
john
irwin
whom
we
both
knew
well
mr
irwin
drew
the
contract
for
the
purchase
of
this
land
on
the
back
of
a
large
manila
envelope
that
he
picked
up
in
the
office
the
description
of
the
property
ran
as
such
contract
usually
do
until
it
come
to
the
phrase
the
line
run
south
to
a
mullen
stalk
etc
this
seem
to
me
a
trifle
indefinite
but
mr
flagler
say
it
be
all
right
john
i
will
accept
that
contract
and
when
the
deed
come
in
you
will
see
that
the
mullen
stalk
will
be
replace
by
a
proper
stake
and
the
whole
document
will
be
accurate
and
shipshape
of
course
it
turn
out
exactly
as
he
say
it
would
i
be
almost
tempt
to
say
that
some
lawyer
might
sit
at
his
foot
and
learn
thing
about
draw
contract
good
for
them
to
know
but
perhaps
our
legal
friend
might
think
i
be
partial
so
i
wo
not
press
the
point
another
thing
about
mr
flagler
for
which
i
think
he
deserves
great
credit
be
that
in
the
early
day
he
insist
that
when
a
refinery
be
to
be
put
up
it
should
be
different
from
the
flimsy
shack
which
it
be
then
the
custom
to
build
everyone
be
so
afraid
that
the
oil
would
disappear
and
that
the
money
expend
in
building
would
be
a
loss
that
the
mean
and
cheapest
building
be
erect
for
use
as
refinery
this
be
the
sort
of
thing
mr
flagler
object
to
while
he
have
to
admit
that
it
be
possible
the
oil
supply
might
fail
and
that
the
risk
of
the
trade
be
great
he
always
believe
that
if
we
go
into
the
oil
business
at
all
we
should
do
the
work
as
well
as
we
knew
how
that
we
should
have
the
very
best
facility
that
everything
should
be
solid
and
substantial
and
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
to
produce
the
fine
result
and
he
follow
his
conviction
of
building
as
though
the
trade
be
go
to
last
and
his
courage
in
act
up
to
his
belief
laid
strong
foundation
for
later
year
there
be
a
number
of
people
still
alive
who
will
recall
the
bright
straightforward
young
flagler
of
those
day
with
satisfaction
at
the
time
when
we
bought
certain
refinery
at
cleveland
he
be
very
active
one
day
he
met
an
old
friend
on
the
street
a
german
baker
to
whom
he
have
sell
flour
in
year
go
by
his
friend
told
him
that
he
have
go
out
of
the
bakery
business
and
have
built
a
little
refinery
this
surprised
mr
flagler
and
he
do
not
like
the
idea
of
his
friend
invest
his
little
fortune
in
a
small
plant
which
he
felt
sure
would
not
succeed
but
at
first
there
seem
nothing
to
do
about
it
he
have
it
on
his
mind
for
some
day
it
evidently
troubled
him
finally
he
come
to
me
and
say
that
little
baker
man
know
more
about
baking
than
oil
refining
but
i
would
feel
well
if
we
invite
him
to
join
us
i
have
get
him
on
my
conscience
i
of
course
agree
he
talk
to
his
friend
who
say
he
would
gladly
sell
if
we
would
send
an
appraiser
to
value
his
plant
which
we
do
and
then
there
arose
an
unexpected
difficulty
the
price
at
which
the
plant
be
to
be
purchase
be
satisfactory
but
the
ex
baker
insist
that
mr
flagler
should
advise
him
whether
he
should
take
his
pay
in
cash
or
standard
oil
certificate
at
par
he
told
mr
flagler
that
if
he
take
it
in
cash
it
would
pay
all
his
debt
and
he
would
be
glad
to
have
his
mind
free
of
many
anxiety
but
if
mr
flagler
say
the
certificate
be
go
to
pay
good
dividend
he
want
to
get
into
and
keep
up
with
a
good
thing
it
be
rather
a
hard
proposition
to
put
up
to
mr
flagler
and
at
first
he
decline
to
advise
or
express
any
opinion
but
the
german
stuck
to
him
and
would
not
let
him
shirk
a
responsibility
which
in
no
way
belong
to
him
finally
mr
flagler
suggest
that
he
take
half
the
amount
in
cash
and
pay
per
cent
on
account
of
his
debt
and
put
the
other
half
in
certificate
and
see
what
happen
this
he
do
and
as
time
go
on
he
bought
more
certificate
and
mr
flagler
never
have
to
apologize
for
the
advice
he
give
him
i
be
confident
that
my
old
partner
give
this
affair
as
much
time
and
thought
as
he
do
to
any
of
his
own
large
problem
and
the
incident
may
be
take
as
a
measure
of
the
man
the
value
of
friendship
but
these
old
men
tale
can
hardly
be
interest
to
the
present
generation
though
perhaps
they
will
not
be
useless
if
even
tiresome
story
make
young
people
realize
how
above
all
other
possession
be
the
value
of
a
friend
in
every
department
of
life
without
any
exception
whatsoever
how
many
different
kind
of
friend
there
be
they
should
all
be
held
close
at
any
cost
for
although
some
be
well
than
others
perhaps
a
friend
of
whatever
kind
be
important
and
this
one
learns
as
one
grows
old
there
be
the
kind
that
when
you
need
help
have
a
good
reason
just
at
the
moment
of
course
why
it
be
impossible
to
extend
it
i
ca
not
indorse
your
note
he
say
because
i
have
an
agreement
with
my
partner
not
to
i
would
like
to
oblige
you
but
i
can
explain
why
at
the
moment
etc
etc
i
do
not
mean
to
criticize
this
sort
of
friendship
for
sometimes
it
be
a
matter
of
temperament
and
sometimes
the
real
necessity
be
such
that
the
friend
cannot
do
as
he
would
like
to
do
as
i
look
back
over
my
friend
i
can
remember
only
a
few
of
this
kind
and
a
good
many
of
the
more
capable
sort
one
especial
friend
i
have
his
name
be
s
v
harkness
and
from
the
first
of
our
acquaintance
he
seem
to
have
every
confidence
in
me
one
day
our
oil
warehouse
and
refinery
burn
to
the
ground
in
a
few
hour
they
be
absolutely
annihilate
though
they
be
insured
for
many
hundred
thousand
of
dollar
of
course
we
be
apprehensive
about
collect
such
a
large
amount
of
insurance
and
fear
it
might
take
some
time
to
arrange
that
plant
have
to
be
rebuilt
right
away
and
it
be
necessary
to
lay
the
financial
plan
mr
harkness
be
interested
with
us
in
the
business
and
i
say
to
him
i
may
want
to
call
upon
you
for
the
use
of
some
money
i
do
not
know
that
we
shall
need
it
but
i
thought
i
would
speak
to
you
in
advance
about
it
he
take
in
the
situation
without
much
explain
on
my
part
he
simply
heard
what
i
have
to
say
and
he
be
a
man
of
very
few
word
all
right
j
d
i
will
give
you
all
i
have
get
this
be
all
he
say
but
i
go
home
that
night
relieve
of
anxiety
as
it
turn
out
we
receive
the
check
of
the
liverpool
london
globe
insurance
company
for
the
full
amount
before
the
builder
require
the
payment
and
while
we
do
not
need
his
money
i
never
shall
forget
the
whole
souled
way
in
which
he
offer
it
and
this
sort
of
experience
be
not
i
be
grateful
to
say
rare
with
me
i
be
always
a
great
borrower
in
my
early
day
the
business
be
active
and
grow
fast
and
the
bank
seem
very
willing
to
loan
me
the
money
about
this
time
when
our
great
fire
have
brought
up
some
new
condition
i
be
study
the
situation
to
see
what
our
cash
requirement
would
be
we
be
accustom
to
prepare
for
financial
emergency
long
before
we
need
the
fund
another
incident
occur
at
this
time
which
show
again
the
kind
of
real
friend
we
have
in
those
day
but
i
do
not
hear
the
full
story
of
it
until
long
year
after
the
event
there
be
one
bank
where
we
have
do
a
great
deal
of
business
and
a
friend
of
mine
mr
stillman
witt
who
be
a
rich
man
be
one
of
the
director
at
a
meeting
the
question
come
up
as
to
what
the
bank
would
do
in
case
we
want
more
money
in
order
that
no
one
might
doubt
his
own
position
on
the
subject
mr
witt
call
for
his
strong
box
and
say
here
gentleman
these
young
men
be
all
o
k
and
if
they
want
to
borrow
more
money
i
want
to
see
this
bank
advance
it
without
hesitation
and
if
you
want
more
security
here
it
be
take
what
you
want
we
be
then
shipping
a
large
quantity
of
oil
by
lake
and
canal
to
save
in
transportation
and
it
take
additional
capital
to
carry
these
shipment
and
we
require
to
borrow
a
large
amount
of
money
we
have
already
make
extensive
loan
from
another
bank
whose
president
inform
me
that
his
board
of
director
have
be
make
inquiry
respect
our
large
line
of
discount
and
have
state
that
they
would
probably
want
to
talk
with
me
on
the
subject
i
answer
that
i
would
be
very
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
meet
the
board
as
we
would
require
a
great
deal
more
money
from
the
bank
suffice
it
to
say
we
get
all
we
want
but
i
be
not
ask
to
call
for
any
far
explanation
but
i
fear
i
be
tell
too
much
about
bank
and
money
and
business
i
know
of
nothing
more
despicable
and
pathetic
than
a
man
who
devotes
all
the
wake
hour
of
the
day
to
make
money
for
money
sake
if
i
be
forty
year
young
i
should
like
to
go
into
business
again
for
the
association
with
interest
and
quick
mind
men
be
always
a
great
pleasure
but
i
have
no
dearth
of
interest
to
fill
my
day
and
so
long
as
i
live
i
expect
to
go
on
and
develop
the
plan
which
have
be
my
inspiration
for
a
lifetime
during
all
the
long
period
of
work
which
last
from
the
time
i
be
sixteen
year
old
until
i
retire
from
active
business
when
i
be
fifty
five
i
must
admit
that
i
manage
to
get
a
good
many
vacation
of
one
kind
or
another
because
of
the
willingness
of
my
most
efficient
associate
to
assume
the
burden
of
the
business
which
they
be
so
eminently
qualify
to
conduct
of
detail
work
i
feel
i
have
do
my
full
share
as
i
begin
my
business
life
as
a
bookkeeper
i
learn
to
have
great
respect
for
figure
and
fact
no
matter
how
small
they
be
when
there
be
a
matter
of
accounting
to
be
do
in
connection
with
any
plan
with
which
i
be
associate
in
the
earlier
year
i
usually
found
that
i
be
select
to
undertake
it
i
have
a
passion
for
detail
which
afterward
i
be
force
to
strive
to
modify
at
pocantico
hill
new
york
where
i
have
spent
portion
of
my
time
for
many
year
in
an
old
house
where
the
fine
view
invite
the
soul
and
where
we
can
live
simply
and
quietly
i
have
spent
many
delightful
hour
study
the
beautiful
view
the
tree
and
fine
landscape
effect
of
that
very
interest
section
of
the
hudson
river
and
this
happen
in
the
day
when
i
seem
to
need
every
minute
for
the
absorb
demand
of
business
so
i
fear
after
i
get
well
start
i
be
not
what
might
be
call
a
diligent
business
man
this
phrase
diligent
in
business
reminds
me
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
in
cleveland
who
be
devote
to
his
work
i
talk
to
him
and
no
doubt
bore
him
unspeakably
on
my
special
hobby
which
have
always
be
what
some
people
call
landscape
gardening
but
which
with
me
be
the
art
of
lay
out
road
and
path
and
work
of
that
kind
this
friend
of
thirty
five
year
ago
plainly
disapprove
of
a
man
in
business
waste
his
time
on
what
he
look
upon
as
mere
foolishness
one
superb
spring
day
i
suggest
to
him
that
he
should
spend
the
afternoon
with
me
a
most
unusual
and
reckless
suggestion
for
a
business
man
to
make
in
those
day
and
see
some
beautiful
path
through
the
wood
on
my
place
which
i
have
be
planning
and
have
about
complete
i
go
so
far
as
to
tell
him
that
i
would
give
him
a
real
treat
i
cannot
do
it
john
he
say
i
have
an
important
matter
of
business
on
hand
this
afternoon
that
may
all
be
i
urge
but
it
will
give
you
no
such
pleasure
as
you
will
get
when
you
see
those
path
the
big
tree
on
each
side
and
go
on
john
with
your
talk
about
tree
and
path
i
tell
you
i
have
get
an
ore
ship
come
in
and
our
mill
be
wait
for
her
he
rubbed
his
hand
with
satisfaction
i
would
not
miss
see
her
come
in
for
all
the
wood
path
in
christendom
he
be
then
get
to
a
ton
for
bessemer
steel
rail
and
if
his
mill
stop
a
minute
wait
for
ore
he
felt
that
he
be
miss
his
life
chance
perhaps
it
be
this
same
man
who
often
gaze
out
into
the
lake
with
every
nerve
stretch
to
try
to
see
an
ore
ship
approach
one
day
one
of
his
friend
ask
him
if
he
could
see
the
boat
no
o
no
o
he
reluctantly
admit
but
she
be
most
in
sight
this
ore
trade
be
of
great
and
absorb
interest
at
cleveland
my
old
employer
be
paid
a
ton
for
carry
ore
from
the
marquette
region
fifty
year
ago
and
to
think
of
the
wickedness
of
this
maker
of
woodland
path
who
in
later
year
be
move
the
ore
in
great
ship
for
eighty
cent
a
ton
and
make
a
fortune
at
it
all
this
reminds
me
of
my
experience
in
the
ore
business
but
i
shall
come
to
that
later
i
want
to
say
something
about
landscape
gardening
to
which
i
have
devote
a
great
deal
of
time
for
more
than
thirty
year
the
pleasure
of
road
planning
like
my
old
friend
others
may
be
surprised
at
my
claim
to
be
an
amateur
landscape
architect
in
a
small
way
and
my
family
have
be
know
to
employ
a
great
landscape
man
to
make
quite
sure
that
i
do
not
ruin
the
place
the
problem
be
just
where
to
put
the
new
home
at
pocantico
hill
which
have
recently
be
built
i
thought
i
have
the
advantage
of
know
every
foot
of
the
land
all
the
old
big
tree
be
personal
friend
of
mine
and
with
the
view
of
any
give
point
i
be
perfectly
familiar
i
have
study
them
hundred
of
time
and
after
this
great
landscape
architect
have
laid
out
his
plan
and
have
driven
his
line
of
stake
i
ask
if
i
might
see
what
i
could
do
with
the
job
in
a
few
day
i
have
work
out
a
plan
so
devise
that
the
road
caught
just
the
best
view
at
just
the
angle
where
in
drive
up
the
hill
you
come
upon
impressive
outlook
and
at
the
end
be
the
final
burst
of
river
hill
cloud
and
great
sweep
of
country
to
crown
the
whole
and
here
i
fix
my
stake
to
show
where
i
suggest
that
the
road
should
run
and
finally
the
exact
place
where
the
house
should
be
look
it
all
over
i
say
and
decide
which
plan
be
best
it
be
a
proud
moment
when
this
real
authority
accepted
my
suggestion
as
bring
out
the
most
favour
spot
for
view
and
agree
upon
the
site
of
the
house
how
many
mile
of
road
i
have
laid
out
in
my
time
i
can
hardly
compute
but
i
have
often
kept
at
it
until
i
be
exhaust
while
survey
road
i
have
run
the
line
until
darkness
make
it
impossible
to
see
the
little
stake
and
flag
it
be
all
very
vain
of
me
to
tell
of
these
landscape
enterprise
but
perhaps
they
will
offset
the
business
talk
which
occupy
so
much
of
my
story
my
method
of
attend
to
business
matter
differ
from
those
of
most
well
conduct
merchant
of
my
time
and
allow
me
more
freedom
even
after
the
chief
affair
of
the
standard
oil
company
be
move
to
new
york
i
spent
most
of
my
summer
at
our
home
in
cleveland
and
i
do
still
i
would
come
to
new
york
when
my
presence
seem
necessary
but
for
the
most
part
i
kept
in
touch
with
the
business
through
our
own
telegraph
wire
and
be
left
free
to
attend
to
many
thing
which
interested
me
among
others
the
make
of
path
the
plant
of
tree
and
the
set
out
of
little
forest
of
seedling
of
all
the
profitable
thing
which
develop
quickly
under
the
hand
i
have
thought
my
young
nursery
show
the
great
yield
we
keep
a
set
of
account
book
for
each
place
and
i
be
amaze
not
long
ago
at
the
increase
in
value
that
a
few
year
make
in
grow
thing
when
we
come
to
remove
some
young
tree
from
westchester
county
to
lakewood
new
jersey
we
plant
our
young
tree
especially
evergreen
by
the
thousand
i
think
we
have
put
in
as
many
as
ten
thousand
at
once
and
let
them
develop
to
be
use
later
in
some
of
our
plant
scheme
if
we
transfer
young
tree
from
pocantico
to
our
home
in
lakewood
we
charge
one
place
and
credit
the
other
for
these
tree
at
the
market
rate
we
be
our
own
best
customer
and
we
make
a
small
fortune
out
of
ourselves
by
sell
to
our
new
jersey
place
at
or
each
tree
which
originally
cost
us
only
five
or
ten
cent
at
pocantico
in
nursery
stock
as
in
other
thing
the
advantage
of
do
thing
on
a
large
scale
reveals
itself
the
pleasure
and
satisfaction
of
save
and
move
large
tree
tree
say
from
ten
to
twenty
inch
in
diameter
or
even
more
in
some
case
have
be
for
year
a
source
of
great
interest
we
build
our
mover
ourselves
and
work
with
our
own
men
and
it
be
truly
surprising
what
liberty
you
can
take
with
tree
if
you
once
learn
how
to
handle
these
monster
we
have
move
tree
ninety
foot
high
and
many
seventy
or
eighty
foot
and
they
naturally
be
by
no
mean
young
at
one
time
or
another
we
have
try
almost
all
kind
of
tree
include
some
which
the
authority
say
could
not
be
move
with
success
perhaps
the
most
dare
experiment
be
with
horse
chestnut
we
take
up
large
tree
transport
them
considerable
distance
some
of
them
after
they
be
actually
in
flower
all
at
a
cost
of
twenty
dollar
per
tree
and
lose
very
few
we
be
so
successful
that
we
become
rather
reckless
try
experiment
out
of
season
but
when
we
work
on
plan
we
have
already
try
our
result
be
remarkably
satisfactory
take
our
experience
in
many
hundred
of
tree
of
various
kind
in
and
out
of
season
and
include
the
time
when
we
be

when

be
hardly
more
than
a

i
want
to
cut
away
a
big

i

interfere
with
the

my

sympathize

she
say
one
day
you
know
my
son
we
have
breakfast
at
eight
o
clock
and
i
think
if
the
tree
be
fell
some
time
before
we
sat
down
to
table
there
would
probably
be
no
great
complaint
when
the

saw
the

which
the
fall

reveal

it
turn
out
chapter
ii
the
difficult
art
of
get
to
my
father
i
owe
a
great
debt
in
that
he
himself
train
me
to
practical
way
he
be
engage
in
different
enterprise
he
use
to
tell
me
about
these
thing
explain
their
significance
and
he
taught
me
the
principle
and
method
of
business
from
early
boyhood
i
kept
a
little
book
which
i
remember
i
call
ledger
a
and
this
little
volume
be
still
preserve
contain
my
receipt
and
expenditure
as
well
as
an
account
of
the
small
sum
that
i
be
taught
to
give
away
regularly
naturally
people
of
modest
mean
lead
a
closer
family
life
than
those
who
have
plenty
of
servant
to
do
everything
for
them
i
count
it
a
blessing
that
i
be
of
the
former
class
when
i
be
seven
or
eight
year
old
i
engage
in
my
first
business
enterprise
with
the
assistance
of
my
mother
i
own
some
turkey
and
she
present
me
with
the
curd
from
the
milk
to
feed
them
i
take
care
of
the
bird
myself
and
sell
them
all
in
business
like
fashion
my
receipt
be
all
profit
as
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
expense
account
and
my
record
be
kept
as
carefully
as
i
knew
how
we
thoroughly
enjoy
this
little
business
affair
and
i
can
still
close
my
eye
and
distinctly
see
the
gentle
and
dignify
bird
walk
quietly
along
the
brook
and
through
the
wood
cautiously
steal
the
way
to
their
nest
to
this
day
i
enjoy
the
sight
of
a
flock
of
turkey
and
never
miss
an
opportunity
of
study
them
my
mother
be
a
good
deal
of
a
disciplinarian
and
upheld
the
standard
of
the
family
with
a
birch
switch
when
it
show
a
tendency
to
deteriorate
once
when
i
be
be
punish
for
some
unfortunate
doings
which
have
take
place
in
the
village
school
i
felt
call
upon
to
explain
after
the
whip
have
begin
that
i
be
innocent
of
the
charge
never
mind
say
my
mother
we
have
start
in
on
this
whip
and
it
will
do
for
the
next
time
this
attitude
be
maintain
to
its
final
conclusion
in
many
way
one
night
i
remember
we
boy
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
go
skate
in
the
moonlight
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
have
be
expressly
forbidden
to
skate
at
night
almost
before
we
get
fairly
start
we
heard
a
cry
for
help
and
found
a
neighbour
who
have
broken
through
the
ice
be
in
danger
of
drown
by
push
a
pole
to
him
we
succeed
in
fishing
him
out
and
restore
him
safe
and
sound
to
his
grateful
family
as
we
be
not
generally
expect
to
save
a
man
life
every
time
we
skate
my
brother
william
and
i
felt
that
there
be
mitigate
circumstance
connect
with
this
particular
disobedience
which
might
be
take
into
account
in
the
final
judgment
but
this
idea
prove
to
be
erroneous
start
at
work
although
the
plan
have
be
to
send
me
to
college
it
seem
best
at
sixteen
that
i
should
leave
the
high
school
in
which
i
have
nearly
complete
the
course
and
go
into
a
commercial
college
in
cleveland
for
a
few
month
they
taught
bookkeeping
and
some
of
the
fundamental
principle
of
commercial
transaction
this
training
though
it
last
only
a
few
month
be
very
valuable
to
me
but
how
to
get
a
job
that
be
the
question
i
tramped
the
street
for
day
and
week
ask
merchant
and
storekeeper
if
they
do
not
want
a
boy
but
the
offer
of
my
service
met
with
little
appreciation
no
one
want
a
boy
and
very
few
show
any
overwhelm
anxiety
to
talk
with
me
on
the
subject
at
last
one
man
on
the
cleveland
dock
told
me
that
i
might
come
back
after
the
noonday
meal
i
be
elate
it
now
seem
that
i
might
get
a
start
i
be
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
l
i
should
lose
this
one
opportunity
that
i
have
unearthed
when
finally
at
what
seem
to
me
the
time
i
present
myself
to
my
would
be
employer
we
will
give
you
a
chance
he
say
but
not
a
word
pass
between
us
about
pay
this
be
september
i
joyfully
go
to
work
the
name
of
the
firm
be
hewitt
tuttle
in
begin
the
work
i
have
some
advantage
my
father
training
as
i
have
say
be
practical
the
course
at
the
commercial
college
have
taught
me
the
rudiment
of
business
and
i
thus
have
a
groundwork
to
build
upon
i
be
fortunate
also
in
work
under
the
supervision
of
the
bookkeeper
who
be
a
fine
disciplinarian
and
well
dispose
toward
me
when
january
arrive
mr
tuttle
present
me
with
for
my
three
month
work
which
be
no
doubt
all
that
i
be
worth
and
it
be
entirely
satisfactory
for
the
next
year
with
a
month
i
kept
my
position
learn
the
detail
and
clerical
work
connect
with
such
a
business
it
be
a
wholesale
produce
commission
and
forward
concern
my
department
be
particularly
the
office
duty
just
above
me
be
the
bookkeeper
for
the
house
and
he
receive
a
year
salary
in
lieu
of
his
share
of
the
profit
of
the
firm
of
which
he
be
a
member
at
the
end
of
the
first
fiscal
year
when
he
left
i
assume
his
clerical
and
bookkeeping
work
for
which
i
receive
the
salary
of
as
i
look
back
upon
this
term
of
business
apprenticeship
i
can
see
that
its
influence
be
vitally
important
in
its
relation
to
what
come
after
to
begin
with
my
work
be
do
in
the
office
of
the
firm
itself
i
be
almost
always
present
when
they
talk
of
their
affair
laid
out
their
plan
and
decide
upon
a
course
of
action
i
thus
have
an
advantage
over
other
boy
of
my
age
who
be
quicker
and
who
could
figure
and
write
well
than
i
the
firm
conduct
a
business
with
so
many
ramification
that
this
education
be
quite
extensive
they
own
dwell
house
warehouse
and
building
which
be
rent
for
office
and
a
variety
of
us
and
i
have
to
collect
the
rent
they
ship
by
rail
canal
and
lake
there
be
many
different
kind
of
negotiation
and
transaction
go
on
and
with
all
these
i
be
in
close
touch
thus
it
happen
that
my
duty
be
vastly
more
interest
than
those
of
an
office
boy
in
a
large
house
to
day
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
work
gradually
the
audit
of
account
be
left
in
my
hand
all
the
bill
be
first
pass
upon
by
me
and
i
take
this
duty
very
seriously
one
day
i
remember
i
be
in
a
neighbour
office
when
the
local
plumber
present
himself
with
a
bill
about
a
yard
long
this
neighbour
be
one
of
those
very
busy
men
he
be
connect
with
what
seem
to
me
an
unlimited
number
of
enterprise
he
merely
glance
at
this
tiresome
bill
turn
to
the
bookkeeper
and
say
please
pay
this
bill
as
i
be
study
the
same
plumber
bill
in
great
detail
check
every
item
if
only
for
a
few
cent
and
find
it
to
be
greatly
to
the
firm
interest
to
do
so
this
casual
way
of
conduct
affair
do
not
appeal
to
me
i
have
train
myself
to
the
point
of
view
doubtless
held
by
many
young
men
in
business
to
day
that
my
check
on
a
bill
be
the
executive
act
which
release
my
employer
money
from
the
till
and
be
attend
with
more
responsibility
than
the
spending
of
my
own
fund
i
make
up
my
mind
that
such
business
method
could
not
succeed
passing
bill
collect
rent
adjust
claim
and
work
of
this
kind
brought
me
in
association
with
a
great
variety
of
people
i
have
to
learn
how
to
get
on
with
all
these
different
class
and
still
keep
the
relation
between
them
and
the
house
pleasant
one
particular
kind
of
negotiation
come
to
me
which
take
all
the
skill
i
could
master
to
bring
to
a
successful
end
we
would
receive
for
example
a
shipment
of
marble
from
vermont
to
cleveland
this
involve
handle
by
railroad
canal
and
lake
boat
the
cost
of
loss
or
damage
have
to
be
somehow
fix
between
these
three
different
carrier
and
it
taxed
all
the
ingenuity
of
a
boy
of
seventeen
to
work
out
this
problem
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
include
my
employer
but
i
thought
the
task
no
hardship
and
so
far
as
i
can
remember
i
never
have
any
disagreement
of
moment
with
any
of
these
transportation
interest
this
experience
in
conduct
all
sort
of
transaction
at
such
an
impressionable
age
with
the
help
hand
of
my
superior
to
fall
back
upon
in
an
emergency
be
highly
interest
to
me
it
be
my
first
step
in
learn
the
principle
of
negotiation
of
which
i
hope
to
speak
later
the
training
that
come
from
work
for
some
one
else
to
whom
we
feel
a
responsibility
i
be
sure
be
of
great
value
to
me
i
should
estimate
that
the
salary
of
that
time
be
far
less
than
half
of
what
be
paid
for
equivalent
position
to
day
the
next
year
i
be
offer
a
salary
of
but
thought
i
be
worth
we
have
not
settle
the
matter
by
april
and
as
a
favourable
opportunity
have
present
itself
for
carry
on
the
same
business
on
my
own
account
i
resign
my
position
in
those
day
in
cleveland
everyone
knew
almost
everyone
else
in
town
among
the
merchant
be
a
young
englishman
name
m
b
clark
perhaps
ten
year
old
than
i
who
want
to
establish
a
business
and
be
in
search
of
a
partner
he
have
to
contribute
to
the
firm
and
want
a
partner
who
could
furnish
an
equal
amount
this
seem
a
good
opportunity
for
me
i
have
save
up
or
but
where
to
get
the
rest
be
a
problem
i
talk
the
matter
over
with
my
father
who
told
me
that
he
have
always
intend
to
give
to
each
of
his
child
when
they
reach
twenty
one
he
say
that
if
i
wish
to
receive
my
share
at
once
instead
of
wait
he
would
advance
it
to
me
and
i
could
pay
interest
upon
the
sum
until
i
be
twenty
one
but
john
he
add
the
rate
be
ten
at
that
time
per
cent
a
year
interest
be
a
very
common
rate
for
such
loan
at
the
bank
the
rate
might
not
have
be
quite
so
high
but
of
course
the
financial
institution
could
not
supply
all
the
demand
so
there
be
much
private
borrowing
at
high
figure
as
i
need
this
money
for
the
partnership
i
gladly
accepted
my
father
offer
and
so
begin
business
as
the
junior
partner
of
the
new
firm
which
be
call
clark
rockefeller
it
be
a
great
thing
to
be
my
own
employer
mentally
i
swell
with
pride
a
partner
in
a
firm
with
capital
mr
clark
attend
to
the
buying
and
sell
and
i
take
charge
of
the
finance
and
the
book
we
at
once
begin
to
do
a
large
business
deal
in
carload
lot
and
cargo
of
produce
naturally
we
soon
need
more
money
to
take
care
of
the
increase
trade
there
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
attempt
to
borrow
from
a
bank
but
would
the
bank
lend
to
us
the
first
loan
i
go
to
a
bank
president
whom
i
knew
and
who
knew
me
i
remember
perfectly
how
anxious
i
be
to
get
that
loan
and
to
establish
myself
favourably
with
the
banker
this
gentleman
be
t
p
handy
a
sweet
and
gentle
old
man
well
know
as
a
high
grade
beautiful
character
for
fifty
year
he
be
interested
in
young
men
he
knew
me
as
a
boy
in
the
cleveland
school
i
give
him
all
the
particular
of
our
business
tell
him
frankly
about
our
affair
what
we
want
to
use
the
money
for
etc
etc
i
wait
for
the
verdict
with
almost
tremble
eagerness
how
much
do
you
want
he
say
two
thousand
dollar
all
right
mr
rockefeller
you
can
have
it
he
reply
just
give
me
your
own
warehouse
receipt
they
be
good
enough
for
me
as
i
left
that
bank
my
elation
can
hardly
be
imagine
i
held
up
my
head
think
of
it
a
bank
have
trust
me
for
i
felt
that
i
be
now
a
man
of
importance
in
the
community
for
long
year
after
the
head
of
this
bank
be
a
friend
indeed
he
loan
me
money
when
i
need
it
and
i
need
it
almost
all
the
time
and
all
the
money
he
have
it
be
a
source
of
gratification
that
later
i
be
able
to
go
to
him
and
recommend
that
he
should
make
a
certain
investment
in
standard
oil
stock
he
agree
that
he
would
like
to
do
so
but
he
say
that
the
sum
involve
be
not
at
the
moment
available
and
so
at
my
suggestion
i
turn
banker
for
him
and
in
the
end
he
take
out
his
principal
with
a
very
handsome
profit
it
be
a
pleasure
to
testify
even
at
this
late
date
to
his
great
kindness
and
faith
in
me
stick
to
business
principle
mr
handy
trust
me
because
he
believe
we
would
conduct
our
young
business
on
conservative
and
proper
line
and
i
well
remember
about
this
time
an
example
of
how
hard
it
be
sometimes
to
live
up
to
what
one
know
be
the
right
business
principle
not
long
after
our
concern
be
start
our
best
customer
that
be
the
man
who
make
the
large
consignment
ask
that
we
should
allow
him
to
draw
in
advance
on
current
shipment
before
the
produce
or
a
bill
of
lade
be
actually
in
hand
we
of
course
wish
to
oblige
this
important
man
but
i
as
the
financial
member
of
the
firm
object
though
i
fear
we
should
lose
his
business
the
situation
seem
very
serious
my
partner
be
impatient
with
me
for
refuse
to
yield
and
in
this
dilemma
i
decide
to
go
personally
to
see
if
i
could
not
induce
our
customer
to
relent
i
have
be
unusually
fortunate
when
i
come
face
to
face
with
men
in
win
their
friendship
and
my
partner
displeasure
put
me
on
my
mettle
i
felt
that
when
i
get
into
touch
with
this
gentleman
i
could
convince
him
that
what
he
propose
would
result
in
a
bad
precedent
my
reason
in
my
own
mind
be
logical
and
convincing
i
go
to
see
him
and
put
forth
all
the
argument
that
i
have
so
carefully
thought
out
but
he
storm
about
and
in
the
end
i
have
the
far
humiliation
of
confess
to
my
partner
that
i
have
fail
i
have
be
able
to
accomplish
absolutely
nothing
naturally
he
be
very
much
disturbed
at
the
possibility
of
lose
our
most
value
connection
but
i
insist
and
we
stuck
to
our
principle
and
refuse
to
give
the
shipper
the
accommodation
he
have
ask
what
be
our
surprise
and
gratification
to
find
that
he
continued
his
relation
with
us
as
though
nothing
have
happen
and
do
not
again
refer
to
the
matter
i
learn
afterward
that
an
old
country
banker
name
john
gardener
of
norwalk
o
who
have
much
to
do
with
our
consignor
be
watch
this
little
matter
intently
and
i
have
ever
since
believe
that
he
originate
the
suggestion
to
tempt
us
to
do
what
we
state
we
do
not
do
as
a
test
and
his
story
about
our
firm
stand
for
what
we
regard
as
sound
business
principle
do
us
great
good
about
this
time
i
begin
to
go
out
and
solicit
business
a
branch
of
work
i
have
never
before
attempt
i
undertook
to
visit
every
person
in
our
part
of
the
country
who
be
in
any
way
connect
with
the
kind
of
business
that
we
be
engage
in
and
go
pretty
well
over
the
state
of
ohio
and
indiana
i
make
up
my
mind
that
i
could
do
this
best
by
simply
introduce
our
firm
and
not
press
for
immediate
consignment
i
told
them
that
i
represent
clark
rockefeller
commission
merchant
and
that
i
have
no
wish
to
interfere
with
any
connection
that
they
have
at
present
but
if
the
opportunity
offer
we
should
be
glad
to
serve
them
etc
etc
to
our
great
surprise
business
come
in
upon
us
so
fast
that
we
hardly
knew
how
to
take
care
of
it
and
in
the
first
year
our
sale
amount
to
half
a
million
dollar
then
and
indeed
for
many
year
after
it
seem
as
though
there
be
no
end
to
the
money
need
to
carry
on
and
develop
the
business
as
our
success
begin
to
come
i
seldom
put
my
head
upon
the
pillow
at
night
without
speak
a
few
word
to
myself
in
this
wise
now
a
little
success
soon
you
will
fall
down
soon
you
will
be
overthrown
because
you
have
get
a
start
you
think
you
be
quite
a
merchant
look
out
or
you
will
lose
your
head
go
steady
these
intimate
conversation
with
myself
i
be
sure
have
a
great
influence
on
my
life
i
be
afraid
i
could
not
stand
my
prosperity
and
try
to
teach
myself
not
to
get
puffed
up
with
any
foolish
notion
my
loan
from
my
father
be
many
our
relation
on
finance
be
a
source
of
some
anxiety
to
me
and
be
not
quite
so
humorous
as
they
seem
now
as
i
look
back
at
them
occasionally
he
would
come
to
me
and
say
that
if
i
need
money
in
the
business
he
would
be
able
to
loan
some
and
as
i
always
need
capital
i
be
glad
indeed
to
get
it
even
at
per
cent
interest
just
at
the
moment
when
i
require
the
money
most
he
be
apt
to
say
my
son
i
find
i
have
get
to
have
that
money
of
course
you
shall
have
it
at
once
i
would
answer
but
i
knew
that
he
be
test
me
and
that
when
i
paid
him
he
would
hold
the
money
without
its
earn
anything
for
a
little
time
and
then
offer
it
back
later
i
confess
that
this
little
discipline
should
have
do
me
good
and
perhaps
do
but
while
i
conceal
it
from
him
the
truth
be
i
be
not
particularly
pleased
with
his
application
of
test
to
discover
if
my
financial
ability
be
equal
to
such
shock
interest
at
per
cent
these
experience
with
my
father
remind
me
that
in
the
early
day
there
be
often
much
discussion
as
to
what
should
be
paid
for
the
use
of
money
many
people
protest
that
the
rate
of
per
cent
be
outrageous
and
none
but
a
wicked
man
would
exact
such
a
charge
i
be
accustom
to
argue
that
money
be
worth
what
it
would
bring
no
one
would
pay
per
cent
or
per
cent
or
per
cent
unless
the
borrower
believe
that
at
this
rate
it
be
profitable
to
employ
it
as
i
be
always
the
borrower
at
that
time
i
certainly
do
not
argue
for
pay
more
than
be
necessary
among
the
most
persistent
and
heat
discussion
i
ever
have
be
those
with
the
dear
old
lady
who
kept
the
boarding
house
where
my
brother
william
and
i
live
when
we
be
away
from
home
at
school
i
use
to
greatly
enjoy
these
talk
for
she
be
an
able
woman
and
a
good
talker
and
as
she
charge
us
only
a
dollar
a
week
for
board
and
lodge
and
fed
us
well
i
certainly
be
her
friend
this
be
about
the
usual
price
for
board
in
the
small
town
in
those
day
where
the
produce
be
raise
almost
entirely
on
the
place
this
estimable
lady
be
violently
oppose
to
loaner
obtain
high
rate
of
interest
and
we
have
frequent
and
earnest
argument
on
the
subject
she
knew
that
i
be
accustom
to
make
loan
for
my
father
and
she
be
familiar
with
the
rate
secure
but
all
the
argument
in
the
world
do
not
change
the
rate
and
it
come
down
only
when
the
supply
of
money
grow
more
plentiful
i
have
usually
found
that
important
alteration
in
public
opinion
in
regard
to
business
matter
have
be
of
slow
growth
along
the
line
of
prove
economic
theory
very
rarely
have
improvement
in
these
relationship
come
about
through
hastily
devise
legislation
one
can
hardly
realize
how
difficult
it
be
to
get
capital
for
active
business
enterprise
at
that
time
in
the
country
farther
west
much
high
rate
be
paid
which
apply
usually
to
personal
loan
on
which
a
business
risk
be
run
but
it
show
how
different
the
condition
for
young
business
men
be
then
than
now
a
nimble
borrower
speak
of
borrowing
at
the
bank
reminds
me
of
one
of
the
most
strenuous
financial
effort
i
ever
make
we
have
to
raise
the
money
to
accept
an
offer
for
a
large
business
it
require
many
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
and
in
cash
security
would
not
answer
i
receive
the
message
at
about
noon
and
have
to
get
off
on
the
three
o
clock
train
i
drove
from
bank
to
bank
ask
each
president
or
cashier
whomever
i
could
find
first
to
get
ready
for
me
all
the
fund
he
could
possibly
lay
hand
on
i
told
them
i
would
be
back
to
get
the
money
later
i
round
up
all
of
our
bank
in
the
city
and
make
a
second
journey
to
get
the
money
and
kept
go
until
i
secure
the
necessary
amount
with
this
i
be
off
on
the
three
o
clock
train
and
close
the
transaction
in
these
early
day
i
be
a
good
deal
of
a
traveller
visit
our
plant
make
new
connection
see
people
arrange
plan
to
extend
our
business
and
it
often
call
for
very
rapid
work
raise
church
fund
when
i
be
but
seventeen
or
eighteen
i
be
elect
as
a
trustee
in
the
church
it
be
a
mission
branch
and
occasionally
i
have
to
hear
member
who
belong
to
the
main
body
speak
of
the
mission
as
though
it
be
not
quite
so
good
as
the
big
mother
church
this
strengthen
our
resolve
to
show
them
that
we
could
paddle
our
own
canoe
our
first
church
be
not
a
very
grand
affair
and
there
be
a
mortgage
of
on
it
which
have
be
a
dispirit
influence
for
year
the
holder
of
the
mortgage
have
long
demand
that
he
should
be
paid
but
somehow
even
the
interest
be
barely
kept
up
and
the
creditor
finally
threaten
to
sell
us
out
as
it
happen
the
money
have
be
lent
by
a
deacon
in
the
church
but
notwithstanding
this
fact
he
felt
that
he
should
have
his
money
and
perhaps
he
really
need
it
anyhow
he
propose
to
take
such
step
as
be
necessary
to
get
it
the
matter
come
to
a
head
one
sunday
morning
when
the
minister
announce
from
the
pulpit
that
the
would
have
to
be
raise
or
we
should
lose
our
church
building
i
therefore
found
myself
at
the
door
of
the
church
as
the
congregation
come
and
go
as
each
member
come
by
i
buttonhole
him
and
get
him
to
promise
to
give
something
toward
the
extinguish
of
that
debt
i
plead
and
urge
and
almost
threaten
as
each
one
promise
i
put
his
name
and
the
amount
down
in
my
little
book
and
continued
to
solicit
from
every
possible
subscriber
this
campaign
for
raise
the
money
which
start
that
morning
after
church
last
for
several
month
it
be
a
great
undertaking
to
raise
such
a
sum
of
money
in
small
amount
range
from
a
few
cent
to
the
more
magnificent
promise
of
gift
to
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
twenty
five
or
fifty
cent
per
week
the
plan
absorbed
me
i
contribute
what
i
could
and
my
first
ambition
to
earn
more
money
be
arouse
by
this
and
similar
undertaking
in
which
i
be
constantly
engage
but
at
last
the
be
all
in
hand
and
a
proud
day
it
be
when
the
debt
be
extinguish
i
hope
the
member
of
the
mother
church
be
properly
humiliate
to
see
how
far
we
have
go
beyond
their
expectation
but
i
do
not
now
recall
that
they
express
the
surprise
that
we
flatter
ourselves
they
must
have
felt
the
beg
experience
i
have
at
that
time
be
full
of
interest
i
go
at
the
task
with
pride
rather
than
the
reverse
and
i
continued
it
until
my
increase
care
and
responsibility
compel
me
to
resign
the
actual
work
out
of
detail
to
others
chapter
iii
the
standard
oil
company
it
would
be
surprising
if
in
an
organization
which
include
a
great
number
of
men
there
should
not
be
an
occasional
employee
here
and
there
who
act
in
connection
with
the
business
or
perhaps
in
conduct
his
own
affair
in
a
way
which
might
be
criticize
even
in
a
comparatively
small
organization
it
be
wellnigh
impossible
to
restrain
this
occasional
man
who
be
over
zealous
for
his
own
or
his
company
advancement
to
judge
the
character
of
all
the
member
of
a
great
organization
or
the
organization
itself
by
the
action
of
a
few
individual
would
be
manifestly
unfair
it
have
be
say
that
i
force
the
men
who
become
my
partner
in
the
oil
business
to
join
with
me
i
would
not
have
be
so
short
sight
if
it
be
true
that
i
follow
such
tactic
i
ask
would
it
have
be
possible
to
make
of
such
men
life
long
companion
would
they
accept
and
remain
for
many
year
in
position
of
the
great
trust
and
finally
could
any
one
have
form
of
such
men
if
they
have
be
so
browbeaten
a
group
which
have
for
all
these
year
work
in
loyal
harmony
with
fair
deal
among
themselves
as
well
as
with
others
building
up
efficiency
and
act
in
entire
unity
this
powerful
organization
have
not
only
last
but
its
efficiency
have
increase
for
fourteen
year
i
have
be
out
of
business
and
in
eight
or
ten
year
go
only
once
to
the
company
office
in
the
summer
of
i
visit
again
the
room
at
the
top
of
the
standard
oil
company
building
where
the
officer
of
the
company
and
the
head
of
department
have
have
their
luncheon
serve
for
many
year
i
be
surprised
to
find
so
many
men
who
have
come
to
the
front
since
my
last
visit
year
ago
afterward
i
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
old
associate
and
many
new
one
and
it
be
a
source
of
great
gratification
to
me
to
find
that
the
same
spirit
of
cooeperation
and
harmony
exist
unchanged
this
practice
of
lunch
together
a
hundred
or
more
at
long
table
in
most
intimate
and
friendly
association
be
another
indication
of
what
i
contend
slight
as
it
may
seem
to
be
at
first
thought
would
these
people
seek
each
other
companionship
day
after
day
if
they
have
be
force
into
this
relation
people
in
such
a
position
do
not
go
on
for
long
in
a
pleasant
and
congenial
intimacy
for
year
the
standard
oil
company
have
developed
step
by
step
and
i
be
convince
that
it
have
do
well
its
work
of
supply
to
the
people
the
product
from
petroleum
at
price
which
have
decrease
as
the
efficiency
of
the
business
have
be
built
up
it
gradually
extend
its
service
first
to
the
large
centre
and
then
to
town
and
now
to
the
small
place
go
to
the
home
of
its
customer
deliver
the
oil
to
suit
the
convenience
of
the
actual
user
this
same
system
be
be
follow
out
in
various
part
of
the
world
the
company
have
for
example
three
thousand
tank
wagon
supply
american
oil
to
town
and
even
small
hamlet
in
europe
its
own
depot
and
employee
deliver
it
in
a
somewhat
similar
way
in
japan
china
india
and
the
chief
country
of
the
world
do
you
think
this
trade
have
be
developed
by
anything
but
hard
work
this
plan
of
sell
our
product
direct
to
the
consumer
and
the
exceptionally
rapid
growth
of
the
business
breed
a
certain
antagonism
which
i
suppose
could
not
have
be
avoid
but
this
same
idea
of
deal
with
the
consumer
directly
have
be
follow
by
others
and
in
many
line
of
trade
without
create
so
far
as
i
recall
any
serious
opposition
this
be
a
very
interest
and
important
point
and
i
have
often
wonder
if
the
criticism
which
centre
upon
us
do
not
come
from
the
fact
that
we
be
among
the
first
if
not
the
first
to
work
out
the
problem
of
direct
sell
to
the
user
on
a
broad
scale
this
be
do
in
a
fair
spirit
and
with
due
consideration
for
everyone
right
we
do
not
ruthlessly
go
after
the
trade
of
our
competitor
and
attempt
to
ruin
it
by
cut
price
or
institute
a
spy
system
we
have
set
ourselves
the
task
of
building
up
as
rapidly
and
as
broadly
as
possible
the
volume
of
consumption
let
me
try
to
explain
just
what
happen
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
facility
we
have
in
manufacture
we
sought
the
utmost
market
in
all
land
we
need
volume
to
do
this
we
have
to
create
sell
method
far
in
advance
of
what
then
exist
we
have
to
dispose
of
two
or
three
or
four
gallon
of
oil
where
one
have
be
sell
before
and
we
could
not
rely
upon
the
usual
trade
channel
then
exist
to
accomplish
this
it
be
never
our
purpose
to
interfere
with
a
dealer
who
adequately
cultivate
his
field
of
operation
but
when
we
saw
a
new
opportunity
or
a
new
place
for
extend
the
sale
by
far
and
effective
facility
we
make
it
our
business
to
provide
them
in
this
way
we
open
many
new
line
in
which
others
have
share
in
this
development
we
have
to
employ
many
comparatively
new
men
the
ideal
way
to
supply
material
for
high
position
be
of
course
to
recruit
the
men
from
among
the
young
in
the
company
service
but
our
expansion
be
too
rapid
to
permit
this
in
all
case
that
some
of
these
employee
be
over
zealous
in
go
after
sale
it
would
not
be
surprising
to
learn
but
they
be
act
in
violation
of
the
express
and
know
wish
of
the
company
but
even
these
instance
i
be
convince
occur
so
seldom
by
comparison
with
the
number
of
transaction
we
carry
on
that
they
be
really
the
exception
that
prove
the
rule
every
week
in
the
year
for
many
many
year
this
concern
have
brought
into
this
country
more
than
a
million
dollar
gold
all
from
the
product
produce
by
american
labour
i
be
proud
of
the
record
and
believe
most
american
will
be
when
they
understand
some
thing
well
these
achievement
the
development
of
this
great
foreign
trade
the
own
of
ship
to
carry
the
oil
in
bulk
by
the
most
economical
method
the
send
out
of
men
to
fight
for
the
world
market
have
cost
huge
sum
of
money
and
the
vast
capital
employ
could
not
be
raise
nor
control
except
by
such
an
organization
as
the
standard
be
to
day
to
give
a
true
picture
of
the
early
condition
one
must
realize
that
the
oil
industry
be
consider
a
most
hazardous
undertaking
not
altogether
unlike
the
speculative
mining
undertaking
we
hear
so
much
of
to
day
i
well
remember
my
old
and
distinguish
friend
rev
thomas
w
armitage
for
some
forty
year
pastor
of
a
great
new
york
church
warn
me
that
it
be
bad
than
folly
to
extend
our
plant
and
our
operation
he
be
sure
we
be
run
unwarranted
risk
that
our
oil
supply
would
probably
fail
the
demand
would
decline
and
he
with
many
others
sometimes
i
thought
almost
everybody
prophesy
ruin
none
of
us
ever
dream
of
the
magnitude
of
what
prove
to
be
the
later
expansion
we
do
our
day
work
as
we
met
it
look
forward
to
what
we
could
see
in
the
distance
and
keep
well
up
to
our
opportunity
but
lay
our
foundation
firmly
as
i
have
say
capital
be
most
difficult
to
secure
and
it
be
not
easy
to
interest
conservative
men
in
this
adventurous
business
men
of
property
be
afraid
of
it
though
in
rare
case
capitalist
be
induced
to
unite
with
us
to
a
limited
extent
if
they
bought
our
stock
at
all
they
take
a
little
of
it
now
and
then
as
an
experiment
and
we
be
painfully
conscious
that
they
often
decline
to
buy
new
stock
with
many
beautiful
expression
of
appreciation
the
enterprise
be
so
new
and
novel
on
account
of
the
fearfulness
of
certain
holder
in
reference
to
its
success
we
frequently
have
to
take
stock
to
keep
it
from
go
beg
but
we
have
such
confidence
in
the
fundamental
value
of
the
concern
that
we
be
willing
to
assume
this
risk
there
be
always
a
few
men
in
an
undertaking
of
this
kind
who
would
risk
all
on
their
judgment
of
the
final
result
and
if
the
enterprise
have
fail
these
would
have
be
class
as
visionary
adventurer
and
perhaps
with
good
reason
the
men
who
be
at
work
constantly
in
the
service
of
the
company
be
kept
busy
year
in
and
year
out
the
past
year
have
be
a
time
of
great
contraction
but
the
standard
have
go
on
with
its
plan
unchecked
and
the
new
work
and
building
have
not
be
delayed
on
account
of
lack
of
capital
or
fear
of
bad
time
it
pay
its
workman
well
it
care
for
them
when
sick
and
pension
them
when
old
it
have
never
have
any
important
strike
and
if
there
be
any
well
function
of
business
management
than
give
profitable
work
to
employee
year
after
year
in
good
time
and
bad
i
do
not
know
what
it
be
another
thing
to
be
remember
about
this
so
call
octopus
be
that
there
have
be
no
water
introduce
into
its
capital
perhaps
we
felt
that
oil
and
water
would
not
have
mixed
nor
in
all
these
year
have
any
one
have
to
wait
for
money
which
the
standard
owe
it
have
suffer
from
great
fire
and
loss
but
it
have
take
care
of
its
affair
in
such
a
way
that
it
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
appeal
to
the
general
public
to
place
block
of
bond
or
stock
it
have
use
no
underwriting
syndicate
or
stock
sell
scheme
in
any
form
and
it
have
always
manage
to
finance
new
oil
field
operation
when
call
upon
it
be
a
common
thing
to
hear
people
say
that
this
company
have
crush
out
its
competitor
only
the
uninformed
could
make
such
an
assertion
it
have
and
always
have
have
and
always
will
have
hundred
of
active
competitor
it
have
live
only
because
it
have
manage
its
affair
well
and
economically
and
with
great
vigour
to
speak
of
competition
for
a
minute
consider
not
only
the
able
people
who
compete
in
refining
oil
but
all
the
competition
in
the
various
trade
which
make
and
sell
by
product
a
great
variety
of
different
business
and
perhaps
of
even
more
importance
be
the
competition
in
foreign
land
the
standard
be
always
fight
to
sell
the
american
product
against
the
oil
produce
from
the
great
field
of
russia
which
struggle
for
the
trade
of
europe
and
the
burma
oil
which
largely
affect
the
market
in
india
in
all
these
various
country
we
be
met
with
tariff
which
be
raise
against
us
local
prejudice
and
strange
custom
in
many
country
we
have
to
teach
the
people
the
chinese
for
example
to
burn
oil
by
make
lamp
for
them
we
packed
the
oil
to
be
carry
by
camel
or
on
the
back
of
runner
in
the
most
remote
portion
of
the
world
we
adapt
the
trade
to
the
need
of
strange
folk
every
time
we
succeed
in
a
foreign
land
it
meant
dollar
brought
to
this
country
and
every
time
we
fail
it
be
a
loss
to
our
nation
and
its
workman
one
of
our
great
helper
have
be
the
state
department
in
washington
our
ambassador
and
minister
and
consul
have
aid
to
push
our
way
into
new
market
to
the
utmost
corner
of
the
world
i
think
i
can
speak
thus
frankly
and
enthusiastically
because
the
work
out
of
many
of
these
great
plan
have
developed
largely
since
i
retire
from
the
business
fourteen
year
ago
the
standard
have
not
now
and
never
do
have
a
royal
road
to
supremacy
nor
be
its
success
due
to
any
one
man
but
to
the
multitude
of
able
men
who
be
work
together
if
the
present
manager
of
the
company
be
to
relax
effort
allow
the
quality
of
their
product
to
degenerate
or
treat
their
customer
badly
how
long
would
their
business
last
about
as
long
as
any
other
neglect
business
to
read
some
of
the
account
of
the
affair
of
the
company
one
would
think
that
it
have
such
a
hold
on
the
oil
trade
that
the
director
do
little
but
come
together
and
declare
dividend
it
be
a
pleasure
for
me
to
take
this
opportunity
to
pay
tribute
to
the
work
these
men
be
do
not
only
for
the
company
they
serve
but
for
the
foreign
trade
of
our
country
for
more
than
half
of
all
the
product
that
the
company
make
be
sell
outside
of
the
united
state
if
in
place
of
these
director
the
business
be
take
over
and
run
by
anyone
but
expert
i
would
sell
my
interest
for
any
price
i
could
get
to
succeed
in
a
business
require
the
best
and
most
earnest
men
to
manage
it
and
the
best
men
rise
to
the
top
of
its
origin
and
early
plan
i
will
speak
later
the
modern
corporation
beyond
question
there
be
a
suspicion
of
corporation
there
may
be
reason
for
such
suspicion
very
often
for
a
corporation
may
be
moral
or
immoral
just
as
a
man
may
be
moral
or
the
reverse
but
it
be
folly
to
condemn
all
corporation
because
some
be
bad
or
even
to
be
unduly
suspicious
of
all
because
some
be
bad
but
the
corporation
in
form
and
character
have
come
to
stay
that
be
a
thing
that
may
be
depend
upon
even
small
firm
be
become
corporation
because
it
be
a
convenient
form
of
partnership
it
be
equally
true
that
combination
of
capital
be
bound
to
continue
and
to
grow
and
this
need
not
alarm
even
the
most
timid
if
the
corporation
or
the
series
of
corporation
be
properly
conduct
with
due
regard
for
the
right
of
others
the
day
of
individual
competition
in
large
affair
be
past
and
go
you
might
just
as
well
argue
that
we
should
go
back
to
hand
labour
and
throw
away
our
efficient
machine
and
the
sober
good
sense
of
the
people
will
accept
this
fact
when
they
have
study
and
try
it
out
just
see
how
the
list
of
stockholder
in
the
great
corporation
be
increase
by
leap
and
bound
this
mean
that
all
these
people
be
become
partner
in
great
business
it
be
a
good
thing
it
will
bring
a
feel
of
increase
responsibility
to
the
manager
of
the
corporation
and
will
make
the
people
who
have
their
interest
involve
study
the
fact
impartially
before
condemn
or
attack
them
on
this
subject
of
industrial
combination
i
have
often
express
my
opinion
and
as
i
have
not
change
my
mind
i
be
not
averse
to
repeat
them
now
especially
as
the
subject
seem
again
to
be
so
much
in
the
public
eye
the
chief
advantage
from
industrial
combination
be
those
which
can
be
derive
from
a
cooeperation
of
person
and
aggregation
of
capital
much
that
one
man
cannot
do
alone
two
can
do
together
and
once
admit
the
fact
that
cooeperation
or
what
be
the
same
thing
combination
be
necessary
on
a
small
scale
the
limit
depends
solely
upon
the
necessity
of
business
two
person
in
partnership
may
be
a
sufficiently
large
combination
for
a
small
business
but
if
the
business
grows
or
can
be
make
to
grow
more
person
and
more
capital
must
be
take
in
the
business
may
grow
so
large
that
a
partnership
cease
to
be
a
proper
instrumentality
for
its
purpose
and
then
a
corporation
becomes
a
necessity
in
most
country
as
in
england
this
form
of
industrial
combination
be
sufficient
for
a
business
co
extensive
with
the
parent
country
but
it
be
not
so
in
america
our
federal
form
of
government
make
every
corporation
create
by
a
state
foreign
to
every
other
state
render
it
necessary
for
person
do
business
through
corporate
agency
to
organize
corporation
in
some
or
many
of
the
different
state
in
which
their
business
be
locate
instead
of
do
business
through
the
agency
of
one
corporation
they
must
do
business
through
the
agency
of
several
corporation
if
the
business
be
extend
to
foreign
country
and
american
be
not
to
day
satisfied
with
home
market
alone
it
will
be
found
helpful
and
possibly
necessary
to
organize
corporation
in
such
country
for
european
be
prejudice
against
foreign
corporation
as
be
the
people
of
many
of
our
state
these
different
corporation
thus
become
cooeperating
agency
in
the
same
business
and
be
held
together
by
common
ownership
of
their
stock
it
be
too
late
to
argue
about
advantage
of
industrial
combination
they
be
a
necessity
and
if
american
be
to
have
the
privilege
of
extend
their
business
in
all
the
state
of
the
union
and
into
foreign
country
as
well
they
be
a
necessity
on
a
large
scale
and
require
the
agency
of
more
than
one
corporation
the
danger
be
that
the
power
confer
by
combination
may
be
abuse
that
combination
may
be
form
for
speculation
in
stock
rather
than
for
conduct
business
and
that
for
this
purpose
price
may
be
temporarily
raise
instead
of
be
lower
these
abuse
be
possible
to
a
great
or
less
extent
in
all
combination
large
or
small
but
this
fact
be
no
more
of
an
argument
against
combination
than
the
fact
that
steam
may
explode
be
an
argument
against
steam
steam
be
necessary
and
can
be
make
comparatively
safe
combination
be
necessary
and
its
abuse
can
be
minimize
otherwise
our
legislator
must
acknowledge
their
incapacity
to
deal
with
the
most
important
instrument
of
industry
in
the
hearing
of
the
industrial
commission
in
i
then
say
that
if
i
be
to
suggest
any
legislation
regard
industrial
combination
it
would
be
first
federal
legislation
under
which
corporation
may
be
create
and
regulate
if
that
be
possible
second
in
lieu
thereof
state
legislation
as
nearly
uniform
as
possible
encourage
combination
of
person
and
capital
for
the
purpose
of
carry
on
industry
but
permit
state
supervision
not
of
a
character
to
hamper
industry
but
sufficient
to
prevent
fraud
upon
the
public
i
still
feel
as
i
do
in
the
new
opportunity
i
be
far
from
believe
that
this
will
adversely
affect
the
individual
the
great
economic
era
we
be
enter
will
give
splendid
opportunity
to
the
young
man
of
the
future
one
often
hears
the
men
of
this
new
generation
say
that
they
do
not
have
the
chance
that
their
father
and
grandfather
have
how
little
they
know
of
the
disadvantage
from
which
we
suffer
in
my
young
manhood
we
have
everything
to
do
and
nothing
to
do
it
with
we
have
to
hew
our
own
path
along
new
line
we
have
little
experience
to
go
on
capital
be
most
difficult
to
get
credit
be
mysterious
thing
whereas
now
we
have
a
system
of
commercial
rating
everything
be
then
haphazard
and
we
suffer
from
a
stupendous
war
and
all
the
disaster
which
follow
compare
this
day
with
that
our
comfort
and
opportunity
be
multiply
a
thousand
fold
the
resource
of
our
great
land
be
now
actually
opening
up
and
be
scarcely
touch
our
home
market
be
vast
and
we
have
just
begin
to
think
of
the
foreign
people
we
can
serve
the
people
who
be
year
behind
us
in
civilization
in
the
east
a
quarter
of
the
human
race
be
just
awaken
the
men
of
this
generation
be
enter
into
a
heritage
which
make
their
father
life
look
poverty
stricken
by
comparison
i
be
naturally
an
optimist
and
when
it
come
to
a
statement
of
what
our
people
will
accomplish
in
the
future
i
be
unable
to
express
myself
with
sufficient
enthusiasm
there
be
many
thing
we
must
do
to
attain
the
high
benefit
from
all
these
great
blessing
and
not
the
least
of
these
be
to
build
up
our
reputation
throughout
the
whole
world
the
great
business
interest
will
i
hope
so
comport
themselves
that
foreign
capital
will
consider
it
a
desirable
thing
to
hold
share
in
american
company
it
be
for
american
to
see
that
foreign
investor
be
well
and
honestly
treat
so
that
they
will
never
regret
purchase
of
our
security
i
may
speak
thus
frankly
because
i
be
an
investor
in
many
american
enterprise
but
a
controller
of
none
with
one
exception
and
that
a
company
which
have
not
be
much
of
a
dividend
payer
and
i
like
all
the
rest
be
dependent
upon
the
honest
and
capable
administration
of
the
industry
i
firmly
and
sincerely
believe
that
they
will
be
so
manage
the
american
business
man
you
hear
a
good
many
people
of
pessimistic
disposition
say
much
about
greed
in
american
life
one
would
think
to
hear
them
talk
that
we
be
a
race
of
miser
in
this
country
to
lay
too
much
stress
upon
the
report
of
greed
in
the
newspaper
would
be
folly
since
their
function
be
to
report
the
unusual
and
even
the
abnormal
when
a
man
go
properly
about
his
daily
affair
the
public
print
say
nothing
it
be
only
when
something
extraordinary
happens
to
him
that
he
be
discuss
but
because
he
be
thus
brought
into
prominence
occasionally
you
surely
would
not
say
that
these
occasion
represent
his
normal
life
it
be
by
no
mean
for
money
alone
that
these
active
mind
men
labour
they
be
engage
in
a
fascinate
occupation
the
zest
of
the
work
be
maintain
by
something
well
than
the
mere
accumulation
of
money
and
as
i
think
i
have
say
elsewhere
the
standard
of
business
be
high
and
be
get
well
all
the
time
i
confess
i
have
no
sympathy
with
the
idea
so
often
advanced
that
our
basis
of
all
judgment
in
this
country
be
found
on
money
if
this
be
true
we
should
be
a
nation
of
money
hoarder
instead
of
spender
nor
do
i
admit
that
we
be
so
small
mind
a
people
as
to
be
jealous
of
the
success
of
others
it
be
the
other
way
about
we
be
the
most
extraordinarily
ambitious
and
the
success
of
one
man
in
any
walk
of
life
spur
the
others
on
it
do
not
sour
them
and
it
be
a
libel
even
to
suggest
so
great
a
meanness
of
spirit
in
reading
the
newspaper
where
so
much
be
take
for
grant
in
consider
thing
on
a
money
standard
i
think
we
need
some
of
the
sense
of
humour
possess
by
an
irish
neighbour
of
mine
who
built
what
we
regard
as
an
extremely
ugly
house
which
stood
out
in
bright
colour
as
we
look
from
our
window
my
taste
in
architecture
differ
so
widely
from
that
affected
by
my
irish
friend
that
we
plant
out
the
view
of
his
house
by
move
some
large
tree
to
the
end
of
our
property
another
neighbour
who
watch
this
work
go
on
ask
mr
foley
why
mr
rockefeller
move
all
these
big
tree
and
cut
off
the
view
between
the
house
foley
with
the
quick
wit
of
his
country
respond
instantly
it
be
invy
they
ca
not
stand
look
at
the
ividence
of
me
prosperity
in
my
early
day
men
act
just
as
they
do
now
no
doubt
when
there
be
anything
to
be
do
for
general
trade
betterment
almost
every
man
have
some
good
reason
for
believe
that
his
case
be
a
special
one
different
from
all
the
rest
for
every
foolish
thing
he
do
or
want
to
do
for
every
unbusiness
like
plan
he
have
he
always
plead
that
it
be
necessary
in
his
case
he
be
the
one
man
who
have
to
sell
at
less
than
cost
to
disrupt
all
the
business
plan
of
others
in
his
trade
because
his
individual
position
be
so
absolutely
different
from
all
the
rest
it
be
often
a
heart
break
undertaking
to
convince
those
men
that
the
perfect
occasion
which
would
lead
to
the
perfect
opportunity
would
never
come
even
if
they
wait
until
the
crack
o
doom
then
again
we
have
the
type
of
man
who
really
never
knew
all
the
fact
about
his
own
affair
many
of
the
brightest
kept
their
book
in
such
a
way
that
they
do
not
actually
know
when
they
be
make
money
on
a
certain
operation
and
when
they
be
lose
this
unintelligent
competition
be
a
hard
matter
to
contend
with
good
old
fashion
common
sense
have
always
be
a
mighty
rare
commodity
when
a
man
affair
be
not
go
well
he
hate
to
study
the
book
and
face
the
truth
from
the
first
the
men
who
manage
the
standard
oil
company
kept
their
book
intelligently
as
well
as
correctly
we
knew
how
much
we
make
and
where
we
gain
or
lose
at
least
we
try
not
to
deceive
ourselves
my
idea
of
business
be
no
doubt
old
fashion
but
the
fundamental
principle
do
not
change
from
generation
to
generation
and
sometimes
i
think
that
our
quick
witted
american
business
men
whose
spirit
and
energy
be
so
splendid
do
not
always
sufficiently
study
the
real
underlie
foundation
of
business
management
i
have
spoken
of
the
necessity
of
be
frank
and
honest
with
oneself
about
one
own
affair
many
people
assume
that
they
can
get
away
from
the
truth
by
avoid
think
about
it
but
the
natural
law
be
inevitable
and
the
sooner
it
be
recognize
the
well
one
hears
a
great
deal
about
wage
and
why
they
must
be
maintain
at
a
high
level
by
the
railroad
for
example
a
labourer
be
worthy
of
his
hire
no
less
but
no
more
and
in
the
long
run
he
must
contribute
an
equivalent
for
what
he
be
paid
if
he
do
not
do
this
he
be
probably
pauperize
and
you
at
once
throw
out
the
balance
of
thing
you
ca
not
hold
up
condition
artificially
and
you
ca
not
change
the
underlie
law
of
trade
if
you
try
you
must
inevitably
fail
all
this
may
be
trite
and
obvious
but
it
be
remarkable
how
many
men
overlook
what
should
be
the
obvious
these
be
fact
we
ca
not
get
away
from
a
business
man
must
adapt
himself
to
the
natural
condition
as
they
exist
from
month
to
month
and
year
to
year
sometimes
i
feel
that
we
american
think
we
can
find
a
short
road
to
success
and
it
may
appear
that
often
this
feat
be
accomplish
but
real
efficiency
in
work
come
from
know
your
fact
and
building
upon
that
sure
foundation
many
men
of
wealth
do
not
retire
from
business
even
when
they
can
they
be
not
willing
to
be
idle
or
they
have
a
just
pride
in
their
work
and
want
to
perfect
the
plan
in
which
they
have
faith
or
what
be
of
still
more
consequence
they
may
feel
the
call
to
expand
and
build
up
for
the
benefit
of
their
employee
and
associate
and
these
men
be
the
great
builder
up
in
our
country
consider
for
a
moment
how
much
would
have
be
left
undone
if
our
prosperous
american
business
men
have
sat
down
with
fold
hand
when
they
have
acquire
a
competency
i
have
respect
for
all
these
reason
but
if
a
man
have
succeed
he
have
brought
upon
himself
correspond
responsibility
and
our
institution
devote
to
help
men
to
help
themselves
need
the
brain
of
the
american
business
man
as
well
as
part
of
his
money
some
of
these
men
however
be
so
absorbed
in
their
business
affair
that
they
hardly
have
time
to
think
of
anything
else
if
they
do
interest
themselves
in
a
work
outside
of
their
own
office
and
undertake
to
raise
money
they
begin
with
an
apology
as
if
they
be
ashamed
of
themselves
i
be
no
beggar
i
have
heard
many
of
them
say
to
which
i
could
only
reply
i
be
sorry
you
feel
that
way
about
it
i
have
be
this
sort
of
beggar
all
my
life
and
the
experience
i
have
have
be
so
interest
and
important
to
me
that
i
will
venture
to
speak
of
them
in
a
later
chapter
chapter
iv
some
experience
in
the
oil
business
during
the
year
when
i
be
just
come
to
man
estate
the
produce
business
of
clark
rockefeller
go
on
prosperously
and
in
the
early
sixty
we
organize
a
firm
to
refine
and
deal
in
oil
it
be
compose
of
messrs
james
and
richard
clark
mr
samuel
andrew
and
the
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
who
be
the
company
it
be
my
first
direct
connection
with
the
oil
trade
as
the
new
concern
grow
the
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
be
call
upon
to
supply
a
large
special
capital
mr
samuel
andrew
be
the
manufacturing
man
of
the
concern
and
he
have
learn
the
process
of
cleanse
the
crude
oil
by
the
use
of
sulphuric
acid
in
the
partnership
be
dissolve
it
be
decide
that
the
cash
asset
should
be
collect
and
the
debt
paid
but
this
left
the
plant
and
the
good
will
to
be
dispose
of
it
be
suggest
that
they
should
go
to
the
high
bidder
among
ourselves
this
seem
a
just
settlement
to
me
and
the
question
come
up
as
to
when
the
sale
should
be
held
and
who
would
conduct
it
my
partner
have
a
lawyer
in
the
room
to
represent
them
though
i
have
not
consider
have
a
legal
representative
i
thought
i
could
take
care
of
so
simple
a
transaction
the
lawyer
act
as
the
auctioneer
and
it
be
suggest
that
we
should
go
on
with
the
sale
then
and
there
all
agree
and
so
the
auction
begin
i
have
make
up
my
mind
that
i
want
to
go
into
the
oil
trade
not
as
a
special
partner
but
actively
on
a
large
scale
and
with
mr
andrew
wish
to
buy
that
business
i
thought
that
i
saw
great
opportunity
in
refining
oil
and
do
not
realize
at
that
time
that
the
whole
oil
industry
would
soon
be
swamp
by
so
many
men
rush
into
it
but
i
be
full
of
hope
and
i
have
already
arrange
to
get
financial
accommodation
to
an
amount
that
i
suppose
would
easily
pay
for
the
plant
and
good
will
i
be
willing
to
give
up
the
other
firm
of
clark
rockefeller
and
readily
settle
that
later
my
old
partner
mr
clark
take
over
the
business
the
bidding
begin
i
think
at
premium
i
bid
a
thousand
they
bid
two
thousand
and
so
on
little
by
little
the
price
go
up
neither
side
be
willing
to
stop
bidding
and
the
amount
gradually
rise
until
it
reach
which
be
much
more
than
we
suppose
the
concern
to
be
worth
finally
it
advanced
to
and
by
slow
stage
to
and
i
almost
fear
for
my
ability
to
buy
the
business
and
have
the
money
to
pay
for
it
at
last
the
other
side
bid
without
hesitation
i
say
mr
clark
then
say
i
will
go
no
high
john
the
business
be
yours
shall
i
give
you
a
check
for
it
now
i
suggest
no
mr
clark
say
i
be
glad
to
trust
you
for
it
settle
at
your
convenience
the
firm
of
rockefeller
andrew
be
then
establish
and
this
be
really
my
start
in
the
oil
trade
it
be
my
most
important
business
for
about
forty
year
until
at
the
age
of
about
fifty
six
i
retire
the
story
of
the
early
history
of
the
oil
trade
be
too
well
know
to
bear
repeat
in
detail
the
cleanse
of
crude
petroleum
be
a
simple
and
easy
process
and
at
first
the
profit
be
very
large
naturally
all
sort
of
people
go
into
it
the
butcher
the
baker
and
the
candlestick
maker
begin
to
refine
oil
and
it
be
only
a
short
time
before
more
of
the
finish
product
be
put
on
the
market
than
could
possibly
be
consume
the
price
go
down
and
down
until
the
trade
be
threaten
with
ruin
it
seem
absolutely
necessary
to
extend
the
market
for
oil
by
export
to
foreign
country
which
require
a
long
and
most
difficult
development
and
also
to
greatly
improve
the
process
of
refining
so
that
oil
could
be
make
and
sell
cheaply
yet
with
a
profit
and
to
use
as
by
product
all
of
the
material
which
in
the
less
efficient
plant
be
lose
or
thrown
away
these
be
the
problem
which
confront
us
almost
at
the
outset
and
this
great
depression
lead
to
consultation
with
our
neighbor
and
friend
in
the
business
in
the
effort
to
bring
some
order
out
of
what
be
rapidly
become
a
state
of
chaos
to
accomplish
all
these
task
of
enlarge
the
market
and
improve
the
method
of
manufacture
in
a
large
way
be
beyond
the
power
or
ability
of
any
concern
as
then
constitute
it
could
only
be
do
we
reason
by
increase
our
capital
and
avail
ourselves
of
the
best
talent
and
experience
it
be
with
this
idea
that
we
proceed
to
buy
the
large
and
best
refining
concern
and
centralize
the
administration
of
them
with
a
view
to
secure
great
economy
and
efficiency
the
business
grow
faster
than
we
have
anticipate
this
enterprise
conduct
by
men
of
application
and
ability
work
hard
together
soon
built
up
unusual
facility
in
manufacture
in
transportation
in
finance
and
in
extend
market
we
have
our
trouble
and
set
back
we
suffer
from
some
severe
fire
and
the
supply
of
crude
oil
be
most
uncertain
our
plan
be
constantly
change
by
change
condition
we
developed
great
facility
in
an
oil
centre
erect
storage
tank
and
connect
pipe
line
then
the
oil
fail
and
our
work
be
thrown
away
at
best
it
be
a
speculative
trade
and
i
wonder
that
we
manage
to
pull
through
so
often
but
we
be
gradually
learn
how
to
conduct
a
most
difficult
business
foreign
market
several
year
ago
when
ask
how
our
business
grow
to
such
large
proportion
i
explain
that
our
first
organization
be
a
partnership
and
afterward
a
corporation
in
ohio
that
be
sufficient
for
a
local
refining
business
but
have
we
be
dependent
solely
upon
local
business
we
should
have
fail
long
since
we
be
force
to
extend
our
market
into
every
part
of
the
world
this
make
the
sea
board
city
a
necessary
place
of
business
and
we
soon
discover
that
manufacturing
for
export
could
be
more
economically
carry
on
there
hence
refinery
be
establish
at
brooklyn
at
bayonne
at
philadelphia
at
baltimore
and
necessary
corporation
be
organize
in
the
different
state
we
soon
discover
as
the
business
grow
that
the
primary
method
of
transport
oil
in
barrel
could
not
last
the
package
often
cost
more
than
the
content
and
the
forest
of
the
country
be
not
sufficient
to
supply
cheaply
the
necessary
material
for
an
extend
time
hence
we
devote
attention
to
other
method
of
transportation
adopt
the
pipe
line
system
and
found
capital
for
pipe
line
construction
equal
to
the
necessity
of
the

we
found

we
interested
others

the

here
be
an
example
of
one
of
the
way
in
which
we
achieve
certain

gain
real
advantage
fire
be
always
to
be
reckon
with
in
oil
refining
and
storage
as
we
learn
by
dear
experience
but
in
have
our
plant
distribute
all
over
the
country
the
unit
of
risk
and
possible
loss
be
minimize
no
one
fire
could
ruin
us
and
we
be
able
thus
to
establish
a
system
of
insure
ourselves
our
reserve
fund
which
provide
for
this
insurance
could
not
be
wipe
out
all
at
once
as
might
be
the
case
with
a
concern
have
its
plant
together
or
near
each
other
then
we
study
and
perfect
our
organization
to
prevent
fire
improve
our
appliance
and
plan
year
after
year
until
the
profit
on
this
insurance
feature
become
a
very
considerable
item
in
the
standard
earnings
it
can
easily
be
see
that
this
save
in
insurance
and
minimize
the
loss
by
fire
affected
the
profit
not
only
in

but
touch
many
other
associate
enterprise
the
manufacture
of
by
product
the
tank
and
steamer
the
pump
station
etc
we
devote
ourselves
exclusively
to
the
oil
business
and
its
product
the
company
never
go
into
outside
venture
but
kept
to
the
enormous
task
of
perfect
its
own
organization
we
educate
our
own
men
we
train
many
of
them
from
boyhood
we
strove
to
keep
them
loyal
by
provide
them
full
scope
for
their
ability
they
be
give
opportunity
to
buy
stock
and
the
company
itself
help
them
to
finance
their
purchase
not
only
here
in
america
but
all
over
the
world
our
young
men
be
give
chance
to
advance
themselves
and
the
son
of
the
old
partner
be
welcome
to
the
council
and
responsibility
of
the
administration
i
may
say
that
the
company
have
be
in
all
its
history
and
i
be
sure
it
be
at
present
a
most
happy
association
of
busy
people
i
have
be
ask
if
my
advice
be
not
often
sought
by
the
present
manager
i
can
say
that
if
it
be
sought
it
would
be
gladly
give
but
the
fact
be
that
since
i
retire
it
have
be
very
little
require
i
be
still
a
large
stockholder
indeed
i
have
increase
my
holding
in
the
company
stock
since
i
relinquish
any
part
in
its
management
why
the
standard
pay
large
dividend
let
me
explain
what
many
people
perhaps
fully
appreciate
but
some
i
be
sure
do
not
the
standard
pay
four
dividend
a
year
the
first
in
march
which
be
the
result
of
the
busiest
season
of
the
whole
twelvemonth
because
more
oil
be
consume
in
winter
than
at
other
season
and
three
other
dividend
later
at
about
evenly
divide
period
now
these
dividend
run
up
to
per
cent
on
the
capital
stock
of
but
that
do
not
mean
that
the
profit
be
per
cent
on
the
capital
invest
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
represent
the
result
of
the
saving
and
surplus
gain
through
all
the
thirty
five
or
forty
year
of
the
working
of
the
company
the
capital
stock
could
be
raise
several
hundred
per
cent
without
a
penny
of
over
capitalization
or
water
the
actual
value
be
there
if
this
increase
have
be
make
the
rate
would
represent
a
moderate
dividend
pay
power
of
about
to
per
cent
a
normal
growth
study
for
a
moment
the
result
of
what
have
be
a
natural
and
absolutely
normal
increase
in
the
value
of
the
company
possession
many
of
the
pipe
line
be
construct
during
a
period
when
cost
be
about
per
cent
of
what
they
be
now
great
field
of
oil
land

purchase
as
virgin
soil
which
later
yield
an
immense
output
quantity
of
low
grade
crude
oil
which
have
be
bought
by
the
company
when
it
be
believe
to
be
of
little
value
but
which
the
company
hop
eventually
to
utilize
be
greatly
increase
in
value
by
invention
for
refining
it
and
for
use
the
residue
formerly
consider
almost
worthless
dock
property
be
secure
at
low
price
and
make
valuable
by
building
and
development
large
unimproved
tract
of
land
near
the
important
business
centre
be
acquire
we
brought
our
industry
to
these
place
make
the
land
useful
and
increase
the
value
not
only
of
our
own
property
but
of
the
land
adjacent
to
it
to
many
time
the
original
worth
wherever
we
have
establish
business
in
this
and
other
country
we
have
bought
largely
of
property
i
remember
a
case
where
we
paid
only
or
so
an
acre
for
some
rough
land
to
be
use
for
such
purpose
and
through
the
improvement
we
create
the
value
have
go
up
or
time
as
much
in
or
year
others
have
have
similar
increase
in
the
value
of
their
property
but
have
enlarge
their
capitalization
correspondingly
they
have
escape
the
criticism
which
have
be
direct
against
us
who
with
our
old
fashion
and
conservative
notion
have
continued
without
such
expansion
of
capitalization
there
be
nothing
strange
or
miraculous
in
all
this
it
be
all
do
through
this
natural
law
of
trade
development
it
be
what
the
astor
and
many
other
large
landholder
do
if
a
man
start
in
business
with
capital
and
gradually
increase
his
property
and
investment
by
retain
in
his
concern
much
of
his
earnings
instead
of
spending
them
and
thus
accumulates
value
until
his
investment
be
say
it
would
be
folly
to
base
the
percentage
of
his
actual
profit
only
on
the
original
with
which
he
start
here
again
i
think
the
manager
of
the
standard
should
be
praise
and
not
blame
they
have
set
an
example
for
upbuilding
on
the
most
conservative
line
and
in
a
business
which
have
always
be
to
say
the
least
hazardous
and
to
a
large
degree
unavoidably
speculative
yet
no
one
who
have
rely
upon
the
ownership
of
this
stock
to
pay
a
yearly
income
have
be
disappointed
and
the
stock
be
held
by
an
increase
number
of
small
holder
the
country
over
the
management
of
capital
we
never
attempt
as
i
have
already
say
to
sell
the
standard
oil
stock
on
the
market
through
the
stock
exchange
in
the
early
day
the
risk
of
the
business
be
great
and
if
the
stock
have
be
dealt
in
on
the
exchange
its
fluctuation
would
no
doubt
have
be
violent
we
prefer
to
have
the
attention
of
the
owner
and
administrator
of
the
business
direct
wholly
to
the
legitimate
development
of
the
enterprise
rather
than
to
speculation
in
its
share
the
interest
of
the
company
have
be
carefully
conserve
we
have
be
criticize
for
pay
large
dividend
on
a
capitalization
which
represent
but
a
small
part
of
the
actual
property
own
by
the
company
if
we
have
increase
the
capitalization
to
bring
it
up
to
the
real
value
and
list
the
share
on
the
exchange
we
might
have
be
criticize
then
for
promote
a
project
to
induce
the
public
to
invest
as
i
have
indicate
the
foundation
of
the
company
be
so
thoroughly
establish
and
its
affair
so
conservatively
manage
that
after
the
earlier
period
of
struggle
to
secure
adequate
capital
and
in
view
of
the
try
experience
through
which
we
then
pass
we
decide
to
pursue
the
policy
of
rely
upon
our
own
resource
since
then
we
have
never
be
oblige
to
lean
very
heavily
upon
the
financial
public
but
have
sought
rather
to
hold
ourselves
in
position
not
only
to
protect
our
own
large
and
important
interest
but
to
be
prepared
in
time
of
stress
to
lend
a
help
hand
to
others
the
company
have
suffer
from
the
statement
of
people
who
i
be
convince
be
not
familiar
with
all
the
fact
as
i
long
ago
cease
to
have
any
active
part
in
the
management
of
its
affair
perhaps
i
may
venture
the
opinion
that
men
who
devote
themselves
to
building
up
the
sale
of
american
product
all
over
the
world
in
competition
with
foreign
manufacturer
should
be
appreciate
and
encourage
there
have
be
so
many
tale
told
about
the
so
call
speculation
of
the
standard
oil
company
that
i
may
say
a
word
about
that
subject
this
company
be
interested
only
in
oil
product
and
such
manufacturing
affair
as
be
legitimately
connect
therewith
it
have
plant
for
the
make
of
barrel
and
tank
and
building
pump
for
pump
oil
it
own
vessel
for
carry
oil
tank
car
pipe
for
transport
oil
etc
etc
but
it
be
not
concerned
in
speculative
interest
the
oil
business
itself
be
speculative
enough
and
its
successful
administration
require
a
firm
hand
and
a
cool
head
the
company
pay
dividend
to
its
stockholder
which
it
earns
in
carry
on
this
oil
trade
this
money
the
stockholder
can
and
do
use
as
they
think
fit
but
the
company
be
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
disposition
that
the
stockholder
make
of
their
dividend
the
standard
oil
company
do
not
own
or
control
a
chain
of
bank
nor
have
it
any

directly
or
indirectly
in
any

its
relation

confine
to
the
function
of
ordinary
banking
such
as
other
depositor
have
it
buy
and
sell
its
own
exchange
and
these
dealing
extend
over
many
year
have
make
its
bill
of
exchange
acceptable
all
over
the
world
character
the
essential
thing
in
speak
of
the
real
begin
of
the
standard
oil
company
it
should
be
remember
that
it
be
not
so
much
the
consolidation
of
the
firm
in
which
we
have
a
personal
interest
but
the
come
together
of
the
men
who
have
the
combine
brain
power
to
do
the
work
which
be
the
actual
start
point
perhaps
it
be
worth
while
to
emphasize
again
the
fact
that
it
be
not
merely
capital
and
plant
and
the
strictly
material
thing
which
make
up
a
business
but
the
character
of
the
men
behind
these
thing
their
personality
and
their
ability
these
be
the
essential
to
be
reckon
with
late
in
we
begin
the
purchase
of
some
of
the
more
important
of
the
refinery
interest
of
cleveland
the
condition
be
so
chaotic
and
uncertain
that
most
of
the
refiner
be
very
desirous
to
get
out
of
the
business
we
invariably
offer
those
who
want
to
sell
the
option
of
take
cash
or
stock
in
the
company
we
very
much
prefer
to
have
them
take
the
stock
because
a
dollar
in
those
day
look
as
large
as
a
cart
wheel
but
as
a
matter
of
business
policy
we
found
it
desirable
to
offer
them
the
option
and
in
most
case
they
be
even
precipitate
in
their
choice
of
the
cash
they
knew
what
a
dollar
would
buy
but
they
be
very
sceptical
in
regard
to
the
possibility
of
resurrect
the
oil
business
and
give
any
permanent
value
to
these
share
these
purchase
continued
over
a
period
of
year
during
which
many
of
the
more
important
refinery
at
cleveland
be
bought
by
the
standard
oil
company
some
of
the
small
concern
however
continued
in
the
business
for
many
year
although
they
have
the
same
opportunity
as
others
to
sell
there
be
always
at
other
refining
point
which
be
regard
as
more
favourably
locate
than
cleveland
many
refinery
in
successful
operation
the
backus
purchase
all
these
purchase
of
refinery
be
conduct
with
the
utmost
fairness
and
good
faith
on
our
part
yet
in
many
quarter
the
story
of
certain
of
these
transaction
have
be
told
in
such
form
as
to
give
the
impression
that
the
sale
be
make
most
unwillingly
and
only
because
the
seller
be
force
to
make
them
by
the
most
ruthless
exertion
of
superior
power
there
be
one
transaction
viz
the
purchase
of
the
property
of
the
backus
oil
company
which
have
be
variously
exploit
and
i
be
make
to
appear
as
have
personally
robbed
a
defenceless
widow
of
an
extremely
valuable
property
pay
her
therefor
only
a
mere
fraction
of
its
worth
the
story
as
told
be
one
which
make
the
strong
appeal
to
the
sympathy
and
if
it
be
true
would
represent
a
shock
instance
of
cruelty
in
crush
a
defenceless
woman
it
be
probable
that
its
wide
circulation
and
its
acceptance
as
true
by
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
fact
have
awaken
more
hostility
against
the
standard
oil
company
and
against
me
personally
than
any
charge
which
have
be
make
this
be
my
reason
for
enter
so
much
into
detail
in
this
particular
case
which
i
be
exceedingly
reluctant
to
do
and
for
many
year
have
refrain
from
do
mr
f
m
backus
a
highly
respect
citizen
of
cleveland
and
an
old
and
personal
friend
of
mine
have
for
several
year
prior
to
his
death
in
be
engage
in
the
lubricate
oil
business
which
be
carry
on
after
his
death
as
a
corporation
know
as
the
backus
oil
company
in
the
latter
part
of
our
company
purchase
certain
portion
of
the
property
of
this
company
the
negotiation
which
lead
to
this
purchase
extend
over
several
week
be
conduct
on
behalf
of
mr
backus
as
the
principal
stockholder
by
mr
charles
h
marr
and
on
behalf
of
our
company
by
mr
peter
s
jennings
i
personally
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
negotiation
except
that
when
the
matter
first
come
up
mr
backus
request
me
to
call
at
her
house
which
i
do
when
she
spoke
of
sell
the
property
to
our
company
and
request
me
to
personally
conduct
the
negotiation
with
her
with
reference
to
it
this
i
be
oblige
to
decline
to
do
because
as
i
then
explain
to
her
i
be
not
familiar
with
the
detail
of
the
business
in
that
conversation
i
advise
her
not
to
take
any
hasty
action
and
when
she
express
fear
about
the
future
of
the
business
state
for
example
that
she
could
not
get
car
to
transport
sufficient
oil
i
say
to
her
that
though
we
be
use
our
car
and
require
them
in
our
business
yet
we
would
loan
her
any
number
she
need
and
do
anything
else
in
reason
to
assist
her
and
i
do
not
see
why
she
could
not
successfully
prosecute
her
business
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
i
told
her
however
that
if
after
reflection
she
desire
to
pursue
negotiation
for
the
sale
of
her
property
some
of
our
people
familiar
with
the
lubricate
oil
business
would
take
up
the
question
with
her
as
she
still
express
a
desire
to
have
our
company
buy
her
property
negotiation
be
take
up
by
mr
jennings
and
the
only
other
thing
that
i
have
to
do
with
the
matter
be
that
when
our
expert
report
that
in
their
judgment
the
value
of
the
work
good
will
and
successorship
which
we
have
decide
to
buy
be
worth
a
certain
sum
i
ask
them
to
add
in
order
to
make
doubly
sure
that
she
receive
full
value
the
sale
be
consummate
as
we
suppose
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
mr
backus
and
the
purchase
price
which
have
be
agree
upon
be
paid
to
my
profound
astonishment
a
day
or
two
after
the
transaction
have
be
close
i
receive
from
her
a
very
unkind
letter
complain
that
she
have
be
unjustly
treat
after
investigate
the
matter
i
write
her
the
follow
letter
november
dear
madam
i
have
held
your
note
of
the
th
inst
receive
yesterday
until
to
day
as
i
wish
to
thoroughly
review
every
point
connect
with
the
negotiation
for
the
purchase
of
the
stock
of
the
backus
oil
company
to
satisfy
myself
as
to
whether
i
have
unwittingly
do
anything
whereby
you
could
have
any
right
to
feel
injured
it
be
true
that
in
the
interview
i
have
with
you
i
suggest
that
if
you
desire
to
do
so
you
could
retain
an
interest
in
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
by
keep
some
number
of
its
share
and
then
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
you
sell
out
you
wish
to
go
entirely
out
of
the
business
that
be
my
understand
our
arrangement
be
make
in
case
you
conclude
to
make
the
sale
that
preclude
any
other
interest
be
represent
and
therefore
when
you
do
make
the
inquiry
as
to
your
take
some
of
the
stock
our
answer
be
give
in
accordance
with
the
fact
note
above
but
not
at
all
in
the
spirit
in
which
you
refer
to
the
refusal
in
your
note
in
regard
to
the
reference
that
you
make
as
to
my
permit
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
to
be
take
from
you
i
say
that
in
this
as
in
all
else
you
have
write
in
your
letter
of
the
th
inst
you
do
me
most
grievous
wrong
it
be
but
of
little
moment
to
the
interest
represent
by
me
whether
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
be
purchase
or
not
i
believe
that
it
be
for
your
interest
to
make
the
sale
and
be
entirely
candid
in
this
statement
and
beg
to
call
your
attention
to
the
time
some
two
year
ago
when
you
consult
mr
flagler
and
myself
as
to
sell
out
your
interest
to
mr
rise
at
which
time
you
be
desirous
of
sell
at
considerably
less
price
and
upon
time
than
you
have
now
receive
in
cash
and
which
sale
you
would
have
be
glad
to
have
close
if
you
could
have
obtain
satisfactory
security
for
the
defer
payment
as
to
the
price
paid
for
the
property
it
be
certainly
three
time
great
than
the
cost
at
which
we
could
now
construct
equal
or
well
facility
but
wish
to
take
a
liberal
view
of
it
i
urge
the
proposal
of
pay
which
be
thought
much
too
high
by
some
of
our
party
i
believe
that
if
you
would
reconsider
what
you
have
write
in
your
letter
to
which
this
be
a
reply
you
must
admit
have
do
me
great
injustice
and
i
be
satisfied
to
await
upon
your
innate
sense
of
right
for
such
admission
however
in
view
of
what
seem
to
be
your
present
feel
i
now
offer
to
restore
to
you
the
purchase
make
by
us
you
simply
return
the
amount
of
money
which
we
have
invest
and
leave
us
as
though
no
purchase
have
be
make
should
you
not
desire
to
accept
this
proposal
i
offer
to
you
or
share
of
the
stock
at
the
same
price
that
we
paid
for
the
same
with
this
addition
that
if
we
keep
the
property
we
be
under
engagement
to
pay
into
the
treasury
of
the
backus
oil
company
any
amount
which
add
to
the
amount
already
paid
would
make
a
total
of
and
thereby
make
the
share
each
that
you
may
not
be
compel
to
hastily
come
to
a
conclusion
i
will
leave
open
for
three

for
your
acceptance

can
convince

financially
be
the
sale
of
her
interest
in
the
backus
oil
company
to
your
people
she
do
not
know
that
five
more
year
of
the
then
increase
desperate
competition
would
have
bankrupt
the
company
and
that
with
the
big
debt
that
she
be
carry
on
the
lot
on
euclid
avenue
near
sheriff
street
she
would
have
be
swamp
and
that
the
only
thing
that
ever
save
her
and
the
oil
business
generally
be
the
plan
of
john
d
rockefeller
she
think
that
you
literally
robbed
her
of
million
and
feed
her
child
on
that
diet
three
time
a
day
more
or
less
principally
more
until
it
have
become
a
mania
with
her
and
no
argument
that
any
one
else
can
suggest
will
have
any
effect
upon
her
she
be
wise
and
good
in
many
way
but
on
that
one
subject
she
be
one
side
i
think
of
course
if
we
could
have
be
assure
of
continued
dividend
i
would
have
be
oppose
to
sell
the
business
but
that
be
out
of
the
question
i
know
of
the
ten
thousand
dollar
that
be
add
to
the
purchase
price
of
the
property
at
your
request
and
i
know
that
you
paid
three
time
the
value
of
the
property
and
i
know
that
all
that
ever
save
our
company
from
ruin
be
the
sale
of
its
property
to
you
and
i
simply
want
to
ease
my
mind
by
do
justice
to
you
by
say
so
after
the
sale
to
your
company
i
be
simple
enough
to
go
to
buffalo
and
try
it
again
but
soon
met
with
defeat
and
retire
with
my
flag
in
the
dust
i
then
go
to
duluth
and
be
on
the
top
wave
till
the
real
estate
bubble
broke
and
i
broke
with
it
i
have
have
my
ups
and
down
but
i
have
try
to
take
my
medicine
and
look
pleasant
instead
of
sit
down
under
a
juniper
tree
and
blame
my
loss
to
john
d
rockefeller
i
suppose
i
would
have
put
off
write
this
letter
for
another
year
or
more
as
i
have
do
so
long
have
it
not
be
for
a
little
chat
that
i
have
with
mr
hanafin
superintendent
of
the
buckeye
pipe
line

a
day
or
two
since
when
i
be

etc
of
the
old
b
o
co
s

and
in
that
way
revive
the
intention
that
have
lain
dormant
since
the
last
good
resolution
in
regard
to
write
it
be
make
but
it
be
do
now
and
off

respect
and
admiration

conclude
during
these

mr

be
anxious
to
sell
and
be
entirely
satisfied
with
the
sale
after
it
be
conclude
i
know
of
the
fact
that
about
a
year
and
a
half
previous
she
have
offer
to
sell
out
the
stock
of
the
backus
oil
company
at
from
to
per
cent
less
than
she
receive
in
the
sale
refer
to
and
the
value
of
the
work
and
property
sell
have
not
increase
in
the
meantime
i
be
well
acquaint
with
the
work
of
the
backus
oil
company
and
their
value
i
could
at
the
time
of
the
sale
have
built
the
work
new
for
there
be
no
threat
nor
intimidation
nor
anything
of
the
kind
use
to
force
the
sale
the
negotiation
be
pleasant
and
fair
and
the
price
paid
in
excess
of
the
value
and
satisfactory
to
mr
backus
and
all
concerned
for
her
so
far
as
i
can
see
after
more
than
year
have
elapse
there
be
nothing
but
the
most
kindly
and
considerate
treatment
of
mr
backus
on
the
part
of
the
standard
oil
company
i
regret
that
mr
backus
do
not
take
at
least
part
of
her
pay
in
standard
certificate
as
we
suggest
she
should
do
the
question
of
rebate
of
all
the
subject
which
seem
to
have
attract
the
attention
of
the
public
to
the
affair
of
the
standard
oil
company
the
matter
of
rebate
from
railroad
have
perhaps
be
uppermost
the
standard
oil
company
of
ohio
of
which
i
be
president
do
receive
rebate
from
the
railroad
prior
to
but
receive
no
advantage
for
which
it
do
not
give
full
compensation
the
reason
for
rebate
be
that
such
be
the
railroad
method
of
business
a
public
rate
be
make
and
collect
by
the
railroad
company
but
so
far
as
my
knowledge
extends
be
seldom
retain
in
full
a
portion
of
it
be
repaid
to
the
shipper
as
a
rebate
by
this
method
the
real
rate
of
freight
which
any
shipper
paid
be
not
know
by
his
competitor
nor
by
other
railroad
company
the
amount
be
a
matter
of
bargain
with
the
carry
company
each
shipper
make
the
best
bargain
that
he
could
but
whether
he
be
do
well
than
his
competitor
be
only
a
matter
of
conjecture
much
depend
upon
whether
the
shipper
have
the
advantage
of
competition
of
carrier
the
standard
oil
company
of
ohio
be
situate
at
cleveland
have
the
advantage
of
different
carry
line
as
well
as
of
water
transportation
in
the
summer
take
advantage
of
those
facility
it
make
the
best
bargain
possible
for
its
freight
other
company
sought
to
do
the
same
the
standard
give
advantage
to
the
railroad
for
the
purpose
of
reduce
the
cost
of
transportation
of
freight
it
offer
freight
in
large
quantity
car
load
and
train
load
it
furnish
load
facility
and
discharge
facility
at
great
cost
it
provide
regular
traffic
so
that
a
railroad
could
conduct
its
transportation
to
the
best
advantage
and
use
its
equipment
to
the
full
extent
of
its
haul
capacity
without
wait
for
the
refiner
convenience
it
exempt
railroad
from
liability
for
fire
and
carry
its
own
insurance
it
provide
at
its
own
expense
terminal
facility
which
permit
economy
in
handle
for
these
service
it
obtain
contract
for
special
allowance
on
freight
but
notwithstanding
these
special
allowance
this
traffic
from
the
standard
oil
company
be
far
more
profitable
to
the
railroad
company
than
the
small
and
irregular
traffic
which
might
have
paid
a
high
rate
to
understand
the
situation
which
affected
the
give
and
take
of
rebate
it
must
be
remember
that
the
railroad
be
all
eager
to
enlarge
their
freight
traffic
they
be
compete
with
the
facility
and
rate
offer
by
the
boat
on
lake
and
canal
and
by
the
pipe
line
all
these
mean
of
transport
oil
cut
into
the
business
of
the
railroad
and
they
be
desperately
anxious
to
successfully
meet
this
competition
as
i
have
state
we
provide
mean
for
load
and
unload
car
expeditiously
agree
to
furnish
a
regular
fix
number
of
car
load
to
transport
each
day
and
arrange
with
them
for
all
the
other
thing
that
i
have
mention
the
final
result
be
to
reduce
the
cost
of
transportation
for
both
the
railroad
and
ourselves
all
this
be
follow
in
the
natural
law
of
trade
pipe
line
v
railroad
the
building
of
the
pipe
line
introduce
another
formidable
competitor
to
the
railroad
but
as
oil
could
be
transport
by
pump
through
pipe
at
a
much
less
cost
than
by
haul
in
tank
car
in
a
railroad
train
the
development
of
the
pipe
line
be
inevitable
the
question
be
simply
whether
the
oil
traffic
be
sufficient
in
volume
to
make
the
investment
profitable
when
pipe
line
have
be
built
to
oil
field
where
the
well
have
cease
to
yield
as
often
happen
they
be
about
the
most
useless
property
imaginable
an
interest
feature
developed
through
the
relation
which
grow
up
between
the
railroad
and
the
pipe
line
in
many
case
it
be
necessary
to
combine
the
facility
of
both
because
the
pipe
reach
only
part
of
the
way
and
from
the
place
where
they
end
the
railroad
carry
the
oil
to
its
final
destination
in
some
instance
a
railroad
have
formerly
carry
the
oil
the
entire
distance
upon
an
agree
rate
but
now
that
this
oil
be
partly
pumped
by
pipe
line
and
partly
carry
by
rail
the
freight
payment
be
divide
between
the
two
but
as
a
through
rate
have
be
provide
the
owner
of
the
pipe
line
agree
to
remit
a
part
of
its
charge
to
the
railroad
so
we
have
case
where
the
standard
paid
a
rebate
to
the
railroad
instead
of
the
reverse
but
i
do
not
remember
have
heard
any
complaint
of
this
come
from
the
student
of
these
complicate
subject
the
profit
of
the
standard
oil
company
do
not
come
from
advantage
give
by
railroad
the
railroad
rather
be
the
one
who
profit
by
the
traffic
of
the
standard
oil
company
and
whatever
advantage
it
receive
in
its
constant
effort
to
reduce
rate
of
freight
be
only
one
of
the
many
element
of
lessen
cost
to
the
consumer
which
enable
us
to
increase
our
volume
of
business
the
world
over
because
we
could
reduce
the
sell
price
how
general
be
the
complicate
bargaining
for
rate
can
hardly
be
imagine
everyone
get
the
best
rate
that
he
could
after
the
passage
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
it
be
learn
that
many
small
company
which
ship
limited
quantity
have
receive
low
rate
than
we
have
be
able
to
secure
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
have
make
large
investment
to
provide
for
terminal
facility
regular
shipment
and
other
economy
i
well
remember
a
bright
man
from
boston
who
have
much
to
say
about
rebate
and
drawback
he
be
an
old
and
experienced
merchant
and
look
after
his
affair
with
a
cautious
and
watchful
eye
he
fear
that
some
of
his
competitor
be
do
well
than
he
in
bargaining
for
rate
and
he
deliver
himself
of
this
conviction
i
be
oppose
on
principle
to
the
whole
system
of
rebate
and
drawback
unless
i
be
in
it
chapter
v
other
business
experience
and
business
principle
go
into
the
iron
ore
field
be
one
of
those
experience
in
which
one
find
oneself
rather
against
the
will
for
it
be
not
a
deliberate
plan
of
mine
to
extend
my
care
and
responsibility
my
connection
with
iron
ore
come
about
through
some
unfortunate
investment
in
the
northwest
country
these
interest
have
include
a
good
many
different
industry
mine
steel
mill
paper
mill
a
nail
factory
railroad
lumber
field
smelt
property
and
other
investment
about
which
i
have
now
forgotten
i
be
a
minority
stockholder
in
all
these
enterprise
and
have
no
part
in
their
management
not
all
of
them
be
profitable
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
a
period
of
year
just
precede
the
panic
of
value
be
more
or
less
inflate
and
many
people
who
thought
they
be
wealthy
found
that
the
actual
fact
be
quite
different
from
what
they
have
imagine
when
the
hard
experience
of
that
panic
force
upon
them
the
unpalatable
truth
most
of
these
property
i
have
not
even
see
have
rely
upon
the
investigation
of
others
respect
their
worth
indeed
it
have
never
be
my
custom
to
rely
alone
upon
my
own
knowledge
of
the
value
of
such
plant
i
have
found
other
people
who
knew
much
well
than
i
how
to
investigate
such
enterprise
even
at
this
time
i
have
be
planning
to
relieve
myself
of
business
care
and
the
panic
only
cause
me
to
postpone
take
the
long
holiday
to
which
i
have
be
look
forward
i
be
fortunate
in
make
the
acquaintance
of
mr
frederick
t
gate
who
be
then
engage
in
some
work
in
connection
with
the
american
baptist
education
society
which
require
him
to
travel
extensively
over
the
country
north
south
east
and
west
it
occur
to
me
that
mr
gate
who
have
a
great
store
of
common
sense
though
no
especial
technical
information
about
factory
and
mill
might
aid
me
in
secure
some
first
hand
information
as
to
how
these
concern
be
actually
prosper
once
as
he
be
go
south
i
suggest
that
he
look
over
an
iron
mill
in
which
i
have
some
interest
which
happen
to
be
on
his
route
his
report
be
a
model
of
what
such
a
report
should
be
it
state
the
fact
and
in
this
case
they
be
almost
all
unfavourable
a
little
later
he
happen
to
be
go
west
and
i
give
him
the
name
and
address
of
property
in
that
region
in
which
i
held
a
minority
interest
i
felt
quite
sure
that
this
particular
property
be
do
well
and
it
be
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
me
to
learn
through
his
clear
and
definite
account
that
it
be
only
a
question
of
time
before
this
enterprise
too
which
have
be
represent
as
roll
in
money
would
get
into
trouble
if
thing
kept
on
as
they
be
go
nursing
the
commercially
ill
i
then
arrange
with
mr
gate
to
accept
a
position
whereby
he
could
help
me
unravel
these
tangle
affair
and
become
like
myself
a
man
of
business
but
it
be
agree
between
us
that
he
should
not
abandon
his
large
and
more
important
plan
for
work
out
some
philanthropic
aspiration
that
he
have
right
here
i
may
stop
to
give
credit
to
mr
gate
for
possess
a
combination
of
rare
business
ability
very
highly
developed
and
very
honourably
exercise
overshadow
by
a
passion
to
accomplish
some
great
and
far
reach
benefit
to
mankind
the
influence
of
which
will
last
he
be
the
chairman
of
the
general
education
board
and
active
in
many
other
board
and
for
year
he
have
help
in
the
various
plan
that
we
have
be
interested
in
where
money
be
give
in
the
hope
that
it
would
do
something
more
than
temporary
service
mr
gate
have
for
many
year
be
closely
associate
with
my
personal
affair
he
have
be
through
strenuous
time
with
me
and
have
take
care
of
many
kind
off
my
shoulder
leave
me
more
time
to
play
golf
plan
road
move
tree
and
follow
other
congenial
occupation
his
effort
in
the
investigation
in
connection
with
our
educational
contribution
our
medical
research
and
other
kindred
work
have
be
very
successful
during
the
last
ten
or
twelve
year
my
son
have
share
with
mr
gate
the
responsibility
of
this
work
and
more
recently
mr
starr
j
murphy
have
also
join
with
us
to
help
mr
gate
who
have
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
and
have
well
earn
some
leisure
which
we
have
want
him
to
enjoy
but
to
return
to
the
story
of
our
troubled
investment
mr
gate
go
into
the
study
of
each
of
these
business
concern
and
do
the
best
he
could
with
them
it
have
be
our
policy
never
to
allow
a
company
in
which
we
have
an
interest
to
be
thrown
into
the
bankruptcy
court
if
we
could
prevent
it
for
receivership
be
very
costly
in
many
way
and
often
involve
heavy
sacrifice
of
genuine
value
our
plan
have
be
to
stay
with
the
institution
nurse
it
lend
it
money
when
necessary
improve
facility
cheapen
production
and
avail
ourselves
of
the
opportunity
which
time
and
patience
be
likely
to
bring
to
make
it
self
sustain
and
successful
so
we
go
carefully
through
the
affair
of
these
cripple
enterprise
in
the
hard
time
of
and
carry
many
of
them
for
year
after
sometimes
buying
the
interest
of
others
and
sometimes
sell
our
own
interest
but
all
or
nearly
all
escape
the
expense
and
humiliation
of
bankruptcy
receivership
and
foreclosure
before
these
matter
be
entirely
close
up
we
have
a
vast
amount
of
experience
in
the
doctor
of
the
commercially
ill
my
only
excuse
for
dwell
upon
the
subject
at
this
late
day
be
to
point
out
the
fact
to
some
business
men
who
get
discourage
that
much
can
be
do
by
careful
and
patient
attention
even
when
the
business
be
apparently
in
very
deep
water
it
require
two
thing
some
add
capital
put
in
by
one
self
or
secure
from
others
and
a
strict
adherence
to
the
sound
natural
law
of
business
the
ore
mine
among
these
investment
be
some
share
in
a
number
of
ore
mine
and
an
interest
in
the
stock
and
bond
of
a
railroad
be
built
to
carry
the
ore
from
the
mine
to
lake
port
we
have
great
faith
in
these
mine
but
to
work
them
the
railroad
be
necessary
it
have
be
begin
but
in
the
panic
of
it
and
all
other
development
be
nearly
ruin
although
we
be
minority
holder
of
the
stock
it
seem
to
be
up
to
us
to
keep
the
enterprise
alive
through
the
harrow
panic
day
i
have
to
loan
my
personal
security
to
raise
money
and
finally
we
be
compel
to
supply
a
great
deal
of
actual
cash
and
to
get
it
we
be
oblige
to
go
into
the
then
greatly
upset
money
market
and
buy
currency
at
a
high
premium
to
ship
west
by
express
to
pay
the
labourer
on
the
railroad
and
to
keep
them
alive
when
the
fright
of
the
panic
period
subside
and
matter
become
a
little
more
settle
we
begin
to
realize
our
situation
we
have
invest
many
million
and
no
one
want
to
go
in
with
us
to
buy
stock
on
the
contrary
everybody
else
seem
to
want
to
sell
the
stock
be
offer
to
us
in
alarm
quantity
substantially
all
of
the
capital
stock
of
the
company
come
without
any
solicitation
on
our
part
quite
the
contrary
and
we
paid
for
it
in
cash
we
now
found
ourselves
in
control
of
a
great
amount
of
ore
land
from
some
of
which
the
ore
could
be
remove
by
a
steam
shovel
for
a
few
cent
a
ton
but
we
still
face
a
most
imperfect
and
inadequate
method
of
transport
the
ore
to
market
when
we
realize
that
event
be
shape
themselves
so
that
to
protect
our
investment
we
should
be
oblige
to
go
into
the
business
of
sell
in
a
large
way
we
felt
that
we
must
not
stop
short
of
do
the
work
as
effectively
as
possible
and
have
already
put
in
so
much
money
we
bought
all
the
ore
land
that
we
thought
be
good
that
be
offer
to
us
the
railroad
and
the
ship
be
only
a
mean
to
an
end
the
ore
land
be
the
crux
of
the
whole
matter
and
we
believe
that
we
could
never
have
too
many
good
mine
it
be
a
surprise
to
me
that
the
great
iron
and
steel
manufacturer
do
not
place
what
seem
to
be
an
adequate
value
on
these
mine
the
land
which
contain
a
good
many
of
our
best
ore
mine
could
have
be
purchase
very
cheaply
before
we
become
interested
have
launch
ourselves
into
the
venture
we
decide
to
supply
ore
to
every
one
who
need
it
by
mining
and
transport
with
the
new
and
most
effective
facility
and
our
profit
we
invest
in
more
ore
land
mr
gate
become
the
president
of
the
various
company
which
own
the
mine
and
the
railroad
to
the
lake
to
transport
the
ore
and
he
start
to
learn
and
develop
the
business
of
ore
mining
and
transportation
he
not
only
prove
to
be
an
apt
scholar
but
he
really
master
the
various
complexity
of
the
business
he
do
all
the
work
and
only
consult
me
when
he
wish
to
yet
i
remember
several
interest
experience
connect
with
the
work
out
of
these
problem
building
the
ship
after
this
railroad
problem
be
solve
it
be
apparent
that
we
need
our
own
ship
to
transport
the
ore
down
the
lake
we
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
building
ship
for
ore
transportation
and
so
follow
out
our
custom
we
go
to
the
man
who
in
our
judgment
have
the
wide
knowledge
of
the
subject
he
be
already
well
know
to
us
but
be
in
the
ore
transportation
business
on
a
large
scale
on
his
own
account
and
of
course
the
moment
we
begin
to
ship
ore
we
realize
that
we
would
become
competitor
mr
gate
get
into
communication
with
this
expert
and
come
with
him
one
even
to
my
house
in
new
york
just
before
dinner
he
say
he
could
stay
only
a
few
minute
but
i
told
him
that
i
thought
we
could
finish
up
our
affair
in
ten
minute
and
we
do
this
be
the
only
time
i
remember
see
personally
any
one
on
the
business
of
the
ore
company
all
the
conference
as
i
say
before
be
carry
on
by
mr
gate
who
seem
to
enjoy
work
and
he
have
have
abundant
privilege
in
that
direction
we
explain
to
this
gentleman
that
we
be
propose
to
transport
our
ore
from
these
lake
superior
land
ourselves
and
that
we
should
like
to
have
him
assume
charge
of
the
construction
of
several
ship
to
be
of
the
large
and
most
approve
type
for
our
chance
of
success
lay
in
have
boat
which
could
be
operate
with
the
great
efficiency
at
that
time
the
large
ship
carry
about
five
thousand
ton
but
in
when
we
sell
out
we
have
ship
that
carry
seven
thousand
or
eight
thousand
ton
and
now
there
be
some
that
transport
as
much
as
ten
thousand
ton
and
more
this
expert
naturally
reply
that
as
he
be
in
the
ore
carry
trade
himself
he
have
no
desire
to
encourage
us
to
go
into
it
we
explain
to
him
that
as
we
have
make
this
large
investment
it
seem
to
us
to
be
necessary
for
the
protection
of
our
interest
to
control
our
own
lake
carrier
so
we
have
decide
to
mine
ship
and
market
the
ore
that
we
come
to
him
because
he
could
plan
and
superintend
the
construction
of
the
best
ship
for
us
and
that
we
want
to
deal
with
him
for
that
reason
that
notwithstanding
that
he
represent
one
of
the
large
firm
among
our
competitor
we
knew
that
he
be
honest
and
straightforward
and
that
we
be
most
anxious
to
deal
with
him
employ
a
competitor
he
still
demur
but
we
try
to
convince
him
that
we
be
not
to
be
deter
from
go
into
the
trade
and
that
we
be
willing
to
pay
him
a
satisfactory
commission
for
look
after
the
building
of
the
ship
somebody
we
explain
be
go
to
do
the
work
for
us
and
he
might
as
well
have
the
profit
as
the
next
man
this
argument
finally
seem
to
impress
him
and
we
then
and
there
close
an
agreement
the
detail
of
which
be
work
out
afterward
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
this
gentleman
be
mr
samuel
mather
of
cleveland
he
spent
only
a
few
minute
in
the
house
during
which
time
we
give
him
the
order
for
about
worth
of
ship
and
this
be
the
only
time
i
saw
him
but
mr
mather
be
a
man
of
high
business
honour
we
trust
him
implicitly
although
he
be
a
competitor
and
we
never
have
occasion
to
regret
it
at
that
time
there
be
some
nine
or
ten
shipbuilding
company
locate
at
various
point
on
the
great
lake
all
be
independent
of
each
other
and
there
be
sharp
competition
between
them
time
be
pretty
hard
with
them
their
business
have
not
yet
recover
from
the
panic
of
they
be
not
able
to
keep
their
work
in
full
operation
it
be
in
the
fall
of
the
year
and
many
of
their
employee
be
face
a
hard
winter
we
take
this
into
account
in
consider
how
many
ship
we
should
build
and
we
make
up
our
mind
that
we
would
build
all
the
ship
that
could
be
built
and
give
employment
to
the
idle
men
on
the
great
lake
accordingly
we
instruct
mr
mather
to
write
to
each
firm
of
shipbuilder
and
ascertain
how
many
ship
they
could
build
and
put
in
readiness
for
operation
at
the
opening
of
navigation
the
next
spring
he
found
that
some
company
could
build
one
some
could
build
two
and
that
the
total
number
would
be
twelve
accordingly
we
ask
him
to
have
construct
twelve
ship
all
of
steel
all
of
the
large
capacity
then
understood
to
be
practicable
on
the
great
lake
some
of
them
be
to
be
steamship
and
some
consort
for
tow
but
all
be
to
be
built
on
substantially
the
same
general
pattern
which
be
to
represent
the
best
ideal
then
prevalent
for
ore
carry
ship
in
give
such
an
order
he
be
expose
of
course
to
the
risk
of
pay
very
high
price
this
would
have
be
certain
if
mr
mather
have
announce
in
advance
that
he
be
prepared
to
build
twelve
ship
and
ask
bid
on
them
just
how
he
manage
it
i
be
not
told
until
long
after
and
though
it
be
now
an
old
story
of
the
lake
i
repeat
it
as
it
may
be
new
to
many
mr
mather
kept
the
secret
of
the
number
of
ship
he
wish
to
construct
absolutely
to
himself
he
sent
his
plan
and
specification
each
substantially
a
duplicate
of
the
others
to
each
of
the
firm
and
ask
each
firm
to
bid
on
one
or
two
ship
as
the
case
might
be
all
naturally
suppose
that
at
most
only
two
ship
be
to
be
built
and
each
be
extremely
eager
to
get
the
work
or
at
least
one
of
the
two
vessel
on
the
day
before
the
contract
be
to
be
let
all
the
bidder
be
in
cleveland
on
the
invitation
of
mr
mather
one
by
one
they
be
take
into
his
private
office
for
special
conference
cover
all
the
detail
preparatory
to
the
final
bid
at
the
appoint
hour
the
bid
be
in
deep
be
the
interest
on
the
part
of
all
the
gentleman
as
to
who
would
be
the
lucky
one
to
draw
the
prize
mr
mather
manner
have
convince
each
that
somehow
he
himself
must
be
the
favour
bidder
yet
when
he
come
to
meet
his
competitor
in
the
hotel
lobby
the
beam
of
satisfaction
which
plainly
emanate
from
their
face
also
compel
many
heart
searchings
at
last
the
crucial
hour
come
and
at
about
the
same
moment
each
gentleman
receive
a
little
note
from
mr
mather
convey
to
him
the
tidings
that
to
him
have
be
award
a
contract
sufficient
to
supply
his
work
to
their
utmost
capacity
they
all
rush
with
a
common
impulse
to
the
hotel
lobby
where
they
have
be
accustom
to
meet
each
bent
on
display
his
note
and
commiserate
his
unsuccessful
rival
only
to
discover
that
each
have
a
contract
for
all
he
could
do
and
that
each
have
be
actually
bidding
against
nobody
but
himself
great
be
the
hilarity
which
cover
their
chagrin
when
they
met
and
compare
note
and
look
into
each
others
face
however
all
be
happy
and
satisfied
but
it
may
be
say
in
passing
that
these
amiable
gentleman
all
united
subsequently
in
one
company
which
have
have
a
highly
satisfactory
career
and
that
we
paid
a
more
uniform
price
for
our
subsequent
purchase
of
ship
after
the
combination
have
be
make
a
landsman
for
ship
manager
with
these
ship
order
we
be
fairly
at
the
begin
of
the
ore
enterprise
but
we
realize
that
we
have
to
make
some
arrangement
to
operate
the
ship
and
we
again
turn
to
our
competitor
mr
mather
in
the
hope
that
he
would
add
this
to
his
care
unfortunately
because
of
his
obligation
to
others
he
felt
that
this
be
impractical
i
ask
mr
gate
one
day
soon
after
this
how
be
we
to
get
some
one
to
run
these
big
ship
we
have
order
do
you
know
of
any
experienced
firm
no
say
mr
gate
i
do
not
know
of
any
firm
to
suggest
at
the
moment
but
why
not
run
them
ourselves
you
do
not
know
anything
about
ship
do
you
no
he
admit
but
i
have
in
mind
a
man
who
i
believe
could
do
it
although
when
i
tell
you
about
him
i
fear
you
will
think
that
his
qualification
be
not
the
best
however
he
have
the
essential
he
life
up
the
state
and
never
be
on
a
ship
in
his
life
he
probably
would
not
know
the
bow
from
the
stern
or
a
sea
anchor
from
an
umbrella
but
he
have
good
sense
he
be
honest
enterprising
keen
and
thrifty
he
have
the
art
of
quickly
master
a
subject
even
though
it
be
new
to
him
and
difficult
we
still
have
some
month
before
the
ship
will
be
complete
and
if
we
put
him
to
work
now
he
will
be
ready
to
run
the
ship
as
soon
as
they
be
ready
to
be
run
all
right
i
say
let
give
him
the
job
and
we
do
that
man
be
mr
l
m
bower
he
come
from
broome
county
new
york
mr
bower
go
from
point
to
point
on
the
lake
where
the
boat
be
building
and
study
them
minutely
he
be
quickly
able
to
make
valuable
suggestion
about
their
construction
which
be
approve
and
adopt
by
the
designer
when
the
vessel
be
finish
he
take
charge
of
them
from
the
moment
they
float
and
he
manage
these
and
the
dozen
which
follow
with
a
skill
and
ability
that
command
the
admiration
of
all
the
sailor
on
the
lake
he
even
invent
an
anchor
which
he
use
with
our
fleet
and
later
it
be
adopt
by
other
vessel
and
i
have
heard
that
it
be
use
in
the
united
state
navy
he
remain
in
his
position
until
we
sell
out
we
have
give
mr
bower
all
sort
of
hard
task
since
we
retire
from
the
lake
traffic
and
have
found
him
always
successful
lately
the
health
of
a
member
of
his
family
have
make
it
desirable
for
him
to
live
in
colorado
and
he
be
now
the
vigorous
and
efficient
vice
president
of
the
colorado
fuel
and
iron
company
the
great
ship
and
the
railroad
put
us
in
possession
of
the
most
favourable
facility
from
the
first
the
organization
be
successful
we
built
up
a
huge
trade
mining
and
carry
ore
to
cleveland
and
other
lake
port
we
kept
on
building
and
develop
until
finally
the
fleet
grow
until
it
include
fifty
six
large
steel
vessel
this
enterprise
in
common
with
many
other
important
business
undertaking
in
which
i
be
interested
require
very
little
of
my
personal
attention
owe
to
my
good
fortune
in
have
active
competent
and
thoroughly
reliable
representative
who
assume
so
largely
the
responsibility
of
administration
it
give
me
pleasure
to
state
that
the
confidence
which
i
have
freely
give
to
business
men
with
whom
i
have
be
associate
have
be
so
fully
justified
sell
to
the
steel
company
the
work
go
on
uninterruptedly
and
prosperously
until
the
formation
of
the
united
state
steel
corporation
a
representative
of
this
corporation
come
to
see
us
about
sell
the
land
the
ore
and
the
fleet
of
ship
the
business
be
go
on
smoothly
and
we
have
no
press
need
to
sell
but
as
the
organizer
of
the
new
company
felt
that
our
mine
and
railroad
and
ship
be
a
necessary
part
of
the
scheme
we
told
him
we
would
be
pleased
to
facilitate
the
completion
of
the
great
undertaking
they
have
i
think
already
close
with
mr
carnegie
for
his
various
property
after
some
negotiation
they
make
an
offer
which
we
accepted
whereby
the
whole
plant
mine
ship
railway
etc
should
become
a
part
of
the
united
state
steel
corporation
the
price
paid
be
we
felt
very
moderate
consider
the
present
and
prospective
value
of
the
property
this
transaction
bid
fair
to
show
a
great
profit
to
the
steel
company
for
many
year
and
as
our
payment
be
largely
in
the
security
of
the
company
we
have
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
prosperity
and
so
after
a
period
of
about
seven
year
i
go
out
of
all
association
with
the
mining
the
transport
and
the
sell
of
iron
ore
follow
the
law
of
trade
go
over
again
in
my
mind
the
event
connect
with
this
ore
experience
that
grow
out
of
investment
that
seem
at
the
time
to
say
the
least
rather
unpromising
i
be
impressed
anew
with
the
importance
of
a
principle
i
have
often
refer
to
if
i
can
make
this
point
clear
to
the
young
man
who
have
have
the
patience
to
follow
these
reminiscence
so
far
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
and
i
hope
it
may
be
a
benefit
to
him
the
underlie
essential
element
of
success
in
business
affair
be
to
follow
the
establish
law
of
high
class
deal
keep
to
broad
and
sure
line
and
study
them
to
be
certain
that
they
be
correct
one
watch
the
natural
operation
of
trade
and
keep
within
them
do
not
even
think
of
temporary
or
sharp
advantage
do
not
waste
your
effort
on
a
thing
which
end
in
a
petty
triumph
unless
you
be
satisfied
with
a
life
of
petty
success
be
sure
that
before
you
go
into
an
enterprise
you
see
your
way
clear
to
stay
through
to
a
successful
end
look
ahead
it
be
surprising
how
many
bright
business
men
go
into
important
undertaking
with
little
or
no
study
of
the
control

they
risk
their
all

that
you
be
not
deceive
yourself
at
any
time
about
actual

the
man
who
start
out
simply
with
the
idea
of
get
rich
wo
not
succeed
you
must
have
a
large
ambition
there
be
no
mystery
in
business
success
the
great
industrial
leader
have
told
again
and
again
the
plain
and
obvious
fact
that
there
can
be
no
permanent
success
without
fair
deal
that
lead
to
wide
spread
confidence
in
the
man
himself
and
that
be
the
real
capital
we
all
prize
and
work
for
if
you
do
each
day
task
successfully
and
stay
faithfully
within
these
natural
operation
of
commercial
law
which
i
talk
so
much
about
and
keep
your
head
clear
you
will
come
out
all
right
and
will
then
perhaps
forgive
me
for
moralize
in
this
old
fashion
way
it
be
hardly
necessary
to
caution
a
young
man
who
read
so
sober
a
book
as
this
not
to
lose
his
head
over
a
little
success
or
to
grow
impatient
or
discourage
by
a
little
failure
panic
experience
i
have
desire
to
retire
from
business
in
the
early
ninety
have
begin
work
so
young
i
felt
that
at
fifty
it
be
due
me
to
have
freedom
from
absorption
in
active
business
affair
and
to
devote
myself
to
a
variety
of
interest
other
than
money
make
which
have
claimed
a
portion
of
my
time
since
the
begin
of
my
business
career
but
be
year
of
ominous
outlook
in
the
storm
broke
and
i
have
many
investment
to
care
for
as
i
have
already
related
this
year
and
the
next
be
a
try
period
of
grave
anxiety
to
everyone
no
one
could
retire
from
work
at
such
a
time
in
the
standard
we
continued
to
make
progress
even
through
all
these
panic
year
as
we
have
large
reserve
of
cash
on
account
of
our
very
conservative
method
of
financing
in
or
i
be
able
to
carry
out
my
plan
to
be
relieve
from
any
association
with
the
actual
management
of
the
company
affair
from
that
time
as
i
have
say
i
have
have
little
or
no
part
in
the
conduct
of
the
business
since
i
can
remember
all
the
great
panic
but
i
believe
the
panic
of
be
the
most
try
no
one
escape
from
it
great
or
small
important
institution
have
to
be
support
and
carry
through
the
time
of
distrust
and
unreasoning
fear
to
mr
morgan
real
and
effective
help
i
should
join
with
other
business
men
and
give
great
praise
his
command
personality
serve
a
most
valuable
end
he
act
quickly
and
resolutely
when
quickness
and
decision
be
the
thing
most
need
to
regain
confidence
and
he
be
efficiently
second
by
many
able
and
lead
financier
of
the
country
who
cooeperated
courageously
and
effectively
to
restore
confidence
and
prosperity
the
question
have
be
ask
if
i
think
we
shall
revive
quickly
from
the
panic
of
october
i
hesitate
to
speak
on
the
subject
since
i
be
not
a
prophet
nor
the
son
of
a
prophet
but
as
to
the
ultimate
outcome
there
be
of
course
no
doubt
this
temporary
set
back
will
lead
to
safer
institution
and
more
conservative
management
upon
the
part
of
everyone
and
this
be
a
quality
we
need
it
will
not
long
depress
our
wonderful
spirit
of
initiative
the
country
resource
have
not
be
cut
down
nor
injured
by
financial
distrust
a
gradual
recovery
will
only
tend
to
make
the
future
all
the
more
secure
and
patience
be
a
virtue
in
business
affair
as
in
other
thing
here
again
i
would
venture
to
utter
a
word
of
caution
to
business
men
let
them
study
their
own
affair
frankly
and
face
the
truth
if
their
method
be
extravagant
let
them
realize
the
fact
and
act
accordingly
one
cannot
successfully
go
against
natural
tendency
and
it
be
folly
to
fail
to
recognize
them
it
be
not
easy
for
so
impressionable
and
imaginative
a
people
as
we
american
be
to
come
down
to
plain
hard
fact
yet
we
be
do
it
without
loss
of
self
esteem
or
prestige
throughout
the
world
chapter
vi
the
difficult
art
of
give
it
be
no
doubt
easy
to
write
platitude
and
generality
about
the
joy
of
give
and
the
duty
that
one
owes
to
one
fellow
men
and
to
put
together
again
all
the
familiar
phrase
that
have
serve
for
generation
whenever
the
subject
have
be
take
up
i
can
hardly
hope
to
succeed
in
start
any
new
interest
in
this
great
subject
when
gift
writer
have
so
often
fail
yet
i
confess
i
find
much
more
interest
in
it
at
this
time
than
in
ramble
on
as
i
have
be
do
about
the
affair
of
business
and
trade
it
be
most
difficult
however
to
dwell
upon
a
very
practical
and
business
like
side
of
benefaction
generally
without
seem
to
ignore
or
at
least
to
fail
to
appreciate
fully
the
spirit
of
give
which
have
its
source
in
the
heart
and
which
of
course
make
it
all
worth
while
in
this
country
we
have
come
to
the
period
when
we
can
well
afford
to
ask
the
ablest
men
to
devote
more
of
their
time
thought
and
money
to
the
public
well
be
i
be
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
attempt
to
define
exactly
what
this
betterment
work
should
consist
of
every
man
will
do
that
for
himself
and
his
own
conclusion
will
be
final
for
himself
it
be
well
i
think
that
no
narrow
or
preconceive
plan
should
be
set
down
as
the
best
i
be
sure
it
be
a
mistake
to
assume
that
the
possession
of
money
in
great
abundance
necessarily
brings
happiness
the
very
rich
be
just
like
all
the
rest
of
us
and
if
they
get
pleasure
from
the
possession
of
money
it
come
from
their
ability
to
do
thing
which
give
satisfaction
to
someone
besides
themselves
limitation
of
the
rich
the
mere
expenditure
of
money
for
thing
so
i
be
told
by
those
who
profess
to
know
soon
pall
upon
one
the
novelty
of
be
able
to
purchase
anything
one
want
soon
pass
because
what
people
most
seek
cannot
be
bought
with
money
these
rich
men
we
read
about
in
the
newspaper
cannot
get
personal
return
beyond
a
well
define
limit
for
their
expenditure
they
cannot
gratify
the
pleasure
of
the
palate
beyond
very
moderate
bound
since
they
cannot
purchase
a
good
digestion
they
cannot
lavish
very
much
money
on
fine
raiment
for
themselves
or
their
family
without
suffer
from
public
ridicule
and
in
their
home
they
cannot
go
much
beyond
the
comfort
of
the
less
wealthy
without
involve
them
in
more
pain
than
pleasure
as
i
study
wealthy
men
i
can
see
but
one
way
in
which
they
can
secure
a
real
equivalent
for
money
spent
and
that
be
to
cultivate
a
taste
for
give
where
the
money
may
produce
an
effect
which
will
be
a
last
gratification
a
man
of
business
may
often
most
properly
consider
that
he
do
his
share
in
building
up
a
property
which
give
steady
work
for
few
or
many
people
and
his
contribution
consists
in
give
to
his
employee
good
work
condition
new
opportunity
and
a
strong
stimulus
to
good
work
just
so
long
as
he
have
the
welfare
of
his
employee
in
his
mind
and
follow
his
conviction
no
one
can
help
honour
such
a
man
it
would
be
the
narrow
sort
of
view
to
take
and
i
think
the
mean
to
consider
that
good
work
consist
chiefly
in
the
outright
give
of
money
the
best
philanthropy
the
best
philanthropy
the
help
that
do
the
most
good
and
the
least
harm
the
help
that
nourishes
civilization
at
its
very
root
that
most
widely
disseminates
health
righteousness
and
happiness
be
not
what
be
usually
call
charity
it
be
in
my
judgment
the
investment
of
effort
or
time
or
money
carefully
consider
with
relation
to
the
power
of
employ
people
at
a
remunerative
wage
to
expand
and
develop
the
resource
at
hand
and
to
give
opportunity
for
progress
and
healthful
labour
where
it
do
not
exist
before
no
mere
money
give
be
comparable
to
this
in
its
last
and
beneficial
result
if
as
i
be
accustom
to
think
this
statement
be
a
correct
one
how
vast
indeed
be
the
philanthropic
field
it
may
be
urge
that
the
daily
vocation
of
life
be
one
thing
and
the
work
of
philanthropy
quite
another
i
have
no
sympathy
with
this
notion
the
man
who
plan
to
do
all
his
give
on
sunday
be
a
poor
prop
for
the
institution
of
the
country
the
excuse
for
refer
so
often
to
the
busy
man
of
affair
be
that
his
help
be
most
need
i
know
of
men
who
have
follow
out
this
large
plan
of
develop
work
not
as
a
temporary
matter
but
as
a
permanent
principle
these
men
have
take
up
doubtful
enterprise
and
carry
them
through
to
success
often
at
great
risk
and
in
the
face
of
great
scepticism
not
as
a
matter
only
of
personal
profit
but
in
the
large
spirit
of
general
uplift
disinterested
service
the
road
to
success
if
i
be
to
give
advice
to
a
young
man
start
out
in
life
i
should
say
to
him
if
you
aim
for
a
large
broad
gauge
success
do
not
begin
your
business
career
whether
you
sell
your
labour
or
be
an
independent
producer
with
the
idea
of
get
from
the
world
by
hook
or
crook
all
you
can
in
the
choice
of
your
profession
or
your
business
employment
let
your
first
thought
be
where
can
i
fit
in
so
that
i
may
be
most
effective
in
the
work
of
the
world
where
can
i
lend
a
hand
in
a
way
most
effectively
to
advance
the
general
interest
enter
life
in
such
a
spirit
choose
your
vocation
in
that
way
and
you
have
take
the
first
step
on
the
high
road
to
a
large
success
investigation
will
show
that
the
great
fortune
which
have
be
make
in
this
country
and
the
same
be
probably
true
of
other
land
have
come
to
men
who
have
perform
great
and
far
reach
economic
service
men
who
with
great
faith
in
the
future
of
their
country
have
do
most
for
the
development
of
its
resource
the
man
will
be
most
successful
who
confers
the
great
service
on
the
world
commercial
enterprise
that
be
need
by
the
public
will
pay
commercial
enterprise
that
be
not
need
fail
and
ought
to
fail
on
the
other
hand
the
one
thing
which
such
a
business
philosopher
would
be
most
careful
to
avoid
in
his
investment
of
time
and
effort
or
money
be
the
unnecessary
duplication
of
exist
industry
he
would
regard
all
money
spent
in
increase
needle
competition
as
waste
and
bad
the
man
who
put
up
a
second
factory
when
the
factory
in
existence
will
supply
the
public
demand
adequately
and
cheaply
be
waste
the
national
wealth
and
destroy
the
national
prosperity
take
the
bread
from
the
labourer
and
unnecessarily
introduce
heartache
and
misery
into
the
world
probably
the
great
single
obstacle
to
the
progress
and
happiness
of
the
american
people
lie
in
the
willingness
of
so
many
men
to
invest
their
time
and
money
in
multiply
competitive
industry
instead
of
opening
up
new
field
and
put
their
money
into

here
be
the

in

a

down
he
inflicts
heartache
and
misery
also
on
others
who
be
in
no

the
generosity
of
service
probably
the
most
generous
people
in
the
world
be
the
very
poor
who
assume
each
other
burden
in
the
crisis
which
come
so
often
to
the
hard
press
the
mother
in
the
tenement
fall
ill
and
the
neighbour
in
the
next
room
assumes
her
burden
the
father
loses
his
work
and
neighbour
supply
food
to
his
child
from
their
own
scanty
store
how
often
one
hears
of
case
where
the
orphan
be
take
over
and
brought
up
by
the
poor
friend
whose
benefaction
mean
great
additional
hardship
this
sort
of
genuine
service
make
the
most
princely
gift
from
superabundance
look
insignificant
indeed
the
jew
have
have
for
century
a
precept
that
one
tenth
of
a
man
possession
must
be
devote
to
good
work
but
even
this
measure
of
give
be
but
a
rough
yardstick
to
go
by
to
give
a
tenth
of
one
income
be
wellnigh
an
impossibility
to
some
while
to
others
it
mean
a
miserable
pittance
if
the
spirit
be
there
the
matter
of
proportion
be
soon
lose
sight
of
it
be
only
the
spirit
of
give
that
count
and
the
very
poor
give
without
any
self
consciousness
but
i
fear
that
i
be
deal
with
generality
again
the
education
of
child
in
my
early
day
may
have
be
straightlaced
yet
i
have
always
be
thankful
that
the
custom
be
quite
general
to
teach
young
people
to
give
systematically
of
money
that
they
themselves
have
earn
it
be
a
good
thing
to
lead
child
to
realize
early
the
importance
of
their
obligation
to
others
but
i
confess
it
be
increasingly
difficult
for
what
be
luxury
then
have
become
commonplace
now
it
should
be
a
great
pleasure
and
satisfaction
to
give
money
for
a
good
cause
than
to
earn
it
and
i
have
always
indulge
the
hope
that
during
my
life
i
should
be
able
to
help
establish
efficiency
in
give
so
that
wealth
may
be
of
great
use
to
the
present
and
future
generation
perhaps
just
here
lie
the
difference
between
the
gift
of
money
and
of
service
the
poor
meet
promptly
the
misfortune
which
confront
the
home
circle
and
household
of
the
neighbour
the
giver
of
money
if
his
contribution
be
to
be
valuable
must
add
service
in
the
way
of
study
and
he
must
help
to
attack
and
improve
underlie
condition
not
be
so
press
by
the
rack
necessity
it
be
he
that
should
be
well
able
to
attack
the
subject
from
a
more
scientific
standpoint
but
the
final
analysis
be
the
same
his
money
be
a
feeble
offering
without
the
study
behind
it
which
will
make
its

no

important
be
the
achievement
in

about

to
help
the
investigator
who
be
strive
successfully
to
attack
the
cause
which
bring
about
sickness
and
distress

not
so

attract
the

the
first
appeal
to
the
sentiment
overpoweringly
but
the
second
have
the
head
to
deal
with
yet
i
be
sure
we
be
make
wonderful
advance
in
this
field
of
scientific
give
all
over
the
world
the
need
of
deal
with
the
question
of
philanthropy
with
something
beyond
the
impulse
of
emotion
be
evident
and
everywhere
help
be

to
those
heroic
men

woman
who
be
devote
themselves
to
the
practical
and
essentially
scientific
task
it
be
a
good
and
inspire
thing
to
recall
occasionally
the
heroism
for
example
of
the
men
who
risk
and
sacrifice
their
life
to
discover
the
fact
about
yellow
fever
a
sacrifice
for
which
untold
generation
will
bless
them
and
this
same
spirit
have
animate
the
profession
of
medicine
and
surgery
scientific
research
how
far
may
this
spirit
of
sacrifice
properly
extend
a
great
number
of
scientific
men
every
year
give
up
everything
to
arrive
at
some
helpful
contribution
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
good
people
who
lightly
and
freely
criticize
their
action
scarcely
realize
just
what
such
criticism
mean
it
be
one
thing
to
stand
on
the
comfortable
ground
of
placid
inaction
and
put
forth
word
of
cynical
wisdom
and
another
to
plunge
into
the
work
itself
and
through
strenuous
experience
earn
the
right
to
express
strong
conclusion
for
my
own
part
i
have
stood
so
much
as
a
placid
onlooker
that
i
have
not
have
the
hardihood
even
to
suggest
how
people
so
much
more
experienced
and
wise
in
those
thing
than
i
should
work
out
the
detail
even
of
those
plan
with
which
i
have
have
the
honour
to
be
associate
there
have
be
a
good
deal
of
criticism
no
doubt
sincere
of
experiment
on
living
dumb
animal
and
the
person
who
stand
for
the
defenceless
animal
have
such
an
overwhelm
appeal
to
the
emotion
that
it
be
perhaps
useless
to
allude
to
the
other
side
of
the
controversy
dr
simon
flexner
of
the
institute
for
medical
research
have
have
to
face
exaggerated
and
even
sensational
report
which
have
no
basis
of
truth
whatever
but
consider
for
a
moment
what
have
be
accomplish
recently
under
the
direction
of
dr
flexner
in
discover
a
remedy
for
epidemic
cerebro
spinal
meningitis
it
be
true
that
in
discover
this
cure
the
life
of
perhaps
fifteen
animal
be
sacrifice
as
i
learn
most
of
them
monkey
but
for
each
one
of
these
animal
which
lose
its
life
already
score
of
human
life
have
be
save
large
hearted
men
like
dr
flexner
and
his
associate
do
not
permit
unnecessary
pain
to
defenceless
animal
i
have
be
deeply
interested
in
the
story
of
a
desperate
experiment
to
save
a
child
life
told
in
a
letter
write
by
one
of
my
associate
soon
after
the
event
described
and
it
seem
worthy
of
repeat
dr
alexis
carrel
have
be
associate
with
dr
flexner
and
his
work
and
his
wonderful
skill
have
be
the
result
of
his
experiment
and
experience
a
wonderful
surgical
operation
dr
alexis
carrel
one
of
the
institute
staff
have
be
make
some
interest
study
in
experimental
surgery
and
have
successfully
transplant
organ
from
one
animal
to
another
and
blood
vessel
from
one
specie
to
another
he
have
the
opportunity
recently
of
apply
the
skill
thus
acquire
to
the
save
of
a
human
life
under
circumstance
which
attract
great
interest
among
the
medical
fraternity
of
this
city
one
of
the
best
know
of
the
young
surgeon
in
new
york
have
a
child
born
early
last
march
which
developed
a
disease
in
which
the
blood
for
some
reason
exudes
from
the
blood
vessel
into
the
tissue
of
the
body
and
ordinarily
the
child
dy
of
this
internal
hemorrhage
when
this
child
be
five
day
old
it
be
evident
that
it
be
die
the
father
and
his
brother
who
be
one
of
the
most
distinguish
men
in
the
profession
and
one
or
two
other
doctor
be
in
consultation
with
reference
to
it
but
consider
the
case
entirely
hopeless
it
so
happen
that
the
father
have
be
impressed
with
the
work
which
dr
carrel
have
be
do
at
the
institute
and
have
spent
several
day
with
him
study
his
method
he
become
convince
that
the
only
possibility
of
save
the
child
life
be
by
the
direct
transfusion
of
blood
while
this
have
be
do
between
adult
the
blood
vessel
of
a
young
infant
be
so
delicate
that
it
seem
impossible
that
the
operation
could
be
successfully
carry
on
it
be
necessary
not
only
that
the
blood
vessel
of
the
two
person
should
be
united
together
but
it
must
be
do
in
such
a
way
that
the
interior
line
of
the
vessel
which
be
a
smooth
shiny
tissue
should
be
continuous
if
the
blood
come
in
contact
with
the
muscular
coat
of
the
blood
vessel
it
will
clot
and
stop
the
circulation
fortunately
dr
carrel
have
be
experiment
on
the
blood
vessel
of
some
very
young
animal
and
the
father
be
convince
that
if
any
man
in
the
country
could
perform
the
operation
successfully
it
would
be
he
it
be
then
the
middle
of
the
night
but
dr
carrel
be
call
on
and
when
the
situation
be
explain
to
him
and
it
be
make
clear
that
the
child
would
die
anyhow
he
readily
consent
to
attempt
the
operation
although
express
very
slight
hope
of
its
successful
outcome
the
father
offer
himself
as
the
person
whose
blood
should
be
furnish
to
the
child
it
be
impossible
to
give
anaesthetic
to
either
of
them
in
a
child
of
that
age
there
be
only
one
vein
large
enough
to
be
use
and
that
be
in
the
back
of
the
leg
and
deep
seat
a
prominent
surgeon
who
be
present
expose
this
vein
he
say
afterward
that
there
be
no
sign
of
life
in
the
child
and
express
the
belief
that
the
child
have
be
to
all
intent
and
purpose
dead
for
ten
minute
in
view
of
its
condition
he
raise
the
question
whether
it
be
worth
while
to
proceed
far
with
the
attempt
the
father
however
insist
upon
go
on
and
the
surgeon
then
expose
the
radial
artery
in
the
surgeon
wrist
and
be
oblige
to
dissect
it
back
about
six
inch
in
order
to
pull
it
out
far
enough
to
make
the
connection
with
the
child
vein
this
part
of
the
work
the
surgeon
who
do
it
afterward
described
as
the
blacksmith
part
of
the
job
he
say
that
the
child
vein
be
about
the
size
of
a
match
and
the
consistency
of
wet
cigarette
paper
and
it
seem
utterly
impossible
for
anyone
to
successfully
unite
these
two
vessel
dr
carrel
however
accomplish
this
feat
and
then
occur
what
the
doctor
who
be
present
described
as
one
of
the
most
dramatic
incident
in
the
history
of
surgery
the
blood
from
the
father
artery
be
release
and
begin
to
flow
into
the
child
body
amount
to
about
a
pint
the
first
sign
of
life
be
a
little
pink
tinge
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
ear
then
the
lip
which
have
become
perfectly
blue
begin
to
change
to
red
and
then
suddenly
as
though
the
child
have
be
take
from
a
hot
mustard
bath
a
pink
glow
broke
out
all
over
its
body
and
it
begin
to
cry
lustily
after
about
eight
minute
the
two
be
separate
the
child
at
that
time
be
cry
for
food
it
be
fed
and
from
that
moment
begin
to
eat
and
sleep
regularly
and
make
a
complete
recovery
the
father
appear
before
a
legislative
committee
at
albany
in
opposition
to
certain
bill
which
be
pending
at
the
last
session
to
restrict
animal
experimentation
and
told
this
incident
and
say
at
the
close
that
when
he
saw
dr
carrel
experiment
he
have
no
idea
that
they
would
so
soon
be
available
for
save
human
life
much
less
do
he
imagine
that
the
life
to
be
save
would
be
that
of
his
own
child
the
fundamental
thing
in
all
help
if
the
people
can
be
educate
to
help
themselves
we
strike
at
the
root
of
many
of
the
evil
of
the
world
this
be
the
fundamental
thing
and
it
be
worth
say
even
if
it
have
be
say
so
often
that
its
truth
be
lose
sight
of
in
its
constant
repetition
the
only
thing
which
be
of
last
benefit
to
a
man
be
that
which
he
do
for
himself
money
which
come
to
him
without
effort
on
his
part
be
seldom
a
benefit
and
often
a
curse
that
be
the
principal
objection
to
speculation
it
be
not
because
more
lose
than
gain
though
that
be
true
but
it
be
because
those
who
gain
be
apt
to
receive
more
injury
from
their
success
than
they
would
have
receive
from
failure
and
so
with
regard
to
money
or
other
thing
which
be
give
by
one
person
to
another
it
be
only
in
the
exceptional
case
that
the
receiver
be
really
benefit
but
if
we
can
help
people
to
help
themselves
then
there
be
a
permanent
blessing
confer
men
who
be
study
the
problem
of
disease
tell
us
that
it
be
become
more
and
more
evident
that
the
force
which
conquer
sickness
be
within
the
body
itself
and
that
it
be
only
when
these
be
reduce
below
the
normal
that
disease
can
get
a
foothold
the
way
to
ward
off
disease
therefore
be
to
tone
up
the
body
generally
and
when
disease
have
secure
a
foothold
the
way
to
combat
it
be
to
help
these
natural
resist
agency
which
be
in
the
body
already
in
the
same
way
the
failure
which
a
man
make
in
his
life
be
due
almost
always
to
some
defect
in
his
personality
some
weakness
of
body
or
mind
or
character
will
or
temperament
the
only
way
to
overcome
these
failing
be
to
build
up
his
personality
from
within
so
that
he
by
virtue
of
what
be
within
him
may
overcome
the
weakness
which
be
the
cause
of
the
failure
it
be
only
those
effort
the
man
himself
put
forth
that
can
really
help
him
we
all
desire
to
see
the
wide
possible
distribution
of
the
blessing
of
life
many
crude
plan
have
be
suggest
some
of
which
utterly
ignore
the
essential
fact
of
human
nature
and
if
carry
out
would
perhaps
drag
our
whole
civilization
down
into
hopeless
misery
it
be
my
belief
that
the
principal
cause
for
the
economic
difference
between
people
be
their
difference
in
personality
and
that
it
be
only
as
we
can
assist
in
the
wider
distribution
of
those
quality
which
go
to
make
up
a
strong
personality
that
we
can
assist
in
the
wider
distribution
of
wealth
under
normal
condition
the
man
who
be
strong
in
body
in
mind
in
character
and
in
will
need
never
suffer
want
but
these
quality
can
never
be
developed
in
a
man
unless
by
his
own
effort
and
the
most
that
any
other
can
do
for
him
be
as
i
have
say
to
help
him
to
help
himself
we
must
always
remember
that
there
be
not
enough
money
for
the
work
of
human
uplift
and
that
there
never
can
be
how
vitally
important
it
be
therefore
that
the
expenditure
should
go
as
far
as
possible
and
be
use
with
the
great
intelligence
i
have
be
frank
to
say
that
i
believe
in
the
spirit
of
combination
and
cooeperation
when
properly
and
fairly
conduct
in
the
world
of
commercial
affair
on
the
principle
that
it
help
to
reduce
waste
and
waste
be
a
dissipation
of
power
i
sincerely
hope
and
thoroughly
believe
that
this
same
principle
will
eventually
prevail
in
the
art
of
give
as
it
do
in
business
it
be
not
merely
the
tendency
of
the
time
developed
by
more
exact
condition
in
industry
but
it
should
make
its
most
effective
appeal
to
the
heart
of
the
people
who
be
strive
to
do
the
most
good
to
the
large
number
some
underlie
principle
at
the
risk
of
make
this
chapter
very
dull
and
i
be
told
that
this
be
a
fault
which
inexperienced
author
should
avoid
at
all
hazard
i
may
perhaps
be
pardon
if
i
set
down
here
some
of
the
fundamental
principle
which
have
be
at
the
bottom
of
all
my
own
plan
i
have
undertaken
no
work
of
any
importance
for
many
year
which
in
a
general
way
have
not
follow
out
these
broad
line
and
i
believe
no
really
constructive
effort
can
be
make
in
philanthropic
work
without
such
a
well
define
and
consecutive
purpose
my
own
conversion
to
the
feel
that
an
organize
plan
be
an
absolute
necessity
come
about
in
this
way
about
the
year
i
be
still
follow
the
haphazard
fashion
of
give
here
and
there
as
appeal
present
themselves
i
investigate
as
i
could
and
work
myself
almost
to
a
nervous
break
down
in
grope
my
way
without
sufficient
guide
or
chart
through
this
ever
widen
field
of
philanthropic
endeavour
there
be
then
force
upon
me
the
necessity
to
organize
and
plan
this
department
of
our
daily
task
on
as
distinct
line
of
progress
as
we
do
our
business
affair
and
i
will
try
to
describe
the
underlie
principle
we
arrive
at
and
have
since
follow
out
and
hope
still
greatly
to
extend
it
may
be
beyond
the
pale
of
good
taste
to
speak
at
all
of
such
a
personal
subject
i
be
not
unmindful
of
this
but
i
can
make
these
observation
with
at
least
a
little
well
grace
because
so
much
of
the
hard
work
and
hard
think
be
do
by
my
family
and
associate
who
devote
their
life
to
it
every
right
mind
man
have
a
philosophy
of
life
whether
he
know
it
or
not
hidden
away
in
his
mind
be
certain
govern
principle
whether
he
formulates
them
in
word
or
not
which
govern
his
life
surely
his
ideal
ought
to
be
to
contribute
all
that
he
can
however
little
it
may
be
whether
of
money
or
service
to
human
progress
certainly
one
ideal
should
be
to
use
one
mean
both
in
one
investment
and
in
benefaction
for
the
advancement
of
civilization
but
the
question
as
to
what
civilization
be
and
what
be
the
great
law
which
govern
its
advance
have
be
seriously
study
our
investment
not
less
than
gift
have
be
direct
to
such
end
as
we
have
thought
would
tend
to
produce
these
result
if
you
be
to
go
into
our
office
and
ask
our
committee
on
benevolence
or
our
committee
on
investment
in
what
they
consider
civilization
to
consist
they
would
say
that
they
have
found
in
their
study
that
the
most
convenient
analysis
of
the
element
which
go
to
make
up
civilization
run
about
as
follow
st
progress
in
the
mean
of
subsistence
that
be
to
say
progress
in
abundance
and
variety
of
food
supply
clothing
shelter
sanitation
public
health
commerce
manufacture
the
growth
of
the
public
wealth
etc
nd
progress
in
government
and
law
that
be
to
say
in
the
enactment
of
law
secure
justice
and
equity
to
every
man
consistent
with
the
large
individual
liberty
and
the
due
and
orderly
enforcement
of
the
same
upon
all
rd
progress
in
literature
and
language
th
progress
in
science
and
philosophy
th
progress
in
art
and
refinement
th
progress
in
morality
and
religion
if
you
be
to
ask
them
as
indeed
they
be
very
often
ask
which
of
these
they
regard
as
fundamental
they
would
reply
that
they
would
not
attempt
to
answer
that
the
question
be
purely
an
academic
one
that
all
these
go
hand
in
hand
but
that
historically
the
first
of
them
namely
progress
in
mean
of
subsistence
have
generally
precede
progress
in
government
in
literature
in
knowledge
in
refinement
and
in
religion
though
not
itself
of
the
high
importance
it
be
the
foundation
upon
which
the
whole
superstructure
of
civilization
be
built
and
without
which
it
could
not
exist
accordingly
we
have
sought
so
far
as
we
could
to
make
investment
in
such
a
way
as
will
tend
to
multiply
to
cheapen
and
to
diffuse
as
universally
as
possible
the
comfort
of
life
we
claim
no
credit
for
prefer
these
line
of
investment
we
make
no
sacrifice
these
be
the
line
of
large
and
surest
return
in
this
particular
namely
in
cheapness
ease
of
acquirement
and
universality
of
mean
of
subsistence
our
country
easily
surpasses
that
of
any
other
in
the
world
though
we
be
behind
other
country
perhaps
in
most
of
the
others
it
may
be
ask
how
be
it
consistent
with
the
universal
diffusion
of
these
blessing
that
vast
sum
of
money
should
be
in
single
hand
the
reply
be
as
i
see
it
that
while
men
of
wealth
control
great
sum
of
money
they
do
not
and
cannot
use
them
for
themselves
they
have
indeed
the
legal
title
to
large
property
and
they
do
control
the
investment
of
them
but
that
be
as
far
as
their
own
relation
to
them
extends
or
can
extend
the
money
be
universally
diffuse
in
the
sense
that
it
be
kept
invest
and
it
pass
into
the
pay
envelope
week
by
week
up
to
the
present
time
no
scheme
have
yet
present
itself
which
seem
to
afford
a
well
method
of
handle
capital
than
that
of
individual
ownership
we
might
put
our
money
into
the
treasury
of
the
nation
and
of
the
various
state
but
we
do
not
find
any
promise
in
the
national
or
state
legislature
view
from
the
experience
of
the
past
that
the
fund
would
be
expend
for
the
general
weal
more
effectively
than
under
the
present
method
nor
do
we
find
in
any
of
the
scheme
of
socialism
a
promise
that
wealth
would
be
more
wisely
administer
for
the
general
good
it
be
the
duty
of
men
of
mean
to
maintain
the
title
to
their
property
and
to
administer
their
fund
until
some
man
or
body
of
men
shall
rise
up
capable
of
administer
for
the
general
good
the
capital
of
the
country
well
than
they
can
the
next
four
element
of
progress
mention
in
the
enumeration
above
namely
progress
in
government
and
law
in
language
and
literature
in
science
and
philosophy
in
art
and
refinement
we
for
ourselves
have
thought
to
be
best
promote
by
mean
of
the
high
education
and
accordingly
we
have
have
the
great
satisfaction
of
put
such
sum
as
we
could
into
various
form
of
education
in
our
own
and
in
foreign
land
and
education
not
merely
along
the
line
of
disseminate
more
generally
the
know
but
quite
as
much
and
perhaps
even
more
in
promote
original
investigation
an
individual
institution
of
learn
can
have
only
a
narrow
sphere
it
can
reach
only
a
limited
number
of
people
but
every
new
fact
discover
every
widen
of
the
boundary
of
human
knowledge
by
research
becomes
universally
know
to
all
institution
of
learn
and
becomes
a
benefaction
at
once
to
the
whole
race
quite
as
interest
as
any
phase
of
the
work
have
be
the
new
line
enter
upon
by
our
committee
we
have
not
be
satisfied
with
give
to
cause
which
have
appeal
to
us
we
have
felt
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
or
the
other
cause
make
its
appeal
be
no
reason
why
we
should
give
to
it
any
more
than
to
a
thousand
other
cause
perhaps
more
worthy
which
do
not
happen
to
have
come
under
our
eye
the
mere
fact
of
a
personal
appeal
creates
no
claim
which
do
not
exist
before
and
no
preference
over
other
cause
more
worthy
which
may
not
have
make
their
appeal
so
this
little
committee
of
ours
have
not
be
content
to
let
the
benevolence
drift
into
the
channel
of
mere
convenience
to
give
to
the
institution
which
have
sought
aid
and
to
neglect
others
this
department
have
study
the
field
of
human
progress
and
sought
to
contribute
to
each
of
those
element
which
we
believe
tend
most
to
promote
it
where
it
have
not
found
organization
ready
to
its
hand
for
such
purpose
the
member
of
the
committee
have
sought
to
create
them
we
be
still
work
on
new
and
i
hope
expand
line
which
make
large
demand
on
one
intelligence
and
study
the
so
call
betterment
work
which
have
always
be
to
me
a
source
of
great
interest
have
a
great
influence
on
my
life
and
i
refer
to
it
here
because
i
wish
to
urge
in
this
connection
the
great
importance
of
a
father
keep
in
close
touch
with
his
child
take
into
his
confidence
the
girl
as
well
as
the
boy
who
in
this
way
learn
by
see
and
do
and
have
their
part
in
the
family
responsibility
as
my
father
taught
me
so
i
have
try
to
teach
my
child
for
year
it
be
our
custom
to
read
at
the
table
the
letter
we
receive
affect
the

value
of
the
cooeperative
principle
in

go
a
step
farther
in
the

make

which
i
take
up
in
the
last
chapter
under
the
title
of
the
difficult
art
of
give
i
be
tempt
to
take
the
opportunity
to
dwell
a
little
upon
the
subject
of
combination
in
charitable
work
which
have
be
something
of
a
hobby
with
me
for
many
year
if
a
combination
to
do
business
be
effective
in
save
waste
and
in
get
well
result
why
be
not
combination
far
more
important
in
philanthropic
work
the
general
idea
of
cooeperation
in
give
for
education
i
have
felt
score
a
real
step
in
advance
when
mr
andrew
carnegie
consent
to
become
a
member
of
the
general
education
board
for
in
accept
a
position
in
this
directorate
he
have
it
seem
to
me
stamp
with
his
approval
this
vital
principle
of
cooeperation
in
aid
the
educational
institution
of
our
country
i
rejoice
as
everybody
must
in
mr
carnegie
enthusiasm
for
use
his
wealth
for
the
benefit
of
his
less
fortunate
fellow
and
i
think
his
devotion
to
his
adopt
land
welfare
have
set
a
strike
example
for
all
time
the
general
education
board
of
which
mr
carnegie
have
now
become
a
member
be
interest
as
an
example
of
an
organization
form
for
the
purpose
of
work
out
in
an
orderly
and
rather
scientific
way
the
problem
of
help
to
stimulate
and
improve
education
in
all
part
of
our
country
what
this
organization
may
eventually
accomplish
of
course
no
one
can
tell
but
surely
under
its
present
board
of
director
it
will
go
very
far
here
again
i
feel
that
i
may
speak
frankly
and
express
my
personal
faith
in
its
success
since
i
be
not
a
member
of
the
board
and
have
never
attend
a
meeting
and
the
work
be
all
do
by
others
there
be
some
other
and
large
plan
thought
out
on
careful
and
broad
line
which
i
have
be
study
for
many
year
and
we
can
see
that
they
be
grow
into
definite
shape
it
be
good
to
know
that
there
be
always
unselfish
men
of
the
best
calibre
to
help
in
every
large
philanthropic
enterprise
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
and
stimulate
piece
of
good
fortune
that
have
come
to
me
be
the
evidence
that
so
many
busy
people
be
willing
to
turn
aside
from
their
work
in
press
field
of
labour
and
to
give
their
best
thought
and
energy
without
compensation
to
the
work
of
human
uplift
doctor
clergyman
lawyer
as
well
as
many
high
grade
men
of
affair
be
devote
their
best
and
most
unselfish
effort
to
some
of
the
plan
that
we
be
all
try
to
work
out
take
as
one
example
of
many
similar
case
mr
robert
c
ogden
who
for
year
while
devote
himself
to
an
exact
business
still
found
time
support
by
wonderful
enthusiasm
to
give
force
by
his
own
personality
to
work
do
in
difficult
part
of
the
educational
world
particularly
to
improve
the
common
school
system
of
the
south
his
effort
have
be
wisely
direct
along
fundamental
line
which
must
produce
result
through
the
year
to
come
fortunately
my
child
have
be
as
earnest
as
i
and
much
more
diligent
in
carefully
and
intelligently
carry
out
the
work
already
begin
and
agree
with
me
that
at
least
the
same
energy
and
thought
should
be
expend
in
the
proper
and
effective
use
of
money
when
acquire
as
be
exert
in
the
earn
of
it
the
general

have
make
or

a
careful

of
the

of

the

make
its
contribution
average
something
like
two
million
dollar
a
year
on
the
most
careful
comparative
study
of
need
and
opportunity
throughout
the
country
its
record
be
open
to
all
many
benefactor
of

be
avail
themselves
of
these
disinterested
inquiry
and
it
be
hop
that
more
will
do
so
a
large
number
of
individual
be
contribute
to
the
support
of
educational
institution
in
our
country
to
help
an
inefficient
ill
locate
unnecessary
school
be
a
waste
i
be
told
by
those
who
have
give
most
careful
study
to
this
problem
that
it
be
highly
probable
that
enough
money
have
be
squander
on
unwise
educational
project
to
have
built
up
a
national
system
of
high
education
adequate
to
our
need
if
the
money
have
be
properly
direct
to
that
end
many
of
the
good
people
who
bestow
their
beneficence
on
education
may
well
give
more
thought
to
investigate
the
character
of
the
enterprise
that
they
be
importune
to
help
and
this
study
ought
to
take
into
account
the
kind
of
people
who
be
responsible
for
their
management
their
location
and
the
facility
supply
by
other
institution
round
about
a
thorough
examination
such
as
this
be
generally
quite
impossible
for
an
individual
and
he
either
decline
to
give
from
lack
of
accurate
knowledge
or
he
may
give
without
due
consideration
if
however
this
work
of
inquiry
be
do
and
well
do
by
the
general
education
board
through
officer
of
intelligence
skill
and
sympathy
train
to
the
work
important
and
need
service
be
render
the
wall
of
sectarian
exclusiveness
be
fast
disappear
as
they
should
and
the
best
people
be
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
as
they
attack
the
great
problem
of
general
uplift
roman
catholic
charity
just
here
it
occurs
to
me
to
testify
to
the
fact
that
the
roman
catholic
church
as
i
have
observe
in
my
experience
have
advanced
a
long
way
in
this
direction
i
have
be
surprised
to
learn
how
far
a
give
sum
of
money
have
go
in
the
hand
of
priest
and
nun
and
how
really
effective
be
their
use
of
it
i
fully
appreciate
the
splendid
service
do
by
other
worker
in
the
field
but
i
have
see
the
organization
of
the
roman
church
secure
well
result
with
a
give
sum
of
money
than
other
church
organization
be
accustom
to
secure
from
the
same
expenditure
i
speak
of
this
merely
to
point
the
value
of
the
principle
of
organization
in
which
i
believe
so
heartily
it
be
unnecessary
to
dwell
upon
the
century
of
experience
which
the
church
of
rome
have
go
through
to
perfect
a
great
power
of
organization
study
these
problem
have
be
a
source
of
the
great
interest
to
me
my
assistant
quite
distinct
from
any
board
have
an
organization
of
sufficient
size
to
investigate
the
many
request
that
come
to
us
this
be
do
from
the
office
of
our
committee
in
new
york
for
an
individual
to
attempt
to
keep
any
close
watch
of
single
case
would
be
impossible
i
be
call
upon
to
explain
this
fact
many
time
to
read
the
hundred
of
letter
daily
receive
at
our
office
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
any
one
man
and
surely
if
the
many
good
people
who
write
would
only
reflect
a
little
they
must
realize
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
personally
to
consider
their
application
the
plan
that
we
have
work
out
and
i
hope
improve
upon
year
after
year
have
be
the
result
of
experience
and
i
refer
to
it
now
only
as
one
contribution
to
a
general
subject
which
be
of
such
great
moment
to
earnest
people
and
this
must
be
my
excuse
for
speak
so
frankly
the
appeal
that
come
the
reading
assort
and
investigate
of
the
hundred
of
letter
of
appeal
which
be
receive
daily
at
my
office
be
attend
to
by
a
department
organize
for
this
purpose
the
task
be
not
so
difficult
as
at
first
it
might
seem
the
letter
be
to
be
sure
of
great
variety
from
all
sort
of
people
in
every
condition
of
life
and
indeed
from
all
part
of
the
world
four
fifth
of
these
letter
be
however
request
for
money
for
personal
use
with
no
other
title
to
consideration
than
that
the
writer
would
be
gratify
to
have
it
there
remain
number
of
request
which
all
must
recognize
as
worthy
of
notice
these
may
be
divide
roughly
as
follow
the
claim
of
local
charity
the
town
or
city
in
which
one
life
have
a
definite
appeal
to
all
its
citizen
and
all
good
neighbour
will
wish
to
cooeperate
with
friend
and
fellow
townsman
but
these
local
charity
hospital
kindergarten
and
the
like
ought
not
to
make
appeal
outside
the
local
community
which
they
serve
the
burden
should
be
carry
by
the
people
who
be
on
the
spot
and
who
be
or
should
be
most
familiar
with
local
need
then
come
the
national
and
international
claim
these
properly
appeal
especially
to
men
of
large
mean
throughout
the
country
whose
wealth
admits
of
their
do
something
more
than
assist
in
care
for
the
local
charity
there
be
many
great
national
and
international
philanthropic
and
christian
organization
that
cover
the
whole
field
of
world
wide
charity
and
while
people
of
repute
wealth
all
receive
appeal
from
individual
worker
throughout
the
world
for
personal
assistance
the
prudent
and
thoughtful
giver
will
more
and
more
choose
these
great
and
responsible
organization
as
the
medium
for
his
gift
and
the
distribution
of
his
fund
to
distant
field
this
have
be
my
custom
and
the
experience
of
every
day
serf
only
to
confirm
its
wisdom
the
great
value
of
deal
with
an
organization
which
know
all
the
fact
and
can
best
decide
just
where
the
help
can
be
apply
to
the
best
advantage
have
impressed
itself
upon
me
through
the
result
of
long
year
of
experience
for
example
one
be
ask
to
give
in
a
certain
field
of
missionary
work
a
sum
for
a
definite
purpose
let
us
say
a
hospital
to
comply
with
this
request
will
take
say
it
seem
wise
and
natural
to
give
this
amount
the
missionary
who
want
this
money
be
work
under
the
direction
of
a
strong
and
capable
religious
denomination
suppose
the
request
be
refer
to
the
manager
of
the
board
of
this
denomination
and
it
transpires
that
there
be
many
good
reason
why
a
new
hospital
be
not
badly
need
at
this
point
and
by
a
little
good
management
the
need
of
this
missionary
can
be
met
by
another
hospital
in
its
neighbourhood
whereas
another
missionary
in
another
place
have
no
such
possibility
for
any
hospital
facility
whatever
there
be
no
question
that
the
money
should
be
spent
in
the
place
last
name
these
condition
the
manager
of
all
the
mission
station
know
although
perhaps
the
one
who
be
give
the
money
never
heard
of
them
and
in
my
judgment
he
be
wise
in
not
act
until
he
have
consult
these
men
of
large
information
it
be
interest
to
follow
the
mental
process
that
some
excellent
soul
go
through
to
cloud
their
conscience
when
they
consider
what
their
duty
actually
be
for
instance
one
man
say
i
do
not
believe
in
give
money
to
street
beggar
i
agree
with
him
i
do
not
believe
in
the
practice
either
but
that
be
not
a
reason
why
one
should
be
exempt
from
do
something
to
help
the
situation
represent
by
the
street
beggar
because
one
do
not
yield
to
the
importunity
of
such
people
be
exactly
the
reason
one
should
join
and
uphold
the
charity
organization
society
of
one
own
locality
which
deal
justly
and
humanely
with
this
class
separate
the
worthy
from
the
unworthy
another
say
i
do
not
give
to
such
and
such
a
board
because
i
have
read
that
of
the
money
give
only
half
or
less
actually
get
to
the
person
need
help
this
be
often
not
a
true
statement
of
fact
as
prove
again
and
again
and
even
if
it
be
true
in
part
it
do
not
relieve
the
possible
giver
from
the
duty
of
help
to
make
the
organization
more
efficient
by
no
possible
chance
be
it
a
valid
excuse
for
closing
up
one
pocketbook
and
dismiss
the
whole
subject
from
one
mind
institution
as
they
relate
to
each
other
surely
it
be
wise
to
be
careful
not
to
duplicate
effort
and
not
to
inaugurate
new
charity
in
field
already
cover
but
rather
to
strengthen
and
perfect
those
already
at
work
there
be
a
great
deal
of
rivalry
and
a
vast
amount
of
duplication
and
one
of
the
most
difficult
thing
in
give
be
to
ascertain
when
the
field
be
fully
cover
many
people
simply
consider
whether
the
institution
to
which
they
be
give
be
thoughtfully
and
well
manage
without
stop
to
discover
whether
the
field
be
not
already
occupy
by
others
and
for
this
reason
one
ought
not
to
investigate
a
single
institution
by
itself
but
always
in
its
relation
to
all
similar
institution
in
the
territory
here
be
a
case
in
point
a
number
of
enthusiastic
people
have
a
plan
for
found
an
orphan
asylum
which
be
to
be
conduct
by
one
of
our
strong
religious
denomination
the
raise
of
the
necessary
fund
be
begin
and
among
the
people
who
be
ask
to
subscribe
be
a
man
who
always
make
it
a
practice
to
study
the
situation
carefully
before
commit
himself
to
a
contribution
he
ask
one
of
the
promoter
of
the
new
institution
how
many
bed
the
present
asylum
serve
this
community
provide
how
efficient
they
be
where
locate
and
what
particular
class
of
institution
be
lack
in
the
community
to
none
of
these
question
be
answer
forthcoming
so
he
have
this
information
gather
on
his
own
account
with
the
purpose
of
help
to
make
the
new
plan
effective
his
study
reveal
the
fact
that
the
city
where
the
new
asylum
be
to
be
built
be
so
well
provide
with
such
institution
that
there
be
already
vastly
more
bed
for
child
than
there
be
applicant
to
fill
them
and
that
the
field
be
well
and
fully
cover
these
fact
be
present
to
the
organizer
of
the
enterprise
it
be
show
that
no
real
need
for
such
an
institution
exist
i
wish
i
might
add
that
the
scheme
be
abandon
it
be
not
such
charity
seldom
be
when
once
the
sympathy
of
the
worthy
people
however
misinform
be
heartily
enlist
it
may
be
urge
that
do
the
work
in
this
systematic
and
apparently
cold
blood
way
leaf
out
of
consideration
to
a
large
extent
the
merit
of
individual
case
my
contention
be
that
the
organization
of
work
in
combination
should
not
and
do
not
stifle
the
work
of
individual
but
strengthens
and
stimulates
it
the
orderly
combination
of
philanthropic
effort
be
grow
daily
and
at
the
same
time
the
spirit
of
broad
philanthropy
never
be
so
general
as
it
be
now
the
claim
of
high
education
the
giver
who
work
out
these
problem
for
himself
will
no
doubt
find
many
critic
so
many
people
see
the
press
need
of
every
day
life
that
possibly
they
fail
to
realize
those
which
be
if
less
obvious
of
an
even
large
significance
for
instance
the
great
claim
of
high
education
ignorance
be
the
source
of
a
large
part
of
the
poverty
and
a
vast
amount
of
the
crime
in
the
world
hence
the
need
of
education
if
we
assist
the
high
form
of
education
in
whatever
field
we
secure
the
wide
influence
in
enlarge
the
boundary
of
human
knowledge
for
all
the
new
fact
discover
or
set
in
motion
become
the
universal
heritage
i
think
we
cannot
overestimate
the
importance
of
this
matter
the
mere
fact
that
most
of
the
great
achievement
in
science
medicine
art
and
literature
be
the
flower
of
the
high
education
be
sufficient
some
great
writer
will
one
day
show
how
these
thing
have
minister
to
the
want
of
all
the
people
educate
and
uneducated
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
and
make
life
more
what
we
all
wish
it
to
be
the
best
philanthropy
be
constantly
in
search
of
the
finality
a
search
for
cause
an
attempt
to
cure
evil
at
their
source
my
interest
in
the
university
of
chicago
have
be
enhance
by
the
fact
that
while
it
have
comprehensively
consider
the
other
feature
of
a
collegiate
course
it
have
give
so
much
attention
to
research
dr
william
r
harper
the
mention
of
this
promising
young
institution
always
brings
to
my
mind
the
figure
of
dr
william
r
harper
whose
enthusiasm
for
its
work
be
so
great
that
no
vision
of
its
future
seem
too
large
my
first
meeting
with
dr
harper
be
at
vassar
college
where
one
of
my
daughter
be
a
student
he
use
to
come
as
the
guest
of
dr
james
m
taylor
the
president
to
lecture
on
sunday
and
as
i
frequently
spent
week
end
there
i
saw
and
talk
much
with
the
young
professor
then
of
yale
and
caught
in
some
degree
the
contagion
of
his
enthusiasm
when
the
university
have
be
found
and
he
have
take
the
presidency
our
great
ambition
be
to
secure
the
best
instructor
and
to
organize
the
new
institution
unhampered
by
tradition
accord
to
the
most
modern
ideal
he
raise
million
of
dollar
among
the
people
of
chicago
and
the
middle
west
and
won
the
personal
interest
of
their
lead
citizen
here
lay
his
great
strength
for
he
secure
not
only
their
money
but
their
loyal
support
and
strong
personal
interest
the
best
kind
of
help
and
cooeperation
he
built
even
well
than
he
knew
his
lofty
ideal
embody
in
the
university
awaken
a
deeper
interest
in
high
education
throughout
the
central
west
and
stir
individual
denomination
and
legislature
to
effective
action
the
world
will
probably
never
realize
how
largely
the
present
splendid
university
system
of
the
central
western
state
be
due
indirectly
to
the
genius
of
this
man
with
all
his
extraordinary
power
of
work
and
his
executive
and
organize
ability
dr
harper
be
a
man
of
exquisite
personal
charm
we
count
it
among
the
rich
and
delightful
experience
of
our
home
life
that
dr
and
mr
harper
could
occasionally
spend
day
together
with
us
for
a
brief
respite
from
the
exact
care
and
responsibility
of
the
university
work
as
a
friend
and
companion
in
daily
intercourse
no
one
could
be
more
delightful
than
he
it
have
be
my
good
fortune
to
contribute
at
various
time
to
the
university
of
chicago
of
which
dr
harper
be
president
and
the
newspaper
not
unnaturally
suppose
at
such
time
that
he
use
the
occasion
of
our
personal
association
to
secure
these
contribution
the
cartoonist
use
to
find
this
a
fruitful
theme
they
would
picture
dr
harper
as
a
hypnotist
wave
his
magic
spell
or
would
represent
him
force
his
way
into
my
inner
office
where
i
be
picture
as
busy
cut
coupon
and
from
which
delightful
employment
i
incontinently
flee
out
of
the
window
at
sight
of
him
or
they
would
represent
me
as
flee
across
river
on
cake
of
float
ice
with
dr
harper
in
hot
pursuit
or
perhaps
he
would
be
follow
close
on
my
trail
like
the
wolf
in
the
russian
story
in
inaccessible
country
retreat
while
i
escape
only
by
mean
of
the
slight
delay
i
occasion
him
by
now
and
then
drop
a
million
dollar
bill
which
he
would
be
oblige
to
stop
and
pick
up
these
cartoon
be
intend
to
be
very
amuse
and
some
of
them
certainly
do
have
a
flavour
of
humour
but
they
be
never
humorous
to
dr
harper
they
be
in
fact
a
source
of
deep
humiliation
to
him
and
i
be
sure
he
would
be
he
living
be
glad
to
have
me
say
as
i
now
do
that
during
the
entire
period
of
his
presidency
of
the
university
of
chicago
he
never
once
either
write
me
a
letter
or
ask
me
personally
for
a
dollar
of
money
for
the
university
of
chicago
in
the
most
intimate
daily
intercourse
with
him
in
my
home
the
finance
of
the
university
of
chicago
be
never
canvass
or
discuss
the
method
of
procedure
in
this
case
have
be
substantially
the
same
as
with
all
other
contribution
the
presentation
of
the
need
of
the
university
have
be
make
in
write
by
the
officer
of
the
university
whose
special
duty
it
be
to
prepare
its
budget
and
superintend
its
finance
a
committee
of
the
trustee
with
the
president
have
annually
confer
at
a
fix
time
with
our
department
of
benevolence
as
to
its
need
their
conclusion
have
generally
be
entirely
unanimous
and
i
have
found
no
occasion
hitherto
seriously
to
depart
from
their
recommendation
there
have
be
no
personal
interview
and
no
personal
solicitation
it
have
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
make
these
contribution
but
that
pleasure
have
arisen
out
of
the
fact
that
the
university
be
locate
in
a
great
centre
of
empire
that
it
have
root
itself
in
the
affection
and
interest
of
the
people
among
whom
it
be
locate
that
it
be
do
a
great
and
need
work
in
fine
that
it
have
be
able
to
attract
and
to
justify
the
contribution
of
its
patron
east
and
west
it
be
not
personal
interview
and
impassioned
appeal
but
sound
and
justify
worth
that
should
attract
and
secure
the
fund
of
philanthropy
the
people
in
great
number
who
be
constantly
importune
me
for
personal
interview
in
behalf
of
favourite
cause
err
in
suppose
that
the
interview
be
it
possible
be
the
best
way
or
even
a
good
way
of
secure
what
they
want
our
practice
have
be
uniformly
to
request
applicant
to
state
their
case
tersely
but
nevertheless
as
fully
as
they
think
necessary
in
write
their
application
be
carefully
consider
by
very
competent
people
chosen
for
this
purpose
if
thereupon
personal
interview
be
found
desirable
by
our
assistant
they
be
invite
from
our
office
write
presentation
form
the
necessary
basis
of
investigation
of
consultation
and
comparison
of
view
between
the
different
member
of
our
staff
and
of
the
final
presentation
to
me
it
be
impossible
to
conduct
this
department
of
our
work
in
any
other
way
the
rule
require
write
presentation
as
against
the
interview
be
enforce
and
adhere
to
not
as
the
applicant
sometimes
supposes
as
a
cold
rebuff
to
him
but
in
order
to
secure
for
his
cause
if
it
be
a
good
one
the
careful
consideration
which
be
its
due
a
consideration
that
cannot
be
give
in
a
mere
verbal
interview
the
reason
for
conditional
gift
it
be
easy
to
do
harm
in
give
money
to
give
to
institution
which
should
be
support
by
others
be
not
the
best
philanthropy
such
give
only
serf
to
dry
up
the
natural
spring
of
charity
it
be
highly
important
that
every
charitable
institution
shall
have
at
all
time
the
large
possible
number
of
current
contributor
this
mean
that
the
institution
shall
constantly
be
make
its
appeal
but
if
these
constant
appeal
be
to
be
successful
the
institution
be
force
to
do
excellent
work
and
meet
real
and
manifest
need
moreover
the
interest
of
many
people
affords
the
best
assurance
of
wise
economy
and
unselfish
management
as
well
as
of
continued
support
we
frequently
make
our
gift
conditional
on
the
give
of
others
not
because
we
wish
to
force
people
to
do
their
duty
but
because
we
wish
in
this
way
to
root
the
institution
in
the
affection
of
as
many
people
as
possible
who
as
contributor
become
personally
concerned
and
thereafter
may
be
count
on
to
give
to
the
institution
their
watchful
interest
and
cooeperation
conditional
gift
be
often
criticize
and
sometimes
it
may
be
by
people
who
have
not
thought
the
matter
out
fully
criticism
which
be
deliberate
sober
and
fair
be
always
valuable
and
it
should
be
welcome
by
all
who
desire
progress
i
have
have
at
least
my
full
share
of
adverse
criticism
but
i
can
truly
say
that
it
have
not
embitter
me
nor
left
me
with
any
harsh
feel
against
a
living
soul
nor
do
i
wish
to
be
critical
of
those
whose
conscientious
judgment
frankly
express
differs
from
my
own
no
matter
how
noisy
the
pessimist
may
be
we
know
that
the
world
be
get
well
steadily
and
rapidly
and
that
be
a
good
thing
to
remember
in
our
moment
of
depression
or
humiliation
the
benevolent
trust
to
return
to
the
subject
of
the
benevolent
trust
which
be
a
name
for
corporation
to
manage
the
business
side
of

the
idea

and
to
be
successful
must
have
the
help
of
men
who
have

along

of

the
closer
association

i
think
benefit
both
class
people

to

those
who
hold
confidential
position
in

at
time
have
surprising
experience
in
meeting
what
be
sometimes
practise
in
the
way
of
ecclesiastical
business
because
these
good
men
have
have
so
little
of
business
training
in
the
work

whole
system
of

seek
to
confine
their
dealing
to
people
who
tell
the
truth
and
keep
their
promise
and
the
representative
of
the
church
who
be
often
prone
to
attack
business
men
as
a
type
of
what
be
selfish
and
mean
have
some
great
lesson
to
learn
and
they
will
gladly
learn
them
as
these
two
type
of
worker
grow
closer
together
the
benevolent
