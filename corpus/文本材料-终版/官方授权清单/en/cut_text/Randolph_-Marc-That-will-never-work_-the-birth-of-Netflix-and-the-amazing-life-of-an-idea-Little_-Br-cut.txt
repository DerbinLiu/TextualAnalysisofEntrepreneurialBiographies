line
on
the
highway
like
ant

okay
i
say
but
i
ve
get
a
new
one
customize
baseball
bat
totally
personalize
and
unique
user
fill
out
their
information
online
then
we
use
a
computer
control
milling
machine
to
craft
a
bat
to
their
exact
spec
length
handle
thickness
size
of
the
barrel
all
one
of
a
kind
or
not
if
you
want
an
exact
re
creation
of
hank
aaron
s
bat
we
could
do
that
too
reed
s
face
go
blank
it
s
an
expression
i
know
well
to
an
outside
observer
it
would
look
like
he
s
just
star
out
the
dirty
windshield
at
the
redwood
whiz
by
or
the
subaru
go
a
little
too
slowly
in
front
of
us
but
i
know
what
s
behind
that
look
a
rapid
fire
evaluation
of
pro
and
con
a
high
speed
cost
benefit
analysis
a
near
instantaneous
predictive
model
about
possible
risk
and
scalability
five
second
go
by
then
ten
then
fifteen
after
about
thirty
second
he
turn
to
me
and
say
that
will
never
work
we
ve
be
do
this
for
a
few
week
reed
have
be
work
overtime
finalize
a
huge
merger
that
will
put
us
both
out
of
a
job
and
once
the
dust
settle
from
that
i
m
planning
to
start
my
own
company
every
day
in
the
car
i
pitch
idea
to
reed
i
m
try
to
convince
him
to
come
on
board
as
an
advisor
or
investor
and
i
can
tell
he
s
intrigue
he
s
not
shy
about
give
me
feedback
he
know
a
good
thing
when
he
see
it
he
also
know
a
bad
thing
when
he
hears
it
and
my
morning
drive
idea
they
re
mostly
bad
idea
reed
swat
this
one
away
just
like
he
do
the
others
it
s
impractical
it
s
unoriginal
it
will
never
work
also
baseball
s
popularity
be
wan
with
young
people
he
say
as
we
roll
to
a
stop
behind
a
sand
truck
the
sand
be
on
its
way
to
san
jose
where
it
will
eventually
be
turn
into
concrete
for
road
and
building
in
boom
silicon
valley
don
t
want
to
be
tie
to
a
decline
user
base
from
the
start
you
re
wrong
i
say
and
i
tell
him
why
i
ve
do
my
research
too
i
know
the
number
for
sport
good
sale
i
ve
look
into
baseball
bat
production
how
much
the
raw
material
cost
how
expensive
it
be
to
buy
and
operate
the
milling
machine
and
okay
i
might
have
a
personal
connection
to
this
idea
my
old
son
just
finish
his
rookie
little
league
season
for
every
one
of
my
point
reed
have
an
answer
he
s
analytical
rational
and
doesn
t
waste
time
with
nicety
i
don
t
either
our
voice
be
raise
but
we
re
not
angry
it
s
an
argument
but
it
s
a
productive
one
each
of
us
understands
the
other
each
of
us
know
that
the
other
be
go
to
offer
stiff
uncompromising
resistance
your
attachment
to
this
idea
isn
t
strictly
rational
he
say
and
i
almost
laugh
behind
his
back
i
ve
heard
people
compare
reed
to
spock
i
don
t
think
they
mean
it
as
a
compliment
but
they
should
in
star
trek
spock
be
almost
always
right
and
reed
be
too
if
he
think
something
won
t
work
it
probably
won
t
the
first
time
i
met
reed
we
be
take
a
cross
country
plane
trip
from
san
francisco
to
boston
reed
have
just
acquire
my
company
but
we
d
never
spent
any
meaningful
time
alone
together
i
d
be
sit
at
the
gate
wait
to
board
reading
through
a
binder
of
material
on
memory
leak
detector
and
software
version
management
when
someone
tapped
my
shoulder
it
be
reed
where
be
you
sit
he
d
ask
frown
at
my
paper
ticket
when
i
told
him
he
take
my
ticket
march
to
the
counter
and
upgraded
me
to
first
class
that
be
nice
i
thought
i
ll
get
a
chance
to
read
relax
a
little
maybe
even
get
a
little
sleep
but
that
be
my
first
lesson
about
reed
when
the
flight
attendant
come
he
d
wave
away
the
free
mimosa
turn
his
body
ninety
degree
and
lock
eye
with
me
then
for
the
next
five
and
a
half
hour
he
d
give
an
exhaustive
overview
of
the
state
of
our
business
barely
pause
to
take
a
sip
of
sparkle
water
i
d
hardly
gotten
a
word
in
edgewise
but
i
didn
t
care
it
be
one
of
the
most
brilliant
business
analysis
i
d
ever
heard
like
be
hooked
up
to
a
supercomputer
we
re
not
in
first
class
anymore
we
re
in
a
volvo
that
could
use
a
wash
but
i
still
find
reed
s
mind
fascinate
and
his
demeanor
refresh
i
m
grateful
for
his
advice
for
the
consult
i
m
get
for
free
on
these
ride
over
the
hill
into
silicon
valley
and
back
by
total
luck
i
ve
end
up
in
the
same
company
and
the
same
town
with
someone
who
understands
my
vision
and
can
provide
invaluable
help
not
to
mention
saving
on
gas
but
it
s
still
frustrate
to
hear
that
an
idea
i
ve
spent
a
week
research
be
totally
unfeasible
a
part
of
me
be
start
to
wonder
if
all
of
my
business
idea
be
built
on
a
foundation
as
unsteady
and
shifty
as
the
sand
load
into
the
truck
ahead
of
us
that
truck
by
the
way
be
still
in
the
left
lane
move
slowly
hold
everybody
up
i
m
frustrate
i
flash
my
light
the
truck
driver
look
at
me
in
the
rearview
mirror
doesn
t
even
react
i
mutter
a
few
irrational
obscenity
you
need
to
relax
reed
say
gesture
to
the
traffic
ahead
of
us
he
s
already
told
me
twice
that
my
habit
of
constantly
change
lane
be
in
the
end
counterproductive
and
inefficient
my
drive
make
him
insane
and
a
little
carsick
we
ll
get
there
when
we
get
there
i
m
gonna
pull
my
hair
out
i
say
and
i
don
t
have
much
left
i
run
my
hand
through
the
remnant
of
my
curl
and
then
it
happens
i
have
one
of
those
all
too
rare
epiphany
moment
it
seem
like
everything
happens
at
once
the
sun
come
out
of
the
cloud
and
it
stop
drizzle
the
sand
truck
wheeze
to
life
and
merges
into
the
proper
lane
and
traffic
start
to
move
it
feel
like
i
can
see
for
mile
down
into
the
clog
heart
of
san
jose
house
office
building
treetop
wave
in
the
breeze
we
pick
up
speed
and
the
redwood
fall
away
behind
us
and
in
the
distance
i
see
mount
hamilton
its
crest
sparkle
with
fresh
snow
and
then
it
come
to
me
the
idea
that
will
finally
work
personalize
shampoo
by
mail
i
say
silicon
valley
love
a
good
origin
story
the
idea
that
change
everything
the
middle
of
the
night
lightbulb
moment
the
what
if
we
could
do
this
differently
conversation
origin
story
often
hinge
on
epiphany
the
story
told
to
skeptical
investor
wary
board
member
inquisitive
reporter
and
eventually
the
public
usually
highlight
a
specific
moment
the
moment
it
all
become
clear
brian
chesky
and
joe
gebbia
can
t
afford
their
san
francisco
rent
then
realize
that
they
can
blow
up
an
air
mattress
and
charge
people
to
sleep
on
it
that
s
airbnb
travis
kalanick
spends
on
a
private
driver
on
new
year
s
eve
and
think
there
have
to
be
a
cheaper
way
that
s
uber
there
s
a
popular
story
about
netflix
that
say
the
idea
come
to
reed
after
he
d
rung
up
a
late
fee
on
apollo
at
blockbuster
he
thought
what
if
there
be
no
late
fee
and
boom
the
idea
for
netflix
be
born
that
story
be
beautiful
it
s
useful
it
be
as
we
say
in
marketing
emotionally
true
but
as
you
ll
see
in
this
book
it
s
not
the
whole
story
yes
there
be
an
overdue
copy
of
apollo
involve
but
the
idea
for
netflix
have
nothing
to
do
with
late
fee
in
fact
at
the
begin
we
even
charge
them
more
importantly
the
idea
for
netflix
didn
t
appear
in
a
moment
of
divine
inspiration
it
didn
t
come
to
us
in
a
flash
perfect
and
useful
and
obviously
right
epiphany
be
rare
and
when
they
appear
in
origin
story
they
re
often
oversimplify
or
just
plain
false
we
like
these
tale
because
they
align
with
a
romantic
idea
about
inspiration
and
genius
we
want
our
isaac
newton
to
be
sit
under
the
apple
tree
when
the
apple
fall
we
want
archimedes
in
his
bathtub
but
the
truth
be
usually
more
complicate
than
that
the
truth
be
that
for
every
good
idea
there
be
a
thousand
bad
one
and
sometimes
it
can
be
hard
to
tell
the
difference
customize
sport
good
personalize
surfboard
dog
food
individually
formulate
for
your
dog
these
be
all
idea
i
pitch
to
reed
idea
i
spent
hour
work
on
idea
i
thought
be
well
than
the
idea
that
eventually
after
month
of
research
hundred
of
hour
of
discussion
and
marathon
meeting
in
a
family
restaurant
become
netflix
i
have
no
idea
what
would
work
and
what
wouldn
t
in
all
i
knew
be
that
i
want
to
start
my
own
company
and
that
i
want
it
to
involve
sell
thing
on
the
internet
that
be
it
it
seem
absurd
that
one
of
the
large
medium
company
in
the
world
could
come
from
those
two
desire
but
it
do
this
be
a
story
about
how
we
go
from
personalize
shampoo
to
netflix
but
it
s
also
a
story
about
the
amaze
life
of
an
idea
from
dream
to
concept
to
share
reality
and
about
how
the
thing
we
learn
on
that
journey
which
take
us
from
two
guy
throw
idea
around
in
a
car
to
a
dozen
people
at
computer
in
a
former
bank

our

one
of
my
goal
in
tell
this
story
be
to
puncture
some
of
the
myth
that
attach
themselves
to
narrative
like
ours
but
it
s
equally
important
to
me
to
show
how
and
why
some
of
the
thing
we
do
at
the
begin
often
unwittingly
work
it
s
be
over
twenty
year
since
those
first
car
ride
with
reed
and
in
that
time
i
ve
come
to
realize
that
there
be
thing
we
discover
that
apply
broadly
can
influence
a
project
s
success
not
exactly
law
not
even
principle
but
hard

the
best
idea
rarely
come
on
a
mountaintop
in
a
flash
of
lightning
they
don
t
even
come
to
you
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
when
you
re
stuck
in
traffic
behind
a
sand
truck
they
make
themselves
apparent
more
slowly
gradually
over
week
and
month
and
in
fact
when
you
finally
have
one
you
might
not
realize
it
for
a
long
time

that
will
never
work
spring
one
year
before
launch
as
a

one
of
my
strong
memory

of
my

they
weren

to
be
built
by
hand
about
the
only
piece
you
didn
t
build
yourself
be
the
screw
that
held
everything
together
that
be
fine
with
my
father
he
be
a
nuclear
engineer
who
have
found
that
his
skill
set
be
much
more
lucrative
as
a

he
miss
the
instrument
the
calculation
the
sense
of
pride
in
building
something
after
a
long
day
on
wall
street
he
d
come
home
take
off
his

then
he

it
be
time
to
build
i
grow
up
in
a
pretty
normal
upper
middle

on
a
hill
flank
by
apple
orchard
with
a
big
pond
in
the
back
i
spent
much
of
my
childhood
outside
roam
through
the
acre
of
wood
that
surround
our
house
but
i
also
spent
a
fair
amount
of
time
indoors
reading
in
my
parent
well
stock
library
two
large
portrait
of
sigmund

hung
there
in
one
of
them
he

alone
in
the
other
he
be
pose
next
to
his
wife
martha

these
be

a
half
dozen
small
photograph
and
rendering

sign
correspondence
and
shelf
fill
with
his
book
civilization
and
its
discontent
beyond
the
pleasure
principle
the
interpretation
of
dream
it
be
the
sixty
freudian
analysis
wasn
t
exactly
uncommon
but
we
didn
t
have
a
miniature
freud
museum
in
the
library
because
anybody
in
the
house
be
spending
time
on
a
therapist
s
couch
it
be
because
he
be
family
he
be
uncle
siggy
it
s
a
little
more
complicate
than
that
freud
be
in
fact
my
father
s
great
uncle
make
him
my
great
grand
uncle
still
no
matter
how
convolute
the
chain
of
connection
my
parent
be
proud
of
the
family
association
with
freud
he
be
a
success
a
giant
of
twentieth
century
thought
as
important
an
intellectual
figure
as
have
exist
in
their
lifetime
it
be
like
be
related
to
einstein
proof
that
the
family
have
excel
on
both
side
of
the

my

also
have

twentieth

if
you

ever
take
any
course
in
advertising
if
you
ve
take
a
course
in
mass
medium
in
the
american
twentieth
century
heck
if
you
ve
even
watch
mad
men
or
see
a
cigarette
ad
then
you
re
familiar
with
his
work
bernays
be
in
many
way
the
father
of
modern
public
relation
the
person
who
really
figure
out
how
to
apply
new
discovery
in
psychology
and
psychoanalysis
to
marketing
he
s
the
reason
we
eat
bacon
and
egg
for
breakfast
he
s
also
the
reason
we
celebrate
thomas
edison
and
not
joseph
swan
as
the
inventor
of
the
lightbulb
he
s
the
guy
who
after
help
popularize
banana
for
united
fruit
turn
around
and
wag
a
propaganda
campaign
alongside
the
cia
to
stage
a
coup
in
guatemala
so
not
always
the
most
laudable
stuff
but
even
though
a
lot
of
what
uncle
edward
do
wasn
t
all
that
admirable
it
do
stick
in
my
head
that
i
could
do
what
my
father
do
every
night
in
our
basement
use
the
tool
he
d
be
give
to
create
something
i
be
an
indifferent
student
in
high
school
i
major
in
geology
in
college
but
if
i
ever
want
to
look
at
my
destiny
on
a
piece
of
paper
all
i
have
to
do
be
look
at
my
birth
certificate
marc
bernays
randolph
marketing
be
my
middle
name
my
father
s
train
be
beautiful
they
take
him
year
to
build
when
he
be
finish
with
one
he
d
give
it
a
coat
of
paint
and
then
another
and
then
another
then
he
d
call
me
down
to
the
basement
hook
the
train
s
boiler
up
to
an
air
compressor
and
perch
the
train
on
tiny
block
above
his
workbench
as
the
air
move
cleanly
through
the
valve
we
d
watch
the
back
and
forth
movement
of
the
piston
the
smooth
revolution
of
the
drive
wheel
we
would
admire
the
hand
built
system
of
rod
and
connector
that
smoothly
transfer
power
to
the
wheel
my
father
would
even
use
compress
air
to
sound
the
miniature
whistle
i
love
that
high
pitch
noise
to
me
it
be
like
a
formal
announcement
of
another
complete
effort
another
beautifully
make
thing
but
my
father
be
often
melancholy
when
he
heard
it
accord
to
him
a
real
train
whistle
power
by
steam
not
air
from
a
compressor
be
a
more
emotional
sound
one
that
he
could
only
hear
in
his
imagination
there
be
no
track
in
the
basement
for
his
train
the
vast
majority
of
them
never
saw
real
movement
just
air
compressor
test
after
i
go
back
upstairs
and
he
turn
the
air
compressor
off
he
d
lovingly
remove
the
train
from
the
workbench
place
it
on
a
shelf
and
start
a
new
one
over
time
i
realize
that
for
my
dad
it
wasn
t
finish
the
train
that
he
like
it
be
the
year
of
labor
the
day
at
the
lathe
the
thousand
of
hour
at
the
drill
press
and
milling
machine
i
don
t
have
many
memory
of
watch
those
train
run
what
i
remember
be
all
the
time
he
excitedly
call
me
down
to
the
basement
to
show
me
a
piece
he
d
just
built
a
piece
that
when
connect
with
fifty
others
might
amount
to
a
single
axle
a
piece
of
advice
he
told
me
once
peer
through
the
magnify
glass
over
his
left
eye
if
you
really
want
to
build
an
estate
own
your
own
business
control
your
own
life
i
be
in
high
school
at
the
time
most
of
my
energy
be
direct
at
girl
rock
climb
and
convincing
the
guy
at
the
liquor
store
that
i
be
old
enough
to
buy
beer
i
wasn
t
quite
sure
what
an
estate
be
but
i
thought
i
caught
his
drift
sure
sure
i
thought
why
not
but
twenty
year
later
in
the
early
ninety
i
thought
i
finally
knew
what
he
meant
i
d
spent
year
work
in
marketing
for
other
people
at
large
corporation
and
small
startup
alike
i
be
a
co
founder
of
macuser
magazine
as
well
as
macwarehouse
and
microwarehouse
two
of
the
first
mail
order
source
for
computer
product
i
d
spent
year
at
borland
international
one
of
the
software
giant
of
the
eighty
at
all
of
these
place
i
d
be
focus
on
direct
marketing
send
letter
and
catalog
directly
to
individual
consumer
and
study
the
way
they
respond
i
d
enjoy
it
and
i
be
good
at
it
i
have
a
knack
for
connect
product
to
customer
i
knew
what
people
want
or
if
i
didn
t
i
knew
how
to
figure
it
out
i
knew
how
to
reach
them
but
i
d
always
be
work
in
some
sense
for
someone
else
at
borland
i
d
be
part
of
a
huge
corporation
and
even
as
a
co
founder
at
macuser
and
macwarehouse
i
d
help
develop
an
idea
that
be
only
partly
my
own
as
reward
as
those
job
be
part
of
me
have
always
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
to
build
a
company
from
the
ground
up
completely
solo
if
it
would
be
more
fulfil
if
the
problem
i
solve
be
my
problem
that
after
all
be
what
my
father
be
tell
me
hammer
in
hand
that
s
why
he
descend
like
vulcan
to
his
workbench
under
our
house
in
chappaqua
he
want
to
set
up
his
own
problem
and
then
knock
them
down
by
so
do
i
i
be
a
year
shy
of
forty
i
have
a
wonderful
wife
three
kid
enough
money
to
buy
a
house
that
be
a
little
too
big
for
us
on
a
hillside
overlook
santa
cruz
i
also
have
somewhat
unexpectedly
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
my
hand
barely
six
month
after
acquire
our
company
and
give
me
the
green
light
to
build
out
the
marketing
department
i
d
inherit
reed
have
agree
to
the
corporate
merger
that
would
make
all
of
us
me
reed
and
the
two
people
i
d
just
brought
in
to
work
with
me
redundant
for
the
next
four
month
or
so
while
the
fed
go
over
the
paperwork
we
have
to
come
to
work
every
day
we
be
still
get
paid
but
we
have
nothing
and
i
mean
nothing
to
do
it
be
tremendously
boring
the
pure
atrium
office
be
nothing
like
the
laid
back
startup
office
of
today
no
nap
pod
no
pinball
machine
in
the
lobby
think
cubicle
think
fake
office
plant
think
a
watercooler
gurgle
at
regular
interval
reed
be
busy
finalize
the
merger
and
have
already
start
make
plan
to
go
back
to
school
as
his
tenure
as
ceo
be
come
to
an
end
he
be
feel
a
little
burn
out
he
want
to
change
the
world
but
he
be
increasingly
convince
that
he
couldn
t
do
so
as
a
tech
ceo
if
you
really
want
to
change
the
world
he
say
you
don
t
need
million
of
dollar
you
need
billion
bar
that
he
thought
the
way
to
effect
change
be
through
education
he
be
increasingly
passionate
about
education
reform
and
he
thought
that
no
one
would
take
him
seriously
unless
he
have
an
advanced
degree
in
the
field
he
have
his
eye
on
stanford
he
have
no
desire
to
start
a
new
company
but
he
also
indicate
that
he
want
to
keep
his
toe
in
the
water
as
an
investor
or
an
advisor
or
both
at
first
i
fill
my
limbo
merger
time
with

the
office
park
body
check
each
other
into
park
car
and
batting
a
scuffed
up
tennis
ball
through
homemade
pvc
pipe
goal
i
also
spent
some
time
at
the
drive
range
and
those
first
few
week
brought
me
a
revelation
i
ll
never
be
good
at
golf
i
d
always
thought
that
if
i
spent
enough
time
on
it
i
could
practice
my
way
into
a
decent
golf
game
and
for
week
i
test
that
hypothesis
i
d
take
an
hour
and
a
half
lunch
then
stop
by
the
range
on
my
way
back
to
the
office
but
no
matter
how
many
ball
i
hit
i
never
get
any
well
i
think
a
part
of
me
knew
even
then
that
a
perfect
swing
wouldn
t
cure
what
ail
me
what
i
need
wasn
t
a
sweaty
hockey
game
or
a
birdie
at
delaveaga
what
i
need
be
the
feel
of
be
deeply
engage
with
a
project
what
i
need
be
purpose
hence
the
idea
for
a
new
company
hence
personalize
shampoo
by
mail
i
kept
a
little
notebook
of
idea
in
my
backpack
and
carry
it
with
me
everywhere
i
go
drive
mountain
biking
you
name
it
it
fit
into
the
pocket
of
hike
short
really
nicely
i
d
even
take
it
surf
leave
it
in
my
backpack
on
shore
of
course
there
s
a
reason
why
reject
idea
be
personalize
surfboard
machine
shape
to
your
exact
size
weight
strength
and
surf
style
they
say
the
best
idea
be
born
of
necessity
and
nothing
s
more
necessary
than
a
properly
shape
board
when
you
re
scramble
for
wave
at
pleasure
point
i
m
an
idea
guy
give
me
hour
of
empty
time
in
a
silicon
valley
office
with
a
fast
internet
connection
and
multiple
whiteboards
and
you
re
go
to
need
to
buy
more
dry
erase
marker
i
probably
would
have
come
up
with
business
plan
just
to
get
out
of
embarrass
myself
at
the
drive
range
but
i
also
felt
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
people
i
d
already
brought
over
to
work
with
me
who
have
left

selfishly
i
didn

find
people
as
capable
smart
and
easy

but
both
woman
be
and
continue
to
be
sharp
detail
orient
and
no
nonsense
and
once
i
d
sniffed
out
that
reed
would
be
amenable
to
funding
a
new
company
if
i
could
come
up
with
a
good
enough
idea
i
go
to
christina
and
te
for
help
we
start
spending
hour
at
the
whiteboards
in
pure
atrium
we
make
good
use
of
the
company
s
high
speed
internet
a
rarity
in
those
day
and
even
in
silicon
valley
it
wasn
t
that
fast
to
do
background
research
in
hundred
of
diverse
field
look
for
the
perfect
opening
long
before
an
idea
make
its
way
to
reed
s
car
it
have
be
examine
and
vet
by
christina
and
te
those
whiteboard
session
make
me
feel
well
than
any
parking
lot
goal
or
long
drive
on
the
range
ever
could
even
if
every
idea
i
brought
to
the
whiteboard
be
bad
even
if
christina
and
te
s
research
make
it
clear
just
how
implausible
some
of
my
middle
of
the
night
revelation
be
i
knew
that
eventually
we
d
land
on
something
good
like
my
father
in
the
basement
there
be
pleasure
in
the
work
we
be
design
something
someday
we
might
get
to
build
it
okay
i
say
sigh
on
another
tuesday
morning
this
time
in
reed
s
immaculate
toyota
that
one
s
toast
i
guess
reed
nod
as
we
accelerate
smoothly
up
to
mph
exactly
the
speed
limit
no
more
no
less
we
d
be
discuss
idea
in
my
notebook
food
custom
blend
specifically
for
your
pet
the
idea
be
good
but
it
be
too
expensive
and
reed
have
point
out
that
it
be
a
liability
nightmare
what
if
someone
s
dog
dy
he
d
ask
we
re
out
a
customer
and
they
re
out
a
dog
i
say
think
of
my
own
lab
who
have
chewed
a
hole
in
the
fence
that
morning
sure
sure
reed
reply
absentmindedly
but
the
point
be
that
customize
a
unique
product
for
every
customer
be
just
too
difficult
it
never
get
easy
the
effort
to
make
a
dozen
be
exactly
twelve
time
the
effort
it
take
to
make
one
you
ll
never
get
ahead
but
we
have
to
sell
something
sure
but
you
want
something
that
will
scale
he
say
you
want
something
where
the
effort
it
take
to
sell
a
dozen
be
identical
to
the
effort
it
take
to
sell
just
one
and
while
you
re
at
it
try
and
find
something
that
s
more
than
just
a
onetime
sale
so
that
once
you
ve
found
a
customer
you
ll
be
able
to
sell
to
them
over
and
over
again
i
thought
of
all
of
my
most
recent
idea
personalize
surfboard
dog
food
and
baseball
bat
all
of
them
be
make
one
of
a
kind
and
aside
from
dog
food
these
be
thing
you
bought
only
occasionally
surfboard
and
bat
dog
food
you
bought
a
few
time
a
month
what
s
something
you
use
relatively
often
something
the
same
person
us
over
and
over
again
reed
thought
for
a
moment
his
head
tilt
slightly
back
the
stanford
student
in
the
driver
s
seat
turn
slightly
and
say
toothpaste
reed
frown
it
take
a
month
to
use
a
tube
of
toothpaste
not
frequent
enough
shampoo
i
say
no
reed
say
no
more
shampoo
i
thought
for
a
second
but
my
brain
felt
slow
that
morning
i
be
two
cup
of
coffee
into
my
day
but
i
be
still
tire
from
the
night
before
my
three
year
old
have
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
bad
dream
and
the
only
thing
that
have
coaxed
her
back
to
sleep
dry
the
tear
and
close
the
eye
be
a
well
worn
copy
of
aladdin
wedge
deep
into
the
entertainment
console
in
our
living
room
i
d
end
up
watch
most
of
it
even
after
she
d
fall
back
to
sleep
videotape
reed
look
at
me
don
t
remind
me
he
say
shake
his
head
i
just
get
nicked
forty
buck
by
blockbuster
on
a
movie
i
return
late
but
he
let
his
voice
tail
off
as
he
turn
to
stare
again
out
the
window
his
face
blank
then
his
eye
arch
upward
and
he
nod
maybe
he
say
that
morning
christina
and
te
and
i
met
in
my
office
as
usual
when
i
told
christina
how
the
drive
with
reed
have
go
she
walk
up
to
the
whiteboard
and
slowly
erase
the
thicket
of
list
projection
and
calculation
we
d
scrawl
across
it
in
the
past
few
day
so
long
fido
say
te
we
need
a
product
that
already
exists
in
the
world
i
say
but
that
we
can
help
people
access
online
bezos
do
it
with
book
you
don
t
have
to
write
book
to
sell
them
it
be
true
amazon
have
just
go
public
prove
to
everyone
that
service
that
be
once
consider
strictly
limited
to
physical
store
could
now
be
do
online
and
could
be
do
even
well
e
commerce
be
the
next
wave
we
all
knew
it
that
s
why
people
be
start
online
shop
for
pretty
much
anything
that
could
fit
in
a
box
diaper
shoe
you
name
it
and
it
s
why
i
be
spending
my
morning
with
reed
batting
idea
back
and
forth
until
they
shatter
into
dust
i
be
think
vhs
tape
i
say
to
christina
they
re
kind
of
small
people
don
t
necessarily
want
to
own
them
after
they
ve
watch
them
once
or
twice
video
store
do
pretty
well
we
could
let
people
rent
online
then
ship
tape
directly
to
them
christina
frown
so
we
d
pay
to
ship
thing
two
way
there
and
back
you
can
t
expect
people
to
pay
for
the
shipping
i
nod
sure
that
s
gonna
be
expensive
christina
say
jotting
down
some
figure
in
a
tiny
notebook
first
you
have
to
buy
the
tape
then
you
have
to
pay
to
ship
them
twice
plus
whatever
you
d
mail
them
in
plus
storage
for
all
the
tape
that
you
ve
bought
not
to
mention
te
chime
in
who
want
to
wait
a
week
to
watch
sleepless
in
seattle
i
ll
wait
forever
i
say
my
point
be
that
when
you
want
a
movie
you
want
it
now
te
say
yeah
but
have
you
be
in
a
blockbuster
lately

home
lorraine
didn
t
mind
up
to
a
point
and
she
be
usually
a
very
good
barometer
about
whether
or
not
something
sound
feasible
when
it
come
to
new
idea
i
tend
to
get
a
little
enthusiastic
this
time
lorraine
listen
to
me
with
a
skeptical
expression
it
have
be
almost
twenty
year
since
i
d
first
see
her
in
vail
colorado
the
friend
of
my
ski
patrol
buddy
s
roommate
she
d
come
to
ski
with
her
boyfriend
and
well
let
s
just
say
that
once
i
enter
the
picture
thing
didn
t
work
out
between
them
i
love
her
then
for
the
same
reason
that
i
love
her
now
her
keen
mind
her
down
to
earth
common
sense
she
rein
me
in
watch
logan
maneuver
a
forkful
of
pasta
toward
his
open
mouth
i
muster
the
last
of
the
day
s
enthusiasm
to
sell
lorraine
on
my
brilliant
idea
think
about
how
much
you
hate
drag
these
three
to
blockbuster
i
say
point
to
morgan
s
sauce
streak
face
and
hunter
s
grin
toothless
mouth
a
nightmare
and
this
could
solve
it
lorraine
purse
her
lip
and
dangle
her
fork
over
her
largely
untouched
plate
of
food
i
knew
that
when
we
get
up
she
d
have
to
eat
it
quickly
stand
up
near
the
sink
while
i
start
the
lengthy
process
of
corral
the
three
kid
into
their
bath
and
then
to
bed
first
of
all
you
have
sauce
all
over
your
shirt
she
say
i
look
down
it
be
true
not
a
great
shirt
a
white
t
shirt
advertising
borland
bug
hunt
only
pass
for
high
fashion
within
forty
mile
of
scott
valley
and
the
sauce
stain
wasn
t
help
i
dabbed
at
it
with
one
of
the
wet
wipe
we
kept
near
the
table
anytime
the
child
be
eat
second
of
all
she
say
smile
broadly
that
will
never
work
lorraine
s
reason
be
much
the
same
as
the
one
christina
and
te
give
me
at
the
end
of
that
week
the
tape
be
too
bulky
to
ship
there
be
no
way
to
guarantee
that
user
would
ship
them
back
there
be
a
high
likelihood
they
d
get
damage
in
transit
but
more
than
anything
it
be
expensive
it
s
easy
to
forget
how
much
vhs
tape
use
to
cost
there
s
a
reason
the
only
tape
we
have
in
our
house
be
kid
movie
back
in
the
ninety
the
only
studio
that
be
pricing
vhs
tape
to
sell
be
disney
and
even
then
they
be
only
do
it
for
movie
that
have
be
out
for
year
for
disney
bambi
be
pretty
much
always
a
new
release
because
new
customer
who
have
never
see
it
be
born
every
day
not
look
for
a
kid
movie
tough
luck
you
be
look
at
to
a
tape
there
be
no
way
we
could
afford
to
assemble
a
vhs
library
big
enough
to
tempt
user
away
from
the
video
store
christina
spent
day
look
into
blockbuster
s
and
hollywood
video
s
business
model
and
what
she
found
wasn
t
encourage
even
the
brick
and
mortar
have
a
hard
time
she
say
to
make
any
money
you
have
to
turn
a
tape
twenty
time
in
a
month
you
need
a
steady
stream
of
customer
that
mean
you
really
have
to
stock
what
people
want
new
release
ideally
crowd
don
t
line
up
at
blockbuster
every
friday
night
for
jean
luc
godard
people
want
die
hard
that
s
why
there
s
a
whole
wall
of
them
okay
we
could
also
focus
on
new
release
i
say
two
can
play
that
game
christina
shook
her
head
not
really
say
we
buy
a
tape
for
eighty
buck
and
rent
it
for
four
after
postage
packaging
and
handle
we
re
clearing
maybe
a
dollar
per
rental
so
we
have
to
rent
something
eighty
time
just
to
break
even
te
say
right
christina
say
the
video
store
can
rent
the
same
new
release
twenty
five
time
in
a
month
because
they
don
t
have
to
wait
for
the
postal
service
they
can
just
have
a
twenty
four
hour
rental
period
plus
they
re
not
pay
for
packaging
or
shipping
so
they
re
clearing
more
money
on
each
rental
too
so
we
limit
a
rental
period
to
two
day
i
say
still
take
at
least
three
day
to
ship
christina
say
look
down
at
her
notebook
best
case
scenario
and
it
s
not
likely
you
get
the
movie
back
after
a
week
you
could
rent
the
same
tape
four
time
a
month
if
you
re
lucky
so
by
the
time
you
could
rent
a
new
release
enough
time
to
make
some
money
off
it
it
wouldn
t
be
a
new
release
anymore
te
say
exactly
christina
say
and
you
re
still
compete
with
blockbuster
te
say
there
s
one
within
ten
or
fifteen
minute
of
almost
every
potential
renter
in
america
what
about
rural
area
i
say
but
my
heart
wasn
t
in
it
i
knew
they
be
right
unless
tape
get
cheaper
or
the
post
office
get
faster
rent
movie
through
the
mail
would
be
almost
impossible
back
to
the
draw
board
i
say
eraser
in
hand

please
mr
postman
early
summer
ten
month
before
launch
for
the
next
few
week
i
bat
idea
around
with
christina
and
te
argue
about
those
idea
with
reed
and
watch
them
slowly
turn
to
ash
on
the
floorboard
of
my
volvo
somewhere
between
scott
valley
and
sunnyvale
i
start
to
get
discourage
i
don
t
remember
how
we
first
learn
about
dvd
christina
might
have
uncovered
the
then
nascent
technology
during
her
market
research
my
co
founder
at
integrity
qa
steve
kahn
be
a
home
theater
tech
geek
and
might
have
mention
them
at
the
pure
atrium
office
i
might
have
read
about
them
in
the
newspaper
they
be
in
test
market
in
san
francisco
and
six
other
city
in
but
i
suspect
i
learn
about
them
from
reed
he
actually
read
all
the
free
tech
journal
that
get
mail
to
pure
atrium
journal
that
in
my
case
only
accumulate
in
a
dusty
pile
in
the
corner
of
my
office
and
sometime
after
the
online
video
rental
idea
crashed
and
burn
he
d
complain
to
me
about
another
exorbitant
late
fee
he
d
incur
at
a
video
store
movie
be
on
his
mind
and
movie
by
mail
have
be
one
of
the
few
idea
i
d
have
that
have
caught
his
eye
one
thing
s
for
certain
i
didn
t
see
a
dvd
on
a
shelf
prior
to
dvd
be
only
available
in
japan
and
even
if
you
found
one
there
be
no
way
to
play
it
no
dvd
player
be
for
sale
in
the
state
it
be
easy
far
easy
to
find
a
laser
disc
than
a
dvd
even
on
march
when
the
first
dvd
player
go
on
sale
in
u
s
test
market
there
be
no
dvd
available
for
purchase
outside
of
japan
it
take
until
march
for
any
title
to
be
release
in
the
united
state
and
the
few
that
be
available
weren
t
exactly
hot
new
release
the
tropical
rainforest
animation
great
africa
the
serengeti
the
first
mass
release
of
title
thirty
two
in
total
come
a
week
later
from
warner
bros
the
history
of
the
format
be
a
fascinate
one
and
it
s
too
long
for
this
book
but
essentially
everyone
movie
studio
the
video
player
manufacturer
the
big
video
chain
the
computer
company
want
to
avoid
a
repeat
of
the
vhs
betamax
war
in
which
two
compete
technology
battle
it
out
in
the
marketplace
confuse
customer
and
set
back
the
adoption
of
the
vcr
for
year
and
nobody
aside
from
cinephiles
and
collector
really
like
the
expensive
large
laser
disc
that
have
come
out
a
few
year
before
either
there
be
various
compete
technology
in
development
in
the
mid
ninety
and
all
of
them
be
compact
disc
size
take
note
of
that
compact
disc
size
that
be
what
caught
my
eye
a
cd
be
much
small
than
a
vhs
tape
and
much
lighter
in
fact
it
occur
to
me
that
it
be
probably
small
and
light
enough
to
fit
into
a
standard
business
envelope
require
nothing
more
than
a
cent
stamp
to
mail
quite
a
difference
from
the
heavy
cardboard
box
and
expensive
ups
shipping
rate
a
vhs
would
have
require
christina
do
some
dig
and
found
out
that
the
studio
and
manufacturer
be
planning
on
pricing
the
dvd
as
a
collectible
item
to
per
disc
that
s
a
far
cry
from
what
have
happen
in
the
eighty
when
studio
respond
to
the
newly
ubiquitous
video
store
by
raise
the
price
on
tape
once
the
studio
realize
that
the
video
rental
store
be
make
all
the
money
by
buying
one
vhs
cassette
and
then
rent
it
out
hundred
of
time
a
right
establish
by
the
supreme
court
as
the
first
sale
doctrine
they
have
decide
that
the
only
way
to
respond
be
to
price
the
vhs
high
enough
that
they
essentially
capture
their
fair
share
of
all
that
rental
income
they
knew
that
by
raise
the
price
like
this
they
be
say
good
bye
to
consumer
purchase
but
it
be
worth
it
because
most
people
didn
t
want
to
own
a
movie
the
studio
have
learn
from
that
mistake
and
they
want
dvd
to
be
like
cd
collectible
consumer
product
if
dvd
be
price
low
enough
they
reason
customer
would
forget
about
rent
and
instead
buy
movie
the
same
way
they
bought
album
on
cd
the
studio
envision
customer
with
shelf
of
movie
in
their
family
room
avoid
the
rental
middleman
altogether
cheaper
inventory
cheaper
shipping
it
be
look
like
movie
by
mail
could
work
if
and
this
be
a
big
if
dvd
become
a
popular
format
with
other
huge
category
book
music
pet
food
slowly
be
take
online
the
movie
rental
category
which
brought
in
billion
a
year
be
a
tempt
target
bet
on
dvd
be
a
risk
but
it
might
also
be
our
way
to
finally
crack
that
category
with
the
whole
world
consume
by
vhs
rental
we
might
be
able
to
make
dvd
rental
by
mail
work
and
have
the
video
rental
by
mail
category
to
ourselves
for
a
while
vhs
by
mail
be
dead
but
dvd
by
mail
could
work
now
if
only
i
could
find
one
i
have
a
longtime
fantasy
of
work
as
a
postman
after
a
few
year
in
california
it
have
become
a
run
joke
with
lorraine
and
me
anytime
i
get
fed
up
with
office
politics
or
worried
about
the
perpetual
boom
bust
cycle
of
startup
funding
and
bubble
the
two
of
us
would
sit
on
our
deck
with
a
glass
of
wine
and
imagine
our
alternate
life
somewhere
else
i
d
work
as
a
mail
carrier
in
a
tiny
town
in
northwest
montana
she
d
homeschool
the
kid
and
we
d
cook
dinner
together
at
when
i
have
finish
my
route
no
more
crisis
no
more
all
nighters
no
more
weekend
in
the
office
no
more
travel
no
more
get
up
at
three
in
the
morning
to
write
down
all
the
thought
that
have
woken
me
up
from
a
sound
sleep
part
of
the
fantasy
be
a
wistful
yearn
for
a
slow
simpler
life
for
get
off
the
treadmill
there
be
something
tempt
about
a
job
that
you
could
leave
behind
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
for
lorraine
i
m
sure
the
fantasy
of
the
simple
life
be
equally
vivid
for
year
she
have
tolerate
my
tendency
to
drift
off
midsentence
if
a
work
thought
push
its
way
in
she
have
gotten
use
to
wait
out
the
two
or
three
second
lag
time
between
when
she
say
something
and
i
finally
be
able
to
drag
my
focus
away
from
what
i
be
work
on
to
respond
the
simple
life
be
tempt
economically
as
well
silicon
valley
be
not
only
one
of
the
most
expensive
housing
market
in
the
country
everything
be
pricey
here
even
though
we
have
save
a
fair
amount
of
money
from
some
of
my
earlier
venture
and
be
earn
a
living
wage
there
be
a
feel
that
we
be
run
as
fast
as
we
could
just
to
stay
in
place
on
the
porch
lorraine
and
i
would
lapse
into
long
fantasy
and
their
attendant
economic
reality
with
the
money
we
have
save
and
the
money
we
would
make
sell
our
current
house
we
could
afford
a
palace
in
montana
i
could
almost
be
retire
at
forty
and
with
even
a
part
time
postal
job
we
would
be
do
great
but
like
all
wistful
yearn
our
vision
for
a
new
life
in
the
wood
be
probably
best
left
unfulfilled
if
i
actually
live
in
say
condon
montana
and
only
have
my
daily
mail
route
to
keep
me
busy
i
d
probably
quickly
learn
just
why
postal
worker
go
postal
the
truth
be
i
like
headache
i
like
a
problem
in
front
of
me
every
day
something
to
chew
on
something
to
solve
that
summer
i
be
do
a
lot
of
chew
at
lulu
carpenter
s
a
cafe
at
the
top
of
pacific
avenue
in
downtown
santa
cruz
reed
and
i
would
meet
there
for
breakfast
once
or
twice
a
week
before
drive
into
work
from
one
of
the
sidewalk
table
where
reed
and
i
usually
sat
with
our
back
to
the
cafe
s
huge
open
window
we
would
look
directly
across
the
street
at
the
santa
cruz
post
office
loom
over
pacific
avenue
like
a
church
the
santa
cruz
post
office
be
a
grand
many
columned
building
it
s
an
appeal
distinctly
old
fashion

granite
and
sandstone
exterior
glossy
tile

a
hallway
of
post
office
box
their
brass

somewhat
tarnished
i
wasn
t
send
many
letter
by
i
be
in
tech
and
email
be
king
but
watch
the
stream
of
people
parade
in
and
out
the
door
of
the
post
office
make
me
want
to
start
a
correspondence
with
someone
it
make
me
think
back
to
my
first
job
as
a
junk
mail
king
when
i
use
to
mail
thousand
no
hundred
of
thousand
of
letter
a
week
it
make
me
want
to
mail
thing
again
look
i
say
eye
the
delicate
leaf
etch
in
foam
on
the
surface
of
my
cappuccino
i
be
thirty
minute
into
the
dvd
by
mail
pitch
that
christina
and
te
have
help
me
formulate
let
s
just
try
it
mail
a
cd
to
your
place
if
it
break
it
break
and
we
know
that
this
idea
could
never
work
if
it
get
there
you
get
something
to
listen
to
on
tuesday
night
reed
s
eye
bore
into
me
it
be
eight
o
clock
on
a
monday
morning
and
not
only
have
he
probably
already
be
awake
since
four
he
d
also
already
have
a
double
shot
of
espresso
now
he
be
halfway
down
a
cup
of
regular
coffee
he
d
already
remind
me
several
time
that
neither
of
us
have
ever
actually
see
a
dvd
me
i
be
excite
as
a
bird
i
d
be
up
early
as
well
surf
at
the
lane
as
the
sun
come
up
but
even
hour
later
sip
coffee
on
dry
land
i
could
see
this
late
idea
ahead
of
me
just
start
to
differentiate
itself
from
the
horizon
rise
in
the
distance
as
an
indistinct
swell
it
be
still
too
early
to
see
if
it
be
go
to
be
rideable
or
not
but
regardless
it
be
best
to
maneuver
into
position
anyway
reed
sense
that
i
be
fidgety
alright
alright
he
say
finish
your
scone
we
walk
down
the
street
to
logo
the
use
record
store
on
pacific
and
wait
out
front
until
they
open
for
business
they
didn
t
carry
dvd
yet
of
course
but
we
thought
a
cd
would
be
close
enough
i
bought
a
use
patsy
cline
great
hit
compilation
if
this
didn
t
work
out
at
least
it
be
a
disc
someone
might
want
to
listen
to
within
minute
reed
be
crack
the
cd
out
of
its
clamshell
while
i
ducked
into
paper
vision
an
office
supply
store
to
look
for
an
envelope
it
seem
stupid
to
buy
a
whole
box
of
envelope
just
to
mail
one
thing
so
i
bought
a
greet
card
two
puppy
in
a
wicker
basket
barking
happy
birthday
it
come
with
its
own
pink
envelope
reed
print
his
address
on
it
in
the
post
office
while
i
fed
coin
into
the
vend
machine
to
buy
a
cent
stamp
in
go
the
cd
on
go
the
stamp
i
lick
the
seal
of
the
envelope
kiss
it
for
luck
and
drop
it
in
the
slot
under
the
worn
brass
sign
say
local
mail
only
speak
of
luck
many
month
later
well
into
the
netflix
experiment
i
go
on
a
tour
of
the
santa
cruz
post
office
by
then
the
company
be
a
go
we
hadn
t
launch
yet
but
we
be
far
beyond
the
early
day
of
just
throw
idea
out
the
window
of
a
toyota
avalon
on
highway
we
be
close
enough
to
actually
launch
that
i
decide
i
need
to
see
exactly
how
our
dvd
would
move
through
a
post
office
so
we
could
tweak
the
design
of
our
mailer
i
felt
like
a
little
kid
as
i
pass
the
stain
basket
on
the
back
side
of
the
mail
slot
the
load
dock
the
delivery
office
the
santa
cruz
postmaster
himself
trace
the
path
that
he
explain
be
exactly
the
same
one
our
pink
envelope
have
take
nine
month
earlier
from
stamp
to
slot
to
sort
to
bag
to
the
delivery
truck
that
would
ultimately
take
it
to
reed
s
mailbox
i
be
expect
a
highly
automate
system
run
at
high
speed
under
great
pressure
something
capable
of
destroy
even
the
sturdiest
of
our
prototype
or
if
it
wasn
t
happen
here
i
thought
that
the
letter
would
be
sent
to
a
large
facility
in
nearby
san
jose
to
be
sort
and
mangle
there
before
come
back
to
santa
cruz
for
delivery
but
what
i
found
be
something
more
human
more
analog
hand
sort
for
immediate
dispersal
local
mail
be
give
directly
to
the
driver
it
be
a
surprisingly
fast
and
gentle
process
be
this
how
it
s
do
everywhere
i
ask
the
postmaster
laugh
in
my
face
definitely
not
he
say
this
be
local
mail
all
the
other
mail
for
out
of
town
get
trucked
over
to
san
jose
and
they
sort
it
there
so
what
you
re
tell
me
be
that
if
i
mail
a
naked
cd
inside
an
envelope
and
address
it
to
anywhere
else
it
would
have
gotten
scratch
crack
or
broken
most
likely
he
say
lucky
us
i
thought
it
s
call
a
false
positive
also
know
as
be
lucky
if
we
d
use
any
other
post
office
or
if
reed
have
live
in
los
gatos
or
saratoga
our
cd
might
have
be
destroyed
hell
if
we
have
mail
it
to
my
house
in
scott
valley
instead
of
his
place
in
santa
cruz
the
thing
wouldn
t
have
make
it
and
i
wouldn
t
be
write
this
book
or
maybe
i
would
be
but
it
would
be
about
shampoo
instead
the
very
next
morning
less
than
twenty
four
hour
after
our
pink
envelope
vanished
into
the
slot
i
met
reed
in
a
parking
lot
in
scott
valley
and
he
pull
out
our
envelope
inside
it
be
an
undamaged
cd
it
come
he
say
thank
god
i
say
so
long
customizable
surfboard
good
bye
personalize
baseball
bat
when
that
cd
arrive
safely
i
think
reed
and
i
both
knew
we
d
found
our
idea
all
of
christina
s
and
te
s
objection
the
turnaround
time
the
convenience
factor
be
still
valid
but
if
it
only
cost
cent
to
mail
a
dvd
and
we
could
buy
them
for
twenty
buck
apiece
we
both
knew
we
have
a
shot
one
of
the
real
factor
separate
dvd
and
vhs
christina
and
te
and
i
found
out
be
the
size
of
the
library
even
in
place
where
dvd
be
available
in
the
united
state
there
weren
t
that
many
title
by
mid
there
be
still
only
about
title
to
choose
from
there
be
ten
of
thousand
of
movie
on
vhs
so
the
think
be
christina
say
when
i
show
her
the
cd
we
get
in
early
beat
the
video
store
to
the
punch
and
then
have
more
inventory
i
nod
it
s
more
like
have
any
inventory
nobody
have
a
dvd
player
yet
so
it
s
go
to
be
a
while
before
the
video
store
even
start
carry
dvd
we
ve
probably
get
a
long
window
of
be
the
only
game
in
town
might
make
up
for
lag
time
te
say
if
people
can
t
find
a
dvd
in
a
store
anyway
they
won
t
mind
wait
as
much
christina
s
brow
be
furrow
but
i
could
see
that
she
be
start
to
agree
okay
she
say
have
anyone
actually
watch
one
of
these
we
have
our
idea
now
we
just
have
to
figure
out
how
to
pay
for
it
when
you
start
a
company
what
you
re
really
do
be
get
other
people
to
latch
on
to
an
idea
you
have
to
convince
your
future
employee
investor
business
partner
and
board
member
that
your
idea
be
worth
spending
money
reputation
and
time
on
nowadays
you
do
that
by
validate
your
product
ahead
of
time
you
build
a
website
or
a
prototype
you
create
the
product
you
measure
traffic
or
early
sale
all
so
that
when
you
go
to
potential
investor
palm
outstretched
you
have
number
to
prove
that
what
you
re
try
to
do
isn
t
just
a
good
idea
but
already
exists
and
work
for
instance
a
few
year
ago
when
my
son
graduate
from
college
he
move
out
to
san
francisco
with
a
buddy
of
his
intent
on
start
a
new
company
in
less
time
than
it
take
to
drive
from
our
place
in
scott
valley
to
san
francisco
he
have
built
a
website
on
squarespace
set
up
a
credit
account
on
stripe
bought
some
banner
ad
use
adsense
and
set
up
some
cloud
base
analytics
on
optimizely
to
measure
the
result
all
within
a
single
weekend
one
of
the
idea
they
test
shampoo
by
mail
what
can
i
say
the
apple
doesn
t
fall
far
from
the
tree
but
back
in
you
could
raise
million
with
a
powerpoint
in
fact
you
have
to
there
be
a
lot
of
reason
for
that
but
the
most
fundamental
have
to
do
with
time
in
there
be
no
squarespace
no
stripe
no
adsense
no
optimizely
no
cloud
if
you
want
to
build
a
website
you
have
to
have
engineer
and
programmer
build
it
for
you
you
have
to
have
server
to
serve
the
page
you
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
accept
credit
card
you
have
to
do
your
own
analytics
forget
a
weekend
try
six
month
and
you
need
money
for
that
money
to
hire
people
to
rent
space
to
buy
equipment
money
to
survive
until
you
could
prove
your
idea
have
merit
and
until
you
could
raise
your
first
serious
funding
it
be
kind
of
a
catch
you
couldn
t
prove
to
your
investor
that
your
idea
would
work
unless
they
give
you
money
to
prove
that
your
idea
could
work
you
have
to
sell
them
on
your
idea
but
before
you
could
accept
that
first
dollar
and
sell
your
very
first
share
of
stock
you
have
to
put
a
dollar
sign
on
it
this
be
call
valuation
you
come
up
with
a
number
what
your
idea
be
worth
in
common
parlance
it
s
typically
a
good
thing
when
someone
say
hey
there
s
a
million
dollar
idea
but
in
silicon
valley
that
s
not
very
much
to
wit
netflix
be
currently
worth
around
billion
back
in
though
reed
and
i
decide
that
the
intellectual
property
the
idea
for
dvd
by
mail
plus
the
fact
that
he
and
i
be
the
one
work
on
it
be
worth
million
that
wasn
t
a
ton
but
it
seem
like
enough
enough
to
take
seriously
but
not
so
much
that
no
one
would
want
to
risk
money
on
it
we
figure
that
it
would
take
million
to
get
the
company
off
the
ground
million
to
get
the
site
launch
and
another
million
to
run
it
while
raise
our
next
round
of
funding
we
d
need
an
angel
investor
luckily
both
of
us
knew

reed
reed
want
to
be
our
angel
investor
because
even
though
he
be
leave
silicon
valley
for
the
education
world
he
want
a
way
to
stay
connect
to
it
funding
us
be
his
way
of
keep
his
toe
in
the
water
it
would
allow
him
to
remain
a
part
of
the
startup
culture
that
he
love
so
much
start
and
run
small
company
have
give
his
life
order
meaning
and
joy
and
i
think
he
may
have
be
scar
of
lose
that
as
he
transition
into
the
education
field
as
an
angel
investor
in
our
company
he
d
have
a
kind
of
safety
net
a
tether
back
to
a
world
he
understood
and
knew
how
to
navigate
it
be
fear
of
miss
out
pure
and
simple
i
decide
not
to
put
any
money
in
for
one
thing
i
d
just
have
my
third
child
my
son
hunter
and
unlike
reed
i
d
be
donate
a
lot
of
time
to
the
project
my
risk
be
my
time
his
be
his
money
but
by
not
put
any
money
in
at
the
outset
i
d
effectively
change
my
ownership
percentage
to
understand
why
you
need
to
know
a
little
bit
about
how
startup
company
raise
money
there
s
math
involve
but
bear
with
me
as
i
mention
earlier
reed
and
i
have
assume
that
the
value
of
netflix
which
at
that
point
be
just
two
guy
and
an
idea
be
million
so
to
keep
the
math
easy
i
decide
that
to
start
there
would
be
six
million
share
of
netflix
stock
each
worth
fifty
cent
and
each
represent
a
small
fraction
of
ownership
in
the
company
on
day
one
there
be
only
two
owner
of
the
company
reed
and
i
and
we
split
it
down
the
middle
each
of
us
receive
three
million
share
or
percent
of
netflix
now
if
nothing
have
happen
since
then
and
i
still
own
percent
of
netflix
my
world
would
be
a
little
different
as
i
mention
netflix
be
now
worth
about
billion
own
half
of
that
would
be
a
nice
piece
of
change
but
then
come
something
call
dilution
remember
at
this
point
it
s
just
two
guy
and
an
idea
we
need
to
build
a
website
hire
people
rent
an
office
buy
whiteboard
marker
i
really
like
whiteboard
marker
so
we
need
money
reed
be
willing
to
give
it
to
us
but
he
have
to
receive
something
of
value
in
return
so
what
happens
be
that
we
sell
him
stock
we
don
t
sell
him
share
that
we
already
have
we
create
new
share
and
sell
him
those
and
since
we
ve
already
say
that
each
share
be
worth
fifty
cent
in
exchange
for
reed
s
million
we
sell
him
four
million
share
so
now
everyone
s
happy
we
now
have
a
company
that
be
worth
million
and
its
asset
include
the
idea
which
we
value
at
million
and
the
million
of
cash
but
now
the
ownership
have
shift
i
still
own
my
three
million
share
but
now
there
be
ten
million
total
share
so
my
percentage
of
ownership
have
change
from
percent
to
percent
at
the
same
time
reed
s
ownership
have
increase
he
now
own
seven
million
share
the
three
million
of
his
original
share
for
the
idea
plus
the
four
million
share
he
receive
in
exchange
for
his
investment
so
he
s
go
from
own
percent
of
the
company
to
percent
we
re
now
partner
this
didn
t
bother
me
at
all
dilution
be
a
normal
part
of
the
startup
world
true
my
share
have
decrease
from
percent
to
percent
but
i
d
much
rather
own
percent
of
a
company
that
have
money
to
pursue
its
goal
than
percent
of
a
company
with
no
cash
on
hand
could
i
have
try
to
split
the
investment
with
reed
in
order
to
have
stayed
partner
sure
that
s
call
go
pro
rata
and
it
happens
all
the
time
but
my
pocket
weren
t
as
deep
as
reed
s
i
have
more
familial
responsibility
and
unlike
him
i
d
be
spending
almost
every
wake
hour
of
the
next
few
year
on
our
idea
plus
i
thought
that
put
significant
amount
of
my
own
money
into
the
project
would
limit
my
capacity
for
other
type
of
risk
take
if
i
stood
to
lose
a
million
dollar
and
not
just
my
job
i
m
not
sure
i
ever
would
have
be
able
to
take
some
of
the
imaginative
leap
that
be
so
crucial
in
the
early
go
in
silicon
valley
tech
talent
be
the
scarcest
resource
and
an
unknown
fledgling
company
can
have
a
hard
time
attract
top
employee
but
reed
thanks
to
the
pure
atrium
deal
have
clout
within
a
few
day
he
d
put
us
in
touch
with
one
of
the
key
player
in
what
would
become
early
netflix
s
eccentric
largely
foreign
national
ops
team
eric
meyer
a
muppetlike
frenchman
with
a
frenetic
manner
who
would
eventually
become
our
chief
technology
officer
eric
have
work
with
reed
earlier
in
his
career
but
now
held
a
senior
position
at
kpmg
i
knew
it
would
take
some
convincing
to
get
a
talented
and
highly
paid
software
developer
like
eric
to
join
our
ragtag
bunch
so
i
start
as
soon
as
i
get
his
number
in
the
meantime
i
need
to
come
up
with
something
approach
a
business
plan
notice
that
i
use
the
word
approach
i
never
intend
to
get
there
most
business
plan
with
their
exhaustive
go
to
market
strategy
detailed
projection
of
revenue
and
expense
and
optimistic
forecast
of
market
share
be
a
complete
waste
of
time
they
become
obsolete
the
minute
the
business
start
and
you
realize
how
wildly
off
the
mark
you
be
with
all
your
expectation
the
truth
be
that
no
business
plan
survives
a
collision
with
a
real
customer
so
the
trick
be
to
take
your
idea
and
set
it
on
a
collision
course
with
reality
as
soon
as
possible
but
we
still
have
to
figure
out
where
to
start
and
for
that
i
lean
on
christina
we
spent
hour
at
the
whiteboard
in
my
office
try
to
visualize
what
an
online
video
store
would
actually
look
like
christina
drew
every
page
of
the
propose
website
by
hand
sketch
out
meticulously
how
every
piece
of
content
the
dvd
title
image
the
synopsis
the
order
information
would
fit
i
start
look
for
office
space
or
at
least
for
conference
room
where
we
could
meet
once
i
have
a
team
together
the
best
western
down
the
street
from
my
house
in
scott
valley
be
my
top
contender
you
could
rent
the
conference
room
there
for
a
week
all
of
this
might
seem
like
it
happen
fast
and
it
do
in
a
matter
of
week
we
d
go
from
a
list
of
nebulous
idea
to
a
semicoherent
plan
for
move
forward
but
here
s
the
thing
about
silicon
valley
in
the
late
ninety
everything
be
fast
it
hadn
t
be
slow
in
the
eighty
not
exactly
but
progress
have
occur
on
a
more
incremental
scale
it
be
an
engineering
driven
culture
so
it
all
move
at
the
speed
with
which
thing
could
be
built
at
borland
international
where
i
work
in
the
eighty

very
architecture
of
the
corporate
campus

on
the
top
floor
in
the
window

and
everyone
else

of

engineer
be
on
top
and
everyone
else
work
for
them
along
with
that
hierarchy
be
a
certain
staidness

logically
accord
to
plan
by
the
mid
ninety
thing
have
change
jeff
bezos
s
success
at
amazon
have
show
us
that
it
wasn
t
just
more
powerful
hardware
or
more
innovative
software
that
would
lead
to
future
progress
it
be
the
internet
itself
you
could
leverage
it
to
sell
thing
it
be
the
future
the
internet
be
not
predictable
its
innovation
be
not
centralize
on
a
corporate
campus
it
be
a
whole
new
world
here
s
how
tangibly
and
quickly
thing
have
change
in
when
i
be
wrap
up
my
time
at
borland
you
could
actually
buy
a
publish
book
that
list
every
website
in
existence
since
there
be
only
about
site
that
book
be
less
than
one
hundred
page
long
but
by
march
of
when
reed
and
i
be
make
our
brainstorming
commute
over
the
santa
cruz
mountain
there
be
about
website
by
the
end
of
that
year
there
be
a
million
and
the
number
of
user
have
grown
to
a
hundred
time
that
number
we
weren
t
the
only
one
try
to
figure
out
new
way
to
monetize
the
internet
there
be
thousand
of
people
like
us
look
for
the
right
angle
the
right
product
the
right
way
to
take
advantage
of
a
brand
new
medium
i
ve
heard
people
call
the
mid
to
late
ninety
in
silicon
valley
the
era
of
irrational
exuberance
and
i
agree
about
the
exuberance
part
who
wouldn
t
be
exuberant
about
the
advent
of
one
of
the
most
revolutionary
game
change
technology
in
the
history
of
our
specie
but
irrational
not
quite
the
excitement
we
felt
at
the
dawn
of
the
internet
era
be
completely
rational
we
be
on
the
edge
of
an
open
green
field
unplowed
unplanted
talk
to
enough
entrepreneur
and
engineer
about
the
mid
to
late
ninety
and
what
they
ll
describe
to
you
sound
like
something
straight
out
of
the
journal
of
lewis
and
clark
we
all
felt
like
pioneer
on
the
eve
of
a
great
expedition
there
be
enough
land
for
everyone

get
the
band
together
july
nine
month
before
launch
a
week
after
we
mail
the
cd
i
found
myself
at
the
head
of
an
eight
top
at
the
cupertino
hobee
s
halfway
through
a
massive
blt
half
eat
burger
and
crinkle
cut
fry
litter
the
table
push
aside
to
make
room
for
binder
notebook
and
coffee
cup
we
be
really
do
it
for
the
uninitiated
hobee
s
isn
t
exactly
fine
din
it
s
basically
a
diner
table
mold
to
the
wall
laminate
menu
with
picture
of
food
on
them
and
no
stain
because
they
go
into
the
dishwasher
at
the
end
of
every
shift
a
cup
of
coffee
cost
two
dollar
and
it
s
endlessly
refillable
we
didn
t
choose
hobee
s
because
the
food
be
good
and
we
weren
t
meeting
at
hobee
s
in
an
effort
to
keep
our
idea
secret
in
fact
secrecy
be
the
least
of
our
concern
i
d
realize
by
then
that
tell
people
about
my
idea
be
a
good
thing
the
more
people
i
told
my
idea
to
the
more
i
receive
good
feedback
and
the
more
i
learn
about
previous
fail
effort
tell
people
help
me
refine
the
idea
and
it
usually
make
people
want
to
join
the
party
so
why
hobee
s
location
location
location
we
use
a
compass
to
draw
equal
size
circle
around
christina
s
house
in
foster
city
and
my
house
in
scott
valley
when
you
intersect
those
two
circle
stevens
creek
boulevard
in
cupertino
be
in
the
exact
center
no
more
than
a
thirty
minute
drive
for
anyone
who
be
anyone
christina
te
and
i
of
course
eric
meyer
our
provisional
cto
look
at
his
overly
foamy
cappuccino
with
gallic
disdain
boris
and
vita
droutman
a
married
ukrainian
couple
with
heavy
accent
and
eric
assure
us
a
genius
for
cod
and
reed
on
the
rare
occasion
he
could
get
away
from
the
pure
atrium
office
we
have
to
meet
at
hobee
s
because
we
be
in
a
weird
in
between
place
move
toward
be
a
real
company
but
without
any
kind
of
office
or
the
money
to
rent
one
christina
te
and
i
be
still
employ
at
pure
atrium
and
it
wouldn
t
do
to
have
people
come
in
and
out
of
our
office
there
all
day
work
for
a
different
company
so
we
stole
time
after
hour
or
during
lunch
break
head
to
hobee
s
for
two
hour
meeting
to
discus
our
company
to
be
what
we
be
go
to
do
how
we
be
go
to
do
it
and
when
we
could
start
christina
and
te
do
hour
of
market
research
and
over
their
cobb
salad
would
present
it
to
us
in
the
past
week
i
ve
go
to
fifteen
video
store
and
here
s
what
i
learn
te
would
say
before
christina
pull
out
her
preliminary
drawing
of
what
she
thought
the
site
might
look
like
boris
and
vita
would
huddle
with
eric
talk
about
tech
specific
in
a
language
so
advanced
i
really
understood
only
every
other
word
i
be
usually
do
about
three
thing
at
once
while
my
body
be
at
the
table
attend
to
these
conversation
my
brain
be
often
elsewhere
try
to
figure
out
how
to
convince
a
new
person
to
join
our
team
or
what
we
should
call
ourselves
or
where
we
d
land
once
we
have
our
funding
finalize
we
couldn
t
stay
at
hobee
s
forever
i
also
need
a
cfo
and
i
have
my
eye
on
a
guy
i
knew
from
borland
name
duane
mensinger
he
fit
the
profile
exactly
professional
with
a
work
history
that
include
close
to
a
decade
at
price
waterhouse
in
casual
california
where
short
and
flip
flop
be
the
norm
he
be
never
see
in
anything
except
a
button
down
shirt
but
the
very
quality
that
attract
me
to
duane
he
be
careful
organize
and
risk
averse
be
the
one
that
kept
him
from
commit
to
become
part
of
our
merry
little
group
of
outsider
while
he
repeatedly
and
ever
so
politely
told
me
no
he
kept
his
iron
in
the
fire
agree
to
help
us
build
our
financial
model
and
act
as
a
kind
of
rent
a
cfo
i
have
the
opposite
problem
with
a
man
name
jim
cook
who
end
up
as
one
of
the
most
important
member
of
the
netflix
team
he
be
a
friend
of
christina
s
a
burly
guy
who
have
work
in
finance
for
year
at
intuit
and
always
have
a
shit
eat
grin
on
his
face
i
like
that
about
him
it
s
good
to
have
optimism
in
the
startup
world
the
problem
however
be
that
he
desperately
want
to
be
the
cfo
he
certainly
look
the
part
jim
dress
like
a
banker
press
pant
crisply
iron
dress
shirt
every
last
one
of
them
light
blue
he
be
organize
detail
orient
and
efficient
and
unlike
duane
he
be
accustom
to
startup
risk
take
like
the
rest
of
us
he
actually
enjoy
it
i
thought
that
make
him
perfect
to
run
operation
to
figure
out
just
how
we
be
go
to
buy
store
and
ship
dvd
but
he
didn
t
agree
it
take
me
a
few
meeting
before
i
realize
that
his
big
grin
be
more
than
just
optimism
it
be
a
negotiate
tactic
my
strategy
when
i
m
not
get
what
i
want
in
a
negotiation
be
to
sigh
and
display
my
weary
sadness
to
make
the
other
party
feel
like
a
child
who
have
disappointed
his
parent
you
know
the
drill
i
m
not
mad
i
m
just
disappointed
jim
s
be
to
just
broadcast
a
huge
creepy
grin
at
me
it
be
unnerve
but
it
didn
t
work
jim
would
sign
on
as
our
director
of
finance
and
operation
in
october
in
the
end
i
realize
that
he
be
more
interested
in
the
finance
title
than
he
be
in
the
actual
job
i
m
usually
wary
of
title
inflation
although
it
s
something
that
seem
like
it
cost
you
nothing
to
give
it
actually
be
far
more
expensive
than
it
seem
since
it
cause
a
cascade
series
of
overpromotions
for
just
this
reason
i
have
already
decide
that
no
one
would
get
a
vp
title
at
least
at
first
instead
they
would
all
be
director
and
their
title
would
reflect
what
they
actually
do
not
what
they
want
to
do
but
in
jim
s
case
a
little
rule
break
be
unavoidable
he
be
too
valuable
to
lose
over
a
job
title
so
i
reluctantly
agree
to
add
the
finance
piece
while
impress
upon
him
that
with
duane
on
board
albeit
in
a
temporary
way
the
real
place
we
need
him
at
the
start
would
be
in
operation
cfo
would
come
he
would
just
have
to
be
patient
in
the
meantime
i
have
to
find
a
place
for
jim
and
all
the
rest
of
us
to
work
we
need
an
office
i
have
strong
feeling
about
be
a
santa
cruz
company
of
buck
the
prevail
norm
of
silicon
valley
and
not
move
to
a
cookie
cutter
office
park
in
sunnyvale
or
san
jose
santa
cruz
spoke
to
me
it
s
a
beach
town
a
surf
town
a
whiff
of
the
sixty
still
cling
to
it
there
be
probably
more
volkswagen
van
than
there
be
people
its
prevail
ethos
as
a
city
be
the
opposite
of
silicon
valley
s
growth
at
all
cost
model
people
in
santa
cruz
be
typically
against
development
they
ve
oppose
widen
the
road
they
don
t
want
it
to
grow
growth
be
god
over
the
santa
cruz
mountain
but
in
santa
cruz
it
s
vulgar
i
want
some
of
santa
cruz
s
laid
back
ethos
for
my
company
i
didn
t
want
to
attract
just
the
same
group
of
ambitious
young
tech
worker
from
over
the
hill
i
want
freethinker
people
who
be
slightly
outside
the
box
i
want
thing
to
be
different
i
want
life
balance
for
me
and
for
my
co
worker
i
want
santa
cruz
s
access
to
trail
and
wave
and
a
more
relaxed
way
of
life
and
i
didn
t
want
to
have
to
spend
two
hour
every
day
commute
to
palo
alto
if
i
be
go
to
start
my
own
company
i
want
it
to
seamlessly
integrate
with
my
life
i
want
my
kid
to
be
able
to
come
by
the
office
for
lunch
and
i
want
to
be
able
to
drive
home
for
dinner
with
them
without
spending
hour
inch
along
in
a
conga
line
of
car
i
be
look
at
office
space
in
santa
cruz
but
until
we
have
money
in
hand
we
be
stuck
with
the
scott
valley
best
western
that
best
western
be
still
there
by
the
way
i
drove
by
last
week
hop
to
sit
at
the
conference
room
table
where
we
d
end
up
spending
week
of
time
before
we
have
a
real
office
i
want
to
check
my
memory
how
big
be
the
conference
table
what
color
be
the
worn
carpeting
i
park
my
car
and
walk
around
outside
the
building
try
to
be
discreet
but
when
i
peer
through
the
window
at
the
first
office
space
netflix
have
ever
have
i
didn
t
see
a
long
table
or
ergonomic
chair
or
the
ever
present
scratch
up
water
pitcher
surround
by
plastic
cup
i
saw
a
room
full
of
thing
none
of
us
would
have
have
any
use
for
a
sad
treadmill
a
collection
of
mismatch
dumbbell
a
dirty
yoga
mat
unfurled
in
the
corner
time
be
cruel
and
there
be
no
monument
in
tech
i
be
spending
a
lot
of
time
eat
lunch
that
summer
in
addition
to
hobee
s
i
be
drive
up
to
woodside
a
few
time
a
month
in
an
ongoing
attempt
to
woo
a
video
store
owner
name
mitch
lowe
i
d
first
met
mitch
in
la
vega
at
the
annual
conference
for
the
video
software
dealer
association
vsda
for
short
i
d
go
in
june
on
a
hunch
with
no
real
plan
other
than
to
conduct
the
most
general
kind
of
research
it
have
seem
prudent
give
that
we
be
look
to
start
an
e
commerce
business
focus
on
video
rental
to
acquire
something
more
than
a
vague
idea
of
what
it
meant
to
rent
video
in
the
back
of
my
mind
i
be
hop
that
someone
might
sell
some
kind
of
software
for
run
rental
store
that
we
might
be
able
to
convert
to
work
online
i
d
have
to
use
a
little
subterfuge
the
vsda
be
a
trade
show
which
mean
that
ostensibly
it
be
only
open
to
member
of
the
trade
not
the
general
public
so
a
month
or
so
before
i
left
for
vega
when
i
go
to
register
i
decide
that
i
be
now
the
general
manager
of
randolph
video
of
scott
valley
california
i
answer
the
questionnaire
as
best
i
could
employee
annual
revenue
that
be
a
hard
one
i
have
no
idea
how
much
a
video
store
do
in
business
let
s
see
how
about

and
then
a
few
week
later
my
badge
show
up
in
the
mail
i
don
t
know
what
i
expect
from
the
vsda
show
probably
some
booth
some
roundtable
talk
the
normal
dry
business
convention
i
recognize
from
my
year
in
direct
marketing
i
think
i
have
the
idea
that
the
whole
thing
would
be
preside
over
by
stereotypical
video
store
employee
if
you
re
old
enough
to
remember
video
store
you
know
the
type
early
twenty
big
glass
permanent
sneer
what
i
found
be
entirely
different
vsda
be
insane
there
be
thousand
of
people
there
swarm
around
hundred
of
elaborate
ridiculously
appoint
booth
model
wander
the
convention
center
hand
out
studio
swag

and

up
the
room
movie
soundtrack
blare
from
gigantic
speaker
so
loud
the
floor
be
shake
it
be
like
some
unholy
mix
of
disney
world
a
hollywood
movie
premiere
and
the
indiana
state
fair
i
stood
in
front
of
a
green
screen
then
have
my
smile
face
insert
into
a
poster
for
mission
impossible
i
pose
for
a
picture
with
wallace
and
gromit
i
stood
in
wonder
beneath
the
thirty
foot
barney
stand
sentinel
at
the
entrance
to
the
exhibit
hall
and
watch
him
open
and
close
his
mouth
in
greet
i
felt
like
i
be
on
hallucinogen
for
hour
i
wander
from
booth
to
booth
essentially
try
to
figure
out
how
the
video
store
business
work
who
be
the
major
player
who
make
money
and
how
my
strategy
be
to
play
the
rube
to
columbo
my
way
to
an
understand
but
i
wasn
t
get
very
far
by
the
end
of
the
day
i
d
make
my
way
past
the
huge
booth
to
what
at
these
kind
of
convention
be
call
the
pipe
and
drape
section
so
call
because
each
booth
be
separate
from
the
next
by
a
waist
high
framework
of
metal
pipe
draped
with
curtain
to
hide
the
ugliness
this
be
the
home
of
the
lesser
trafficked
low
real
estate
booth
go
be
the
fancy
electronic
display
there
be
no
sign
of
john
cusack
or
denise
richards
no
commemorative
mug
or
d
glass
greet
me
instead
middle
age
guy
sat
behind
card
table
chat
placidly
about
return
rate
and
inventory
here
be
the
people
i
want
to
see
the
software
guy
i
end
up
at
a
booth
near
the
back
talk
to
a
nondescript
man
in
his
mid
thirty
with
a
mustache
he
have
a
kind
expression
a
sweet
manner
and
a
hand
letter
name
tag
that
simply
say
mitch
i
laid
my
columbo
act
on
thick
at
my
store
my
seven
employee
and
i
have
be
use
pad
and
pencil
to
keep
track
of
rental
i
say
what
do
this
type
of
software
actually
do
his
smile
suggest
that
he
might
be
on
to
me
but
he
didn
t
let
on
as
we
talk
i
learn
that
mitch
ran
a
small
chain
of
video
store
call
video
droid
he
have
ten
location
and
manage
thousand
of
title
in
each
one
of
them
i
be
interested
in
the
way
he
talk
about
the
practical
challenge
of
maintain
an
inventory
of
both
new
and
classic
film
but
what
really
fascinate
me
be
his
deep
knowledge
of
movie
and
his
even
deeper
connection
with
his
renter
he
paid
attention
to
what
they
like
what
they
ask
for
and
what
they
want
he
be
a
movie
buff
and
he
want
to
help
his
customer
find
the
kind
of
movie
they
d
love
that
meant
give
them
not
only
what
they
thought
they
want
but
what
they
didn
t
even
know
they
want
mitch
be
a
walk
talk
imdb
he
watch
movie
all
day
at
the
store
then
go
home
and
watch
a
movie
while
he
be
eat
dinner
then
stayed
up
late
watch
even
more
movie
unlike
the
stereotypical

snobbish
and
elitist
proud
of
his
vast
knowledge
mitch
be
gregarious
and
friendly
eager
to
share
his
passion
over
his
decade
in
the
business
he
have
talk
to
thousand
of
people
about
what
they
watch
what
they
like
and
disliked
what
else
they
have
see
it
be
this
deep
internal
database
of
movie
knowledge
and
human
insight
that
enable
him
to
predict
exactly
the
right
movie
for
a
person
s
mood

and
taste
he
be
a

sommelier
he
also
wasn
t
fall
for
my
columbo
routine
about
ten
minute
into
our
conversation
he
smile
at
me
seemingly
guileless
but
with
a
glint
in
his
eye
and
say
what
be
you
really
up
to
i
hem
and
haw
and
then
i
told
him
the
outline
of
my
idea
for
video
by
mail
he
seem
mildly
interested
we
exchange
number
and
i
left
the
booth
think
i
might
have
found
a
low
profile
minor
player
to
bounce
idea
off
of
what
a
nice
guy
i
thought
later
that
day
look
for
a
map
of
the

i
open
the

kept
in
touch
he
live
in
marin
so
we
mostly
met
by
phone
but
i
kept
him
abreast
of
what
we
be
up
to
ask
him
question
if
i
thought
his
answer
would
be
helpful
i
met
him
a
few
time
in
woodside
for
coffee
by
the
time
we
be

a
crazy

hallucinogenic

i
have

and
just
by
hearing

shoot
them
down
i
d
learn
something
he
have
the
perfect
combination
of
content
knowledge
and
industry
knowledge
he
love
movie
as
much
as
he
love
the
logistics
of
rent
them
mitch
wasn
t
and
even
now
he
isn
t
a
silicon
valley
guy
he
be
a
down
to
earth
business
owner
with
incredibly
progressive
idea
in
fact
the
very
name
of
his
video
store
chain
video
droid
be
a
reference
to
his
very
early
wager
that
eventually
movie
could
be
distribute
from
kiosk
george
lucas
at
one
point
come
after
mitch
serve
him
with
a
cease
and
desist
order
claim
he
held
the
right
to
the
word
droid
that
last
about
as
long
as
it
take
mitch
to
demonstrate
that
his
use
of
the
word
predate
star
war
by
many
year
his
look
and
manner
scream
normal
guy
but
the
more
i
talk
to
him
the
more
hint
i
get
that
there
be
something
much
more
interest
behind
the
fa
ade
he
let
slip
once
that
he
d
once
work
as
a
smuggler
of
clothing
in
and
out
of
the
eastern
bloc
under
communism
he
shyly
admit
that
his
mother
have
a
porn
oscar
not
as
a
performer
but
as
a
friend
to

openly
offer
him
a
job

politely
demur
he
love
run

eight

before

enough
time
around
silicon

and
you
ll
start
to
hear
a
funny
acronym
opm
particularly
if
you
re
hang
around
with
battle
scar
entrepreneur
with
a
couple
of
startup
under
their
belt
opm
will
pepper
conversation
about
early
stage
company
sometimes
it
s
use
in
the
context
of
sage
advice
you
want
to
know
the
most
important
principle
of

s
opm
sometimes
you
ll
hear
it
as
a
cautionary
warn
i
know
you
re
confident
but
please
stick
to
opm
sometimes
it
s
just
a
mantra
repeat
as
part
of
a
kind
of
yogic
practice
in
the
conference
room
of
office
park
across
the
land
opm
opm
opm
what
s
opm
you
might
ask
just
a
bit
of
startup
slang
other
people
s
money
when
entrepreneur
implore
you
to
remember
opm
what
they
re
say

when
it
come
to
financing
your
dream
use
only
other
people
s
money
entrepreneurship
be
risky
and
you
want
to
ensure
that
the
only
skin
you
have
in
the
game
be
well
your
actual
skin
you
ll
be
dedicate
your
life
to
your
idea
let
others
dedicate
the
content
of
their
wallet
by
dedicate
my
time
not
my
money
to
our
dvd
by
mail
concept
i
be
follow
my
own
opm
advice
reed
wasn
t
he
d
agree
as
we
ve
see
to
put
up
million
of
his
own
capital
as
seed
money
but
after
a
few
week
he
reconsider
the
amount
he
didn
t
have
cold
foot
exactly
but
he
didn
t
want
to
be
the
only
backer
i
like
the
idea
but
i
m
worried
we
might
be
in
an
echo
chamber
he
say
you
re
worried
about
us
get
stuck
up
our
own
ass
i
say
reed
nod
you
do
have
a
tendency
to
get
high
on
your
own
bullshit
it
s
not
bullshit
if
you
believe
it
i
say
that
s
true
by
the
way
for
most
of
my
career
i
ve
gotten
flack
before
for
my
boundless
faith
in
whatever
it
be
i
m
sell
even
before
netflix
i
d
convince
more
than
a
few
people
to
take
pay
cut
to
work
for
me
to
leave
steady
work
to
hop
aboard
a
startup
with
a
slim
chance
of
survival
but
in
every
case
i
wasn
t
just
spew
hot
air
whether
it
be
the
late
generation
of
spreadsheet
or
dvd
by
mail
i
genuinely
believe
in
what
i
be
sell
i
have
absolute
faith
in
what
reed
and
i
be
do
but
i
saw
his
point
ask
other
people
for
money
force
us
to
allow
other
voice
into
the
room
to
listen
to
people
outside
the
pure
atrium
office
or
reed
s
avalon
it
force
us
to
validate
the
idea
that
s
another
benefit
of
use
opm
before
you
pour
your
life
into
start
a
company
it
s
not
a
bad
idea
to
get
just
a
little
bit
of
reassurance
that
you
re
not
completely
out
of
your
mind
convincing
someone
to
part
with
their
money
tends
to
separate
those
who
be
blindly
supportive
i
love
that
idea
from
those
who
be
support
you
with
their
eye
wide
open
i
often
counsel
young
entrepreneur
to
start
by
ask
people
what
they
think
but
then
immediately
follow
up
the
inevitable
i
love
it
reply
with
the
ask
can
i
count
on
you
to
invest
a
few
thousand
dollar
the
backpedal
be
so
fast
and
furious
that
it
make
lance
armstrong
look
like
my
grandmother
plus
it
s
never
too
early
to
be
in
contact
with
future
investor
you
might
need
later
when
you
re
raise
your
next
round
of
funding
the
seed
in
seed
funding
usually
refers
to
the
business
newly
plant
and
hop
to
grow
but
it
also
refers
to
investor
who
be
get
in
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
end
reed
reduce
his
original
million
pledge
to
million
we
would
reach
out
to
others
for
the
remain
i
should
start
by
say
that
ask
for
money
be
hard
really
hard
but
it
s
nothing
compare
to
what
it
feel
like
to
beg
for
spare
change
on
the
sidewalk
of
hartford
connecticut
when
i
be
in
college

lot

and
imbue
in
me

healthy
respect
for

me
knot

and
how

almost
everything

how
to
build
a
shelter
how
to
purify
drinking
water
as
a
way
to
teach
leadership
and
teamwork
but
the
real
objective
be
to
put
the
kid
in
situation
that
seem
impossible
and
prove
to
them
over
and
over
that
they
be
capable
of
much
more
than
they
imagine
work
for
the
wilderness
school
taught
me
a
lot
about
humility
like
most
of
the
other
leader
and
instructor
i
grow
up
in
a
leafy
suburb
a
child
of
privilege
on
the
surface
we
didn
t
have
much
in
common
with
the
kid
we
d
be
lead
into
the
wood
most
of
us
have
grown
up
well
fed
with
secure
housing
and
plenty
of
money
many
of
these
kid
have
endure
homelessness
unstable
housing
and
hunger
take
a
kid
who
have
never
left
hartford
who
have
grown
up
in
poverty
who
have
already
endure
more
deprivation
than
i
would
ever
know
and
drop
him
into
the
wood
outside
cornwall
or
goshen
be
a
huge
change
to
say
the
least
to
help
us
well
understand
what
a
shock
this
kind
of
experience
could
be
the
wilderness
school
give
us
a
number
of
different
training
experience
each
design
to
be
similarly
disorient
for
us
all
of
them
take
place
in
the
city
hartford
stamford
new
haven
where
our
student
be
from
all
of
them
be
engineer
to
make
us
as
uncomfortable
as
our
charge
the
most
impactful
of
these
exercise
blindfolding
us
drive
us
to
a
random
intersection
in
hartford
confiscate
our
wallet
and
watch
and
tell
us
that
we
d
be
picked
up
in
three
day
no
food
no
water
no
prearrange
place
to
sleep
just
a
phone
number
write
on
our
arm
in
case
we
decide
to
give
up
it
go
without
say
that
all
of
us
would
rather
freeze
to
death
under
an
overpass
than
admit
defeat
and
call
it
i
be
drop
off
at
the
corner
of
charter
oak
and
taylor
at
p
m
on
a
tuesday
at
first
it
didn
t
seem
that
different
from
a
regular
afternoon
in
any
city
i
d
eat
a
late
lunch
so
i
wasn
t
worried
about
hunger
my
map
reading
skill
come
in
handy
and
i
be
quickly
able
to
locate
the
connecticut
river
i
knew
how
to
survive
in
green
space
when
night
come
i
improvised
a
shelter
with
a
trash
bag
and
some
fall
tree
branch
the
night
be
warm
and
when
i
couldn
t
sleep
i
walk
down
to
the
river
and
talk
myself
into
a
few
beer
with
a
group
of
teenager
party
down
there
i
didn
t
particularly
want
to
stay
up
until
sunrise
with
them
drinking
the
night
away
but
i
knew
that
beer
have
enough
calorie
to
stave
off
hunger
and
it
would
pas
the
time
when
i
woke
up
the
next
morning
i
be
starve
i
hoofed
it
into
town
drawn
by
the
unmistakable
odor
of
fry
food
and
wander
into
a
downtown
food
court
i
circle
the
table
like
a
vulture
try
to
work
up
the
courage
to
ask
someone
to
buy
me
a
breakfast
or
at
the
very
least
give
me
one
of
their
bagel
but
then
i
have
a
different
idea
why
bother
to
ask
instead
i
watch
businessmen
scarf
down
egg
mcmuffins
and
bagel
wait
for
them
to
leave
so
i
could
discreetly
slide
into
their
seat
i
didn
t
fish
anything
out
of
the
trash
but
i
be
not
above
scavenge
a
plate
of
half
eat
hash
brown
i
be
like
one
of
the
pigeon
crowd
the
plaza
alert
to
every
sign
of
movement
i
be
also
very
aware
of
the
way
people
look
at
me
or
pointedly
didn
t
look
at
me
as
i
go
in
for
other
people
s
scrap
i
have
never
be
look
at
like
that
before
by
dinner
on
that
second
day
my
stomach
have
curl
into
itself
from
hunger
half
eat
pizza
just
wasn
t
go
to
make
it
i
need
to
cut
out
the
middleman
get
myself
a
few
dollar
and
buy
myself
something
i
need
money
people
have
it
and
all
i
have
to
do
be
walk
up
to
them
and
ask
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
myself
in
a
bank
window
saw
my
reasonably
clean
preppy
east
coast
clothes
my
still
relatively
clean
shaven
face
and
ask
myself
how
hard
could
it
be
answer
very
hard
one
of
the
way
people
measure
a
marketing
or
sale
assignment
be
by
analyze
the
difficulty
of
the
ask
what
be
you
ask
for
and
what
be
you
promising
in
return
year
later
when
i
be
first
enter
the
marketing
profession
i
look
to
bottle
water
as
one
of
the
great
triumph
of
salesmanship
marketing
in
its
purest
form
give
me
your
money
and
i
ll
give
you
water
something
that
be
almost
free
and
that
be
available
almost
everywhere
something
that
cover
percent
of
the
earth
s
surface
but
that
s
nothing
compare
to
beg
for
spare
change
panhandle
be
salesmanship
at
its
purest
it
s
the
totally
naked
ask
money
for
nothing
we
re
condition
not
to
ask
for
thing
and
when
we
do
ask
for
them
we
ve
learn
that
we
have
to
offer
something
in
return
but
ask
for
money
and
offering
nothing
back
no
service
no
product
not
even
a
song
be
truly
terrify
it
s
like
look
into
an
abyss
that
day
in
hartford
i
thought
a
bare
outstretched
hand
be
too
stark
so
i
picked
a
plastic
cup
out
of
the
trash
and
station
myself
on
a
pedestrian
friendly
street
downtown
slightly
off
the
beaten
path
i
be
a
hundred
mile
from
home
but
i
didn
t
want
to
take
the
chance
of
run
into
anybody
i
knew
friend
friend
of
friend
friend
parent
in
my
mind
i
rehearse
my
line
spare
any
change
i
consider
a
longer
story
i
be
stuck
after
hitchhike
i
d
be
robbed
on
the
bus
i
have
lose
my
wallet
the
only
thing
that
be
out
of
bound
be
the
truth
i
be
participate
in
a
strange
urban
test
for
my
summer
employment
lead
underprivileged
youth
through
the
connecticut
countryside
the
first
person
to
pas
be
a
brusque
tall
lawyer
type
in
a
suit
i
chickened
out
before
he
be
within
three
foot
couldn
t
even
make
eye
contact
the
same
thing
happen
with
a
construction
worker
shrug
his
way
out
of
his
work
vest
on
his
way
to
the
bus
stop
then
a
nurse
in
her
scrub
hurry
to
the
pharmacy
across
the
street
every
time
i
d
resolve
to
make
eye
contact
and
ask
for
money
and
then
my
body
would
recoil
little
by
little
my
shoulder
slump
my
head
start
to
hang
i
have
climbed
mountain
raft
river
run
triathlons
but
this
be
the
hardest
thing
i
have
ever
try
to
do
and
then
i
finally
do
it
a
friendly
look
woman
about
my
mother
s
age
turn
the
corner
and
walk
toward
me
she
be
move
fast
enough
to
be
go
somewhere
but
slow
enough
to
look
like
she
be
enjoy
herself
i
muster
up
the
courage
to
look
her
in
the
eye
and
ask
my
voice
barely
a
whisper
do
you
have
any
spare
change
no
she
say
her
face
turn
to
stone
as
she
walk
right
past
me
but
i
have
broken
the
ice
over
the
next
four
hour
i
make
a
dollar
and
seventy
five
cent
enough
for
a
hot
dog
back
at
the
food
court
i
get
gradually
well
at
ask
i
learn
to
keep
it
short
to
make
eye
contact
to
slump
but
not
too
much
to
use
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
but
not
loud
enough
to
seem
demand
or
scary
but
the
breakthrough
for
me
be
simply
tell
people
the
truth
can
you
spare
some
change
i
m
really
hungry
there
be
something
about
speak
from
the
heart
that
cut
right
through
it
get
people
s
attention
and
broke
down
their
cynicism
and
defense
the
key
be
get
over
the
shame
of
ask
of
show
the
most
basic
essential
need
to
a
stranger
it
s
more
difficult
than
it
sound
it
make
me
feel
sleazy
to
ask
it
make
me
feel
low
when
people
say
no
but
by
far
the
most
difficult
thing
to
bear
be
the
invisibility
muster
up
all
your
courage
and
desperation
then
debase
yourself
in
front
of
a
stranger
only
to
be
totally
ignore
that
be
bad
of
all

me
after
that
ask
an
investor
for
be
nothing
one
of
our
first
target
for
funding
be

we
thought
we
have
the
perfect
person
someone
who
would
understand
what
we
be
do
and
why
it
would
work
and
whose
deep
knowledge
of
the

could
give
us
valuable
insight
into
how
to
position
our
service
reed
and
i
drove
out
to
his
company
hq
in
milpitas
acknowledge
the
importance
of
the
meeting
i
have
dress
up
a
little
trading
my
hike
short
for
clean
jean
and
my
ever
present
t

for
a

be
wear
what
be
for
him
a
fancy
outfit
dark
jean
and
a
white
button
down
by
now
i
wasn
t
nervous
reed
and
i
be
veteran
at
this
kind
of
thing
and
we
knew
that
we
have
something
that
be
worth
buying
but
when
the
receptionist
show
us
to
a
couple
of
chair
in
the
foyer
and
no
one
come
out
for
five
then
ten
then
fifteen
minute
i
think
both
of
us
start
to
sweat
a
little
he
s
really
ice
us
i
thought
then
the
door
open
and
a
tall
fit
look
guy
step
out
he
be
wear
a
blazer
and
slack
and
expensive
look
leather
slipper
hello
he
say
in
a
vaguely
european
accent
uh
oh
i
thought
be
he
french
when
you
pitch
a
business
idea
to
someone
you
never
expect
to
make
it
all
the
way
through
your
presentation
it
s
like
present
a
case
to
the
supreme
court
within
a
few
moment
of
make
your
first
point
the
question
will
invariably
start
if
they
don
t
you
re
probably
in
trouble
nine
time
out
of
ten
they
re
not
quiet
because
they
re
politely
listen
they
re
quiet
because
they
re
totally
uninterested
or
bad
they
re
think
your
argument
be
so
weak
and
pathetic
that
they
don
t
even
warrant
an
argument
so
we
be
prepared
for
interruption
for
question
for
probe
analysis
of
our
business
idea
what
we
weren
t
prepared
for
be
alexandre
who
halfway
through
our
pitch
dvd
by
mail
the
large
inventory
in
the
world
first
to
the
space
shook
his
head
knock
his
knuckle
on
the
glass
table
between
us
and
say
in
an
accent
that
i
still
couldn
t
place
this
be
sheet
transliteration
mine
shit
really
we
have
almost
million
on
the
line
a
team
of
excite
people
and
a
genuine
opportunity
to
be
the
next
amazon
i
look
at
reed
who
be
star
at
alexandre
with
an
expression
that
be
impossible
to
read
if
you
didn
t
know
him
i
knew
him
though
he
be
worried
alexandre
told
us
dvd
be
a
flash
in
the
pan
no
one
be
adopt
this
tech
long
term
he
say
the
big
jump
be
from
analog
to
digital
once
movie
be
in
a
digital
form
it
won
t
make
sense
to
move
the
bit
around
on
piece
of
plastic
that
s
terribly
inefficient
and
slow
it
s
just
a
matter
of
time
before
people
be
go
to
be
download
their
movie
or
stream
them
at
some
point
probably
soon
you
re
go
to
be
stuck
with
a
warehouse
full
of
useless
dvd
i
m
not
so
sure
about
that
i
say
i
think
it
could
be
a
while
before
that
happens
we
ve
get
at
least
five
year
alexandre
shook
his
head
sooner
he
say
why
should
i
invest
in
a
company
that
won
t
be
around
five
year
from
now
the
thing
be
he
be
right
about
nearly
all
of
it
dvd
be
a
middle
step
between
analog
vhs
tape
and
downloads
or
stream
he
knew
well
than
anyone
that
the
technology
to
make
dvd
themselves
obsolete
be
just
around
the
corner
it
be
his
field
after
all
and
a
cursory
glance
at
netflix
s
current
business
will
bear
out
his
theory
that
eventually
viewer
would
access
almost
all
of
their
movie
directly
through
the
internet
but
he
have
the
timeline
all
wrong
what
he
didn
t
understand
be
hollywood
we
knew
that
the
studio
be
bet
big
on
the
dvd
format
and
more
importantly
be
bet
on
dvd
ownership
they
didn
t
want
a
repeat
of
the
eighty
when
video
store
have
establish
themselves
as
middleman
to
consumer
rent
the
same

out
dozen
of
time
movie
studio
didn
t
want
to
have
to
jack
up
the
price
of
movie
just
to
earn
their
share
of
the
home
view
market
they
want
to
get
their
film
directly
into
consumer
home
and
dvd
a
new
technology
that
they
could
price
competitively
represent
an
opportunity
to
hit
the
reset
button
as
for
online
download
sixty
five
year
old
studio
exec
weren
t
exactly
the
most
tech
savvy
people
around
they
be
terrify
of
what
have
happen
to
the
music
industry
napster
have
inaugurate
the
age
of
illegal
file
share
and
although
dvd
have
be
developed
with
more
robust
piracy
prevention
mechanism
than
cd
movie
studio
be
still
wary
of
allow
customer
to
access
movie
as
easily
shareable
digital
file
alexandre
also
underestimated
the
last
mile
problem
in
most
of
the
country
download
a
movie
be
still
functionally
impossible
or
at
least
impractical
high
speed
internet
be
only
intermittently
available
and
frankly
it
wasn
t
that
fast
yet
plus
the
internet
terminate
at
the
computer
not
the
television
even
if
you
could
download
a
movie
in
less
than
a
few
day
there
be
no
way
of
get
it
from
your
computer
to
your
television
and
most
people
didn
t
want
to
plop
down
in
their
office
chair
and
cue
up
total
recall
on
their
compaq
presario
alexandre
s
whole
life
have
lead
up
to
the
moment
when
movie
and
television
would
be
able
to
be
stream
over
the
internet
c
cube
in
many
way
be
the
enabler
of
what
make
all
this
possible
but
like
most
pioneer
alexandre
be
too
early
in
the
meantime
we
have
a
business
model
that
work
in
a
dvd
world
we
could
afford
to
wait
every
piece
of
brand
equity
that
we
be
building
all
those
customer
relationship
all
of
our
movie
match
expertise
would
still
be
relevant
and
useful
when
the
world
shift
or
so
we
told
alexandre
but
he
bat
away
every
counterargument
with
a
dismissive
wave
of
his
well
manicure
hand
and
if
you
re
argue
with
a
potential
investor
it
s
already
over
we
left
that
office
deflate
surprised
and
a
little
nervous
on
the
trip
back
to
sunnyvale
i
drove
fast
as
i
usually
do
take
corner
at
speed
all
the
way
home
reed
didn
t
say
a
word
in
silicon
valley
no
one
ever
really
tell
you
no
after
a
pitch
you
ll
typically
hear
a
sentence
that
begin
with
this
be
great
but
you
get
so
use
to
it
that
if
you
hear
a
sentence
start
with
this
be
great
you
mentally
start
gathering
your
paper
and
feel
for
your
key
this
be
great
but
i
d
love
to
see
more
traction
before
commit
this
be
great
but
why
don
t
we
talk
again
when
you
have
ten
thousand
subscriber
this
be
great
but
that
s
not
an
investment
premise
we
re
focus
on
right
now
alexandre
didn
t
tell
us
this
be
great
he
told
us
this
be
shit
and
that
scar
the
hell
out
of
us
it
be
time
for
an
even
harder
ask
i
would
be
pitch
steve
kahn
while
normally
i
would
be
look
forward
to
pitch
someone
i
knew
so
well
in
this
case
it
be
complicate
and
awkward
because
reed
be
push
me
to
go
back
on
a
deal
steve
have
be
my
first
bos
at
borland
and
in
many
way
he
be
and
still
be
a
mentor
he
s
a
button
down
guy
who
be
constantly
have
to
do
damage
control
for
me
he
once
told
me
that
when
he
d
see
me
knock
on
his
office
door
he
typically
have
one
of
two
thought
who
d
he
piss
off
this
time
or
what
crazy
thing
do
he
dream
up
now
i
m
sure
he
be
ask
himself
one
of
these
question
on
the
day
i
walk
down
to
his
basement
office
at
pure
atrium
to
ask
him
to
lunch
even
before
we
have
definitively
decide
we
be
move
forward
with
the
idea
that
would
one
day
become
netflix
i
knew
i
want
steve
on
my
board
of
director
for
one
thing
all
board
need
at
least
a
third
person
to
break
tie
for
another
steve
be
a
voracious
video
technophile
he
d
take
his
spoil
from
our
sale
of
integrity
qa
and
use
it
to
ignite
a
home
video
theater
system
arm
race
with
bob
warfield
our
fellow
integrity
qa
co
founder
theirs
be
an
ongoing
take
no
prisoner
competition
surround
sound
stadium
seat
noise
cancel
wall
hanging
leather
recliner
state
of
the
art
projection
system
if
you
could
hook
it
up
to
a
home
theater
steve
and
bob
already
have
it
or
they
soon
would
there
be
about
a
forty
five
day
window
when
any
piece
of
video
technology
be
state
of
the
art
and
steve
and
bob
be
always
fight
to
be
the
proud
owner
of
that
window
but
the
most
important
reason
i
want
steve
on
the
board
he
be
a
friend
not
only
would
he
be
helpful
honest
and
thoughtful
it
would
be
great
to
have
one
person
who
truly
have
my
back
ask
him
to
join
the
board
have
be
easy
i
be
essentially
ask
for
a
favor
that
require
nothing
but
a
little
bit
of
his
time
in
return
when
i
take
him
out
to
lunch
an
all
you
can
eat
indian
buffet
locate
in
a
strip
mall
near
the
office
he
have
listen
patiently
as
i
laid
out
the
idea
for
him
my
tikka
masala
sit
untouched
in
front
of
me
it
hadn
t
take
long
for
him
to
say
sure
but
i
could
tell
by
the
way
he
say
it
that
it
really
hadn
t
make
a
difference
what
the
idea
be
now
reed
thought
i
need
to
ask
him
for
more
than
just
his
time
if
he
be
go
to
be
on
the
board
reed
explain
he
have
to
have
some
skin
in
the
game
but
ask
him
for
solely
for
the
privilege
of
be
on
our
board
be
go
to
be
hard
i
dread
it
i
put
it
off
for
day
it
felt
like
a
bait
and
switch
the
favor
i
d
ask
that
have
cost
him
nothing
now
have
a
price
tag
attach
we
go
to
the
same
indian
restaurant
i
thought
it
might
be
good
luck
i
be
nervous
steve
barely
have
a
chance
to
pick
his
menu
up
when
i
blurt
it
out
could
you
put
twenty
five
thousand
dollar
in
i
ll
never
forget
the
look
on
steve
s
face
he
exhale
purse
his
lip
and
laid
down
his
menu
and
a
generally
weary
expression
slowly
spread
over
his
face
even
in
that
moment
hover
over
a
basket
of
garlic
naan
slowly
rip
a
paper
napkin
to
shred
underneath
the
table
i
recognize
it
it
s
the
face
of
be
in
an
impossible
bind
the
face
of
there
s
no
right
answer
if
steve
say
no
that
he
wouldn
t
put
toward
the
business
he
would
look
cheap
like
he
didn
t
truly
believe
in
the
idea
even
though
he
probably
didn
t
but
if
he
say
yes
he
d
be
out
money
he
hadn
t
expect
to
spend
and
on
top
of
that
we
d
both
know
that
he
would
be
do
it
not
because
he
love
the
idea
or
thought
it
would
work
but
because
i
d
ask
him
to
because
he
have
see
in
my
face
and
heard
in
my
voice
the
same
thing
that
have
gotten
me
over
the
hump
on
the
street
of
hartford
that
i
be
truly
hungry
when
he
say
yes
both
of
us
knew
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
idea
steve
told
me
later
that
he
say
to
himself
well
that
s
i
ll
never
see
again
i
be
most
nervous
about
ask
my
mother
plenty
of
people
ask
their
parent
for
money
during
the
seed
stage
of
startup
in
fact
back
then
nobody
even
call
it
a
seed
round
people
call
it
the
friend
and
family
round
still
there
s
something
slightly
pathetic
about
be
almost
forty
year
old
married
with
three
kid
and
multiple
successful
company
to
your
name
and
call
your
parent
ask
for
cash
you
re
right
back
to
be
eight
year
old
tug
on
your
mommy
s
leg
ask
for
fifty
cent
for
a
candy
bar
at
the
grocery
store
still
i
do
it
i
ask
my
mother
because
ask
my
father
be
out
of
the
question
he
be
stern
and
unyielding
about
money
his
parent
have
lose
everything
in
the
depression
and
as
a
result
he
be
extremely
risk
averse
with
his
finance
he
kept
his
book
in
old
school
ledger
account
everything
from
income
to
investment
to
monthly
utility
bill
when
he
die
i
go
through
his
paper
and
every
gas
bill
from
to
be
enter
in
his
precise
engineer
s
hand
on
wall
street
he
d
see
people
lose
everything
the
way
he
thought
about
business
have
more
to
do
with
large
company
and
bank
thing
have
to
be
solid
profit
driven
real
than
it
do
with
venture
capital
and
startup
that
didn
t
make
money
for
a
couple
of
year
if
ever
if
i
d
pitch
him
on
the
initial
idea
for
netflix
he
would
have
gotten
out
his
magnify
glass
and
picked
the
idea
apart
my
mother
though
scrupulous
with
money
enjoy
a
splurge
now
and
then
plus
she
be
an
entrepreneur
herself
when
i
be
in
high
school
she
have
start
her
own
real
estate
firm
it
have
prosper
and
now
she
have
money
of
her
own
in
fact
she
d
put
both
me
and
my
sibling
through
college
with
it
she
be
on
the
east
coast
so
i
couldn
t
ask
her
in
person
i
dread
that
phone
conversation
sale
be
theater
every
pitch
every
call
every
interaction
in
which
you
the
businessperson
be
try
to
convince
someone
else
the
customer
the
client
the
potential
investor
you
name
it
be
a
little
performance
in
which
each
side
play
a
role
but
a
son
call
his
mother
to
ask
for
money
that
isn
t
just
theater
it
s
kabuki
theater
everything
be
ritual
and
prescribed
both
of
us
knew
that
she
would
eventually
say
yes
she
be
my
mother
the
money
wasn
t
completely
unreasonable
and
she
have
always
support
me
and
my
career
she
have
confidence
in
me
in
fact
one
of
the
reason
i
be
ask
be
that
i
knew
she
d
invest
what
s
more
i
knew
that
she
knew
that
i
knew
we
both
understood
that
her
thought
process
would
go
something
like
this
a
i
have
no
idea
what
he
s
talk
about
b
wait
a
minute
what
c
oh
for
cry
out
loud
d
i
guess
i
ll
do
it
i
m
his
mother
after
all
in
other
word
i
knew
that
i
would
play
the
somewhat
indulge
son
she
d
play
the
skeptical
but
generous
mother
both
of
us
would
be
act
out
age
old
role
cement
by
decade
of
family
dynamic
and
that
be
alright
for
both
of
us
how
s
that
for
make
uncle
siggy
proud
i
don
t
remember
much
about
that
awful
phone
call
i
wasn
t
as
practice
in
the
art
of
the
ask
then
as
i
be
now
i
m
sure
i
let
slip
some
truly
heinous
salesmanship
clich
s
i
m
call
today
to
give
you
the
opportunity
to
invest
in
my
company
etc
if
i
d
be
at
home
back
in
chappaqua
i
probably
would
have
retire
with
her
to
the
library
to
discus
the
investment
over
brandy
even
now
i
cringe
think
of
that
phone
call
i
m
sure
my
mom
ask
polite
curious
question
i
m
sure
i
give
polite
enthusiastic
answer
the
only
thing
i
really
remember
and
i
thought
this
be
the
epitome
of
grace
when
she
say
it
be
that
she
knew
that
her
investment
would
bear
fruit
in
the
long
term
i
m
sure
in
fifteen
year
i
can
use
this
money
to
buy
an
apartment
in
the
city
she
say
laugh
she
want
to
prove
to
me
that
the
money
she
be
invest
wasn
t
just
a
gift
that
it
be
a
real
investment
even
though
she
knew
and
i
knew
that
the
reason
she
be
invest
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
pro
and
con
and
my
projection
and
everything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
she
be
my
mother
and
i
be
her
son
i
almost
wish
she
have
say
no
because
now
i
have
to
actually
do
it

how
it
feel
to
deposit
a
check
for
almost
million
fall
winter
half
a
year
until
launch
after
week
of
hound
him
for
whatever
reason
reed
seem
reluctant
to
actually
sign
and
date
the
check
your
first
investor
finally
hand
you
the
check
that
will
let
you
rent
an
office
hire
employee
and
buy
a
few
fold
table
it
s
more
than
that
of
course
the
check
represent
the
ability
to
start
it
s
the
difference
between
an
idea
in
your
head
and
a
company
in
the
world
it
s
the
difference
between
nothing
and
something
it
s
everything
it
s
also
quite
a
bit
of
money
you
scrutinize
the
check
look
again
and
again
at
the
dollar
amount
you
make
sure
there
be
enough
comma
that
the
date
be
correct
that
the
signature
resembles
the
one
you
know
a
part
of
you
want
to
drive
all
the
way
down
to
santa
cruz
to
the
bank
with
the
recess

gleam
tile
the
golden
safe
door
half
open
behind
the
counter
gleam
from
the
darkness
like
a
yacht
s
steer
wheel
to
change
your
shirt
into
something
with
a
collar
maybe
wear
a

to
dress
up
for
the
occasion
one
point
nine
million
dollar
be
a
lot
of
money
you
feel
nervous
handle
it
like
you
ve
robbed
it
off
someone
else
well
to
go
to
the
closest
bank
you
can
find
who
care
if
it
s
in
a
strip
mall
in
los
gatos
you
need
to
get
this
thing
out
of
your
hand
fast
you
begin
to
feel
like
a
fugitive
in
line
at
the
bank
you
touch
the
check
with
your
sweaty
hand
again
and
again
until
it
s
damp
in
your
pocket
to
anyone
else
it
might
look
like
you
re
get
away
with
something
you
ve
handle
money
before
of
course
and
you
ve
work
for
company
that
threw
around

considerably
large
than

you
ve
never
held
it
in

the

move
slowly
but
eventually
you
reach
the
teller
you
think
this
will
make
her
day
you
think
i
bet
she
ll
be
impressed
i
bet
she
ll
discreetly
signal
to
the
manager
and
he
ll
usher
me
into
a
back
office
where
there
will
be
antique
furniture
and
a
persian
carpet
he
ll
pour
me
some
champagne
and
make
polite
conversation
while
an
underling

all
the
detail
one
million
nine
hundred
thousand
and
dollar
you
hand
it
over
and
there
s
nothing
no
glimmer
of
recognition
no
hint
of
surprise
on
the
teller
s
face
business
as
usual
you
want
any
cash
back
she
asks
with
reed
s
money
in
the
bank
and
with
the
pure
atrium
merger
a
do
deal
we
could
finally
move
out
of
the
best
western
but
we
didn
t
have
to
move
far
i
found
a
place
just
across
the
street
in
a
nondescript
office
park
in
scott
valley
the
lease
seem
exorbitantly
expensive
to
me
it
be
also
multiyear
which
introduce
a
note
of
optimism
into
the
proceeding
that
i
hop
wasn
t
entirely
foolish
it
be
a
far
cry
from
the
glitter
corporate
campus
i
d
know
at
borland
or
the
gleam
blond
wood
and
succulent
open
plan
monstrosity
currently
in
vogue
which
all
seem
to
include
fireman
pole
and
beanbag
chair
our
office
park
be
completely
anonymous
it
look
like
the
kind
of
place
where
a
dentist
might
have
his
office
or
a
tax
attorney
in
fact
there
be
a
few
psychiatrist
there
and
an
optometrist
mostly
though
the
office
park
have
be
take
over
by
small
startup
which
enter
and
exit
lease
in
a
revolve
door
of
boom
and
bust
there
be
a
flower
bed
out
front
next
to
the
flagpole
and
in
it
be
plant
perpetually
fresh
flower
and
plant
nothing
really
grow
there
or
be
tend
to
exactly
instead
adult
in
bloom
flower
be
plant
into
the
soil
and
when
they
die
they
be
dug
up
and
replace
with
a
new
round
of
in
bloom
tulip
or
pansy
or
daffodil
cost
be
no
object
as
long
as
the
flower
be
in
bloom
passing
a
gardener
with
a
wagon
of
fully
bloom
tulip
to
be
hastily
insert
into
the
earth
it
be
hard
not
to
see
the
garden
as
a
particularly
perverse
metaphor
for
the
life
cycle
of
a
startup
plant
bloom
die
and
be
replace
our
office
be
a
big
open
room
with
a
hideous
green
carpet
it
have
once
house
a
small
bank
and
in
fact
the
walk
in
safe
be
still
accessible
its
door
left
unlocked
there
be
a
few
office
on
a
long
wall
a
conference
room
and
an
office
in
the
corner
with
view
of
the
parking
lot
and
the
wendy
s
across
the
street
as
the
ceo
i
claimed
it
and
then
have
nothing
to
put
in
it
this
be
not
a
luxurious
space
we
spent
less
than
a
thousand
dollar
furnish
it
there
be
no
aeron
chair
no
ping
pong
table
no
refrigerator
full
of
lacroix
there
be
six
or
seven
fold
table
the
cheap
one
that
caterer
use
there
be
a
mismatch
set
of
din
room
chair
i
d
scavenge
from
my
storage
unit
if
you
want
more
than
that
you
have
to
bring
it
from
home
i
distinctly
remember
several
employee
drag
beach
chair
into
the
space
the
seat
and
leg
still
cover
in
sand
the
first
time
lorraine
come
to
the
office
she
point
at
our
conference
table
and
ask
be
those
our
old
din
room
chair
instead
of
furniture
we
spent
money
on
technology
we
bought
dozen
of
dell
online
and
have
them
ship
to
the
office
we
bought
our
own
server
in
there
be
no
share
cloud
and
instal
them
in
the
corner
we
bought
mile
of
cable
and
wire
the
office
after
hour
ourselves
extension
cord
and
ethernet
cable
twist
through
the
office
like
orange
and
black
snake
wire
hung
down
from
the
ceiling
like
vine
i
don
t
remember
our
move
in
day
we
might
have
order
some
pizza
and
make
a
few
costco
run
but
more
likely
people
just
trickle
in
bring
with
them
whatever
they
need
to
do
their
work
if
you
stood
in
the
first
netflix
office
sometime
in
the
fall
of
you
would
have
see
a
room
that
resemble
some
unholy
cross
between
a
computer
geek
s
basement
and
a
politician
s
on
the
road
campaign
war
center
and
that
s
just
the
way
we
like
it
our
office
sent
a
clear
message
this
isn
t
about
us
it
s
about
the
customer
the
reason
for
work
there
weren
t
exotic
perk
or
free
food
it
be
the
camaraderie
and
the
challenge
the
opportunity
to
spend
your
time
solve
hard
interest
problem
with
smart
people
you
didn
t
work
for
us
because
you
want
a
beautiful
office
you
work
for
us
because
you
want
the
chance
to
do
something
meaningful
at
the
same
time
that
we
be
move
into
our
office
in
scott
valley
i
be
contemplate
and
ultimately
prepare
for
a
move
of
my
own
for
the
first
few
month
of
the
netflix
experiment
i
be
living
a
five
minute
walk
away
in
a
tiny
rental
house
lorraine
and
i
have
move
there
in
after
year
of
living
up
in
the
mountain
tire
of
the
thirty
minute
drive
into
santa
cruz
and
my
hour
and
a
half
trek
over
the
hill
to
work
each
day
we
d
sell
our
house
in
the
mountain
and
move
into
a
small
rental
in
scott
valley
put
away
money
for
the
future
i
enjoy
walk
to
and
from
work
be
so
close
to
home
make
it
easy
for
me
to
leave
at
dinnertime
rush
home
to
be
with
my
family
for
a
few
hour
and
then
return
to
the
office
to
finish
up
the
day
s
work
but
it
wasn
t
a
sustainable
solution
for
the
future
i
want
a
yard
that
be
large
than
a
postage
stamp
and
lorraine
want
a
big
house
to
raise
our
kid
in
there
be
three
of
them
and
in
our
tiny
rental
it
always
seem
like
they
be
run
into
each
other
they
didn
t
have
much
space
to
play
outside
either
and
we
be
so
close
to
the
highway
that
the
noise
of
car
kept
us
up
at
night
but
our
attempt
to
find
a
new
home
hadn
t
be
go
anywhere
there
be
no
place
in
our
price
range
anywhere
close
to
santa
cruz
and
when
we
look
over
the
hill
toward
san
jose
what
we
saw
be
even
less
encourage
realtor
hearing
what
we
have
to
spend
show
us
place
that
be
almost
comical
in
their
inadequacy
one
place
have
grass
grow
on
the
roof
and
it
wasn
t
on
purpose
another
come
with
a
flock
of
goat
then
in
october
a
three
story
house
on
fifty
acre
in
the
hill
outside
scott
valley
come
on
the
market
it
have
once
be
a
vineyard
and
in
the
early
twentieth
century
it
have
be
a
country
resort
the
owner
be
octogenarian
who
couldn
t
maintain
the
property
anymore
the
first
time
we
take
a
tour
drag
the
kid
along
with
us
we
fell
in
love
it
be
perfect
for
us
a
big
house
on
a
lot
of
land
it
be
also
just
shy
of
a
million
dollar
that
night
somewhat
panicked
i
call
my
mother
for
advice
she
be
a
real
estate
agent
and
knew
my
family
almost
as
well
as
i
do
we
really
want
this
house
i
say
but
it
s
a
lot
of
money
more
than
i
ve
ever
spent
and
i
m
just
start
this
new
company
do
i
really
need
the
add
risk
what
should
we
offer
if
you
want
it
don
t
try
for
a
bargain
and
risk
lose
it
she
told
me
the
anxiety
of
pay
that
much
won
t
last
but
the
enjoyment
of
living
there
will
last
forever
go
all
in
so
we
do
do
i
have
buyer
s
remorse
of
course
i
do
even
the
night
after
the
paper
be
finalize
when
lorraine
and
i
be
sit
on
the
deck
with
a
few
of
our
friend
drinking
a
bottle
of
wine
and
watch
our
kid
chase
each
other
in
the
lengthen
shadow
cast
by
the
redwood
that
tower
over
our
new
lawn
even
then
when
we
be
ostensibly
celebrate
our
great
fortune
i
be
think
be
this
the
big
mistake
of
my
life
what
if
the
company
fail
what
if
i
lose
my
job
what
if

by
mail
never
take
off
remember
our
post
college
day
lorraine
say
that
first
night
after
our
guest
have
driven
away
our
splurge
when
lorraine
and
i
be
first
married
we
be
about
ten
thousand
dollar
in
debt
at
the
time
i
be
work
my
first
job
in
direct
mail
marketing
and
make
about
thirty
thousand
dollar
a
year
lorraine
s
income
be
about
the
same
she
be
make
cold
call
as
an
entry
level
stockbroker
we
set
a
goal
to
get
out
of
debt
in
a
year
and
for
the
next
twelve
month
we
kept
a
meticulous
notebook
counting
every
single
expenditure
no
matter
how
minor
toothpaste
donut
at
the
train
station
cent
once
a
week
we
allow
ourselves
two
big
splurge
a
square
pizza
from
the
athens
pizza
joint
down
the
street
and
a
case
of
bar
bottle
schlitz
when
we
d
drunk
the
beer
we
take
the
bottle
back
for
the
rebate
we
do
it
once
we
can
do
it
again
i
agree
by
nature
i
m
not
a
cheap
man
in
fact
much
of
my
behavior
in
business
be
a
kind
of
rejection
of
my
own
father
s
meticulous
carefulness
when
it
come
to
money
the
expenditure
notebook
be
an
aberration
a
reaction
to
a
particular
problem
normally
when
there
s
money
i
spend
it
not
wastefully
or
stupidly
but
in
the
boom
bust
cycle
of
silicon
valley
economics
i
ve
always
believe
that
you
should
spend
the
money
you
re
give
spend
it
wisely
but
spend
it
although
i
have
quite
a
bit
of
startup
success
early
on
i
be
never
a
big
equity
holder
so
although
i
do
okay
there
weren
t
huge
reward
my
first
actual
windfall
come
when
i
join
borland
just
a
few
month
after
my
thirtieth
birthday
my
timing
be
good
the
product
take
off
and
so
do
our
stock
i
be
wealthy
but
only
on
paper
since
all
i
really
own
be
stock
option
one
night
at
a
bar
in
hong
kong
i
be
belly
up
next
to
doug
antone
borland
s
senior
vp
of
sale
we
be
talk
about
how
well
the
stock
have
do
and
when
i
share
that
i
hadn
t
realize
any
of
that
he
almost
spit
out
his
drink
what
be
you
wait
for
he
ask
as
soon
as
any
of
my
stock
vest
i
sell
it
there
be
plenty
more
upside
if
the
stock
keep
go
up
but
if
it
go
down
you
ll
be
glad
you
take
something
off
the
table
from
that
day
on
not
only
do
i
adopt
that
philosophy
but
i
become
one
of
its
big
advocate
i
always
told
my
employee
to
sell
when
they
could
one
of
my
favorite
expression
actually
come
from
lorraine
s
old
bos
from
her
entry
level
stockbroker
day
bull
make
money
bear
make
money
pig
get
slaughter
that
bos
be
later
indict
for
insider
trading
he
might
have
do
well
to
have
actually
follow
his
own
advice
despite
my
profess
ambivalence
toward
money
anytime
i
pause
that
first
fall
at
netflix
anxiety
about
my
finance
set
in
the
only
cure
it
seem
be
work
i
didn
t
worry
about
netflix
s
future
when
i
be
deeply
engage
in
ensure
it
and
i
didn
t
despair
about
our
new
house
when
i
be
work
on
it
i
spent
every
saturday
and
sunday
for
month
fix
the
place
up
before
we
move
in
rip
out
vine
clearing
out
brush
with
a
tractor
remove
dead
tree
that
the
previous
owner
have
left
where
they
have
fall
ten
twenty
even
thirty
year
prior
i
have
a
vision
of
bountiful
grape
and
fruit
tree
after
an
east
coast
childhood
of
can
fruit
salad
and
pear
in
heavy
syrup
i
want
nothing
more
than
to
walk
out
in
my
backyard
pluck
a
piece
of
fruit
right
from
the
tree
and
eat
it
stand
on
land
that
i
own
but
to
do
that
i
need
to
do
some
plant
i
need
to
clear
a
space
plant
a
sapling
and
week
by
week
month
by
month
nurture
the
tender
thing
that
grow
there
under
my
care
my
daily
routine
in
the
fall
and
winter
of
in
the
month
before
we
move
be
everything
i
d
ever
hop
it
would
be
i
d
wake
up
and
help
lorraine
get
the
kid
ready
for
school
and
then
i
d
hop
in
my
car
for
the
three
minute
drive
to
the
office
if
the
weather
be
nice
and
i
wasn
t
in
a
hurry
i
d
walk
there
all
day
i
d
find
myself
work
on
an
idea
i
d
come
up
with
in
the
pleasant
company
of
a
team
of
people
i
d
handpicked
for
their
obvious
talent
we
be
deep
in
the
planning
trench
for
someone
with
adhd
and
i
ve
long
suspect
a
mild
case
of
ocd
there
be
few
more
pleasant
place
to
be
every
day
at
work
i
have
my
pick
of
hundred
no
thousand
of
problem
to
work
on
and
since
i
be
in
charge
of
and
surround
by
brilliant
people
i
could
focus
on
what
interested
me
that
s
one
of
the
great
pleasure
of
be
at
the
helm
of
a
startup
in
the
planning
stage
the
company
be
small
enough
that
everyone
in
it
have
to
wear
multiple
hat
but
big
enough
that
you
never
have
to
wear
one
that
doesn
t
fit
properly
here
be
just
a
few
of
the
issue
that
face
us
that
fall
set
up
an
office
you
never
have
to
think
about
it
when
you
re
work
at
a
large
public
company
like
borland
or
pure
atrium
or
even
when
you
re
an
employee
at
an
establish
startup
but
i
be
learn
that
when
you
re
in
charge
it
ultimately
fall
on
you
to
ensure
that
the
most
basic
element
of
office
life
telephone
printer
staple
for
the
stapler
be
there
for
your
worker
we
need
to
buy
phone
we
need
to
buy
computer
we
need
to
wire
the
office
so
that
all
of
our
gadget
actually
work
and
even
if
we
spent
roughly
five
minute
total
think
about
d
cor
somebody
still
have
to
buy
the
fold
card
table
and
set
them
up
in
something
approximate
a
straight
line
not
only
that
i
have
to
make
decision
about
thing
i
d
never
consider
do
we
want
the
office
clean
weekly
or
biweekly
how
do
you
organize
key
which
bank
should
we
use
should
i
hire
an
outside
firm
for
hr
in
a
way
all
of
these
decision
be
a
kind
of
microcosm
of
the
problem
face
us
as
innovator
in
the
late
ninety
when
you
re
building
a
business
from
the
ground
up
you
start
from
scratch
from
zilch
from
nada
and
you
have
to
figure
out
how
to
make
it
work
the
same
be
true
for
a
tech
startup
in
especially
one
that
focus
on
use
the
emergent
power
of
the
internet
to
sell
a
brand
new
piece
of
technology
dvd
be
barely
in
the
world
high
speed
internet
be
in
its
infancy
and
there
be
no
premade
template
for
online
site
if
you
want
to
do
something
you
have
to
build
it
yourself
from
scratch
building
a
team
now
that
we
be
an
actual
company
we
need
to
fill
out
our
roster
a
bit
we
have
a
core
of
seven
people
christina
te
eric
boris
vita
jim
and
i
but
there
be
a
lot
of
hole
we
need
someone
who
could
connect
us
with
dvd
user
we
need
someone
who
could
connect
us
with
studio
and
distributor
and
we
need
back
end
cod
and
tech
talent
the
shortest
resource
in
silicon
valley
we
would
always
need
that
by
late
fall
i
d
somehow
convince
mitch
lowe
to
join
our
ragtag
bunch
he
say
jokingly
now
that
the
reason
he
finally
decide
to
drive
an
hour
and
a
half
each
way
to
work
for
us
be
so
that
he
could
finish
more
of
the
presidential
biography
he
be
work
his
way
through
on
tape
he
be
go
chronologically
start
with
washington
and
after
several
year
he
be
only
up
to
john
tyler
he
s
really
into
presidential
history
but
i
think
the
real
reason
mitch
join
us
be
because
he
d
gotten
a
little
bore
with
his
store
and
be
start
to
realize
that
his
movie
kiosk
experiment
be
still
a
few
too
many
year
ahead
of
their
time
the
software
company
he
have
be
pitch
when
i
met
him
at
vsda
nervous
system
inc
be
still
a
few
year
away
from
viability
as
well
with
mitch
we
have
an
invaluable
resource
someone
who
understood
the
rental
business
perfectly
have
a
deep
rolodex
of
studio
exec
and
distributor
and
knew
how
to
reach
customer
with
the
movie
they
d
want
he
brought
a
wealth
of
experience
and
knowledge
i
knew
as
soon
as
i
convince
him
that
he
d
be
one
of
the
most
important
hire
i
ever
make
his
wife
though
still
thought
it
would
never
work
to
help
us
connect
far
with
customer
te
brought
in
corey
bridge
to
work
on
customer
acquisition
or
more
specifically
on
something
we
jokingly
call
black
ops
a
onetime
english
major
at
berkeley
he
be
a
brilliant
writer
with
a
gift
for
create
character
he
d
realize
early
on
that
the
only
way
to
find
dvd
owner
be
in
the
fringe
community
of
the
internet
user
group
bulletin
board
web
forum
and
all
the
other
digital
water
hole
where
enthusiast
met
up
corey
s
plan
be
to
infiltrate
these
community
he
wouldn
t
announce
himself
as
a
netflix
employee
pose
as
a
home
theater
enthusiast
or
cinephile
he
would
join
the
conversation
in
community
gear
to
dvd
fanatic
and
movie
buff
befriend
the
major
player
and
slowly
over
time
alert
the
most
respect
commenters
moderator
and
website
owner
about
this
great
new
site
call
netflix
we
be
month
from
launch
but
he
be
plant
seed
that
would
pay
off
big
time
as
for
tech
talent
through
eric
s
contact
we
hire
a
talented
engineer
from
pure
atrium
name
suresh
kumar
as
well
as
a
brilliant
but
eccentric
german
name
kho
braun
eric
boris
and
vita
all
say
kho
be
a
genius
he
usually
roll
into
the
office
around
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
and
stayed
till
the
wee
hour
of
the
morning
sometimes
if
i
get
to
work
especially
early
i
d
see
him
at
his
desk
at
six
in
the
morning
surround
by
dry
out
tea
bag
and
half
eat
muesli
bar
he
be
the
one
to
wire
the
office
complete
the
whole
task
himself
overnight
he
be
industrious
creative
and
mostly
silent
for
the
entire
time
we
work
together
i
m
not
sure
i
heard
him
say
more
than
twenty
word
building
the
basic
i
firmly
believe
that
a
healthy
startup
culture
arises
from
the
value
and
choice
make
by
the
startup
s
founder
culture
be
a
reflection
of
who
you
be
and
what
you
do
it
doesn
t
come
from
carefully
word
mission
statement
and
committee
meeting
you
can
talk
until
you
re
blue
in
the
face
about
how
your
employee
be
your
great
asset
or
about
how
you
want
to
ensure
that
your
office
be
a
great
place
to
work
but
eventually
you
have
to
start
take
the
small
step
to
put
your
word
into
practice
so
once
the
check
have
be
deposit
i
have
to
make
some
decision
how
much
would
we
pay
people
would
employee
get
benefit
how
about
dental
answer
not
all
that
much
absolutely
nope
everybody
in
the
early
day
take
a
pay
cut
to
work
for
us
that
wasn
t
because
we
be
cheap
it
be
because
we
didn
t
know
exactly
how
long
we
need
to
make
our
money
last
and
because
we
d
need
a
lot
of
it
to
build
up
our
stock
of
number
four
on
this
list
in
those
day
i
kept
a
jar
of
silver
dollar
on
my
desk
which
i
get
in
roll
of
forty
from
the
bank
and
at
every
weekly
meeting
i
d
hand
one
out
as
a
bonus
to
the
employee
who
d
make
that
week
s
large
contribution
to
the
company
s
success
don
t
spend
it
all
in
one
place
i
d
say
still
if
i
be
go
to
ask
everyone
to
sacrifice
on
behalf
of
our
future
success
i
want
them
to
participate
once
that
success
hopefully
arrive
while
our
salary
at
that
point
be
well
below
what
might
be
available
elsewhere
each
of
those
early
employee
receive
a
large
stake
in
the
business
in
the
form
of
stock
option
they
wouldn
t
be
make
a
lot
up
front
but
we
be
bet
on
ourselves
that
the
eventual
payoff
would
be
huge
building
an
inventory
our
goal
be
to
have
the
most
complete
collection
of
dvd
in
the
world
it
make
good
marketing
copy
and
it
would
separate
us
from
our
brick
and
mortar
competitor
who
be
still
living
in
a
world
where
only
a
handful
of
their
customer
own
a
dvd
player
it
barely
make
sense
for
them
to
carry
dvd
at
all
never
mind
one
copy
of
every
dvd
ever
release
not
only
be
that
our
goal
but
we
plan
on
have
multiple
copy
of
popular
title
that
way
when
renter
want
to
watch
something
we
would
never
leave
them
hang
but
how
do
we
decide
how
many
dvd
of
say
the
mighty
duck
to
order
eventually
of
course
we
developed
complex
algorithm
to
accurately
match
supply
with
anticipate
demand
but
back
then
we
be
just
guess
or
more
accurately
mitch
lowe
be
guess
use
his
decade
of
consumer
knowledge
to
come
up
with
an
ideal
lending
library
as
it
would
turn
out
he
be
rarely
wrong
he
knew
a
blockbuster
when
he
saw
one
and
he
could
smell
a
turkey
like
it
be
in
the
oven
in
the
next
room
he
could
also
help
connect
us
with
distributor
in
dvd
distributor
be
a
motley
bunch
spread
across
dozen
of
state
they
be
small
niche
company
and
sometimes
it
take
day
to
get
somebody
on
the
phone
it
could
take
week
to
get
a
shipment
and
half
the
time
it
wouldn
t
have
everything
you
order
in
it
in
our
quest
to
build
a
library
of
every
dvd
in
existence
we
often
spent
week
look
for
a
single
copy
of
a
single
hard
to
find
title
even
though
there
be
only
a
few
hundred
movie
available
on
the
format
it
take
us
month
to
build
a
sizable
library
and
then
what
we
have
to
find
somewhere
to
put
it
this
be
jim
cook
s
territory
remember
that
bank
vault
he
convert
it
into
a
storage
facility
and
for
month
experiment
with
different
way
to
store
locate
and
ship
what
we
hop
would
eventually
be
thousand
of
disc
a
day
shelve
bin
organize
alphabetically
jim
s
task
those
early
month
be
daunt
when
i
walk
back
to
the
vault
in
the
early
month
it
look
like
a
cinephile
hoarder
s
basement
but
eventually
it
begin
to
resemble
nothing
more
than
a
video
store
title
organize
alphabetically
and
by
genre
with
hot
new
release
segregate
into
their
own
section
building
a
mailer
one
of
the
big
problem
we
have
to
solve
before
launch
be
the
mailer
my
initial
test
with
reed
have
be
a
simple
greet
card
envelope
but
we
couldn
t
send
thousand
of
dvd
across
the
country
as
naked
disc
inside
flimsy
envelope
we
need
a
real
mailer
one
that
would
protect
the
disc
on
an
unpredictable
journey
through
the
interstate
postal
system
it
also
have
to
be
sturdy
enough
that
it
could
be
use
again
when
the
customer
sent
the
disc
back
we
have
to
make
it
easy
to
use
intuitive
to
figure
out
and
it
have
to
be
small
and
light
enough
to
qualify
as
first
class
mail
the
moment
our
mailer
veer
into
fourth
class
mail
territory
our
cost
go
up
and
delivery
speed
go
down
and
neither
of
those
outcome
would
be
sustainable
we
experiment
wildly
cardboard
cardstock
craft
paper
tyvek
plastic
we
try
square
and
rectangle
of
all
size
we
insert
tab
we
try
foam
pad
thousand
of
design
end
up
on
the
cut
room
floor
after
christina
jim
or
i
deem
them
unworkable
there
be
day
i
go
into
the
office
and
couldn
t
tell
if
the
table
near
the
back
be
fill
with
netflix
mailer
material
or
the
detritus
from
one
of
my
son
s
preschool
cut
and
paste
project
get
the
mailer
perfect
be
key
it
be
the
first
physical
point
of
contact
we
d
have
with
our
user
if
our
disc
arrive
broken
or
late
or
ding
or
scratch
or
if
a
user
couldn
t
figure
out
how
to
mail
disc
back
to
us
use
our
packaging
then
we
be
doom
it
be
a
massively
important
project
and
one
that
i
be
heavily
involve
with
in
the
early
day
i
stayed
late
tinker
with
prototype
sketch
out
idea
on
napkin
during
meal
sometimes
at
night
i
dream
about
mailer
building
a
website
this
one
be
probably
the
hardest
to
imagine
the
advent
of
the
cloud
and
the
proliferation
of
website
building
tool
squarespace
and
the
like
have
make
it
easy
for
anyone
with
a
macbook
and
an
internet
connection
to
buy
a
domain
upload
some
photo
and
text
and
throw
a
website
together
but
in
at
the
dawn
of
the
e
commerce
age
the
idea
of
a
website
be
still
only
a
few
year
old
and
if
you
want
to
use
the
internet
to
sell
something
then
you
have
to
build
it
all
yourself
you
have
to
buy
not
only
server
space
but
the
server
themselves
you
have
to
do
more
than
buy
a
template
for
an
online
store
you
have
to
write
the
code
for
one
that
meant
thousand
of
hour
of
design
cod
test
and
fine
tune
what
do
we
want
the
website
to
look
like
how
do
we
want
a
user
to
navigate
it
how
would
it
look
when
you
search
for
a
film
how
would
film
be
organize
on
the
site
what
kind
of
content
do
we
need
displayed
for
each
film
once
a
customer
have
chosen
a
movie
what
would
they
see
how
would
they
input
their
information
what
would
happen
if
they
make
a
mistake
when
enter
their
state
s
abbreviation
or
their
credit
card
information
it
be
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
question
be
nearly
infinite
and
to
answer
them
we
have
to
coordinate
two
vastly
different
camp
the
designer
mostly
me
and
christina
and
the
engineer
who
actually
have
to
build
the
thing
engineer
be
by
necessity
literal
mind
they
will
do
exactly
what
you
instruct
them
to
do
so
christina
very
quickly
learn
that
she
could
leave
nothing
to
chance
she
begin
draw
the
site
by
hand
painstakingly
replicate
exactly
what
we
want
for
each
and
every
page
along
with
dozen
of
note
in
the
margin
about
how
each
piece
would
interact
with
the
next
then
she
d
hand
it
over
to
eric
and
his
team
would
build
it
we
d
look
at
what
they
d
built
and
make
far
suggestion
which
they
d
incorporate
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
we
do
this
for
month
get
the
picture
we
have
a
lot
to
do
but
there
be
real
pleasure
in
it
in
the
planning
in
the
problem
in
the
puzzle
we
have
to
solve
i
have
so
many
task
set
in
front
of
me
so
many
little
piece
i
have
to
prep
and
build
that
there
wasn
t
much
time
for
anxiety
about
the
future
it
all
disappear
when
i
be
in
those
office
i
forgot
about
the
half
finish
bedroom
in
the
new
house
i
could
barely
afford
i
forgot
about
logan
s
private
school
tuition
bill
i
forgot
about
alexandre
balkanski
frown
and
tell
me
this
be
sheet
i
felt
like
my
father
work
on
one
of
his
train
i
found
satisfaction
in
line
up
all
the
task
investigate
all
the
problem
and
then
work
to
solve
them
i
be
in
the
basement
building
something
know
that
someday
in
the
near
future
i
d
have
to
invite
everyone
else
in
to
have
a
look

we
be
almost
cinemacenter
six
month
until
launch
one
of
the
thing
i
m
ask
about
most
often
be
the
netflix
culture
how
do
we
establish
it
what
kind
of
presentation
do
we
make
to
new
employee
how
do
we
figure
out
the
way
we
want
to
work
together
interact
with
one
another
speak
to
each
other
now
of
course
netflix
s
culture
be
famous
there
s
a
much
download
powerpoint
presentation
give
to
all
new
employee
but
the
truth
be
it
wasn
t
the
product
of
meeting
or
careful
planning
or
roundtable
discussion
it
arose
organically
through
a
share
set
of
value
among
a
team
of
people
who
have
be
through
their
fair
share
of
office
startup
major
corporation
and
everywhere
in
between
netflix
for
all
of
us
be
an
opportunity
to
work
at
the
kind
of
place
we
d
always
dream
about
it
be
a
chance
to
do
thing
truly
our
way
culture
isn
t
what
you
say
it
s
what
you
do
i
d
recruit
almost
everybody
in
that
office
i
knew
how
they
work
i
knew
that
christina
love
to
impose
order
on
chaos
and
that
she
d
thrive
if
give
a
lot
of
chaos
to
handle
i
knew
that
te
s
creativity
would
flourish
if
she
be
give
free
rein
to
try
out
her
most
out
there
idea
i
knew
that
jim
cook
would
solve
almost
any
problem
put
in
front
of
him
but
you
have
to
give
him
room
to
work
i
knew
that
i
and
everyone
else
on
that
initial
team
would
thrive
if
give
a
lot
of
work
to
do
and
a
lot
of
space
to
do
it
that
be
really
all
our
culture
amount
to
handpick
a
dozen
brilliant
creative
people
give
them
a
set
of
delicious
problem
to
solve
then
give
them
space
to
solve
them
netflix
would
eventually
codify
this
as
freedom
and
responsibility
but
that
be
year
later
at
the
time
it
be
just
how
we
do
thing
we
didn
t
have
set
hour
for
work
you
could
come
in
when
you
want
leave
when
you
want
you
be
be
judged
by
what
you
could
accomplish
as
long
as
you
be
solve
problem
and
get
thing
do
i
didn
t
care
where
you
be
how
hard
you
work
or
how
long
you
stayed
my
philosophy
be
inform
by
year
of
wilderness
expedition
with
nols
i
ve
be
take
backpacking
trip
in
the
mountain
since
i
be
fourteen
it
keep
me
sane
i
love
the
smell
of
the
mountain
air
the
stillness
of
the
outdoors
the
sense
of
peace
that
come
from
reduce
life
to
its
barest
essential
but
more
than
anything
what
i
love
about
backpacking
trip
be
the
people
i
take
with
me
when
you
re
out
in
the
wood
you
re
separate
from
the
rest
of
human
society
and
as
a
result
you
have
the
opportunity
to
form
a
new
culture
with
its
own
rule
and
law
and
tradition
you
really
get
to
know
people
when
you
re
sleep
on
the
ground
eat
simple
food
you
prepare
yourself
and
smell
like
you
haven
t
shower
in
a
week
since
usually
you
haven
t
some
of
my
great
friendship
have
be
forge
in
the
wilderness
and
the
bond
with
my
family
have
be
strengthen
immeasurably
by
our
time
together
on
a
river
climb
a
peak
or
surf
a
remote
reef
break
what
happens
on
a
backpacking
trip
also
turn
out
to
be
a
perfect
model
for
what
happens
in
a
startup
startup
be
small
they
re
often
lean
and
they
ve
separate
themselves
from
the
dominant
mode
of
think
within
their
space
they
re
make
up
of
like
mind
people
who
be
on
a
journey
who
share
a
common
goal
and
they
often
end
up
totally
lose
in
the
wood
what
i
learn
in
those
early
month
at
pre
launch
netflix
be
that
work
at
a
startup
be
like
go
on
a
backcountry
trip
where
there
be
no
trail
say
you
be
on
such
a
trip
and
knew
that
your
next
campsite
be
eight
mile
ahead
on
the
other
side
of
a
steep
ridge
say
you
have
a
specialized
team
a
couple
of
people
carry
pack
raft
a
couple
more
people
with
all
the
food
and
equipment
as
well
as
some
incredibly
quick
trail
runner
with
light
pack
who
could
act
as
scout
one
possible
route
go
straight
up
and
over
the
ridge
to
the
campsite
one
be
less
arduous
but
longer
and
involves
several
water
crossing
and
one
be
a
measure
stately
hike
up
a
series
of
gradual
switchbacks
which
do
you
choose
for
the
group
the
answer
be
none
of
them
if
there
s
no
one
trail
why
be
you
try
to
force
everyone
to
go
the
same
way
the
scout
with
no
pack
should
take
the
steep
route
get
there
quickly
and
scope
out
the
best
place
to
camp
with
good
access
to
water
flat
spot
for
the
tent
and
good
protection
from
the
element
the
guy
with
the
pack
raft
should
use
the
water
along
the
route
to
float
to
camp
arrive
a
little
later
but
more
rest
the
pack
mule
should
take
the
slow
but
least
tax
route
your
job
as
a
leader
be
to
let
them
figure
that
out
you
ve
presumably
chosen
this
group
for
such
an
arduous
off
trail
trip
because
you
trust
their
judgment
and
because
they
understand
their
job
so
as
a
leader
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
everyone
arrives
at
the
campsite
be
to
tell
them
where
to
go
not
how
to
get
there
give
them
clear
coordinate
and
let
them
figure
it
out
it
s
the
same
at
a
startup
real
innovation
come
not
from
top
down
pronouncement
and
narrowly
define
task
it
come
from
hire
innovator
focus
on
the
big
picture
who
can
orient
themselves
within
a
problem
and
solve
it
without
have
their
hand
held
the
whole
time
we
call
it
be
loosely
couple
but
tightly
align
from
the
begin
i
resolve
to
treat
everyone
who
work
at
netflix
as
an
adult
at
borland
i
d
see
what
happen
when
company
decide
not
to
do
that
when
i
work
at
borland
the
company
be
at
its
decadent
eighty
height
set
on
a
dozen
beautifully
landscape
acre
the
campus
boast
a
koi
pond
in
the
lobby
a
redwood
grove
walk
path
a
theater
a
full
restaurant
a
health
club
with
racquetball
court
weight
room
fitness
studio
and
an
olympic
size
pool
and
of
course
as
befits
a
company
where
nothing
be
too
good
for
its
employee
there
be
a
hot
tub
but
even
a
jacuzzi
wasn
t
enough
to
ensure
that
everyone
be
happy
not
long
after
move
onto
the
new
campus
i
be
return
from
lunch
with
patty
mccord
at
the
time
one
of
borland
s
human
resource
manager
when
we
notice
a
group
of
engineer
soak
in
the
company
hot
tub
stop
to
say
hello
we
couldn
t
help
but
overhear
that
they
be
bitching
about
the
company
that
s
right
sit
in
the
company
hot
tub
complain
about
their
situation
what
s
wrong
with
this
picture
it
be
a
funny
moment
but
as
patty
and
i
head
back
to
work
we
couldn
t
help
but
wonder
if
we
be
supply
our
employee
with
fine
din
a
fitness
center
and
an
olympic
size
pool
and
they
be
still
complain
what
be
the
factor
that
really
drive
employee
satisfaction
or
more
importantly
what
do
it
take
to
get
other
people
to
sign
on
to
help
you
with
your
dream
and
be
happy
do
it
what
we
found
be
surprising
and
surprisingly
simple
people
want
to
be
treat
like
adult
they
want
to
have
a
mission
they
believe
in
a
problem
to
solve
and
space
to
solve
it
they
want
to
be
surround
by
other
adult
whose
ability
they
respect
year
later
patty
would
end
up
revolutionize
the
field
of
hr
at
netflix
and
much
of
her
philosophy
can
be
trace
back
to
the
realization
we
both
have
that
day
at
borland
people
don
t
want
hot
tub
not
really
they
don
t
want
free
snack
or
ping
pong
table
or
kombucha
on
tap
what
they
really
want
be
freedom
and
responsibility
they
want
to
be
loosely
couple
but
tightly
align
follow
one
problem
through
its
various
guise
and
iteration
should
give
you
a
good
idea
about
how
we
function
pre
launch
this
particular
problem
brought
us
into
contact
with
another
young
company
one
with
its
own
unique
culture
a
culture
that
couldn
t
have
be
more
different
from
ours
when
we
start
acquire
dvd
there
be
only
or
so
title
available
by
the
time
we
launch
in
april
of
there
be
the
relatively
low
number
of
dvd
in
existence
be
in
some
way
a
boon
for
us
it
meant
that
we
could
feasibly
acquire
a
couple
copy
of
each
one
and
accurately
claim
that
we
carry
every
dvd
that
have
ever
be
release
but
the
relatively
small
dvd
library
be
also
a
liability
many
of
the
title
available
weren
t
exactly
blockbuster
material
sure
some
of
the
studio
be
produce
dvd
people
might
have
actually
want
in
the
birdcage
the
mask
se
en
but
the
vast
majority
be
decidedly
less
upmarket
it
be
a
total
grab
bag
national
velvet
next
to
free
willy
elmo
save
christmas
next
to
sport
blooper
encyclopedia
there
be
low
budget
documentary
about
train
nasa
and
world
war
ii
there
be
dozen
of
nature
film
and
magazine
with
short
video
article
bollywood
be
big
so
be
karaoke
video
and
concert
film
of
orchestra
and
march
band
basically
the
selection
be
all
over
the
place
no
one
really
knew
if
dvd
be
go
to
take
off
and
how
it
would
work
if
it
do
would
dvd
be
a
format
use
mostly
for
movie
be
they
a
good
technology
for
listen
to
music
would
people
want
to
use
dvd
five
channel
sound
to
watch
two
hour
live
performance
by
the
usc
march
band
in
their
home
theater
so
manufacturer
and
studio
be
kind
of
just
experiment
the
library
be
a
mix
of
somewhat
newish
release
establish
classic
forgotten
oldie
and
disc
that
seem
design
to
show
off
home
theater
equipment
if
you
look
at
the
library
you
d
think
that
the
audience
for
dvd
be
mostly
nerd
college
sport
fanatic
and
anime
fan
the
distribution
be
similarly
idiosyncratic
vhs
be
still
king
so
many
distributor
weren
t
even
carry
dvd
and
i
don
t
blame
them
why
would
anyone
buy
a
library
of
thing
for
which
there
be
not
any
demand
as
a
result
dvd
become
the
province
of
the
fringe
distributor
these
distributor
be
flaky
they
didn
t
return
phone
call
in
our
quest
to
acquire
at
least
two
copy
of
every
dvd
we
d
spend
day
track
down
a
title
only
to
play
phone
tag
for
a
week
through
all
of
this
process
mitch
lowe
be
invaluable
he
knew
how
to
deal
with
distributor
even
the
small
elusive
one
he
knew
how
to
make
them
call
us
back
he
be
charm
persistent
and
happy
to
call
in
the
many
favor
he
d
earn
after
his
year
as
vsda
chairman
one
of
the
most
valuable
skill
he
have
be
know
exactly
how
many
copy
to
buy
in
those
early
day
there
be
no
algorithm
no
equation
just
mitch
he
knew
when
to
buy
three
copy
and
when
to
buy
thirty
two
copy
of
every
dvd
be
our
minimum
but
we
bought
many
more
for
title
that
mitch
thought
would
be
in
demand
far
more
than
a
video
store
would
have
for
a
comparable
vhs
title
the
question
of
inventory
be
one
that
we
thought
would
give
us
an
edge
over
the
video
store
there
be
a
finite
amount
of
space
in
a
brick
and
mortar
video
store
so
part
of
their
job
be
learn
how
to
deal
with
the
inevitable
shortage
mitch
and
others
in
the
business
most
notably
blockbuster
call
this
manage
dissatisfaction
what
do
you
do
when
a
customer
come
into
the
store
look
for
a
copy
of
die
hard
but
all
of
the
copy
be
checked
out
you
try
to
rent
them
something
else
that
they
might
like
just
as
much
you
try
to
make
them
happy
enough
so
that
they
ll
come
back
but
even
then
customer
leave
with
a
bad
taste
in
their
mouth
since
we
weren
t
tie
to
a
physical
location
we
thought
we
could
avoid
manage
dissatisfaction
entirely
the
closest
thing
to
instant
gratification
that
we
could
give
our
customer
be
always
have
the
title
they
want
in
stock
so
while
a
video
store
would
have
bought
or
copy
we
bought
or
when
l
a
confidential
be
release
we
bought
it
be
expensive
but
we
have
four
thing
go
for
us
first
million
in
the
bank
let
s
see
ye
olde
video
closet
at
the
northeast
corner
of
boring
and
main
compete
with
that
second
the
cost
of
all
those
extra
disc
wasn
t
expensive
inventory
it
be
inexpensive
advertising
it
be
like
those
old
mastercard
commercial
a
disc
a
reputation
for
have
every
dvd
and
always
be
in
stock
priceless
third
we
be
counting
on
the
dvd
market
continue
to
grow
what
seem
like
ten
time
too
many
copy
today
might
very
well
be
just
what
we
need
when
the
market
be
ten
time
as
big
and
lastly
well
if
we
really
screw
up
we
could
always
sell
our
extra
dvd
while
jim
try
to
figure
out
a
way
to
squeeze
all
those
dvd
into
the
bank
vault
christina
and
i
wrestle
with
a
different
problem
how
would
our
customer
find
a
dvd
what
search
term
could
they
use
how
would
we
group
movie
on
our
site
what
information
would
they
use
to
make
their
selection
when
you
rent
dvd
you
have
to
have
information
about
them
think
about
the
back
of
a
dvd
case
there
s
a
synopsis
a
list
of
the
cast
the
director
and
the
producer
a
few
well
chosen
and
often
mislead
quote
from
lead
critic
praise
the
movie
you
re
about
to
watch
in
a
video
store
that
stuff
be
all
in
place
long
before
the
movie
hit
the
shelf
sure
place
like
blockbuster
or
video
droid
have
searchable
in
store
database
for
actor
director
genre
and
the
like
but
most
of
the
information
a
customer
want
be
right
in
front
of
them
all
a
potential
renter
have
to
do
be
walk
in
see
the
picture
of
tom
cruise
on
the
cover
of
mission
impossible
and
flip
the
vhs
case
over
we
have
a
harder
road
in
our
store
there
be
no
case
to
flip
over
what
we
be
offering
renter
wasn
t
just
an
alphabetically
order
trove
of
movie
separate
by
genre
we
want
the
ability
to
filter
for
director
for
actor
for
genre
we
want
renter
to
be
able
to
follow
their
interest
in
a
precise
way
do
they
like
movie
in
which
andie
macdowell
appear
be
they
really
into
the
cinematography
of
n
stor
almendros
who
be
behind
all
those
beautiful
sunset
in
day
of
heaven
do
they
want
a
horror
movie
and
not
only
a
horror
movie
but
a
vampire
movie
and
not
only
a
vampire
movie
but
a
vampire
movie
with
comedic
element
we
want
to
be
able
to
offer
renter
the
ability
to
find
exactly
what
they
want
that
require
an
immense
amount
of
data
both
objective
data
like
director
actor
producer
date
of
release
and
subjective
data
thing
like
genre
and
mood
we
also
need
to
be
able
to
access
data
about
award
and
critical
acclaim
or
lack
thereof
if
a
renter
want
to
watch
every
best
picture
winner
of
all
time
we
want
her
to
be
able
to
do
so
how
could
we
go
about
building
such
a
database
the
obvious
answer
be
to
hire
a
few
people
to
comb
through
the
list
of
dvd
and
pull
data
for
all
the
category
we
want
there
be
few
than
a
thousand
dvd
available
so
it
be
possible
but
we
only
have
twelve
employee
we
have
more
than
enough
to
do
so
our
time
be
a
precious
resource
but
money
we
have
a
bunch
of
that
so
i
start
look
for
other
option
my
think
be
that
if
we
could
buy
it
rather
than
build
it
then
we
should
buy
it
big
mistake

an
american
musician
astrologer
photographer
tv
host
and
internet
entrepreneur
who
found
in
the
all
music
guide
now
know
as
allmusic
back
in
all
i
knew
be
the
last
part
i
d
come
across
all
music
guide
s
sister
site
all
movie
guide
when
i
be
look
for
possible
data
source
i
didn
t
know
that
michael
have
hitchhike
with
bob
dylan
or
that
he
d
be
in
a
blue
band
with
iggy
pop
i
didn
t
know
that
he
be
the
author
at
the
time
of
five
book
on
astrology
with
title
like
tibetan
earth
lord
tibetan
astrology
and
geomancy
i
just
knew
that
he
have
something
i
want
data
i
have
something
he
want
too
dvd
the
goal
of
all
movie
be
to
compile
a
detailed
catalogue
of
every
film
ever
make
erlewine
have
dozen
of
employee
track
down
watch
and
annotate
movie
around
the
clock
visitor
to
his
website
could
find
the
most
arcane
information
about
any
movie
they
have
ever
heard
of
and
thousand
they
hadn
t
the
problem
be
that
he
have
no
dvd
an
inveterate
completist
erlewine
didn
t
just
want
detailed
information
about
every
movie
ever
make
he
want
it
about
every
format
of
every
movie
ever
make
for
dvd
he
want
to
know
what
special
feature
be
available
which
language
be
include
the
screen
ratio
and
whether
or
not
there
be
surround
sound
all
the
information
he
need
be
right
there
on
the
dvd
case
but
distributor
weren
t
really
sell
to
private
consumer
so
erlewine
s
problem
be
even
more
profound
than
ours
as
we
try
to
build
out
our
inventory
because
there
be
so
few
retail
store
that
even
carry
dvd
acquire
a
library
of
every
title
would
require
thousand
of
hour
hundred
of
mile
of
travel
and
a
good
slug
of
chance
we
begin
discuss
a
deal
we
d
give
him
money
and
dvd
in
exchange
for
his
data
i
love
negotiation
and
i
m
pretty
good
at
it
in
large
part
this
be
because
it
s
easy
for
me
to
identify
with
other
people
s
need
i
m
able
to
understand
what
another
party
in
a
negotiation
want
what
they
need
and
how
they
feel
about
get
it
because
i
can
quickly
identify
what
the
other
side
want
i
m
able
to
strategize
more
efficiently
about
how
we
can
come
to
a
mutually
beneficial
solution
with
erlewine
though
thing
didn
t
go
so
smoothly
over
the
phone
i
knew
what
he
want
he
knew
what
i
want
but
i
have
a
harder
time
understand
his
reluctance
to
meet
in
the
middle
make
a
deal
would
help
both
of
us
and
our
phone
call
be
cordial
but
he
kept
stall
he
seem
reluctant
to
come
to
an
agreement
and
i
couldn
t
figure
out
why
so
i
flew
out
to
meet
him
in
person
one
tuesday
that
winter
i
get
on
a
plane
bound
for
grand
rapid
michigan
when
i
land
i
rent
a
subaru
and
drove
north
to
big
rapid
i
be
expect
an
office
park
a
corporate
hq
maybe
even
some
good
size
rapid
behind
the
building
but
the
address
michael
give
me
belong
to
a
big
house
in
a
residential
neighborhood
with
not
a
ripple
in
sight
pickup
truck
be
park
in
every
driveway
flanneled
men
be
shovel
snow
from
their
yard
i
park
in
a
circular
drive
in
front
of
a
three
story
colonial
that
have
be
modify
and
join
to
several
other
house
in
the
immediate
vicinity
cover
breezeways
connect
several
of
the
adjoin
house
i
saw
people
hurry
from
building
to
building
carry
cardboard
box
and
in
one
instance
a
reel
to
reel
projector
it
look
like
a
commune
maybe
a
cult
i
be
a
world
away
from
our
sterile
office
park
in
northern
california
michael
give
me
a
tour
of
the
premise
at
the
time
he
be
lean
and
wiry
undoubtedly
from
a
diet
high
in
kale
yogurt
and
granola
he
wore
an
open
neck
shirt
that
show
some
kind
of
necklace
he
be
direct
soft
spoken
and
lean
in
when
he
make
a
point
listen
carefully
to
what
i
say
in
response
i
expect
at
any
moment
for
him
to
shake
his
head
slowly
and
murmur
ah
hah
just
what
i
thought
taurus
with
aries
ascendant
but
then
he
could
shut
off
quickly
if
thing
weren
t
go
the
way
he
want
conveniently
he
seem
guide
by
an
external
force
a
high
power
that
be
actually
in
charge
negotiate
a
compromise
be
not
something
he
could
do
since
he
be
in
fact
only
the
messenger
he
would
have
to
check
with
his
bos
before
decide
if
the
exterior
of
the
all
movie
hq
resemble
a
commune
the
interior
be
like
be
inside
an
ocd
record
collector
s
head
every
square
inch
of
wall
space
be
cover
by
floor
to
ceiling
shelf
fill
with
lp
compact
disc
and
tape
the
room
have
clearly
be
improvised
into
work
space
the
first
room
we
poked
our
head
into
have
three
desk
one
in
each
corner
the
woman
at
the
desk
closest
to
the
door
be
hold
the
liner
note
to
an
lp
up
to
a
small
lamp
a
foreign
language
dictionary
open
in
front
of
her
norwegian
folk
music
she
say
in
the
next
room
a
man
be
go
through
a
huge
stack
of
daily
variety
from
the
s
what
be
you
look
for
i
ask
film
announcement
he
say
i
m
try
to
correlate
shoot
date
he
s
capture
data
on
film
that
never
even
get
make
michael
say
proudly
the
tour
take
nearly
an
hour
i
saw
three
or
four
building
all
fill
with
these
detail
obsess
scrivener
one
building
a
former
garage
be
particularly
loud
that
s
the
woodshop
michael
say
opening
the
door
saw
pallet
stack
of
lumber
and
dozen
of
identical
six
foot
bookshelf
they
acquire
so
many
book
record
and
film
that
they
manufacture
their
own
shelve
we
didn
t
reach
a
deal
that
day
or
in
the
week
that
follow
we
parry
over
the
silliest
detail
as
soon
as
i
have
met
one
of
his
demand
he
would
come
up
with
another
one
in
one
sense
i
knew
exactly
how
to
appeal
to
erlewine
for
all
his
site
rhetoric
about
be
the
world
s
lead
repository
of
information
about
music
and
movie
my
visit
to
michigan
have
taught
me
something
valuable
erlewine
be
a
hoarder
his
real
motivation
wasn
t
information
it
be
collect
he
d
cannily
found
a
way
to
monetize
his
obsession
and
he
need
my
dvd
more
than
he
need
my
money
but
even
with
dvd
in
hand
i
suspect
that
there
be
another
reason
michael
be
hold
out
he
be
paranoid
about
his
data
my
proposal
be
that
we
would
use
his
movie
data
release
date
cast
and
so
on
as
the
bedrock
for
our
own
entry
we
would
append
all
the
dvd
specific
information
and
send
that
back
to
him
but
erlewine
insist
that
he
be
the
one
to
add
the
dvd
data
and
then
send
it
to
us
i
like
the
idea
of
him
do
more
of
the
work
but
the
deal
breaker
be
his
insistence
that
in
the
end
he
would
own
all
of
the
data
even
though
it
be
our
participation
that
have
make
this
data
possible
this
be
unacceptable
to
me
we
would
be
building
our
entire
website
infrastructure
on
top
of
that
data
and
be
he
to
decide
in
a
fit
of
astrologically
induced
pique
that
he
didn
t
like
us
or
our
term
or
the
way
aries
be
ascend
he
could
easily
take
his
crystal
ball
and
go
home
leave
us
with
nothing
we
would
be
royally
screw
and
i
didn
t
need
to
read
any
tea
leaf
to
make
that
prediction
an
early
stage
startup
be
a
delicate
ecosystem
in
which
compete
pressure
investor
expectation
market
reality
and
plain
old
plausibility
push
in
from
all
side
i
didn
t
need
yet
another
outside
force
dictate
our
progress
i
recognize
erlewine
s
anxiety
it
be
the
same
anxiety
that
many
people
felt
during
the
internet
boom
his
service
both
all
music
and
all
movie
have
begin
as
print
publication
they
d
be
analog
the
transition
to
digital
make
him
uneasy
he
be
sit
on
his
hoard
and
he
didn
t
want
anyone
to
take
it
away
eventually
i
start
to
get
exasperate
under
erlewine
s
plan
we
d
be
pay
him
for
the
privilege
of
learn
about
dvd
we
technically
own
but
i
also
knew
that
he
have
us
over
a
barrel
we
be
the
one
under
a
time
crunch
and
he
have
the
information
we
want
the
site
be
launch
in
just
a
few
month
and
we
need
the
data
he
have
to
even
begin
to
build
the
database
that
would
power
our
site
i
stall
i
hem
and
i
haw
every
day
as
january
flow
into
february
christina
and
eric
badger
me
we
need
the
data
to
be
able
to
build
a
model
of
the
database
we
be
write
our
own
blurb
add
the
movie
to
collection
and
make
other
editorial
decision
but
all
of
our
content
need
to
be
attach
to
a
root
record
even
if
we
finish
the
content
well
before
launch
date
we
knew
there
be
day
if
not
week
of
effort
to
actually
connect
our
content
with
erlewine
s
we
couldn
t
just
plug
everything
in
the
day
before
launch
there
be
another
problem
even
if
we
could
get
a
deal
the
amount
of
data
he
would
be
send
our
way
be
so
massive
especially
in
that
it
couldn
t
be
do
over
the
internet
we
d
receive
the
data
in
a
pretty
analog
fashion
reel
of
magnetic
tape
forget
email
this
data
would
have
to
be
ship
to
us
in
a
box
that
be
another
reason
we
need
all
the
time
we
could
get
once
we
have
the
tape
in
hand
we
d
have
to
translate
it
teach
our
site
how
to
read
it
the
contract
erlewine
have
drawn
up
be
completely
unacceptable
i
hat
it
but
i
have
to
sign
it
he
won
but
the
second
i
sign
that
contract
i
start
think
of
way
to
get
out
of
it
i
have
to
hand
it
to
the
guy
michael
erlewine
found
a
way
to
monetize
his
obsessive
compulsive
hoard
that
company
ran
accord
to
his
principle
it
resemble
him
sure
walk
through
their
office
be
like
take
a
tour
of
the
inside
of
an
obsessive
record
collector
s
skull
but
the
place
have
an
ethos
it
have
an
identity
it
be
not
anywhere
in
the
same
ballpark
of
how
i
want
my
company
to
look
feel
or
behave
but
it
work
for
him
my
own
approach
have
always
be
more
measure
i
think
people
be
more
productive
when
they
re
happy
when
their
life
outside
of
work
aren
t
totally
subsume
by
their
job
i
m
the
guy
who
want
to
put
the
company
in
santa
cruz
remember
i
m
the
guy
who
want
a
short
commute
and
the
opportunity
to
go
surf
in
the
morning
before
work
it
be
a
give
that
once
we
start
work
to
make
netflix
a
reality
the
hour
would
be
long
all
of
us
knew
that
because
all
of
us
be
silicon
valley
veteran
we
d
do
the
fifty
or
sixty
or
seventy
hour
workweek
before
the
difference
be
that
this
time
we
be
choose
to
do
it
we
weren
t
work
for
someone
else
s
dream
we
be
work
for
ourselves
so
yes
i
sometimes
slept
on
a
couch
in
the
office
and
yes
i
once
saw
one
of
our
coder
take
a
bird
bath
in
the
men
s
restroom
i
won
t
pretend
that
my
diet
in
the
fall
of
consist
of
much
more
than
takeout
eggplant
parm
a
steal
at
from
the
italian
place
across
the
street
but
when
i
need
a
morning
off
to
mountain
bike
and
clear
my
head
i
take
it
when
te
want
to
chew
over
pr
stunt
during
a
manicure
she
book
an
appointment
nowadays
they
call
that
self
care
back
then
we
just
call
it
common
sense
if
we
be
go
to
try
to
fundamentally
change
an
entire
industry
we
need
to
have
our
wit
about
us
even
in
the
trench
of
pre
launch
netflix
i
kept
to
a
long
stand
tradition
with
lorraine
on
tuesday
no
matter
what
i
left
the
office
promptly
at
and
spent
the
even
with
my
wife
we
d
hire
a
babysitter
go
for
a
walk
on
the
beach
and
then
head
to
our
favorite
restaurant
bittersweet
bistro
for
some
roast
salmon
and
a
few
glass
of
wine
sometimes
we
d
hit
the
theater
in
downtown
santa
cruz
and
catch
a
movie
i
need
that
time
with
lorraine
just
the
two
of
us
no
kid
no
domestic
duty
i
need
to
recharge
to
be
with
my
best
friend
for
a
few
hour
and
not
think
about
anything
else
i
d
institute
date
night
at
borland
where
it
wasn
t
unusual
for
worker
to
stay
until
seven
or
eight
o
clock
at
night
regularly
at
first
i
didn
t
mind
the
long
hour
it
be
just
how
thing
work
but
after
a
few
month
i
fear
burnout
and
i
also
worried
that
i
wasn
t
prioritize
my
relationship
with
my
wife
especially
once
we
have
kid
so
much
of
our
time
together
be
dominate
by
family
sport
practice
family
dinner
get
the
child
ready
for
school
or
sleep
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
two
of
us
stayed
connect
once
i
d
institute
tuesday
date
night
i
be
fiercely
protective
of
it
five
o
clock
be
a
hard
deadline
the
moment
the
second
hand
hit
the
i
be
out
of
there
last
minute
crisis
too
bad
an
emergency
meeting
that
could
only
be
held
at
well
make
it
short
need
to
talk
to
me
about
something
at
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
walk
to
my
car
at
first
this
occasion
some
conflict
but
eventually
after
people
get
the
memo
and
after
i
d
remain
firm
in
the
face
of
numerous
challenge
my
colleague
knew
not
to
schedule
anything
that
would
conflict
with
my
deadline
they
both
respect
and
work
around
it
in
the
fall
of
as
we
built
our
company
it
would
have
be
easy
for
me
to
break
the
tuesday
night
tradition
there
be
so
many
thing
to
do
so
many
problem
to
solve
and
i
have
my
hand
in
hundred
of
them
my
usual
routine
be
to
hit
the
office
at
around
seven
in
the
morning
eat
lunch
at
my
desk
and
work
all
afternoon
until
six
or
so
then
i
d
drive
the
five
minute
back
to
my
house
to
be
home
in
time
for
dinner
with
my
kid
i
d
help
lorraine
put
them
to
bed
and
then
more
often
than
not
i
d
head
back
to
the
office
for
a
few
hour
eventually
quit
around
ten
or
eleven
then
back
home
for
some
wind
down
and
a
few
hour
of
sleep
i
think
i
be
average
about
five
hour
a
night
in
those
day
often
less
one
night
when
i
come
home
for
dinner
my
son
logan
greet
me
at
the
door
and
instead
of
a
hug
say
he
have
a
question
to
ask
me
sure
logan
what
s
up
he
study
me
for
a
moment
star
hard
at
the
backpack
i
be
shrug
off
my
shoulder
be
the
bacon
in
there
i
cocked
my
head
what
do
you
mean
mom
say
you
be
bring
some
home
he
told
me
it
take
me
a
second
and
then
i
get
it
i
couldn
t
stop
laugh
for
about
five
minute
lorraine
told
me
later
that
when
the
kid
ask
where
i
be
in
those
day
she
d
say
one
of
two
thing
that
i
be
bring
home
the
bacon
or
climb
the
corporate
ladder
she
only
stop
say
it
when
logan
told
some
of
his
friend
at
school
that
his
dad
climbed
ladder
for
a
living
you
re
not
a
housepainter
after
all
she
say
still
a
part
of
me
think
that
logan
be
right
those
early
day
pre
launch
be
like
climb
a
long
endless
ladder
there
be
a
problem
to
deal
with
at
every
rung
and
each
time
we
solve
one
we
be
one
step
closer
to
our
goal
we
be
move
up
and
it
be
thrill
to
think
of
how
high
we
could
go
but
no
matter
how
high
i
d
climbed
or
how
many
step
i
saw
ahead
of
me
i
always
left
the
office
at
p
m
sharp
on
tuesday
i
didn
t
want
to
be
one
of
those
successful
entrepreneur
who
be
on
their
second
or
third
startup
but
also
on
their
second
or
third
spouse
save
a
night
for
my
wife
kept
both
of
us
sane
and
in
tune
with
each
other
by
november
of
we
have
an
office
we
have
a
semifunctional
website
that
we
be
test
we
have
dozen
of
mailer
prototype
we
have
the
begin
of
an
inventory
we
even
have
a
launch
date
march
what
we
didn
t
have
be
a
name
this
be
often
the
case
for
early
stage
startup
most
company
don
t
keep
the
same
name
from
ideation
to
funding
to
launch
name
be
important
and
sometimes
they
take
forever
to
find
amazon
be
originally
call
cadabra
twitter
start
off
as
status
you
have
to
allow
for
serendipity
for
the
right
name
to
come
along
as
you
develop
your
service
sometimes
that
take
month
but
in
the
meantime
you
typically
have
a
beta
name
a
work
title
that
you
use
to
test
your
site
set
up
email
account
and
write
on
bank
document
and
it
can
t
just
be
the
untitled
marc
randolph
project
our
beta
name
be
kibble
as
in
dog
food
steve
kahn
once
advise
me
that
when
it
come
time
for
us
to
choose
our
beta
name
i
should
choose
something
so
bad
it
wouldn
t
be
possible
to
use
it
for
real
six
month
in
he
say
and
you
ll
be
so
fry
that
you
ll
want
to
just
say
screw
it
let
s
keep
the
beta
name
your
sense
of
what
s
good
and
what
s
bad
will
be
almost
entirely
deplete
but
if
you
pick
something
so
awful
that
it
s
obviously
impossible
wewanttoripyouoff
com
giveusallyourmoney
net
you
ll
be
force
to
come
up
with
something
new
that
s
why
month
into
our
new
office
we
be
call
kibble
our
bank
statement
say
kibble
the
website
we
be
test
have
the
domain
name
kibble
com
my
email
address
be
marc
kibble
com
kibble
have
be
my
idea
it
come
from
an
old
advertising
and
marketing
adage
it
doesn
t
make
a
difference
how
good
the
ad
be
if
the
dog
don
t
eat
the
dog
food
the
idea
be
that
no
matter
how
much
sizzle
you
d
give
the
steak
no
matter
how
well
you
d
sell
it
nothing
matter
if
the
product
be
lackluster
it
doesn
t
matter
how
brilliant
your
ad
campaign
for
alpo
be
if
your
dog
won
t
eat
it
i
d
picked
kibble
as
a
work
name
because
i
thought
it
would
remind
us
to
focus
on
the
product
ultimately
we
have
to
build
something
people
would
love
we
be
go
up
against
some
big
gun
and
we
d
never
succeed
long
term
if
our
service
wasn
t
something
people
want
to
use
if
the
dog
food
we
be
sell
wasn
t
tasty
and
it
didn
t
hurt
that
i
already
own
the
domain
name
still
do
in
fact
type
kibble
com
into
a
web
browser
and
you
ll
end
up
on
my
personal
website
send
an
email
to
marc
kibble
com
and
you
ll
find
yourself
in
my
in
box
we
d
never
plan
on
use
kibble
as
the
name
for
our
service
but
steve
be
right
as
the
month
go
on
and
the
launch
date
get
closer
and
closer
kibble
be
start
to
look
pretty
good
team
meeting
i
finally
say
one
friday
afternoon
we
ve
get
to
decide
on
a
name
the
entire
company
all
fifteen
of
us
file
into
my
office
soon
after
we
d
move
into
the
building
christina
and
i
have
write
two
column
on
the
whiteboard
one
be
fill
with
word
related
to
the
internet
the
other
be
fill
with
word
related
to
movie
we
d
decide
that
the
best
name
for
our
company
would
combine
two
word
one
related
to
movie
one
related
to
the
internet
the
best
name
would
combine
both
term
seamlessly
with
a
minimum
of
syllable
and
letter
pick
a
name
be
incredibly
difficult
for
one
thing
you
need
something
catchy
something
that
roll
off
the
tongue
and
be
easy
to
remember
one
or
two
syllable
word
be
best
and
ideally
the
emphasis
be
should
on
the
first
syllable
think
of
the
most
popular
website
name
goo
gle
face
book
these
name
open
with
a
bang
too
many
syllable
too
many
letter
and
you
run
the
risk
of
people
misspell
your
website
too
few
letter
and
you
risk
them
forget
the
name
and
then
there
s
the
issue
of
what
s
available
it
doesn
t
matter
if
you
find
the
perfect
name
if
someone
else
already
own
the
domain
or
the
trademark
for
the
past
several
week
i
d
invite
anyone
who
have
an
idea
to
come
add
it
to
the
board
i
d
already
do
most
of
the
legwork
about
availability
trademark
and
the
like
now
it
be
time
to
make
a
decision
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
the
shadow
lengthen
on
the
floor
we
bat
around
name
match
up
syllable
from
one
column
to
the
other

not
say
anything
about

somebody

two
syllable
and
sure
it
satisfied
both
criterion
movie
and
internet
but
there
be
a
lot
of
worry
in
the
office
about
the
connotation
of

it
just
make
me
think
of

usual
babysitter
could
cover
for
us
and
even
though
the
point
of
date
night
be
to
get
away
from
work
to
get
away
from
member
of
the
netflix
board
like
reed
and
steve
by
that
time
a
week
pre
launch
it
be
almost
impossible
for
me
to
ever
fully
leave
the
netflix
office
behind
even
when
i
wasn
t
there
physically
my
mind
return
to
the
office
look
for
solution
to
all
the
little
problem
we
need
to
fix
before
go
live
steve
knew
that
he
d
know
me
a
long
time
he
knew
i
wouldn
t
be
able
to
truly
take
a
break
so
he
decide
to
help
any
way
he
could
by
at
least
give
lorraine
a
night
off
only
thing
you
have
to
bring
be
a
dvd
he
say
easy
enough
before
i
left
the
office
for
the
day
i
swung
by
the
vault
and
without
look
grabbed
the
top
dvd
case
on
the
pile
of
new
release
that
have
just
arrive
that
morning
i
really
need
a
break
so
do
lorraine
morgan
s
be
drive
me
nut
she
say
in
the
car
on
the
way
to
los
alto
she
spent
all
afternoon
steal
lipstick
out
of
my
purse
and
try
to
eat
it
this
sound
almost
unbearably
cute
to
me
but
i
understood
steve
live
on
the
east
side
of
los
alto
on
a
street
crowd
with
gigantic
new
house
his
house
wasn
t
that
big
but
it
be
nice
i
mean
really
nice
architecture
digest
nice
and
it
displayed
tastefully
of
course
all
the
trapping
of
wealth
that
a
long
successful
career
in
business
afford
i
don
t
think
you
need
to
lock
the
door
lorraine
say
sarcastically
as
i
park
the
car
not
in
this
neighborhood
steve
greet
us
at
the
door
with
glass
of
wine
healthy
pours
of
cabernet
for
me
and
chardonnay
for
lorraine
he
give
us
a
tour
through
impeccably
decorate
room
two
thing
stand
out
in
my
memory
a
wall
in
the
study
that
be
cover
entirely
with
bird
s
eye
maple
cabinetry
and
a
living
room
fill
with
modernist
furniture
that
look
straight
out
of
beetlejuice
it
be
the
first
time
i
d
see
more
than
one
eames
chair
in
the
same
room
the
furniture
museum
be
karen
s
territory
steve
say
when
his
wife
be
out
of
earshot
i
don
t
know
what
any
of
this
crap
be
throughout
this
tour
i
smell
cooking
but
steve
and
karen
be
with
us
who
be
watch
the
stove
it
wasn
t
until
we
repair
to
the
bar
for
finger
food
that
i
saw
the
white
coat
of
a
caterer
disappear
through
the
swing
door
to
the
kitchen
this
be
a
first
for
me
i
d
never
be
to
a
dinner
party
with
a
hire
chef
when
reed
and
his
wife
arrive
steve
lift
his
empty
wineglass
cocktail
in
the
garage
he
say
laugh
within
thirty
second
a
tray
of
gin
and
tonic
appear
carry
by
a
smile
waiter
and
steve
take
us
out
to
the
garage
to
show
off
his
new
porsche
i
m
not
really
a
car
guy
but
i
know
when
to
make
appreciative
noise
and
it
wasn
t
just
the
porsche
there
be
also
a
full
home
gym
gleam
brand
new
exercise
machine
a
treadmill
a
stationary
bike
all
of
it
atop
racquet
club
quality
rubber
mat
though
he
be
a
decade
old
than
i
be
steve
be
probably
in
well
shape
back
at
borland
steve
s
fortieth
birthday
resolution
have
be
to
run
every
day
on
his
lunch
break
for
forty
day
in
a
row
and
to
take
me
wheeze
along
with
him
drink
in
hand
i
wonder
if
all
of
this
the
car
the
furniture
museum
the
caterer
in
the
kitchen
be
in
my
future
too
i
thought
of
my
beat
up
volvo
dog
toy
in
the
backseat
the
house
with
a
leaky
roof
i
couldn
t
at
that
moment
afford
to
repair
the
stain
green
carpet
of
the
netflix
office
which
have
begin
to
exude
a
peculiar
stench
the
closer
we
get
to
launch
day
it
seem
unlikely
or
at
least
far
far
in
the
future
there
be
still
about
a
half
hour
before
the
cook
would
be
do
with
dinner
so
while
lorraine
and
karen
pour
more
glass
of
chardonnay
and
discuss
our
kitchen
renovation
steve
reed
and
i
repair
to
the
back
deck
bring
a
suit
steve
ask
and
that
s
how
i
end
up
in
borrow
hawaiian
swim
trunk
bobbing
in
a
saltwater
pool
in
an
impromptu
board
meeting
with
two
of
netflix
s
early
investor
there
be
a
ton
of
thing
i
d
do
if
we
have
more
time
i
say
for
instance
we
want
to
do
a
thing
call
the
list
which
would
let
you
save
a
list
of
title
that
you
want
to
watch
mitch
have
this
idea
to
have
a
digital
clerk
who
help
you
find
movie
he
know
you
ll
like
make
sense
steve
say
rest
his
wineglass
on
the
side
of
the
pool
every
time
i
go
to
hollywood
video
i
just
ask
the
kid
with
the
nose
ring
what
to
rent
the
other
guy
always
give
me
french
new
wave
crap
reed
wasn
t
really
say
anything
but
i
could
tell
that
he
be
think
about
what
who
knew
by
spring
of
he
d
gotten
tire
of
his
classmate
at
stanford
and
have
be
focus
most
of
his
energy
run
a
different
venture
technology
network
technet
be
a
lobbying
group
that
combine
reed
s

world
and
educational

it
push
for
well

reed
be
a
big
believer
in
charter
school
and
be
use
the
group
to
advocate
for
them
donate
money
to
a
grow
number
of
politician
frankly
he
have
enough
to
worry
about
but
i
be
still
relieve
when
he
dunked
his
head
underwater
and
swam
to
the
other
end
of
the
pool
i
didn
t
want
his
laser
focus
on
any
of
netflix
s
problem
due
to
michael
erlewine
we
d
already
miss
one
launch
date
it
be
now
april
rather
than
march
and
i
didn
t
want
reed
to
think
that
we
d
have
any
problem
meeting
the
second
one
as
reed
begin
swim
lap
his
six
foot
frame
glide
through
the
water
like
a
seal
i
told
steve
about
the
version
of
the
list
we
d
actually
be
able
to
construct
under
our
deadline
like
a
lot
of
our
quick
fix
it
wasn
t
built
to
last
christina
have
come
up
with
it
a
button
a
user
could
push
that
would
flag
a
movie
you
be
interested
in
so
that
next
time
you
saw
it
an
icon
would
appear
the
icon
a
finger
with
a
red
thread
wrap
around
it
the
engineer
hate
it
i
told
steve
they
call
it
the
bloody
finger
we
laugh
and
for
a
moment
the
stress
of
the
previous
week
melt
away
we
have
a
deadline
sure
we
have
people
counting
on
us
investor
to
satisfy
employee
to
pay
and
customer
to
reach
but
when
it
be
all
say
and
do
we
be
a
website
that
give
people
access
to
dvd
we
weren
t
change
the
world
like
reed
be
we
d
fix
the
bloody
finger
but
for
the
moment
it
be
okay
after
dry
off
and
have
dinner
mussel
in
some
kind
of
sauce
a
fish

a
number
of
modification
there

huge
leather
chair
with
massive
arm
and
cupholders
each
separate
from
each
other
each
of
them
be
nicer
than
anything
in
my
house
and
he
have
twelve
of
them
he
d
instal
track
light

aisle
just
like

the
screen
be
easily
eight
foot
across
and
take
up
a
full
wall
and

down
from
the
ceiling
steve

on

at
the
front
of
the
room

massive
one
at
the
back
and
a
center
speaker
in
the
middle
of
the
room
that
steve
say

just
for
dialogue
steve
then
gesture
at
one
of
the
seat

row
slightly
left
of
center
that
seat

fade
and
tone

perfect
in
that
one
spot
karen
start
up
the
popcorn
machine
just
outside
the
screen
room
and
i
take
a
look
inside
the
replica
candy
case
that
stood
by
a
refrigerator
stock
with
soda
mound
bar
my
favorite
so
marc
you
get
a
movie
for
us
steve
ask
once
we
all
have
our
concession
sure
i
say
fumble
in
my
backpack
until
i
found
it
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
but
it
just
come
in
today
one
of
this
week
s
feature
release
steve
saw
the
cover
oh
right
boogie
night
i
remember
hearing
that
be
good
worth
a
shot
i
say
i
felt
good
relaxed
full
of
wine
and
seafood
and
the
reassurance
of
a
friend
i
sat
down
in
one
of
the
front
row
recliner
next
to
lorraine
steve
take
the
money
seat
next
to
karen
reed
take
the
row
behind
them
the
light
go
down
the
curtain
go
up
and
we
watch
dirk
diggler
let
it
all
hang
out
in
crystalline
dvd
quality
resolution
across
an
eight
foot
screen
at
first
i
be
horrify
then
i
laugh
until
i
cry
let
s
hope
your
content
team
know
more
about
your
inventory
than
you
do
lorraine
say
i
have
to
agree
that
night
with
steve
kahn
taught
me
a
thing
or
two
about
the
virtue
of
preparation
but
i
ve
learn
most
of
my
lesson
on
that
subject
outdoors
particularly
in
the
mountain
it
s
definitely
not
a
place
that
you
can
take
lightly
there
be
river
crossing
where
a
single
miss
step
can
plunge
you
into
water
that
be
snowmelt
only
hour
before
if
the
cold
doesn
t
get
you
then
it
will
rush
you
downstream
and
stuff
you
permanently
beneath
a
submerge
outcrop
or
fell
tree
or
fail
that
trap
your
leg
in
the
rock
and
bend
you
backward
buffeting
you
up
and
down
until
you
finally
lose
the
strength
to
hold
your
head
above
water
there
be
snowfield
to
cross
them
you
have
to
step
with
enough
force
to
forge
a
solid
platform
but
it
s
entirely
possible
that
once
you
ve
commit
your
weight
to
a
step
your
platform
will
give
out
without
warn
leave
you
slide
downhill
at
increase
speed
hop
that
you
will
be
able
to
arrest
your
slide
with
your
ice
ax
before
you
plunge
at
high
speed
into
the
rock
fill
moat
that
form
the
boundary
between
snow
and
earth
there
be
cliff
to
climb
them
you
must
make
a
pact
with
the
rock
promising
to
linger
on
each
hold
only
as
long
as
it
take
to
move
to
the
next
one
the
cliff
warrant
that
the
tiny
edge
of
rock
you
have
grasped
and
stake
your
life
on
will
support
your
weight
until
it
doesn
t
and
with
sudden
and
unexpected
consequence
you
re
hurtle
down
your
fall
unobstructed
until
it
s
broken
by
the
jagged
pile
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
there
be
dangerous
animal
like
bison
cougar
and
grizzly
poisonous
plant
berry
and
mushroom
you
risk
infection
laceration
contusion
concussion
and
dislocation
there
be
avalanche
rockslide
mudflows
and
icefall
there
be
blizzard
downpour
hailstorm
and
sudden
freeze
there
be
countless
way
nature
can
tell
you
that
you
be
unwanted
alone
and
far
from
medical
attention
but
probably
the
scariest
risk
in
nature
s
repertoire
be
lightning
when
you
re
in
the
mountain
weather
move
fast
one
moment
the
sky
be
clear
and
cloudless
and
the
next
it
s
dark
fill
with
angry
cloud
be
there
anything
more
biblical
than
a
bolt
of
energy
that
come
crash
down
from
the
cloud
without
warn
in
an
instant
lightning
can
turn
a
tower
douglas
fir
into
a
blazing
birthday
candle
and
when
you
re
up
high
it
s
certainly
no
consolation
to
know
that
lightning
aim
for
the
high
point
around
whether
that
be
a
tree
rock
pile
sailboat
mast
ice
ax
or
head
lightning
doesn
t
discriminate
base
on
your
religion
your
educational
background
your
sexual
orientation
how
much
money
you
have
or
how
many
pound
you
can
bench
press
all
it
know
be
that
you
be
out
in
the
open
unaware
and
for
at
least
that
particular
moment
the
fast
and
easy
way
to
move
billion
watt
of
potential
energy
in
a
single
release
from
turbulent
cloud
to
the
ground
if
it
have
to
go
through
your
head
down
through
your
organ
and
out
through
the
sol
of
your
foot
in
order
to
do
so
well
then
that
s
just
your
bad
luck
to
maintain
your
sanity
in
the
mountain
you
can
t
dwell
on
these
thing
but
the
best
mountaineer
aren
t
quite
sane
i
m
no
climb
legend
or
anything
but
when
i
m
at
elevation
i
m
always
ask
myself
what
be
go
to
go
wrong
if
i
have
to
cross
a
stream
it
s
only
after
i
ve
hike
a
few
hundred
yard
downstream
to
see
if
there
be
anything
there
that
might
trap
me
should
i
lose
my
footing
and
be
swept
down
that
way
i
m
look
for
tree
limb
on
the
bank
i
can
grab
area
where
the
current
eddy
out
into
a
gentle
swirl
so
i
know
what
to
swim
toward
and
as
i
start
wad
across
the
stream
or
start
my
way
across
the
log
that
span
the
creek
i
ll
have
loosen
the
waist
belt
on
my
pack
it
make
it
harder
to
carry
but
infinitely
easy
to
shed
should
i
need
to
swim
that
s
what
it
s
like
be
in
a
startup
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
think
about
what
might
happen
and
prepare
for
it
sometimes
you
actually
put
a
backup
plan
in
place
but
most
of
the
time
you
just
think
through
how
you
will
respond
you
scout
out
the
river
for
rock
check
out
the
cliff
for
thing
to
grab
onto
if
you
fall
most
of
the
time
the
bad
doesn
t
come
to
pas
but
when
it
do
when
the
shit
really
hit
the
fan
well
you
re
go
to
be
the
guy
with
the
pail
and
the
mop
and
wear
a
raincoat
and
that
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
make
the
difference
between
be
a
success
and
be
the
guy
who
be
cover
with
shit
sometimes
as
we
learn
on
netflix
launch
day
there
be
no
difference
you
re
both
on
the
morning
of
the
netflix
launch
i
woke
up
early
around
five
lorraine
mumble
in
her
sleep
as
i
quietly
slid
on
my
slipper
and
shut
the
door
behind
me
the
kid
would
be
up
in
two
hour
or
so
but
until
then
i
have
the
house
to
myself
in
the
predawn
darkness
i
dodge
hammer
and
granite
sample
in
the
still
unfinished
kitchen
it
be
the
last
room
in
the
house
to
be
remodel
and
we
hadn
t
gotten
very
far
yet
the
d
cor
be
straight
out
of
fluorescent
light
avocado
green
cabinet
peel
linoleum
over
the
wood
floor
there
be
still
some
coffee
in
the
pot
from
the
previous
day
and
after
heating
it
up
in
the
microwave
i
drank
it
stand
in
the
kitchen
feel
my
mind
boot
up
i
make
a
new
pot
scoop
ground
coffee
into
a
filter
and
pour
water
into
the
reservoir
of
our
coffeemaker
it
be
ostensibly
for
lorraine
but
i
d
probably
drink
half
of
it
before
she
get
up
i
d
need
every
bit
of
the
caffeine
in
the
six
month
since
reed
have
write
that
check
we
d
do
so
much
we
d
assemble
an
inventory
put
together
a
website
built
a
company
with
a
culture
we
d
work
tirelessly
to
make
our
dream
of
an
e
commerce
site
for
dvd
a
reality
but
up
until
now
it
still
have
the
feel
of
an
unresolved
dream
the
site
exist
for
us
but
not
for
anyone
else
the
problem
we
anticipate
and
we
d
rack
our
brain
anticipate
them
be
still
in
the
future
we
weren
t
even
sure
if
we
d
identify
the
right
problem
the
success
too
be
in
the
unrealized
day
and
month
ahead
there
be
a
great
many
stage
in
the
life
cycle
of
a
startup
but
a
tectonic
shift
happens
on
launch
day
before
you
go
live
you
re
in
the
dreamy
zone
of
planning
and
forecast
your
effort
be
provisional
you
re
make
prediction
about
what
can
go
wrong
and
what
can
go
right
it
s
a
very
creative
heady
sort
of
work
it
be
essentially
optimistic
the
day
your
site
launch
something
shift
your
work
now
be
no
longer
predictive
and
anticipatory
it
s
fundamentally
reactive
those
problem
you
anticipate
you
didn
t
know
the
half
of
it
your
plan
solution
they
re
a
drop
in
the
bucket
and
there
be
hundred
thousand
of
issue
that
you
could
have
never
even
imagine
and
now
have
to
deal
with
that
morning
watch
the
sun
rise
over
the
mountain
i
be
position
the
various
team
in
my
mind
imagine
what
the
day
would
bring
for
jim
cook
s
crew
for
eric
s
programmer
for
te
and
the
marketing
squad
i
ran
through
the
day
s
plan
the
a
m
launch
the
morning
full
of
press
call
the
process
of
order
to
shipment
in
other
word
i
be
do
what
i
d
be
do
since
the
summer
of
strategizing
before
you
launch
you
re
make
a
beautiful
battle
plan
coordinate
the
future
movement
of
your
troop
the
second
you
launch
you
re
in
the
fog
of
war
i
get
to
the
office
at
seven
or
so
in
the
morning
and
call
our
standard
daily
meeting
christina
te
jim
eric
and
i
file
into
the
conference
room
to
go
over
the
day
s
schedule
we
ve
get
press
call
start
at
nine
te
told
me
for
month
te
have
be
line
up
reporter
and
news
outlet
who
would
be
interested
in
write
a
story
about
our
startup
hit
her
rolodex
hard
so
that
when
our
launch
day
come
people
would
read
about
it
all
morning
i
d
be
on
the
phone
with
these
reporter
give
them
a
pretty
can
speech
that
i
d
spent
hour
try
to
make
sound
natural
here
s
an
excerpt
with
this
morning
s
launch
of
the
nation
s
first
internet
dvd
rental
store
every
dvd
owner
no
matter
where
he
life
no
matter
how
far
he

from
a
video

store
be
now
guaranteed
access
to
every
dvd
title
available
to
buy
or
to
rent
who
s
first
i
ask
steve
perez
at
the
santa
cruz
sentinel
te
say
start
with
the
hometown
paper
wasn
t
coincidental
my
strategy
be
always
to
start
with
a
softball
for
your
first
call
there
s
nothing
like
have
a
friendly
voice
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
and
in
this
case
it
paid
off
unlike
the
san
francisco
chronicle
or
yahoo
two
of
the
other
outlet
that
cover
us
the
sentinel
give
us
prominent
coverage
with
a
photo
somewhere
in
my
file
there
s
a
fade
full
page
newspaper
clip
from
the
day
after
our
launch
feature
a
photo
of
a
very
late
ninety
iteration
of
me
complete
with
a
pager
clipped
to
my
belt
stand
next
to
a
gateway
and
a
mess
of
cable
and
wire
the
lede
still
try
to
figure
out
how
to
program
your
vcr
trash
it
then
videotape
be
as
pas
as
grandpa
s
polaroid
great
i
say
run
over
my
line
in
my
head
i
knew
that
whatever
happen
i
d
have
to
project
cheerful
calm
through
the
mouthpiece
of
my
telephone
bomb
could
go
off
the
server
could
catch
on
fire
and
the
site
could
crash
but
i
d
just
have
to
close
my
eye
and
keep
go
netflix
make
it
incredibly
easy
to
rent
a
dvd
there
s
no
drive
no
search
for
parking
no
stand
in
line
we
even
make
it
easy
to
return
it
and
we
re
open
day
a
week
hour
a
day
we
go
over
one
last
time
the
process
for
jim
s
team
order
come
in
jim
say
and
once
we
ve
get
credit
card
authorization
it
go
to
the
printer
in
the
safe
my
team
find
the
disc
slip
it
into
the
sleeve
and
scan
it
once
to
pull
it
from
inventory
then
it
s
off
to
dan
dan
insert
the
promo
sheet
seal
thing
up
slap
the
label
on
and
scan
it
again
to
show
it
s
shipping
then
into
the
bin
and
ready
to
mail
jim
be
still
smile
that
stupid
grin
but
i
could
tell
he
be
nervous
he
d
spent
week
streamline
his
process
check
it
for
flaw
and
inefficiency
but
there
be
only
so
much
he
could
do
without
the
pressure
of
real
order
come
from
the
site
and
one
of
the
big
problem
be
that
we
have
no
clue
how
many
order
we
d
get
on
launch
day
five
or
ten
twenty
or
thirty
a
hundred
corey
have
be
work
overdrive
on
the
message
board
pump
netflix
up
to
tech
nerd
and
cinephiles
and
he
d
continue
to
do
so
throughout
the
day
but
how
many
order
be
that
i
wasn
t
hold
my
breath
for
big
number
eric
and
his
team
boris
vita
suresh
and
kho
look
inscrutable
whether
they
be
nervous
or
not
i
couldn
t
tell
most
of
the
stress
of
the
day
fell
on
their
shoulder
of
course
they
d
anticipate
all
sort
of
problem
with
the
site
and
they
d
formulate
any
number
of
solution
to
those
problem
but
they
knew
that
thing
would
go
wrong
that
they
hadn
t
expect
and
so
the
day
for
them
be
go
to
unroll
in
a
flurry
of
mountain
dew
and
pizza
slice
eric
bark
out
a
few
largely
incomprehensible
reminder
to
his
team
and
i
take
that
as
an
opportunity
to
look
them
over
boris
and
vita
appear
the
same
as
ever
unflappable
and
calm
kho
look
like
he
d
dress
up
for
the
launch
clean
black
t
shirt
somewhat
clean
look
black
jean
his
hair
look
combed
christina
be
nervous
she
d
plan
for
this
day
for
month
she
have
hundred
of
page
in
dozen
of
notebook
detail
the
site
s
operation
how
a
user
would
interact
with
it
what
would
happen
if
they
make
a
mistake
her
team
have
spent
many
hundred
of
hour
integrate
our
own
movie
content
with
michael
erlewine
s
back
of
the
box
data
building
informative
interest
entry
for
all
film
in
our
archive
i
could
see
her
team
through
the
conference
room
window
still
manually
scan
the
cover
image
of
the
last
few
dvd
box
to
be
uploaded
onto
the
site
to
them
it
be
just
another
day
of
their
usual
work
but
to
christina
whose
understand
of
the
website
s
logistics
far
surpass
anyone
else
s
it
be
a
stressful
day
you
know
she
told
me
this
be
our
fifth
launch
together
it
be
true
we
d
launch
a
whole
series
of
paperport
scanner
at
visioneer
together
and
each
of
us
individually
have
dozen
of
other
launch
under
our
belt
but
that
be
then
after
all
in
software
and
package
good
when
the
actual
launch
day
arrives
you
re
already
past
the
point
of
no
return
the
product
have
be
finish
for
week
it
s
come
out
of
the
factory
it
s
make
its
way
into
box
it
s
on
truck
go
out
across
the
country
launch
day
be
just
a
press
day
i
feel
like
this
be
go
to
go
somewhat
differently
i
say
as
we
file
toward
the
bank
of
computer
in
the
middle
of
the
office
workspace
i
think
you
re
right
christina
say
we
have
no
idea
it
start
well
at
everyone
in
the
office
gather
in
front
of
eric
s
computer
the
site
be
go
live
at
and
we
d
already
make
the
round
of
preparation
be
there
paper
in
the
printer
be
all
the
dvd
tucked
in
their
sleeve
in
the

all
the
i

all
the

there
be
actually
two
version
of
our
website
one
reside
on
a
server
that
wasn
t
online
it
be
a
duplicate
version
that
eric
could
use
to
test
out
new
page
and
feature
anything
new
be
post
first
to
what
be
call
a
stag
server
then
we
would
bang
on
it
for
a
while
to
make
sure
that
it
work
the
way
we
expect
it
to
and
more
importantly
that
the
new
addition
played
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
site
then
once
we
have
some
satisfaction
that
we
weren
t
go
to
have
a
disaster
on
our
hand
we
would
push
the
new
version
over
to
what
be
call
a
production
server
which
be
host
the
live
site
up
until
this
morning
the
distinction
between
the
two
site
be
entirely
academic
although
one
be
supposedly
final
and
connect
to
the
internet
it
wasn
t
visible
to
the
actual
public
although
we
have
practice
push
thing
live
and
pretend
we
have
real
customer
use
it
there
weren
t
any
real
consequence
this
be
all
about
to
change
for
the
hundredth
time
eric
idly
scroll
through
on
the
stag
site
pretend
to
be
a
customer
it
look
good
it
look
good

say
click
on
the
link
and
fill
in
field
on
our
form
boris
and
vita
be
act
nervous
too
they
knew
as
we
all
do
that
thing
would
break
and
that
they
d
have
to
be
on
their
toe
to
fix
the
site
when
it
invariably
malfunction
they
d
plan
for
thing
to
go
wrong
what
happen
if
a
user
enter
his
state
abbreviation
as
nf
rather
than
nc
nd
ne
nm
nv
or
ny
on
the
checkout
page
what
would
happen
if
the
credit
card
number
didn
t
start
with
a
for
visa
or
for
mastercard
or
didn
t
go
through
at
all
would
we
fail
gracefully
or
crash
and
burn
one
final
thread
that
i
knew
be
still
stick
out
of
the
seam
of
our
startup
be
the
confirmation
email
we
hadn
t
yet
create
an
automate
confirmation
email
function
for
user
one
that
would
contact
a
customer
after
she
place
an
order
and
reiterate
information
about
payment
and
shipping
we
d
have
to
compose
confirmation
email
by
hand
for
each
individual
customer
that
wasn
t
ideal
obviously
but
i
figure
it
would
be
workable
five
minute
christina
say
at
she
be
drinking
coffee
out
of
a
huge
mug
and
munch

of
the
heavier

about

who
know
how
many
jim
have
his
hand
on
his
hip
i
could
see
his
mind
go
through
the
logistics
of

replay
over
and
over
how
to
fill
an
order
pack
it

counter
to
alert
employee
that
a
customer
need
help

several
month
ago
we
recognize
an
opportunity
to
create
a
major
commerce
brand
in
a
billion
dollar
market
as
well
as
to
be
a
critical
catalyst
in
the
growth
of
one
of
the
fast
grow
consumer
electronics
category
this

through
the
glass
of
my
office
window
giddy
with
excitement
i
d
ask

with
me
and
to
write
down
any
question
from
the
press
on
the
whiteboard
i
kept
in
my
office
the
same
board
we
d
use
to
decide
on
a
name
i
like
to
use
journalist
question
as
a
jumping
off
point
for
longer
more
in
depth
story
even
though
the
begin
of
each
call
be
can
i
want
my
answer
to
be
improvisatory
riff
that
really
get
at
the
heart
of
what
we
be
try
to
do
i
d
weave
in
american
history
pop
culture
and
even
story
from
the
outdoors
but
i
need
an
anchor
a
handhold
to
grab
hence
the
question
on
the
board
and
te
stand
next
to
it
marker
in

like
a
silicon

riff
about
our
business
that
day
i
could
see
it
through
the
window
right
there
in
front

drop
it
in
the
near
mailbox
we
even
pre

at
his
computer
boris
and
vita
be
type
furiously

and
knee
grasp
at
something
underneath
the
server
kho
be
unplug
and
replugging
cord
into
the
wall
and
trace
their

trajectory
up
to
the
ceiling
eventually
christina

into
the

biting
one
of
the

the
san
francisco
chronicle
this
be
a
tremendously
excite
prospect
for
us
for
our
customer
and
most
importantly
for
the
entire
dvd
community
i
set
the
receiver
down
in
the
cradle
that

when

another
problem

have
to
deal
with
now
almost
every
web
company
run
their
business
in
the
cloud
rather
than
the
long
laborious
and
capital
intensive
setup
that
eric
and
kho
have
to
deal
with
now

simply

s
i
didn
t
go
with

but
i
can
imagine
it
even
now
the
two
of
them
rid
sternly
to
the
store
in
the
rusty
pickup

controller
push
a
shopping
cart
directly
to
the
computer
department
then
deal
with
the
same
checkout
person
as
they
discuss
among
themselves
whose
credit
card
to
use
that
clerk
have
probably
see
this
exact
thing
happen
dozen
of
time
with
dozen
of
startup
we
be
in
silicon
valley
after
all
the
site
crashed
all
day
and
because
we
have
no
way
to
measure
site
traffic
yet
we
didn
t
know
how
many
potential
customer
we
be
miss
it
be
a
disaster
but
at
the
same
time
these
be
good
problem
we
have
visitor
to
the
site
we
have
order
come
in
people
be
come
i
found
myself
say
in
amazement
they
re
come
to
the
site
and
they
re
give
us
their
credit
card
information
when
we
d
move
into
the
office
i
d
bought
a
bottle
of
ridge
estate
cabernet
sauvignon
a
california
wine
that
be
about
a
hundred
dollar
more
expensive
than
the
bottle
lorraine
and
i
usually
bought
translation
it
be
i
d
told
everyone
that
we
d
open
it
once
the
website
have
gotten
a
hundred
order
and
take
a
straw
poll
about
when
the
rest
of
the
office
thought
that
would
happen
the
shortest
guess
be
from
suresh
who
be
work
on
inventory
and
order
entry
he
guess
less
than
a
day
i
guess
a
month
or
two
guess
who
be
right
good
call
suresh
i
say
sometime
after
p
m
when
the
hundredth
order
come
in
i
flip
him
a
silver
dollar
which
he
caught
without
even
take
his
eye
off
the
screen
it
s
what
we
d
all
hop
for
of
course
but
it
still
be
astonish
in
the
moment
to
see
it
as
i
watch
the
order
come
in
and
listen
to
the
printer
printing
them
out
i
have
an
enormous
sense
of
relief
our
big
reveal
hadn
t
be
greet
by
an
orchestra
of
cricket
it
be
popular
in
fact
it
be
a
bit
too
popular

he
knew
that
the
dvd
we

travel
first
to
san

we
d
see

fifty
two
he

the
scott
valley
po
with
a
minute
to
spare
if
we
re

ready
by
then
i
can
go
to
the
santa
cruz
post
office
but
it
ll
take
me
twenty
minute
to
get
there
and
who
know
if
there
will
be
parking
so
i
d
have
to
leave
at
three
thirty
to
be
safe
i
knew
that
jim
be
just
think
out
loud
he
d
driven
to
the
post
office
a
half
dozen
time
in
the
week
before
the
launch
try
to
find
the
quick
route
once
he
be
there
he
d
familiarize
himself
with
the
parking
lot
and
the
drop
off
location
in
an
extreme
gesture
of
optimism
he
have
even
put
a
handcart
in
the
back
of
his
pickup
that
he
could
use
to
wheel
up
box
if
the
order
be
too
heavy
to
carry
he
d
already
scout
out
where
the
handicap
ramp
be
in
case
he
need
to
use
them
you
do
whatever
you
think
be
best
i
say
but
it
would
be
kind
of
nice
to
use
the
hometown
po
for
the
first
run
wouldn
t
it
jim
nod
we
d
step
into
the
vault
by
then
and
two
of
jim
s
team
be
busy
flip
through
the
hang
disc
search
for
movie
to
fulfill
recently
place
order
i
picked
up
an
order
slip
from
the
table
near
the
door
and
join
them
search
the
alphabetize
wall
for
a
dvd
copy
of
heat
i
walk
past
it
several
time
before
i
saw
it
i
bumped
into
jim
s
worker
at
least
twice
you
re
hopeless
marc
jim
say
grab
the
dvd
from
me
and
expertly
shove
it
into
a
mailer
he
affixed
an
address
label
with
finesse
and
expertly
seal
the
flap
now
get
out
of
here
we
ve
get
forty
five
order
more
to
fill
before
the
post
office
close
the
clock
on
the
wall
of
the
safe
read
it
be
stressful
until
when
jim
left
for
the
post
office
then
the
whole
office
relaxed
the
day
s
deadline
have
pass
now
it
be
just
time
to
figure
out
how
to
make
thing
work
well
the
next
day
we
d
expect
or
people
to
use
the
site
to
order
a
dvd
we
d
gotten
and
potentially
we
d
gotten
more
than
that
since
we
didn
t
know
how
many
people
have
try
to
access
the
site
when
it
be
down
it
be
an
enormously
promising
start
but
that
s
all
it
be
a
start
there
be
hundred
no
thousand
of
change
we
still
need
to
make
do
we
open
the
bottle
of
wine
we
didn
t
have
a
corkscrew
so
i
have
to
push
the
cork
into
the
bottle
use
a
ballpoint
pen
then
decant
into
an
empty
liter
bottle
that
use
to
hold
diet
coke
and
we
have
to
use
red
solo
cup
instead
of
wineglass
but
we
open
that
bottle
and
all
share
a
brief
toast
in
the
conference
room
i
look
for
reed
but
didn
t
see
him
he
d
slip
out
sometime
in
the
afternoon
to
beginning
i
say
to
the
work
ahead
and
there
be
a
lot
of
it
we
need
to
automate
confirmation
email
there
be
dozen
of
problem
with
the
online
order
form
which
it
turn
out
be
fine
at
catch
bad
state
code
not
so
good
at
validate
zip
code
and
clueless
for
international
order
who
knew
people
would
try
to
order
from
other
country
we
still
need
an
algorithm
that
would
ensure
that
high
demand
title
be
always
in
stock
and
figure
out
how
to
steer
customer
to
low
demand
title
in
a
way
that
make
them
actually
want
to
rent
them
there
be
thousand
of
puzzle
to
solve
and
we
all
knew
that
we
d
spend
month
solve
them
so
after
the
toast
we
all
crumple
our
solo
cup
into
the
recycle
bin
and
get
back
to
work
around
six
or
so
someone
order
pizza
i
left
around
ten
the
engineer
would
probably
be
in
the
office
all
night
work
to
ensure
that
the
next
day
s
traffic
wouldn
t
crash
the
site
and
of
course
the
site
didn
t
shut
down
overnight
you
couldn
t
just
turn
the
neon
sign
off
and
get
back
to
work
in
the
morning
all
of
us
realize
then
that
our
work
with
netflix
be
enter
an
entirely
new
stage
that
night
i
sat
again
at
the
table
in
my
unfinished
kitchen
the
kid
be
asleep
and
so
be
lorraine
i
be
still
antsy
high
on
the
adrenaline
of
the
day
when
i
m
like
that
there
s
no
point
in
try
to
sleep
so
i
pull
out
my
notebook
and
start
write
down
a
list
of
all
the
thing
we
need
to
work
on
site
redundancy
how
do
we
gracefully
recover
from
crash
when
a
server
go
down
get
well
pack
slip
peel
off
label
keep
come
off
in
the
printer
more
inventory
how
many
be
too
enough
how
many
be
too
many
need
metric
get
suresh
to
report
on
today
s
order
by
source
and
title
what
else
as
i
thought
of
possible
solution
i
idly
line
up
a
few
slat
of
wood
we
d
left
on
the
table
they
be
year
old
piece
of
redwood
that
we
have
reclaim
from
some
of
the
house
s
original
floor
and
lorraine
have
be
think
of
use
them
as
shelve
i
lift
one
felt
its
heft
the
line
of
the
wood
grain
i
try
to
imagine
it
on
the
wall
behind
me
which
be
cover
in
paint
sample
for
the
eventual
renovation
i
could
almost
see
it
we
be
still
building
our
kitchen
even
as
we
live
around
it
just
like
netflix
i
thought
we
d
built
it
but
it
wasn
t
finish
yet
it
would
probably
never
be
finish
truthfully
every
day
we
d
have
to
work
to
keep
it
upright
to
keep
the
water
flow
to
keep
the
cabinet
fill
to
keep
the
burner
clean
and
the
gas
bill
paid
but
it
be
there
now
it
be
out
in
the
world
year
ago
on
a
climb
trip
i
be
hike
across
a
snow
plain
just
below
the
summit
of
a
mountain
when
i
felt
a
peculiar
static
buzzing
around
my
head
my
hair
stood
on
end
and
around
my
helmet
there
be
an
ultraviolet
glow
it
be
saint
elmo
s
fire
a
positively
charge
electromagnetic
field
that
be
about
to
discharge
itself
to
earth
it
be
lightning
just
before
the
strike
that
s
how
netflix
have
felt
all
that
spring
a
blue
haze
buzzing
around
all
of
our
head
but
start
on
april
netflix
wasn
t
just
potential
energy
anymore
it
be
a
live
current
positive
meeting
negative
it
be
a
lightning
strike
and
now
we
have
to
figure
out
how
to
manage
it

a
day
in
the
post
launch
life
summer
eight

short
clear
and
easy
to

the

how
many

that
sort
of
thing
this
morning
s

which
i
scan
with
one
eye
the
other
train
on

s
slowly
empty
bowl
contain
good
and
bad
news
the
good
be
in
the

column
sale
be
up
percent
over
may
our
first
full
month
in
business
monthly
revenue
have
just
pass
for
the
month
of
june
with
twelve
month
in
a
row
like
that
we
ll
hit
one
of
those
magic
startup
number
a
million
dollar
of
annual
revenue
i
make
a
note
to
myself
to
bring
that
up
at
our
company
meeting
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
bad
news
be
one
column
over
rental
revenue
i
wince
when
i
see
that
it
be
still
in
the
four
digit
and
that
the
first
digit
be
a
we
have
in
dvd
sale
barely
in
dvd
rental
shit
i
murmur
to
myself
hunter
look
up
at
me
for
a
moment
then
go
back
to
his
cereal
oblivious
to
anything
that
isn
t
a
banana
i
pour
a
second
cup
of
coffee
and
ponder
the
number
one
reason
for
the
great
disparity
between
sale
and
rental
revenue
be
pricing
customer
pay
for
a
dvd
but
only
for
a
rental
we
make
six
time
as
much
sell
a
dvd
as
we
do
rent
it
once
of
course
you
can
only
sell
a
dvd
one
time
you
can
rent
it
hundred
of
time
the
problem
be
no
one
be
rent
from
us
and
when
we
be
able
to
convince
someone
to
rent
a
dvd
they
almost
never
come
back
for
a
second
one
i
methodically
lay
out
bread
peanut
butter
and
marshmallow
fluff
and
construct
sandwich
for
logan
and
morgan
they
love
it
when
i
make
their
lunch
because
unlike
lorraine
i
let
them
eat
garbage
i
just
have
to
balance
it
out
with
something
healthy
hence
the
carrot
i
m
slice
my
mind
a
million
mile
away
now
pull
up
mental
image
of
each
of
our
current
round
of
promotion
imagine
how
i
might
be
able
to
tweak
the
word
the
graphic
or
the
offer
itself
to
make
a
difference
to
make
people
rent
i
barely
even
notice
when
lorraine
glide
into
the
kitchen
an
efficient
hurry
of
noise
and
activity
she
herd
logan
and
morgan
already
dress
and
ready
for
the
day
ahead
of
her
and
to
their
place
at
the
table
simultaneously
dish
out
cereal
and
yogurt
shove
the
lunch
i
ve
make
into
lunchboxes
squeeze
hunter

a

round
up
soccer
shin

then
seemingly
within

she

the

door
strap
them
into
their

because
i
ve
forgotten
where
exactly
i
drop
off
my
new
medium
outfit
let
me
explain
to
understand
the
new
medium
outfit
you
need
some
background
on
one
of
the
big
issue
we
face
as
a
young
company
essentially
it
s
a
version
of
the
chicken
and
the
egg
how
can
we
market
a
dvd
rental
service
to
people
if
hardly
anyone
own
a
dvd
player
in
direct
marketing
if
you
re
try
to
reach
a
group
of
people
you
contact
a
list
broker
and
rent
a
list
give
me
two
million
dvd
owner
address
you
might
say
and
then
you
do
a
mail
to
that
list
but
in
the
case
of
a
brand
new
technology
there
be
no
list
yet
because
there
be
hardly
any
dvd
player
the
big
consumer
electronics
company
that
make
dvd
player
be
in
the
same
boat
as
we
be
but
they
re
row
in
the
opposite
direction
it
s
hard
to
convince
people
to
buy
a
dvd
player
when
there
be
hardly
any
dvd
back
in
january
i
d
sense
an
opportunity
we
need
a
way
to
reach
people
who
own
dvd
player
the
manufacturer
need
a
way
for
their
new
customer
to
access
dvd
what
if
we
could
come
up
with
a
promotion
that
would
link
our
interest
in
january
i
d
flown
to
vega
for
the
consumer
electronics
show
at
that
time
the
large
trade
show
in
the
world
it
make
vsda
which
to
me
have
seem
like
an
acid
trip
look
like
sunday
school
every
major
consumer
electronics
company
be
there
they
rent
out
entire
hotel
to

their

buckle
up
it
be
a
true
east
meet
west
moment
not
just
because
most
of
the
company
be
headquarter
in
asia
or
because
their
american
office
be
all
on
the
east
coast
in
suburban
office
park
in
new
jersey
it

employee
at

they
park
their

ridge
and
enter
drab
sterile
building
with
thousand
of
other
people
they
obeyed
a
rigid
hierarchy
in
which
each
employee
have
clearly
delineate
responsibility
and
task
to
accomplish
they
answer
to
their
superior
along
vast
and
complex
chain
of
command
they
work
from
nine
to
five
every
day
and
get
paid
overtime
if
they
stayed
late
once
a
month
they
come
to
work
in
khaki
and
polo
for
casual
friday
but
only
once
a
month
in
other
word
the
ethos
of
a
consumer
electronics
company
be
about
as
far
from
the
startup
mentality
as
possible
that
be
understandable
though
consumer
electronics
company
be
sell

with
an
incredibly
long
lead
time
from
research
and
development
to
packaging
to

to
shipping
it
take
year
to
roll
out
a
new
tv
vcr

there
be
quite
literally
hundred
of
thousand
of
tiny
decision
that
have
to
be
make
and
they
all
have
to

these
decision
across
a

ten

we
have
one

thousand
a
major
challenge
that
the

be
how
to
standardize
the
technology
behind
the
dvd

like
storage
space
dimension
and
user
face
function
be
still
different
from

to
prevent
a

from
the

an

be
there
for
it
the

not

auspicious
in

to
the
gaudy
display
of
the
rest
of
the

there
be
just
a
small

about
the

to
collaborate
with
each
other
circle
with
tiny
plate
of
cheese
i
be
angle
to
meet
three
people
mike
fidler
from
sony
steve
nickerson
from
toshiba
and
rusty
osterstock
from
panasonic
between
the
three
they
control
roughly
percent
of
the
dvd
player
market
i
knew
that
if
i
want
to
cut
any
sort
of
deal
i
d
have
to
get
my
foot
in
the
door
with
one
of
them
easy
say
than
do
after
all
i
ran
a
seventeen
person
startup
that
hadn
t
even
launch
yet
nickerson
fidler
and
osterstock
work
for
corporation
so
large
they
need
their
own
phone
book
i
be
a
gnat
they
be
elephant
whose
tail
i
want
to
ride
still
i
be
confident
for
one
thing
i
be
wear
the
aforementioned
new
medium
outfit
i
d
bought
it
for
ibms
important
business
meeting
outside
silicon
valley
for
time
when
i
need
to
wear
something
nicer
than
jean
and
sneaker
i
thought
it
be
important
to
never
be
see
wear
a
tie
and
to
also
look
like
i
could
navigate
entertainment
circle
to
that
end
i
d
bought
a
pair
of
greenish
khaki
pant
a
blazer
with
a
fluorescent
glow
and
a
shirt
with
a
subtle
geometric
print
that
a
salesperson
told
me
be
moir
it
be
absolutely
hideous
when
lorraine
saw
me
try
it
on
for
the
first
time
she
couldn
t
stop
laugh
you
look
like
a
chameleon
she
say
in
a
way
that
s
exactly
what
i
be
i
need
to
be
able
to
adapt
to
a
number
of
different
environment
medium
consumer
electronics
tech
wear
the
new
medium
outfit
or
nmo
as
i
sometimes
call
it
give
me
a
way
to
blend
in
with
company
and
entity
far
large
and
more
powerful
than
my
own
that
afternoon
i
sweat
through
my
nmo
many
time
over
i
give
every
one
of
the
manufacturer
the
same
pitch
what
if
i
could
in
one
fell
swoop
eliminate
their
big
obstacle
to
sell
more
dvd
player
what
if
they
could
assure
every
one
of
their
customer
that
if
they
bought
a
dvd
player
they
would
have
immediate
access
to
every
dvd
available
and
then
the
real
heart
of
the
pitch
what
if
every
new
player
they
sell
come
with
a
coupon
offering
three
free
netflix
rental
chicken
egg
simultaneous
we
d
get
traffic
to
our
site
and
they
d
help
grow
the
dvd
user
base
sound
good
doesn
t
it
i
get
polite
demurral
from
all
three
this
sound
interest
mike
fidler
say
he
be
a
california

mike
work
for
sony
the
industry
leader
he
told
me
it
would
be

he
knew
all
the
major

be
as
at

here
as
he
have
be
at

over
the
next
four
hour
as
i
nervously

out
my

and
make
copious
eye
contact
all
the
while
brainstorming
way
to

studio
head
major

on

the

here
didn
t
look
that
much
different
from
their
counterpart
at
ce
if
it
weren
t
for
the
scantily
clad
woman
flock
to
mitch
i
would
have
thought
we
be
still
back
with
the
suit
at
sony
you
know
everybody
i
say
a
couple
of
hour
later
as
we
head
back
to
our
hotel
my
dvd
backpack
have
a
couple
of
new
title
in
it
mitch
just
grin
pay
to
have
friend
in
high
place
he
say
as
january
turn
to
february
and
then
march
i
hadn
t
heard
anything
from
fidler
or
osterstock
and
to
be
honest
i
wasn
t
all
that
surprised
it
be
a
hard
ask
for
them
company
like
sony
and
panasonic
have
year
long
product
development
timeline
to
put
a
sticker
or
a
coupon
into
one
of
their
box
would
require
month
of
negotiation
with
dozen
of
different
project
leader
go
by
the
normal
process
to
have
any
chance
of
get
our
coupon
into
a
sony
dvd
box
you
d
need
to
start
about
a
year
ahead
of
time
to
jump
into
the
middle
of
a
new
release
as
i
be
hop
you
d
have
to
really
stick
your
neck
out
it
be
a
big
risk
for
them
and
ce
company
didn
t
usually
reward
risk
i
still
don
t
really
know
why
steve
nickerson
call
me
i
think
it
be
because
he
saw
even
in
the
risk
averse
field
he
work
in
an
opportunity
for
a
big
risk
to
have
big
reward
yes
it
would
be
a
nightmare
to
navigate
the
chain
of
decision
sure
if
it
backfire
his
job
might
be
in
danger
but
if
a
promotion
with
a
new
company
call
netflix
help
him
connect
with
dvd
customer
it
could
grow
the
base
for
a
new
fledgling
technology
plus
nickerson
work
for
toshiba
the
perpetual
second
banana
in
the
ce
world
sony
be
the
undisputed
king
they
didn
t
need
to
take
risk
but
for
a
company
like
toshiba
always
vie
for
market
share
a
risk
or
innovation
could
help
set
the
company
apart
whatever
his
reason
i
m
eternally
thankful
to
steve
nickerson
for
take
the
plunge
in
my
estimation
he
s
one
of
the
single
most
important
player
in
the
netflix
story
without
his
help
there
be
absolutely
no
way
the
company
would
have
succeed
i
d
flown
up
to
new
jersey
the
nmo
in
tow
and
over
the
course
of
a
few
day
in
april
steve
and
i
have
settle
on
a
deal
in
every
dvd
player
toshiba
sell
they
d
allow
us
to
include
a
small
promotional
flyer
offering
three
free
dvd
rental
through
our
site
all
a
customer
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
visit
netflix
com
and
enter
their
dvd
player
s
serial
number
and
they
d
have
three
free
dvd
rental
it
be
a
win
win
we
get
direct
access
to
dvd
player
owner
at
precisely
the
moment
when
they
need
us
most
and
toshiba
solve
its
big
problem
convincing
reluctant
buyer
that
they
d
actually
be
able
to
find
something
to
play
on
their
new
machine
the
promotion
be
advertised
right
there
on
the
outside
of
the
box
free
rental
with
purchase
but
it
be
more
than
a
win
win
it
be
a
revelation
you
see
a
startup
be
a
lonely
place
you
be
work
on
something
that
no
one
believe
in
that
you
ve
be
told
time
and
time
again
will
never
work
it
s
you
against
the
world
but
the
reality
be
that
you
can
t
really
do
it
on
your
own
you
need
to
enlist
help
bring
others
around
to
your
way
of
think
let
them
share
in
your
enthusiasm
give
them
the
magic
glass
that
will
let
them
see
your
vision
of
the
future
steve
nickerson
have
glimpse
and
believe
and
it
be
already
pay
off
within
day
we
d
see
an
immediate
uptick
in
traffic
and
we
knew
where
it
be
come
from
corey
use
his
moniker
damon
matthew
have
be
listen
to
the
chatter
on
the
toshiba
message
board
and
it
seem
like
our
promotion
be
resonate
with
their
customer
base
so
why
once
they
use
their
three
free
rental
weren
t
they
come
back
a
m
after
make
a
few
small
change
to
our
agreement
with
toshiba
minor
stuff
i
call
michael
dubelko
from
dvd
express
i
ve
spent
countless
hour
try
to
convince
him
that
we
can
help
each
other
it
just
doesn
t
make
sense
marc
he
say
we
sell
dvd
too
why
would
we
partner
with
a
competitor
we
just
need
you
to
push
rental
i
say
different
ball
game
how
the
conversation
doesn
t
really
go
anywhere
it
often
doesn
t
site
that
sell
dvd
don
t
really
want
to
do
business
with
a
site
that
could
chip
away
at
their
market
share
i
understand
i
tell
him
but
i
know
it
s
possible
as
i
hang
up
the
phone
with
mike
i
think
about
steve
sickle
administrator
of
dvd
daily
one
of
the
large
dvd
site
whom
i
d
convince
to
do
a
deal
with
us
over
raw
yellowtail
at
nobu
in
new
york
city
every
mention
of
a
movie
on
his
site
would
now
be
a
link
to
netflix
i
think
about
bill
hunt
of
digital
bit
who
in
a
hallway
of
the
game
industry
trade
show
in
atlanta
have
agree
to
pump
our
service
in
his
editorial
provide
we
give
him
an
online
shout
out
now
and
then
maybe
the
key
be
meeting
in
person
i
m
lean
back
in
my
chair
brainstorming
new
place
to
wear
the
nmo
i
ve
just
tracked
it
down
to
mission
dry
cleaner
in
santa
cruz
when
eric
pop
his
head
in
you
almost
ready
i
ve
get
ishaan
and
dev
out
front
they
re
ready
to
go
but
they
re
both
really
nervous
nervous
why
be
i
really
that
intimidate
eric
shrug
and
tilt
his
palm
up
not
to
me
he
say
but
those
guy
be
freak
out
about
everything
here
they
don
t
know
what
to
expect
from
lunch
with
the
ceo
nearly
a
year
after
reed
and
i
have
mail
that
patsy
cline
cd
the
company
be
grow
beyond
its
found
team
when
it
come
to
hire
i
m
not
just
hit
my
own
rolodex
anymore
which
mean
new
face
to
ensure
that
we
remain
a
tight
knit
group
i
ve
institute
the
monthly
ritual
of
take
all
new
employee
out
to
lunch
this
serf
a
number
of
purpose
at
a
minimum
it
s
a
chance
to
get
to
know
everybody
i
m
present
for
nearly
all
of
our
job
interview
but
it
s
hard
to
get
past
someone
s
nerve
and
ambition
in
an
interview
set
and
a
lunch
allows
me
to
see
past
all
that
more
importantly
though
lunch
be
a
chance
to
start
imprint
culture
to
explain
the
most
important
aspect
of
work
at
netflix
what
we
expect
of
people
and
what
they
can
expect
of
us
in
today
s
lunch
though
culture
be
go
to
take
on
a
different
meaning
that
s
because
i
ll
be
eat
with
two
of
our
new
engineer
two
month
in
hire
engineer
be
shape
up
to
be
a
big
problem
than
we
d
imagine
in
silicon
valley
the
fight
for
engineer
be
always
intense
with
hundred
of
company
compete
for
top
talent
i
have
some
experience
in
the
recruitment
fight
and
over
time
have
recognize
a
key
truth
for
most
engineer
it
s
not
about
the
money
that
s
a
good
thing
for
netflix
since
our
pile
of
chip
be
quite
a
bit
small
than
the
more
establish
company
most
engineer
can
choose
where
they
want
to
work
and
the
way
they
make
their
decision
boil
down
to
two
question
do
i
respect
the
people
i
m
work
for
will
i
be
give
interest
problem
to
solve
we
have
an
answer
for
question
eric
meyer
a
certify
genius
who
command
respect
and
if
you
ask
me
the
answer
to
question
be
a
resound
yes
pre
launch
i
d
also
count
on
another
recruiting
advantage
location
about
people
per
day
commute
from
santa
cruz
over
the
hill
to
tech
job
in
silicon
valley
probably
of
them
hate
it
and
i
can
t
imagine
what
those
other
three
be
think
i
d
assume
that
there
would
be
plenty
of
local
engineer
so
fed
up
with
their
commute
that
they
would
jump
at
the
chance
to
take
a
job
closer
to
home
i
d
be
so
confident
about
it
that
i
d
run
pre
movie
advertisement
help
want
in
the
scott
valley
movie
theater
but
i
d
make
a
deep
miscalculation
i
have
assume
that
we
would
need
a
lot
of
front
end
engineer
people
with
the
skill
to
build
web
page
design
for
e
commerce
but
it
turn
out
that
what
we
really
need
be
help
with
back
end
problem
process
have
to
do
with
order
processing
inventory
management
analytics
and
financial
transaction
and
if
you
want
engineer
for
that
kind
of
work
no
amount
of
pre
movie
advertising
in
scott
valley
will
do
the
trick
most
of
the
good
back
end
engineer
live
near
san
francisco
and
despite
eric
s
reputation
and
my
power
of
persuasion
it
be
virtually
impossible
to
convince
someone
to
drive
mile
each
way
to
work
eric
have
come
up
with
a
solution
though
forget
engineer
from
mile
away
how
about
engineer
from
mile
away
turn
out
there
s
a
large
population
of
recently
arrive
indian
engineer
in
silicon
valley
look
for
work
and
eager
to
join
a
fledgling
startup
with
suresh
s
help
eric
have
hit
the
cultural
center
and
cricket
field
of
silicon
valley
recruiting
talented
immigrant
programmer
like
dev
and
ishaan
who
be
wait
for
me
now
as
i
rush
out
to
say
hello
i
m
already
think
about
what
i
can
say
to
make
them
more
comfortable
in
their
new
life
how
i
can
ease
the
transition
to
the
united
state
and
how
i
can
ensure
that
their
job
be
reward
and
what
i
m
go
to
order
at
zanotto
s
the
italian
restaurant
across
the
street
p
m
when
i
get
back
from
lunch
i
see
that
lorraine
have
call
to
check
in
i
m
not
look
forward
to
talk
to
her
because
i
m
pretty
sure
i
know
what
s
come
financial
worry
morgan
be
get
ready
to
start
kindergarten
in
the
fall
and
we
be
planning
on
have
her
join
logan
at
the
private
school
down
by
the
water
in
santa
cruz
and
kindergarten
at
a
private
school
be
much
more
expensive
than
preschool
how
be
we
ever
go
to
afford
this
lorraine
start
in
when
i
finally
reach
her
in
the
background
i
can
hear
kid
and
what
sound
like
seagull
be
you
at
the
beach
i
m
with
a
bunch
of
logan
s
school
friend
i
know
morgan
s
really
excite
about
go
to
gateway
but
i
think
we
re
make
a
big
mistake
she
pause
and
i
hear
the
crash
of
a
wave
follow
by
a
child
s
delighted
squeal
we
should
sell
the
house
she
say
this
be
a
common
refrain
almost
as
common
as
a
reminder
that
montana
and
my
dream
life
as
a
postman
beckons
should
everything
go
south
with
netflix
it
have
gotten
more
frequent
lately
it
be
as
close
to
an
argument
as
we
usually
get
we
re
go
to
be
fine
i
remind
her
through
the
glass
i
can
see
dev
and
ishaan
rip
open
box
contain
brand
new
gateway
eric
be
watch
them
a
smile
on
his
face
i
just
want
you
to
be
realistic
she
say
we
can
do
without
a
lot
of
stuff
maybe
we
should
think
about
cut
back
more
we
re
make
great
progress
here
i
tell
her
as
of
today
we
re
officially
a
million
dollar
company
i
don
t
tell
her
that
we
re
a
project
million
dollar
company
or
mention
how
concerned
i
be
about
where
that
money
be
come
from
i
just
say
we
can
talk
more
about
it
at
dinner
as
usual
i
ll
be
there
p
m
be
you
off
the
phone
without
wait
for
an
answer
te
swoosh
into
my
office
as
always
she
know
the
answer
to
her
question
before
she
even
asks
it
we
re
try
to
finalize
the
press
announcement
for
the
sony
promotion
she
pause
push
her
lip
together
in
an
exaggerated
pout
it
s
go
to
be
almost
impossible
to
get
them
to
approve
our
release
sony
hadn
t
really
give
me
the
time
of
day
when
i
first
approach
them
about
a
coupon
deal
but
once
they
d
see
that
we
be
work
with
toshiba
they
felt
like
they
have
to
keep
up
with
the
jones
you
see
this
all
the
time
in
business
and
in
sport
a
young
upstart
try
something
new
and
when
it
work
the
industry
leader
co
opts
why
because
they
can
plus
their
own
promotion
bundling
a
free
copy
of
james
taylor
in
concert
with
every
dvd
player
hadn
t
really
move
the
needle
james
taylor
be
a
sony
artist
so
it
have
cost
them
almost
nothing
but
they
should
have
know
well
it
s
a
full
twenty
year
after
fire
and
rain
sweet
baby
james
isn
t
really
all
that
entice
to
tech
geek
te
spread
a
sheaf
of
paper
out
across
my
conference
table
look
at
this
mess
she
say
shake
her
head
so
hard
that
i
get
a
whiff
of
hairspray
i
don
t
know
how
they
ever
get
anything
do
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
anyone
with
the
power
to
make
decision
i
m
start
to
think
we
should
just
say
screw
it
and
announce
whether
they
approve
the
release
or
not
that
s
a
terrible
idea
i
say
come
around
from
behind
my
desk
and
bending
over
the
page
i
ve
spent
week
try
to
get
them
comfortable
trust
a
startup
if
we
go
wild
west
on
them
now
it
ll
screw
everything
up
but
she
isn
t
lie
about
their
nit
pick
the
draft
of
the
announcement
be
spatter
with
revision
and
cross
out
what
be
they
have
a
problem
with
now
everything
te
throw
up
her
hand
then
grab
the
release
and
stab
at
it
with
her
bright
red
pen
everything
we
bring
up
the
growth
of
the
dvd
market
the
number
of
movie
come
out
even
how
excite
we
be
blah
blah
blah
everything
need
to
go
through
about
six
layer
of
approval
and
that
s
not
even
talk
about
legal
i
ll
call
mike
i
answer
but
i
m
not
optimistic
mike
fidler
be
famous
for
deliver
the
smile
screw
ask
you
for
a
deal
point
that
will
be
brutal
expensive
and
difficult
all
with
a
big
smile
on
his
face
that
s
exactly
what
he
do
to
me
three
week
ago
he
d
caught
wind
that
toshiba
be
interested
he
say
and
he
thought
we
could
work
together
too
but
he
didn
t
want
three
free
dvd
rental
he
want
ten
and
that
wasn
t
all
in
addition
to
the
free
rental
he
also
want
five
totally
free
dvd
this
have
be
an
enormously
expensive
proposition
for
us
five
free
dvd
from
our
library
be
essentially
a
hundred
dollar
so
under
the
term
of
his
deal
we
be
basically
pay
sony
a
hundred
buck
just
for
one
person
who
own
a
dvd
player
to
visit
our
site
and
that
be
on
top
of
the
cost
of
fulfil
the
five
free
rental
bad
of
all
i
d
promise
exclusivity
to
toshiba
but
the
opportunity
to
work
with
sony
the
large
player
in
the
game
have
be
too
good
to
pas
up
it
be
worth
it
i
d
give
mike
what
he
want
push
him
now
might
piss
him
off
but
call
mike
to
argue
about
the
language
of
the
press
release
would
be
a
lot
easy
than
call
steve
nickerson
tail
between
my
leg
to
admit
that
i
d
be
cheat
on
toshiba
with
its
hot
old
sister
now
that
be
a
call
i
m
dread
make
give
me
twenty
minute
i
say
to
te
let
s
see
if
i
m
any
good
at
the
smile
screw
p
m
crisis
avert
no
hard
feeling
just
promise
from
mike
we
ll
try
to
be
a
little
speedier
a
little
more
proactive
he
say
to
me
we
re
be
careful
on
this
because
we
think
it
can
really
work
music
to
my
ear
now
i
just
have
to
figure
out
some
way
to
get
people
to
rent
when
it
isn
t
free
it
s
take
all
day
but
i
finally
have
a
moment
to
pull
up
the
data
from
the
morning
and
begin
dig
turn
out
it
s
even
bad
than
i
thought
we
aren
t
just
stagnate
we
re
lose
ground
don
t
get
me
wrong
it
s
great
that
we
re
do
so
much
business
two
month
in
the
come
in
every
month
from
dvd
sale
not
only
pay
a
few
of
our
bill
it
demonstrates
to
our
supplier
and
partner
that
we
re
real
it
give
eric
and
his
team
a
chance
to
stress
test
the
site
under
the
load
of
real
customer
not
projection
it
give
our
operation
team
the
thrill
of
see
real
package
go
out
the
door
each
day
it
give
the
entire
company
a
sense
of
momentum
but
it
s
a
sugar
high
right
now
we
re
the
only
game
in
town
but
it
won
t
be
long
before
amazon
expands
into
sell
dvd
and
after
amazon
there
will
be
border
then
walmart
and
then
virtually
every
other
store
online
or
brick
and
mortar
in
america
when
you
get
down
to
it
sell
dvd
be
a
commodity
business
look
at
the
figure
i
know
that
once
everyone
be
sell
the
exact
same
thing
pretty
much
exactly
the
same
way
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
time
before
our
margin
shrink
to
nothing
it
might
not
happen
next
week
next
month
or
even
next
year
but
it
be
inevitable
and
when
it
happens
we
ll
be
toast
dvd
rental
on
the
other
hand
have
real
potential
it
s
hard
to
find
place
to
rent
dvd
in
person
much
less
online
and
it
might
be
a
while
before
that
change
as
we
ve
found
out
the
hard
way
rent
dvd
online
be
operationally
difficult
which
mean
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
potential
competitor
to
figure
it
out
we
have
at
least
a
year
s
head
start
plus
the
margin
be
high
since
you
can
rent
the
same
disc
dozen
of
time
the
monitor
show
that
we
re
sell
a
lot
of
dvd
we
just
can
t
convince
anyone
to
rent
from
us
and
do
both
rental
and
sale
at
the
same
time
be
really
hard
it
s
complicate
for
our
inventory
there
be
some
title
that
legally
we
can
both
rent
and
sell
but
others
we
can
only
rent
or
only
sell
our
warehouse
and
shipping
procedure
have
to
accommodate
some
movie
that
go
out
and
come
back
while
others
go
out
and
stay
out
offering
both
dvd
sale
and
rental
be
confuse
for
our
customer
who
arrive
at
netflix
com
unsure

be
that
if
you
have
to
explain
something
you
ve
already
lose
the

cumbersome
too
everything
be
harder

it

to
be
i
think
lean
back
in
my
chair
we
have
to
focus
but
on
what
should
we
focus
on
sell
dvd
which
be
bring
in
percent
of
our
revenue
but
will
slowly
inevitably
evaporate
as
competitor
crowd
the
field
or
should
we
throw
our
limited
resource
behind
rent
dvd
which
if
we
can
make
it
work
could
be
a
hugely
profitable
business
but
at
this
point
be
show
absolutely
no
sign
of
life
there
s
no
easy
answer
p
m
as
i
pull
into
the

i
can
already

the
murmur
of

by
my

something
funny
about

it

postage
stamp
that
s
what
you
need
for
a
one
ounce
letter
in
that
s
what
we
d
be
aim
for
when
we
design
our
mailer
but
jim
s
late
analysis
show
that
only
a
handful
of
the
previous
month
s
rental
have
make
the
one
ounce
cutoff
bad
more
than
half
of

jim
explains
pull
another
page
from
his

look
at
our
packaging
cost
my
eye
scan
the
number
we
be
wildly
over
budget
our
original
test
that
patsy
cline
cd
stuffed
into
a
greet
card
envelope
have
be
the
guide
force
behind
our
budget
but
it
be
clear
now
that
as
we
move
from
concept
to
scale
it
have
be
a
gross
oversimplification
although
i
m
upset
i
m
not
entirely
surprised
the
second
your
dream
becomes
a
reality
thing
get
complicate
you
simply
can
t
know
how
thing
be
go
to
behave
until
you
ve
actually
try
them
go
ahead
and
write
up
a
plan
but
don
t
put
too
much
faith
in
it
the
only
real
way
to
find
something
out
be
to
do
it
we
d
be
lucky
that
the
cd
have
arrive
unscathed
at
reed
s
house
but
when
you
ship
thousand
of
dvd
across
the
country
you
can
t
rely
on
luck
to
protect
the
dvd
from
scratch
fingerprint
and
other
general
abuse
the
disc
need
to
be
in
some
sort
of
sleeve
the
plastic
sleeve
we
ve
decide
on
be
sturdy
reusable
and
transparent
but
it
be
also
expensive
and
heavy
and
it
have
gotten
even
heavier
and
more
expensive
with
the
addition
of
a
paper
label
for
the
movie
info
and
unique
serial
number
the
mail
envelope
have
evolve
from
a
simple
pink
greet
card
envelope
into
a
total
chimera
make
up
of
disparate
part
and
scrap
we

move
from

to
heavy
cardboard

jim
give
me
a
sheepish
grin

one
more

make
up

if
i
cupped
my

i

wonder
if

she
didn
t
say
why
she
want
to
meet
but
she
didn
t
need
to
it
be
obvious
although
amazon
be
only
a
few
year
old
and
still
strictly
a
place
to
buy
book
bezos
have
decide
early
in

his
site
wouldn
t
just
be
a

it

go
to

we

that
music

go

target
although
it
be
unlikely
that
jeff
would
be
interested
or
foolish
enough
to
rent
dvd
it
be
clear
that
he
be
soon
go
to
start
sell
them

once
that
happen
we
d
be
out

we
d
also
heard
from
our
vc
connection
that
bezos
plan
to
use
a
good
chunk
of
the
million
raise
during
his
company
s
ipo
to
finance
an
aggressive
acquisition
of
small
company
that
s
normal
most
company
look
to
enter
a
new
business
arena
do
what
s
call
a
make
or
buy
analysis
in
which
they
consider
the
cost
timing
and
difficulty
of
start
a
new
business
from
scratch
then
evaluate
whether
it
would
be
cheaper
faster
and
well
to
simply
buy
another
company
that
s
already
do
it
with
that
in
mind
it
didn
t
take
us
long
to
figure
out
why
jeff
and
joy
want
to
meet
netflix
be
in
play
i
d
be
lie
if
i
say
that
the
feel
although
thrill
wasn
t
also
a
little
bittersweet
in
the
summer
of
we
d
finally
gotten
the
engine
to
turn
over
and
we
be
just
start
to
pick
up
some
speed
i
wasn
t
quite
ready
to
put
it
in
park
and
hand
over
the
key
but
when
amazon
call
you
pick
up
the
phone
even
if
it
s
and
amazon
be
nowhere
near
the
powerhouse
it
be
today
the
building
we
be
wind
our
way
through
certainly
didn
t
look
like
it
belong
to
a
powerhouse
the
stair
to
the
second
floor
be
warp
and
creaky
the
reception
area
be
clutter
and
dusty

push
into
the
corner

over

us
back
into
the
warren
of
cubicle
that
make
up
the
amazon
office
it
be
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
this
be
the

the
carpeting

and

it
make
the
green
carpeting
and
beach
chair
of
the
netflix
office
seem
like
the
executive
suite
at
ibm
we
could
hear
jeff
bezos
before
we
saw
him
he
huh
huh
huh
huh
jeff
have
a
distinctive
laugh
if
you
ve
see
any
video
of
him
speak
you
ll
have
heard
a
version
of
it
but
not
the
true
untamed
thing
in
the
same
way
that
he
s
definitely
hire
a
personal
trainer
since
the
late
ninety
i
think
he
s
also
work
with
someone
to
tame
his
laugh
now
it
s
polite
a
little
giggly
but
back
then
it
be
explosive
loud
hiccup
he
laugh
the
way
that
barney
rubble
laugh
on
the
flintstone
he
be
in
his
office
just
hang
up
the
phone
when
we
walk
in
his
desk
and
the
desk
of
the
two
other
people
he
share
the
office
with
be
make
of
door
that
have
be
mount
atop
wooden
leg
brace
with
triangular
metal
piece
i
suddenly
realize
that
every
desk
i
d
see
in
that
office
be
the
same
all
make
from
door
all
on
top
of
simple
repurposed
s
a
short
man
bezos
be
wear
press
khaki
pant
and
a
crisp
blue
oxford
shirt
he
be
already
well
on
his
way
to
be
completely
bald
and
the
combination
of
the
huge
forehead
a
slightly
peaked
nose
a
shirt
that
be
a
little
too
big
for
him
and
a
neck
that
be
a
little
too
small
all
have
the
effect
of
make
him
look
like
a
turtle
that
have
just
popped
its
head
out
of
its
shell
behind
him
hang
from
an
expose
pipe
in
the
ceiling
four
or
five
identical
press
blue
oxford
shirt
flutter
in
the
breeze
provide
by
an
oscillate
fan
after
the
introduction
have
be
make
we
file
into
a
corner
of
the
building
where
enough
space
have
be
clear
to
fit
a
big
table
with
eight
chair
around
it
this
table
too
be
make
from
recycle
door
i
could
clearly
see
where
the
hole
that
use
to
hold
the
doorknob
have
be
neatly
patch
with
circular
plug
of
wood
okay
jeff
i
say
grin
what
s
with
all
the
door
it
s
a
deliberate
message
he
explain
everyone
in
the
company
have
them
it
s
a
way
of
say
that
we
spend
money
on
thing
that
affect
our
customer
not
on
thing
that
don
t
netflix
be
the
same
way
i
told
him
we
didn
t
even
provide
chair
he
laugh
it
s
like
this
building
it
s
a
mess
we
barely
have
room
to
turn
around
in
it
but
it
s
cheap
i
ve
held
out
as
long
as
i
can
but
even
i
admit
that
we
need
more
space
now
we
just
sign
a
lease
on
what
use
to
be
the
seattle
pacific
medical
center
it
s
huge
but
we
get
a
great
deal
because
no
one
else
want
it
i
wasn
t
surprised
to
hear
any
of
this
bezos
be
notoriously
frugal
even
cheap
he
be
famous
for
his
two
pizza
meeting
the
idea
be
that
if
it
take
more
than
two
pizza
to
feed
a
group
of
people
work
on
a
problem
then
you
have
hire
too
many
people
people
work
long
hour
for
him
and
they
didn
t
get
paid
a
lot
but
bezos
inspire
loyalty
he
s
one
of
those
genius
like
steve
job
or
like
reed
whose
peculiarity
only
add
to
his
legend
in
jeff
s
case
his
legendary
intelligence
and
notorious
nerdiness
mix
into
a
kind
of
contagious
enthusiasm
that
push
him
headlong
into
every
challenge
he
didn
t
look
back
or
as
he
put
it
he
evaluate
opportunity
use
a
regret
minimization
framework
he
show
reed
his
wristwatch
bragging
that
it
update
itself
thirty
six
time
a
day
by
pick
up
the
radio
signal
from
the
national
atomic
clock
in
fort
collins
colorado
a
star
trek
fan
bezos
have
spent
his
entire
childhood
act
out
scene
from
the
show
with
his
friend
his
pal
would
play
kirk
or
spock
jeff
be
always
the
enterprise
s
computer
when
he
spoke
i
notice
that
unlike
me
jeff
didn
t
gesture
with
his
hand
instead
he
use
his
head
for
emphasis
lift
his
chin
up
for
question
drop
it
down
suddenly
for
emphasis
twist
his
head
at
a
degree
angle
meant
he
be
curious
at
thirty
four
his
demeanor
still
retain
a
strong
dose
of
gee
whiz
enthusiasm
but
all
the
childlike
delight
in
the
world
couldn
t
mask
the
analytical
and
ambitious
brain
constantly
at
work
behind
his
unblinking
eye
as
i
start
to
bring
jeff
up
to
speed
about
netflix
detail
the
effort
we
d
make
to
get
the
site
off
the
ground
he
pepper
me
with
question
how
could
i
know
that
i
have
every
dvd
how
could
i
forecast
expect
turn
what
do
i
expect
the
ratio
of
sale
to
rental
to
be
but
it
be
clear
to
me
that
what
he
be
most
excite
about
be
the
story
about
launch
day
particularly
the
story
of
that
ring
bell
that
s
fantastic
he
exclaim
so
excite
that
he
almost
move
his
hand
we
have
the
exact
same
thing
a
bell
that
rang
every
time
an
order
come
in
i
have
to
stop
everyone
from
rush
over
to
the
computer
screen
to
see
if
they
knew
the
customer
we
trade
beta
name
he
laugh
at
kibble
and
told
me
that
amazon
have
originally
call
itself
cadabra
which
he
have
thought
evoke
the
sense
of
magic
that
online
shopping
could
produce
the
problem
be
that
cadabra
sound
a
little
too
much
like
cadaver
bezos
say
barking
out
a
laugh
although
amazon
be
still
relatively
small
in
they
already
have
over
employee
and
be
do
more
than
million
in
revenue
they
be
a
real
company
now
with
real
pressure
but
as
jeff
and
i
chat
about
our
launch
day
i
could
see
in
his
face
and
hear
in
his
voice
that
in
many
way
he
miss
those
simpler
more
excite
time
reed
on
the
other
hand
be
obviously
bore
forget
regret
minimization
framework
reed
have
never
be
someone
who
dwells
at
all
on
the
past
so
these
story
of
early
struggle
and
frenetic
launch
day
be
of
little
interest
to
him
his
placid
stare
have
turn
stony
and
he
be
impatiently
jogging
his
leg
up
and
down
he
want
i
knew
to
direct
the
conversation
to
the
topic
at
hand
what
netflix
be
do
how
it
could
potentially
fit
with
what
amazon
be
do
and
how
some
kind
of
arrangement
could
be
a
win
win
situation
for
both
party
i
be
just
finish
bring
jeff
and
joy
through
my
professional
r
sum
and
be
about
to
brief
them
on
christina
te
and
other
key
member
of
our
team
when
reed
decide
he
d
have
enough
we
don
t
need
to
go
through
all
this
he
say
exasperate
what
do
this
have
to
do
with
netflix
and
amazon
and
possible
way
we
can
work
together
everyone
stop
it
be
quiet
reed
i
say
after
a
few
second
it
s
obvious
that
amazon
be
consider
use
netflix
to
jump
start
their
entry
into
video
our
people
would
be
a
huge
part
of
any
possible
acquisition
so
it
s
entirely
appropriate
for
them
to
want
to
understand
who
we
be
i
be
relieve
when
joy
jumped
in
to
help
reed
she
suggest
can
you
help
me
understand
a
bit
well
how
you
re
think
about
your
unit
economics
this
be
exactly
what
reed
want
to
hear
and
with
obvious
relief
that
we
be
finally
on
topic
he
begin
run
joy
through
the
number
an
hour
later
after
the
meeting
be
over
and
bezos
have
head
back
to
his
office
joy
linger
behind
to
wrap
thing
up
i
m
very
impressed
with
what
you
ve
accomplish
she
start
and
i
think
there
be
lot
of
potential
for
a
strong
partnership
to
jump
start
our
entry
into
video
but
now
let
me
interject
something
here
i
m
not
a
but
man
nothing
good
ever
come
of
that
word
this
time
be
no
exception
but
joy
continued
if
we
elect
to
continue
down
this
path
we
re
probably
go
to
land
somewhere
in
the
low
eight
figure
when
someone
us
the
term
eight
figure
they
be
refer
to
digit
eight
figure
translates
to
ten
of
million
of
dollar
when
someone
us
low
eight
figure
that
mean
barely
eight
figure
that
mean
probably
something
between
million
and
million
that
would
have
be
a
pretty
good
outcome
for
me
since
at
the
time
i
own
about
percent
of
the
company
thirty
percent
of
million
be
a
pretty
nice
return
for
twelve
month
of
work
particularly
when
your
wife
be
broadly
hint
that
it
might
be
time
to
pull
the
kid
out
of
private
school
sell
the
house
and
move
to
montana
but
for
reed
it
wasn
t
enough
he
own
the
other
percent
of
the
company
but
he
d
also
invest
million
in
it
and
he
be
fresh
off
the
pure
atrium
ipo
he
be
already
an
eight
figure
guy
a
high
eight
figure
guy
on
the
plane
ride
home
we
discuss
the
pro
and
con
the
pro
we
d
find
a
solution
for
our
big
problem
we
weren
t
make
any
money
we
didn
t
have
a
repeatable
scalable
or
profitable
business
model
we
be
do
plenty
of
business
most
of
it
through
dvd
sale
but
our
cost
be
high
it
be
expensive
to
buy
dvd
expensive
to
ship
them
expensive
to
give
away
thousand
of
dvd
in
promotion
hop
that
we
d
convert
onetime
user
into
return
customer
and
of
course
there
be
the
big
problem
which
be
that
if
we
didn
t
sell
to
them
we
would
soon
be
compete
with
them
so
long
dvd
sale
so
long
netflix
sell
to
amazon
now
would
solve
all
those
problem
or
at
least
it
would
hand
them
off
to
a
large
company
with
deeper
pocket
but
we
be
also
on
the
brink
of
something
we
have
a
work
website
we
have
a
smart
team
we
have
deal
in
place
with
a
handful
of
dvd
manufacturer
we
have
figure
out
how
to
source
virtually
every
dvd
currently
available
we
be
unquestionably
the
best
source
on
the
internet
for
dvd
amazon
s
entry
as
a
competitor
would
undoubtedly
make
thing
more
complicate
and
difficult
but
we
have
a
bit
of
time
and
it
still
didn
t
seem
like
the
right
moment
to
give
up
listen
marc
reed
say
over
airline
peanut
and
ginger
ale
as
we
watch
mount
rainier
scroll
by
outside
the
window
this
business
have
real
potential
i
think
we
could
make
more
on
this
than
on
the
pure
atrium
deal
i
nod
in
agreement
and
then
for
some
reason
i
chose
that
moment
to
tell
reed
that
we
should
abandon
the
only
profitable
part
of
our
business
i
think
it
be
the
afternoon
with
bezos
see
amazon
in
the
flesh
dingy
office
and
all
just
reinforce
for
me
that
we
could
never
compete
in
the
dvd
retail
sale
market
well
to
focus
on
what
make
us
different
and
unique
we
just
have
to
figure
out
some
way
to
get
out
of
sell
dvd
i
say
to
him
do
rental
and
sale
be
confuse
for
our
customer
and
unnecessarily
complex
for
ops
and
if
we
don
t
sell
amazon
will
destroy
us
when
they
enter
the
field
i
think
we
get
out
now
focus
on
rental
reed
arch
his
eyebrow
kinda
put
all
our
egg
in
one
basket
he
say
that
s
the
only
way
to
make
sure
you
don
t
break
any
i
reply
that
s
true
by
the
way
one
of
the
key
lesson
i
learn
at
netflix
be
the
necessity
not
only
of
creative
ideation
or
of
have
the
right
people
around
you
but
of
focus
at
a
startup
it
s
hard
enough
to
get
a
single
thing
right
much
less
a
whole
bunch
of
thing
especially
if
the
thing
you
be
try
to
do
be
not
only
dissimilar
but
actively
impede
each
other
focus
be
imperative
even
when
the
thing
you
re
focus
on
seem
impossible
especially
then
but
reed
agree
with
me
you
re
right
he
say
throw
back
a
few
peanut
if
we
get
funding
this
summer
that
ll
buy
us
some
time
it
s
a
difficult
problem
he
frown
but
i
could
tell
he
be
pleased
to
have
something
new
to
chew
on
what
percentage
of
revenue
come
from
rental
right
now
roughly
three
percent
i
say
signal
to
the
flight
attendant
for
a
much
need
gin
and
tonic
that
s
horrible
reed
say
but
sale
be
a
band
aid
if
we
rip
it
off
then
we
have
to
focus
on
the
wound
i
say
squeeze
my
lime
into
the
drink
we
go
back
and
forth
like
this
for
the
rest
of
the
plane
ride
and
it
be
only
when
we
land
that
i
realize
we
hadn
t
actually
formally
decide
not
to
take
bezos
s
offer
we
d
just
naturally
go
back
into
our
carpool
on
mode
lob
idea
back
and
forth
and
shoot
them
down
without
decide
we
d
decide
we
weren
t
ready
to
sell
before
we
land
we
agree
that
reed
would
let
amazon
down
lightly
and
politely
we
d
be
well
off
have
amazon
as
a
friend
not
an
enemy
and
once
they
enter
the
dvd
sale
business
there
might
still
be
a
way
to
make
it
work
in
the
meantime
we
need
to
figure
out
a
way
to
get
people
rent
from
us
when
an
opportunity
come
knock
you
don
t
necessarily
have
to
open
your
door
but
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
at
least
look
through
the
keyhole
that
s
what
we
d
do
with
amazon
as
the
week
go
by
that
summer
that
glimpse
start
to
look
a
lot
more
entice
because
not
all
the
meeting
i
attend
with
reed
go
as
well
as
the
one
with
bezos
our
number
one
problem
after
launch
be
money
we
have
take
on
an
additional
just
before
the
launch
from
rick
schell
an
old
colleague
of
mine
from
borland
but
that
have
quickly
be
absorbed
by
the
steadily
increase
pile
of
dvd
that
we
be
shoehorn
into
our
warehouse
we
still
have
cash
in
the
bank
but
we
be
rapidly
approach
the
point
where
we
d
need
more
that
money
be
definitely
not
come
from
our
own
profit
it
be
still
far
too
early
for
that
but
to
raise
our
series
b
round
of
funding
we
be
go
to
have
to
convince
some
people
that
our
business
wasn
t
just
shiny
and
new
but
that
it
have
the
potential
to
be
profitable
massively
profitable
and
fairly
soon
we
weren
t
approach
friend
and
family
this
time
we
be
approach
professional
investor
real
venture
capitalist
and
they
would
need
more
than
a
sincere
look
communicate
how
hungry
i
be
they
need
data
sound
easy
right
wrong
flash
forward
to
my
volvo
station
wagon
idle
in
a
parking
space
in
front
of
the
sand
hill
road
office
of
institutional
venture
partner
a
prominent
silicon
valley
venture
capital
firm
in
just
twenty
minute
we
will
be
ushered
into
an
opulent
conference
room
where
we
ll
make
the
case
for
why
ivp
should
invest
in
us
we
re
ask
for
million
i
m
freak
out
and
even
reed
who
normally
isn
t
one
to
show
emotion
be
visibly
concerned
it
be
obvious
to
both
of
us
that
my
number
aren
t
add
up
for
the
previous
three
night
the
light
have
stayed
on
late
in
our
small
conference
room
duane
mensinger
the
interim
cfo
who
isn
t
even
confident
enough
about
the
number
to
come
on
full
time
and
i
have
burn
the
midnight
oil
come
up
with
multiple
financial
scenario
try
to
make
the
number
show
that
with
just
a
nominal
investment
we
can
get
our
company
to
a
place
where
we
could
actually
make
money
but
it
s
not
look
good
reed
be
hunch
forward
in
the
passenger
seat
look
at
the
number
for
the
first
time
and
see
clearly
what
will
also
become
evident
to
the
ivp
partner
just
a
short
while
later
that
without
some
tectonic
change
in
the
market
landscape
our
company
won
t
make
it
okay
i
say
flip
open
my
laptop
and
rehearse
my
pitch
as
you
can
see
our
user
growth
have
explode
in
the
week
post
launch
site
traffic
be
up
three
hundred
percent
with
at
least
half
of
all
visitor
to
netflix
com
try
the
service
out
we
expect
that
pursuant
to
our
deal
with
toshiba
and
sony
we
ll
see
a
two
hundred
percent
uptick
in
user
acquisition
by
the
new
year
when
dvd
player
sale
these
number
don
t
make
sense
marc
reed
interrupt
you
still
aren
t
capture
enough
revenue
from
each
new
user
to
cover
the
expense
of
the
promotion
it
s
like
a
taxi
drive
all
the
way
to
another
state
just
to
pick
up
a
four
dollar
fare
he
s
right
our
promotion
with
toshiba
and
sony
be
reach
new
dvd
owner
but
they
re
enormously
expensive
we
be
spending
a
lot
of
money
up
front
to
get
people
in
the
door
factor
in
two
way
shipping
the
mailer
the
labor
and
the
dvd
each
of
those
three
free
dvd
rental
be
cost
us
more
than
and
the
sony
deal
with
its
ten
free
rental
be
even
more
expensive
none
of
this
would
be
so
bad
if
every
free
trial
eventually
turn
into
a
return
renter
read
pay
customer
but
most
of
our
free
trial
user
be
only
tire
kicker
in
fact
only
about
percent
of
them
actually
return
and
rent
again
that
mean
that
we
have
to
subsidize
twenty
freebie
at
apiece
for
every
actual
customer
we
get
out
of
the
deal
do
the
math
every
pay
customer
be
cost
us
we
call
that
cac
pronounce
kack
it
stand
for
cost
of
acquire
a
customer
it
s
also
the
noise
you
make
when
you
realize
that
you
ll
never
be
able
to
make
enough
money
to
justify
cac
be
so
big
i
pivot
lay
the
charm
on
thick
we
re
see
a
thirty
percent
increase
month
over
month
i
say
point
to
a
graph
its
column
grow
april
to
july
like
an
in
progress
skyscraper
that
number
will
only
increase
as
the
format
grows
more
popular
already
dvd
player
be
half
as
expensive
this
year
as
they
be
last
year
people
be
buying
the
technology
and
when
they
do
netflix
be
one
of
the
first
thing
they
see
christmas
this
year
will
be
huge
it
won
t
matter
if
santa
claus
himself
ride
into
scott
valley
reed
say
if
we
re
just
give
away
the
house
on
promotion
i
know
i
say
frown
i
ve
be
so
focus
on
the
launch
on
grow
the
company
on
make
it
exist
at
all
that
i
ve
lose
sight
of
the
reason
we
re
do
this
in
the
first
place
to
create
something
real
that
can
stand
on
its
own
i
ve
miss
the
forest
for
the
tree
reed
look
at
me
curiously
cock
his
head
then
shake
it
he
s
not
accustom
to
see
me
this
rattle
historically
i
ve
be
the
one
to
help
him
out
with
presentation
with
pitch
i
ve
help
him
soften
his
message
help
him
pivot
from
inconvenient
problem
i
ve
try
mostly
unsuccessfully
to
teach
him
to
lighten
tension
with
a
joke
the
key
to
these
pitch
be
to
read
the
room
sense
what
they
want
to
hear
and
then
give
that
to
them
without
lie
obfuscate
or
distort
the
truth
in
a
pitch
perfection
isn
t
always
the
goal
projection
be
you
don
t
have
to
have
all
the
answer
if
you
appear
to
be
the
sort
of
person
to
whom
they
ll
eventually
come
i
be
not
that
person
sit
in
the
parking
lot
and
reed
can
see
it
come
on
he
say
opening
the
door
let
s
go
i
sit
for
a
while
click
through
the
slide
one
more
time
chug
a
few
last
gulp
of
coffee
get
your
shit
together
marc
reed
say
then
he
shuts
the
door
the
pitch
do
not
go
particularly
well
though
they
didn
t
question
my
slide
the
way
reed
have
the
firm
seem
dubious
and
within
a
few
day
one
of
their
analyst
be
call
the
office
ask
question
that
i
didn
t
have
great
answer
for
yet
eventually
they
decide
to
fund
us
but
that
have
less
to
do
with
my
pitch
than
reed
s
presence
reed
be
a
know
quantity
venture
capitalist
catnip
he
d
orchestrate
major

reluctantly
on
the
cover
of
usa
today
next
to
his
porsche
people
with
money
trust
him
because
he

a
track

in
he

around
his

before

in

i
can
also
now
see
that
that
s
when
everything
start
to
change
one
of
the
paradox
of
memory
be
how
it
distorts
time
if
you
d
ask
me
before
write
this
book
how
long
the
truly
early
day
of
netflix
last
the
day
of
lawn
chair
and
pathetic
christmas
party
heat
argument
and
hash
brown
at

s
i
would
have
scratch
my
head
and
say
a
year
and
a
half
two
year
really
it
be
about
a
year
but
those
eleven
or
twelve
month
be
crucial
they
exist
in
a
kind
of
peaceable
vacuum
set
apart
from
what
come
before
and
what
come
after
before
we
almost
sell
ourselves
to
amazon
we
be
just
try
to
make
something
happen
that
no
one
else
have
ever
do
we
be
work
independently
of
competition
we
be
in
a
sense
protect
by
the
wall
of
that
bank
vault
we
have
a
stinky
green
carpet
place
to
dream
the
ancient
greek
have
a
term
for
this
halcyon
day
i
won
t
bore
you
too
much
with
the
mythology
but
essentially
they
refer
to
the
seven
day
each
year
when
the
wind
be
calm
and
alcyone
a
kingfisher
could
lay
her
egg
the
halcyon
day
of
netflix
ran
from
the
summer
of
to
the
summer
of
there
wasn
t
a
moment
that
fall
or
afterward
when
i
realize
that
they
be
over
transition
rarely
work
like
that
when
change
be
incremental
it
s
hard
to
put
your
finger
on
the
end
point
the
ironic
thing
be
that
change
be
what
you
want
all
along
it
s
the
point
of
any
startup
and
it
s
what
we
work
so
hard
to
have
happen
but
that
doesn
t
make
it
any
easy
when
it
do
still
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
i
can
pinpoint
a
high
water
mark
and
tell
you
that
the
halcyon
day
of
early
netflix
be
at
their
apogee
in
june
during
our
summer
company
picnic
at
hallcrest
vineyard
i
remember
it
so
clearly
picnic

topped
with
pizza
an
open
field
surround
by
redwood

and
a

of

free
in
the

and
all
our
kid

other
with
brand

super
soaker
bought
for
the
occasion
with
reed
s
help
we
d
just
raise
million
to
get
us
through
to
the
end
of
the
year
and
we

i
d
give
a
toast
to
our

and
at
the
end
of
it
mitch
lowe
have
proudly
present
me
with
a
netflix

license
plate
i
be
hold
it
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
i
be
hold
a
glass
of

look
down
into
the

and
think
you
know
this
be
go
pretty
well
a
year
maybe
a
little
more
doesn
t
sound
like
a
lot
but
those
twelve
month
or
so
determine
so
much
about
the
company
s
culture
direction
and
ethos
netflix
today
wouldn
t
exist
without
them
or
if
it
do
it
would
look
a
hell
of
a
lot
different
netflix
also
wouldn
t
exist
today
without
what
happen
after
that
s
the
thing
about
halcyon
day
you
need
them
but
if
you
want
your
egg
to
hatch
and
the
bird
to
fly
away
you
need
a
little
wind

when

reliant
on
a
careful
methodical
rollout
do
something

thing
might
sound
dire
to
you
at
this
point
but
that
s
the
thing
about
startup
you
re
almost
always
on
the
razor
s
edge
between
total
success
and
total
failure
you
learn
to
live
there
i
imagine
it

how

to
most
people

do
it
enough
time
and
that
s
just
the
life
you
lead
plus
success

quite
a
long
tail
we
get
a
lot
of
press
on

but
it
be
really
for
work
that
we
d
do
a
month
three
month
six
month
a
year
prior
the
life
span
of
a
startup
be
often
so
short
that
by
the
time
people
notice
what
you
re
do
you
re
hang
on
by
a
thread
that
s
true
of
most
thing
really
when
you
re
busy
make
your
dream
into
reality
no
one
praise
you
until
the
work

group
i
knew
everyone
i
d
hire
them
i
knew
what
they
be
good
at
and
what
they
didn
t
know
they
be
good
at
yet
i
knew
how
they
thought
how
they
work
most
of
all
i
knew
they
be
brilliant
that
they
could
learn
new
thing
if
need
jim
have
no
experience
in
operation
when
i
hire
him
boris
wasn
t
even
a
web
designer
but
i
knew
that
both
of
them
have
the
necessary
drive
and
malleable
creativity
to
make
a
go
of
it
and
that
s
how
startup
typically
run
in
the
early
day
you
hire
a
bunch
of
brilliant
people
to
be
jack
of
all
trade
everyone
do
a
little
bit
of
everything
you
re
hire
a
team
not
a
set
of
position
that
fall
i
be
try
to
manage
the
growth
of
that
team
to
make
sure
that
the
culture
we
d
forge
over
the
previous
twelve
month
survive
a
scale
up
we
d
built
a
company
where
freewheel
discussion
sometimes
turn
heat
and
it
be
okay
where
idea
be
more
important
than
chain
of
command
where
it
didn
t
matter
who
solve
a
problem
only
that
it
get
solve
where
dedication
and
creativity
matter
a
lot
more
than
dress
code
or
meeting
time
it
be
special
and
i
knew
it
even
then
here
s
an
example
te
would
ask
each
new
hire
what
his
or
her
favorite
film
be
then
the
day
before
our
monthly
company
wide
meeting
she
d
instruct
the
person
to
come
to
work
the
next
day
dress
as
a
character
from
that
film
the
new
hire
would
spend
the
day
dress
as
batman
or
cruella
de
vil
or
humphrey
bogart
as
rick
blaine
in
casablanca
before
be
introduce
in
front
of
the
entire
company
be
this
silly
yes
be
it
a
waste
of
time
arguably
be
it
pointless
not
at
all
small
semi
improvised
ritual
like
this
kept
thing
light
they
remind
us
that
no
matter
how
stressful
the
job
be
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
be
rent
movie
to
people
and
nothing
force
people
to
bond
like
share
embarrassment
but
as
the
company
grow
past
its
founder
and
initial
small
team
i
didn
t
know
if
tradition
like
that
would
survive
our
hire
from
india
seem
totally
bewilder
by
the
practice
the
whole
thing
have
haze
and
possible
hr
violation
write
all
over
it
but
that
s
how
small
we
be
we
didn
t
even
have
hr
guideline
to
violate
yet
we
d
need
them
if
we
continued
to
grow
and
we
d
need
to
codify
a
lot
of
thing
to
make
sure
our
business
continued
to
run
smoothly
once
the
found
team
wasn
t
do
all
the
work
navigate
those
challenge
be
a
lot
of
what
i
spent
the
fall
of
do
that
and
look
for
new
office
space
oh
and
deal
with
a
massive
international
porn
scandal
it
be
suppose
to
be
a
stunt
something
viral
something
that
would
get
traction
well
beyond
its
cost
it
be
suppose
to
be
bill
clinton
when
you
re
try
to
build
a
product
sometimes
it
doesn
t
matter
how
many
promotion
you
run
or
how
many
deal
you
offer
sometimes
you
just
need
to
get
attention
blockbuster
would
use
this
tactic
in
when
they
launch
total
access
a
combine
in
store
and
online
rental
service
meant
to
compete
with
netflix
they
hire
jessica
simpson
for
a
huge
unveil
and
make
her
gush
in
front
of
the
press
about
how
much
she
love
rent
movie
on
the
internet
but
in
the
fall
of
we
didn
t
have
blockbuster
money
and
we
certainly
didn
t
have
jessica
simpson
s
number
but
we
do
have
mitch
lowe
mitch
be
spending
more
and
more
time
in
the
netflix
office
in
scott

the
draw
of

he
be
tire
of
the
long
commute
to
his
house
back
in

frequently
stay
overnight
in
a
small
hotel
by
the
golf
course
in
aptos
half
an
hour
south
of
our
office
it
certainly
wasn
t
the
closest
place
he
could
stay
but
he
have
two
reason
for
choose

bottle
or
more
of
wine
each
tuesday
night
mitch
have
ample
incentive
to
shorten
his
commute
the
other
reason
be
an
old
friend
arthur

to
any

store
he
could
convince
to
carry
them
it
wasn
t
long
before
he
realize
it
would
be
considerably
more
lucrative
to
move
video
in
the
opposite
direction
which
lead
to
a
video
export
business
by
the
time

view
of
all
the
new
video
technology
come
out
of
the
valley
and
have
recently
discover
a
startup
call
mindset
that
be
develop
new
video
codecs
the
software
that
convert
and
compress
analog

into
digital

a
critical
part
of
the
technology
that
go
into

a
dvd
late
one
thursday
night
after
a
bit
of
taste
arthur
told
mitch
about
a
new
breakthrough
that
mindset
have
make
their
encode
and
compression
process
be
now
so
fast
that
they
could
essentially
transfer
analog
tape
to
dvd
in
real
time
this
increase
speed
arthur
say
be
go
to
revolutionize
the
dvd
master
process
they
be
look
for
a
project
with
a
quick
turnaround
time
that
they
could
use
to
live
test
their
process
and
make
sure
it
work
as
fast
as
they
thought
it
take
less
than
twenty
four
hour
and
a
few
bottle
of
wine
for
mitch
to
come
up
with
the
perfect
candidate
for
the
previous
eight
month
the
country
have
be
gripped
by
the
investigation
into
president
bill
clinton
s
affair
with
monica
lewinsky
in
mid
august
the
scandal
have
reach
a
critical
moment
for
the
first
time
a
sit
president
have
be
compel
to
testify
in
front
of
a
grand
jury
although
his
testimony
be
secret
the
session
have
be
videotaped
and
now
a
month
later
on
friday
september
the
republican
control
house
judiciary
committee
have
announce
that
in
the
interest
of
public
transparency
it
would
be
release
the
video
to
all
the
major
broadcast
network
the
testimony
would
be
make
public
after
the
weekend
three
day
later
at
a
m
monday
september
when
mitch
get
to
the
office
later
that
morning
he
could
barely
contain
himself
this
be
it
he
say
throw
a
printout
of
a
page
from
yahoo
news
onto
my
desk
look
at
this
it
s
the
perfect
thing
clinton
let
s
make
our
own
dvd
he
star
at
me
expectantly
and
then
realize
that
i
have
no
idea
what
he
be
talk
about
begin
fill
me
in
on
his
conversation
with
art
i
ve
already
talk
to
one
of
my
friend
at
ktvu
mitch
go
on
refer
to
the
bay
area
fox
affiliate
he
say
that
he
could
make
us
a
three
quarter
inch
master
copy
directly
from
the
broadcast
it
s
only
four
hour
long
i
ll
be
there
wait
i
ll
drive
it
straight
to
mindset
and
they
can
have
a
dvd
master
ready
to
start
press
disc
by
that
afternoon
we
can
begin
shipping
them
the
next
morning
okay
hold
on
woodward
i
say
let
s
slow
down
a
sec
and
figure
this
out
but
i
have
to
admit
it
mitch
s
idea
be
good
it
wasn
t
watergate
but
it
be
good
while
mitch
ran
off
to
set
the
wheel
in
motion
i
round
up
te
and
christina
and
fill
them
in
predictably
te
love
it
she
pull
out
one
of
the
pencil
she
regularly
have
in
her
hair
hold
thing
in
place
and
use
it
to
make
note
on
a
yellow
pad
while
she
spoke
we
can
probably
get
national
press
on
this
the
time
the
post
even
the
journal
what
s
wrong
christina
i
ask
she
be
chew
on
her
thumbnail
and
frown
it
s
a
cool
idea
but
we
can
t
just
jump
into
this
without
think
it
through
she
explain
her
voice
rise
what
be
the
disc
art
go
to
look
like
how
be
we
go
to
ship
it
how
much
be
we
go
to
charge
we
have
to
get
it
all
set
up
in
the
system
she
shook
her
head
in
frustration
there
s
just
no
way
we
can
have
this
ready
to
go
by
monday
but
this
be
all
about
the
timing
i
counter
we
don
t
have
time
to
do
a
full
release
of
this
and
we
don
t
have
to
we
can
do
very
minimal
disc
art
we
can
mail
it
in
any
envelope
it
s
a
sale
not
a
rental
it
doesn
t
need
to
come
back
i
pause
an
idea
be
form
and
let
s
not
charge
anything
let
s
make
it
free
no
charge
a
public
service
from
your
civic
mind
friend
at
netflix
that
s
crazy
te
say
shake
her
head
so
crazy
that
it
just
might
work
we
ve
get
a
problem
it
be
two
hour
later
and
christina
be
clearly
in
problem
solve
mode
her
happy
spot
she
have
that
smile
on
her
face
that
say
she
be
excite
to
tell
me
what
the
problem
be
and
even
more
excite
to
tell
me
the
clever
way
she
have
already
solve
it
i
ve
be
work
with
eric
on
get
a
free
dvd
set
up
in
our
system
she
explain
prepare
to
walk
me
through
the
process
i
normally
would
have
push
her
to
cut
to
the
chase
but
i
decide
to
let
her
have
her
moment
well
we
have
no
problem
get
it
all
set
up
on
the
development
server
but
when
we
try
to
actually
ship
the
order
no
go
she
pause
for
effect
eric
and
boris
played
with
it
for
a
while
and
finally
figure
out
that
the
software
can
t
sell
something
for
nothing
our
system
literally
doesn
t
know
how
to
give
something
away
for
free
so
eric
and
i
decide
to
try
something
we
price
the
dvd
at
one
cent
and
it
work
as
long
as
we
charge
something
for
it
we
re
fine
she
sat
back
grin
there
be
more
i
knew
she
have
something
up
her
sleeve
then
i
have
an
idea
two
cent
let
s
charge
everybody
two
cent
then
we
can
do
some
crazy
promotion
about
put
in
your
two
cent
or
something
like
that
she
drop
her
hand
in
her
lap
clearly
proud
of
herself
there
be
nothing
else
to
say
we
have
the
tag
for
our
press
release
which
would
go
out
first
thing
tuesday
morning
mitch
have
problem
too
but
he
wasn
t
quite
as
happy
about
them
as
christina
be
at
first
everything
have
go
smoothly
at
the
conclusion
of
the
broadcast
monday
morning
mitch
s
contact
at
ktvu
have
be
true
to
his
word
and
immediately
transfer
the
four
hour
of
testimony
to
tape
mitch
have
driven
it
from
oakland
to
aptos
and
within
a
few
hour
mindset
have
the
tape
mount
and
encode
be
under
way
but
when
mitch
give
me
an
update
call
at
p
m
it
be
clear
that
thing
have
begin
to
go
awry
the
technology
be
actually
really
good
he
start
in
but
as
he
struggle
with
what
to
say
next
i
could
hear
his
enthusiasm
fading
but
uh
it
s
clearly
not
ready
for
prime
time
all
kind
of
bug
every
time
they
start
the
encode
it
run
for
a
bit
then
stop
they
re
run
it
now
but
it

of
attention

up
instead
the
follow
monday
i
be
just
walk
into
the
office
when
corey
grabbed
me
hey

run
across

around
to
his
computer
where
one
of
his
dvd
forum
be
on
screen
and
scroll
furiously
with
his

kind
of
porno

have
a
sinking
feel
in
my
stomach
people
be
certainly

clinton
dvd
but
when
they
say
that

they
didn
t
mean
that
clinton
s

occasionally
x
rat
they
be
say
that
we
have
sent
them

if
you
can
figure
out
how
widespread
this
be
i
shout
at
corey
then
jumped
up
and
ran
back
to
the
safe
where
jim

start
to
make
sense
of
the
order

dvd
they
look
identical
to
me
they
come
off
two
different
spindle
and
they
both
should
be
the
same
but
if
you
look
closely
you
can
see
where
this
one
he
hand
me
one
of
the
two
dvd
be
slightly
different
this
be
the
porn
one
look
like
we
get
two
spindle
of
these
one
of
them
have
be
completely
sent
out

other

have
a
dozen
or
so
disc
left
have
you
i
didn
t
know
how
to
ask
this
watch
it
yet
there
be
that
smile
again
yep
let
s
just
say
we
watch
enough
to
know
that
this
be
the
culprit
that
night
when
i
get
home
the
house
be
already
dark
thank
goodness
i
didn
t
want
to
have
to
explain
to
lorraine
what
i
need
to
do
i
turn
on
our
tv
power
up
the
dvd
player
and
slid
the
dvd
into
the
slot
as
it
spun
up
and
the
image
start
i
knew
in
a
second
that
what
i
be
watch
didn
t
star
bill
clinton
monica
lewinsky
or
even
ken
starr
it
be
porn
all
right
and
nasty
stuff
too
i
didn
t
need
to
watch
anymore
i
promise
it
be
a
big
swing
and
a
big
miss
but
if
you
re
try
to
make
a
dream
into
reality
you
have
to
be
willing
to
swing
at
a
lot
of
pitch
the
next
day
we
do
the
only
thing
we
could
like
bill
we
come
clean
we
sent
out
a
letter
to
every
one
of
the
nearly
people
who
have
put
in
their
two
cent
we
explain
what
have
happen
and
we
apologize
for
the
confusion
and
any
possible
offense
and
if
they
have
receive
the
porn
version
we
ask
that
they
return
it
to
us
at
our
expense
after
which
we
would
gladly
send
them
out
the
proper
dvd
but
you
know
funny
thing
not
a
single
person
do

i
m
lose
faith
in
you
fall
back
in
the
stone
age
when
i
be
a
kid
there
be
no
video
game
there
be
no
instagram
no
facebook
no
snapchat
there
be
no
way
to
watch
movie
at
home
unless
you
want
to
set
up
the
old
reel
to
reel
and
watch
yourself
as
a
baby
there
wasn
t
in
the
randolph
household
at
least
even
cable
tv
the
only
way
to
rot
your
brain
back
then
be
by
watch
whatever
be
on
the
major
network
and
on
saturday
morning
and
after
school
that
meant
cartoon
back
then
i
d
watch
anything
superhero
cartoon
cartoon
sitcom
like
the
flintstone
or
the
jetsons
anything
by
hanna
barbera
but
now
when
i
think
of
cartoon
i
mostly
remember
the
old
stuff
bug
bunny
and
elmer
fudd
wile
e
coyote
and
the
road
runner
tom
and
jerry
and
tweety
and
sylvester
all
of
those
cartoon
it
strike
me
now
be
about
pursuit
about
one
character
chase
another
often
to
his
doom
elmer
fudd
want
the
wascally
wabbit
wile
e
coyote
pant
after
the
road
runner
tom
and
sylvester
cat
to
the
core
spend
their
life
stalk
tweety
and
jerry
sometimes
chase
a
dream
be
like
that
a
singular
pursuit
of
something
nearly
impossible
in
the
startup
world
where
the
money
be
perilous
and
the
timeline
be
unbelievably
compress
the
day
to
day
pursuit
of
your
dream
can
appear
frenzied
even
manic
to
outsider
to
your
friend
and
family
you
ll
sometimes
look
more
like
yosemite
sam
than
say
marc
randolph
successful
ceo
of
a
young
e
commerce
company
you
ll
lose
sleep
you
ll
mutter
to
yourself
while
drive
when
you
try
to
explain
your
dream
to
other
people
they
won
t
understand
that
it
isn
t
just
about
raise
fund
or
customer
conversion
or
daily
monitor
it
s
a
surreal
chase
a
pursuit
that
give
your
life
meaning
funny
thing
about
those
cartoon
they
never
end
in
capture
they
re
about
evasion
disappointment
near
miss
you
get
the
feel
that
if
wile
e
coyote
ever
actually
caught
the
road
runner
he
wouldn
t
know
what
to
do
but
that
s
not
the
point
the
point
be
the
pursuit
of
the
impossible
pursue
the
impossible
be
a
setup
for
pratfall
and
comedy
drama
and
tension
also
absurdity
because
despite
all
the
best
laid
trap
of
elmer
fudd
or
the
most
elaborate
snare
of
tom
or
sylvester
a
lot
of
those
cartoon
end
suddenly
with
anvil
and
piano
fall
out
of
the
sky
follow
your
dream
spend
a
year
chase
it
and
one
day
you
might
find
yourself
sit
daze
in
a
wreckage
of
black
and
white
key
bluebird
chirp
around
your
head
with
no
idea
of

one
of
the
box
and
balance
it
between
my
briefcase
and
my
hip
we
really
should
invest
in
a
real
handcart
eric
say
as
we
squeak
up
the
ramp
and
into
the
office
christina
look
up
from
her
computer
when
we
pass
then
go
back
to
type
reed
stop
by
this
morning
she
say
tilt
her
head
toward
me
but
keep
her
eye
angle
at
her
screen
super
early
like
six
a
m
say
he
be
go
to
stop
by
again
on
his
way
back
from
the
valley
tonight
he
want
you
to
stick
around
until
then
that
it
christina
nod
that
s
it
i
didn
t
have
much
time
to
dwell
on
what
reed
want
but
i
could
guess
most
likely
it
be
the
sony
deal
scammer
aside
we
be
start
to
see
real
return
from
it
people
be
redeem
their
coupon
it
be
by
far
the
big
bet
we
d
ever
make
and
consider
all
the
chip
we
d
push
into
the
middle
we
need
it
to
pay
off
or
it
could
be
an
agreement
with
amazon
we
d
be
fin
ever
since
meeting
with
bezos
in
june
we
hadn
t
be
ready
to
sell
then
but
reed
have
be
ready
to
partner
with
amazon
in
a
different
capacity
reed
agree
with
me
that
if
we
be
go
to
make
it
as
a
company
we
d
have
to
focus
on
rent
dvd
not
sell
them
so
he
d
engineer
a
soft
exit
once
amazon
move
into
dvd
we
d
push
our
user
who
want
to
buy
dvd
there
they
could
rent
through
us
and
buy
through
amazon
via
a
link
in
exchange
amazon
would
direct
traffic
our
way
nothing
about
this
deal
be
official
yet
in
fact
in
september
i
think
i
be
the
only
one
who
knew
about
it
reed
and
i
have
be
go
back
and
forth
on
the
subject
for
week
even
though
halt
dvd
sale
have
be
my
idea
the
thought
of
jettisoning
the
only
profitable
part
of
our
business
still
make
me
nervous
but
reed
and
i
be
both
convince
that
we
have
to
choose
what
we
be
go
to
focus
on
and
partner
with
amazon
would
not
only
reinvigorate
our
rental
it
would
be
a
real
feather
in
our
cap
it
would
validate
us
we
be
think
a
lot
about
validation
in
those
day
that
s
how
tim
haley
saw
the
sony
deal
if
they
be
willing
to
work
with
us
we
be
worth
invest
in
sony
make
us
credible
even
at
an
incredible
cost
a
partnership
with
amazon
in
reed
s
view
could
do
the
same
thing
i
be
die
to
find
out
what
have
happen
over
the
weekend
how
many
new
sony
customer
have
ripped
open
their
new
player
note
down
their
product
serial
number
and
head
to
netflix
to
redeem
their
offer
i
knew
reed
be
equally
curious
maybe
he
thought
we
would
have
new
number
to
go
over
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
make
a
note
to
myself
to
make
sure
i
have
up
to
date
report
before
he
come
back
but
for
now
there
be
plenty
of
other
thing
to
worry
about
like
the
morning
monitor
it
be
nearly
six
when
reed
finally
swept
in
i
be
write
copy
but
i
could
hear
his
progress
through
the
office
from
the
front
to
the
back
first
i
heard
the
beach
chair
creak
in
front
of
eric
s
desk
as
reed
pull
it
around
to
eric
s
side
so
he
could
point
something
out
on
the
screen
then
a
few
minute
later
i
heard
him
ask
our
controller
greg
julien
for
an
update
on
cash
soon
he
make
his
way
back
to
my
office
get
a
minute
he
say
with
no
upward
inflection
like
it
wasn
t
a
question
like
he
almost
hop
i
didn
t
reed
look
serious
and
he
be
dress
the
part
in
the
formal
for
him
outfit
he
wore
only
for
important
meeting
black
linen
pant
and
a
gray
turtleneck
with
black
dress
shoe
i
point
to
his
neck
and
try
to
make
a
joke
of
it
reed
it
s
almost
ninety
outside
but
he
didn
t
seem
to
hear
me
we
need
to
talk
he
say
he
be
carry
his
notebook
computer
open
in
his
hand
hold
it
by
the
corner
of
the
screen
with
the
keyboard
hang
below
i
could
see
that
it
be
open
to
a
powerpoint
slideshow
and
i
could
just
make
out
the
first
slide
accomplishment
it
read
in
bold
point
type
reed
step
into
the
room
grabbed
the
chair
in
front
of
my
desk
and
in
one
motion
swung
it
around
to
my
side
with
the
seat
face
out
he
straddle
it
lean
his
chest
across
the
back
then
spun
the
laptop
so
i
could
see
the
screen
it
be
exactly
what
he
do
when
he
want
to
show
eric
how
badly
he
d
bungle
a
piece
of
code
where
be
this
go
i
thought
marc
reed
start
slowly
i
ve
be
think
a
lot
about
the
future
and
i
m
worried
he
pause
try
to
read
my
face
then
he
purse
his
lip
look
down
at
the
screen
like
it
be
a
set
of
cue
card
and
continued
i
m
worried
about
us
actually
i
m
worried
about
you
about
your
judgment
what
my
mouth
i
m
sure
drop
open
reed
direct
my
attention
to
the
screen
then
hit
the

their
way
onto
the
screen

like
a
slideshow
at
a

i
could
tell
it
wasn
t
go
to
get
well
from
here
what
the
fuck
reed
i
finally
manage
to
blurt
out
you
re
concerned
about
where
we
re
go
and
you
re
go
to
lay
it
out
for
me
in

powerpoint
my
voice
have
start
to
rise
but
then
notice
my
office
door
be
still
open
i
drop
it
to
a
whisper
this
be
bullshit
i
hiss
point
at
the
laptop
there
be
no
way
i
m
sit
here
while
you
pitch
me
on
why
i
suck
reed
blink
and
sat
still
i
could
tell
he
hadn
t
expect
this
reaction
he
purse
his
lip
again
i
knew
he
be
analyze
pro
and
con
evaluate
his
next
step
his
mind
whir
just
like
the
cool
fan
in
the
dell
in
front
of
us
still
display
its
list
of
my
accomplishment
after
about
ten
second
he
nod
then
reach
over
and
shut
the
computer
okay
he
say
this
isn
t
about
how
you
suck
though
good
i
stammer
okay
i
could
feel
my
anger
subside
replace
now
by
a
sense
of
dread
i
stood
up
and
close
the
office
door
marc
reed
start
in
as
i
settle
back
into
my
seat
you
ve
do
some
amaze
thing
here
he
pause
but
i
m
lose
faith
in
your
ability
to
lead
the
company
alone
your
strategic
sense
be
erratic
sometimes
right
on
and
sometime
way
off
i
ve
see
issue
with
judgment
hire
financial
instinct
and
i
m
concerned
that
i
m
see
these
kind
of
issue
at
our
small
size
next
year
s
problem
and
the
year
after
s
will
be
much
harder
and
the
consequence
for
misstep
much
more
severe
thing
be
only
go
to
get
bad
as
the
company
grows
there
s
a
speak
tactic
in
business
useful
for
break
bad
news
it
s
call
a
shit
sandwich
you
open
up
with
a
string
of
compliment
praise
for
work
well
do
that
s
your
first
piece
of
bread
once
that
s
do
you
pile
on
the
shit
the
bad
news
the
less
than
glow
report
the
thing
your
audience
doesn
t
particularly
enjoy
hearing
you
close
with
more
bread
a
blueprint
for
move
forward
a
plan
for
deal
with
all
the
shit
i
m
quite
familiar
with
the
shit
sandwich
hell
i
d
taught
reed
how
to
make
one
so
it
be
with
a
peculiar
mix
of
bewilderment
and
a
teacher
s
pride
that
i
watch
him
serve
one
up
to
me
on
a
silver
platter
you
don
t
think
i
m
a
good
ceo
i
say
cut
him
off
i
don
t
think
you
re
a
complete
ceo
reed
say
a
complete
ceo
wouldn
t
have
to
rely
on
the
guidance
of
the
board
as
much
as
you
do
he
put
his
fingertip
together
and
touch
them
to
his
chin
as
though
pray
that
he
could
get
through
what
he
be
try
to
say
to
me
i
think
we
both
know
that
ivp
be
only
willing
to
invest
in
us
because
i
promise
that
i
would
be
actively
involve
as
chairman
that
s
a
problem
and
it
s
not
just
fund
raise
one
of
the
reason
i
ve
be
so
active
be
because
i
m
scar
about
what
would
happen
to
the
business
if
i
weren
t
i
don
t
mind
the
time
but
the
result
to
date
have
not
be
sufficient
no
one
can
add
enough
value
from
the
outside
especially
as
the
pace
pick
up
for
the
next
five
minute
reed
laid
out
a
meticulous
argument
for
why
the
company
be
in
trouble
if
i
be
to
continue
lead
it
alone
he
put
forth
a
clear
eyed
assessment
of
my
first
year
in
charge
my
accomplishment
and
my
failure
it
be
like
watch
a
computer
play
chess
ruthlessly
and
quickly
his
analysis
be
both
detailed
and
general
it
veer
from
individual
hire
i
d
make
to
error
in
accounting
to
corporate
communication
it
all
go
by
in
a
blur
but
one
thing
he
say
really
stuck
out
you
don
t
appear
tough
and
candid
enough
to
hold
strong
people
s
respect
he
say
on
the
good
side
no
one
good
have
quit
and
your
people
like
you
i
have
to
smile
at
that
forget
radical
honesty
this
be
brutal
honesty
ruthless
honesty
gee
thanks
i
say
put
that
one
on
my
tombstone
he
may
have
run
his
business
into
the
ground
but
no
one
good
quit
and
his
people
like
him
reed
didn
t
react
to
this
bit
of
gallows
humor
at
all
he
just
kept
go
like
he
be
recite
something
he
d
memorize
i
d
take
away
his
slide
but
this
be
a
speech
he
d
definitely
rehearse
he
be
nervous
about
deliver
it
marc
reed
say
we
re
head
for
trouble
and
i
want
you
to
recognize
as
a
shareholder
that
there
be
enough
smoke
at
this
small
business
size
that
fire
at
a
large
size
be
likely
ours
be
an
execution
play
we
have
to
move
fast
and
almost
flawlessly
the
competition
will
be
direct
and
strong
yahoo
go
from
a
grad
school
project
to
a
six
billion
dollar
company
on
awesome
execution
we
have
to
do
the
same
thing
i
m
not
sure
we
can
if
you
re
the
only
one
in
charge
he
pause
then
look
down
as
if
try
to
gain
the
strength
to
do
something
difficult
he
look
up
again
right
at
me
i
remember
think
he
s
look
me
in
the
eye
so
i
think
the
best
possible
outcome
would
be
if
i
join
the
company
full
time
and
we
ran
it
together
me
as
ceo
you
as
president
he
wait
again
see
no
reaction
he
plunge
on
i
don
t
think
i
m
overreact
i
think
this
be
a
thoughtful
solution
to
an
unhappy
reality
and
i
think
the
ceo
president
arrangement
would
give
the
company
the
leadership
team
it
deserves
we
could
make
history
we
be
proud
of
for
the
rest
of
our
life
finally
mercifully
he
stop
rock
back
slightly
in
the
chair
and
take
a
deep
breath
i
sat
there
not
speak
just
slowly
nod
that
s
what
happens
when
a
piano
fall
out
of
the
sky
on
your
head
i
m
sure
reed
wonder
why
i
didn
t
see
the
situation
with
the
same
clarity
and
logic
as
he
do
i
knew
that
reed
didn
t
couldn
t
understand
what
be
go
through
my
head
thank
god
for
that
because
the
word
go
through
my
head
weren
t
polite
i
knew
that
a
lot
of
what
he
be
say
be
true
but
i
also
thought
that
we
be
talk
about
my
company
it
have
be
my
idea
my
dream
and
now
it
be
my
business
while
reed
have
be
off
at
stanford
and
at
technet
i
d
be
pour
my
entire
life
into
building
the
company
be
it
realistic
to
expect
anyone
to
get
every
decision
right
shouldn
t
i
be
allow
to
work
my
way
through
mistake
he
wasn
t
wrong
about
those
either
he
have
a
point
about
some
of
our
misstep
and
our
future
go
forward
but
my
initial
reaction
to
what
reed
be
say
that
day
in
the
office
be
that
it
have
more
to
do
with
him
than
me
i
kept
think
he
s
realize
that
he
make
a
life
mistake
hadn
t
he
be
bore
at
stanford
and
drop
out
hadn
t
he
be
disappointed
by
his
work
in
education
reform
at
technet
he
d
skip
the
early
day
of
netflix
because
he
want
to
change
the
world
revolutionize
education
and
most
of
the
teacher
and
administrator
he
d
encounter
just
want
their
pay
grade
to
go
up
with
seniority
and
now
that
he
saw
that
the
little
crazy
idea
we
d
test
together
have
real
potential
he
suddenly
found
problem
with
my
leadership
be
i
not
fit
to
run
the
company
alone
or
do
he
just
want
back
in
without
the
ego
hit
of
be
my
employee
i
be
furious
and
hurt
but
also
even
in
the
moment
i
knew
that
reed
have
a
point
what
this
complex
mix
of
emotion
look
like
only
reed
know
but
it
must
have
look
pretty
remarkable
because
even
he
notice
that
he
need
to
say
something
nice
to
put
the
top
bun
on
the
shit
sandwich
don
t
be
upset
he
finally
blurt
out
i
have
tremendous
respect
and
affection
for
you
it
pain
me
to
be
so
harsh
there
be
a
million
good
thing
about
your
character
maturity
and
skill
that
i
admire
greatly
i
would
call
you
partner
proudly
reed
pause
again
i
could
tell
there
be
more
come
how
could
there
possibly
be
more
to
say
my
head
be
spin
i
need
some
time
to
process
this
reed
i
say
look
you
can
t
just
come
in
here
and
propose
take
over
the
company
and
expect
me
to
say
oh
how
logical
of
course
my
voice
be
get
high
again
so
i
stop
talk
i
m
not
propose
that
i
take
over
the
company
he
say
i
m
propose
that
we
run
it
together
as
a
team
there
be
a
pause
a
long
one
look
i
m
your
friend
no
matter
how
this
work
out
reed
finally
say
stand
up
but
if
this
be
something
that
you
be
dead
set
against
i
m
not
go
to
force
it
down
your
throat
even
though
in
my
position
as
a
shareholder
i
could
i
respect
you
too
much
to
do
that
if
you
don
t
believe
that
this
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
company
and
don
t
want
to
go
forward
this
way
i
m
fine
with
that
we
ll
just
sell
the
company
pay
back
the
investor
split
the
money
and
go
home
when
he
left
my
office
he
shut
the
door
quietly
behind
him
like
someone
leave
a
hospital
room
the
sun
be
set
but
i
didn
t
get
up
to
turn
on
the
light
i
sat
in
the
dark
until
almost
everyone
have
left
everyone
but
kho
who
amble
in
sometime
after
nine
whistle
and
drum
his
finger
on
a
grease
stain
pizza
box
radical
honesty
be
great
until
it
s
aim
at
you
i
m
not
go
to
lie
to
you
or
to
myself
what
reed
say
to
me
that
day
in
mid
september
hurt
it
really
hurt
not
because
reed
be
be
unkind
he
wasn
t
but
because
he
be
be
honest
brutally
astringently
rip
the
bandage
off
honest
this
be
radical
honesty
the
same
type
that
we
d
practice
from
the
begin
back
in
my
volvo
on
highway
reed
didn
t
have
an
ax
to
grind
or
any
ulterior
motive
he
be
driven
by
what
be
best
for
the
business
and
he
respect
me
too
much
to
do
anything
else
but
tell
the
complete
unvarnished
truth
he
be
just
do
what
we
d
always
do
with
each
other
and
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
the
powerpoint
touch
me
be
it
clumsy
yes
be
it
totally
like
reed
to
try
to
frame
a
delicate
emotionally
volatile
conversation
within
the
safe
confines
of
a
series
of
animate
slide
a
presentation
of
a
type
that
i
have
taught
him
to
deliver
also
yes
but
insult
no
i
could
see
now
that
he
be
out
of
the
room
and
i
be
sit
in
the
dark
that
reed
have
be
so
nervous
about
give
me
honest
feedback
that
he
d
need
a
prompt
a
set
of
write
reminder
something
to
make
him
feel
like
he
be
on
solid
ground
he
d
want
to
make
sure
that
he
do
it
right
he
want
to
make
sure
he
say
the
thing
that
need
to
be
say
they
be
hard
to
hear
but
it
be
even
harder
to
admit
to
myself
that
reed
be
right
i
be
have
problem
our
ivp
investment
have
almost
fall
apart
because
of
me
because
our
new
partner
knew
that
without
some
bold
stroke
born
of
dramatic
intuitive
and
confident
leadership
this
company
be
never
go
to
make
it
they
have
never
say
it
out
loud
but
it
be
probably
obvious
to
everyone
else
in
that
room
that
the
bold
stroke
the
dramatic
and
confident
and
intuitive
leadership
be
not
go
to
come
from
me
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
i
realize
that
my
dream
have
evolve
it
have
originally
be
a
single
dream
a
new
company
with
me
at
the
helm
but
sit
in
my
office
hearing
reed
articulate
where
i
be
fall
short
and
listen
to
him
make
the
case
for
why
the
company
need
both
of
us
together
at
the
helm
i
realize
that
there
be
really
two
dream
and
that
i
might
need
to
sacrifice
one
of
them
to
ensure
that
the
other
come
true
the
company
be
one
dream
me
at
the
helm
be
another
and
if
the
company
be
go
to
succeed
i
need
to
honestly
confront
my
own
limitation
i
need
to
acknowledge
that
i
be
a
builder
someone
creative
and
freewheel
enough
to
assemble
a
team
to
create
a
culture
to
launch
an
idea
from
the
back
of
an
envelope
into
a
company
an
office
a
product
that
exist
in
the
world
but
we
be
exit
that
initial
stage
now
we
be
go
to
have
to
grow
and
rapidly
and
that
take
a
different
skill
set
entirely
i
have
a
pretty
good
sense
of
my
skill
as
an
entrepreneur
i
don
t
think
i
m
toot
my
own
horn
to
say
that
i
m
in
the
th
percentile
i
knew
even
then
that
i
could
lead
the
company
as
it
grow
but
i
also
knew
even
then
that
reed
be
in
the
th
percentile
he
s
one
of
the
all
time
great
and
he
be
well
at
this
stage
of
thing
than
i
be
more
confident
more
focus
bolder
it
be
totally
obvious
to
me
that
when
it
come
to
our
most
press
and
urgent
need
money
reed
be
well
he
d
almost
singlehandedly
found
a
company
and
have
brought
it
through
an
ipo
as
ceo
he
be
a
know
quantity
investor
be
far
more
likely
to
bet
on
him
than
me
we
d
already
see
that
to
be
the
case
i
have
to
ask
myself
how
important
be
it
to
see
my
dream
come
true
and
be
it
even
my
dream
anymore
we
now
have
forty
employee
each
of
whom
be
as
emotionally
commit
as
i
be
to
make
netflix
a
success
they
stayed
late
work
weekend
miss
commitment
to
friend
and
family
all
in
service
to
something
that
have
begin
as
my
dream
but
which
god
bless
them
they
have
adopt
as
their
own
didn
t
i
owe
it
to
them
to
do
everything
i
could
to
ensure
that
we
survive
even
if
it
meant
that
my
role
would
no
longer
be
the
one
i
d
imagine
for
myself
what
be
more
important
my
title
or
their
job
i
stood
up
from
my
desk
and
walk
to
the
window
i
could
see
the
nearly
empty
parking
lot
the
flower
bed
at
its
perimeter
in
full
bloom
illuminate
by
the
orange
light
of
streetlamps
tomorrow
by
six
in
the
morning
that
lot
would
be
fill
up
with
toyota
subarus
and
vws
belonging
to
the
people
who
work
for
me
many
of
those
car
have
payment
attach
to
them
and
insurance
policy
bill
and
in
a
way
i
be
responsible
for
those
when
your
dream
becomes
a
reality
it
doesn
t
just
belong
to
you
it
belongs
to
the
people
who
help
you
your
family
your
friend
your
co
worker
it
belongs
to
the
world
look
at
those
car
in
the
parking
lot
i
really
knew
that
reed
be
right
that
the
ceo
president
arrangement
would
give
the
company
the
leadership
it
deserve
would
greatly
increase
our
odds
of
success
would
create
a
company
that
we
could
be
proud
of
for
the
rest
of
our
life
and
in
retrospect
of
course
reed
be
right
netflix
might
have
survive
with
me
continue
on
as
sole
ceo
but
you
don
t
write
a
book
about
a
company
that
survives
there
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
without
him
assume
more
of
a
leadership
role
netflix
would
not
have
become
the
company
it
be
today
paradoxically
if
i
hadn
t
relinquish
the
title
of
ceo
to
reed
in
i
wouldn
t
be
write
this
book
the
company
need
us
to
run
it
together
when
i
m
feel
down
and
need
to
remember
moment
of
courage
from
my
past
i
don
t
immediately
think
back
to
some
faraway
mountain
peak
a
dangerous
climb
or
a
treacherous
river
cross
i
don
t
even
think
back
to
those
morning
in
reed
s
car
or
the
first
meeting
in
hobee
s
when
i
be
try
to
convince
talented
and
reluctant
people
to
quit
their
job
for
a
crazy
and
illogical
venture
i
don
t
think
of
the
original
leap
of
faith
the
run
start
the
hundred
of
fail
test
with
no
indication
that
any
of
them
would
ever
work
i
think
of
leave
the
office
that
night
i
think
of
drive
slowly
home
through
the
empty
street
of
scott
valley
ready
to
tell
my
wife
that
i
d
decide
i
should
no
longer
be
sole
ceo
of
the
company
i
d
found
and
know
that
i
be
do
the
right
thing
by
now
you
know
that
chapter
in
the
netflix
story
rarely
end
neatly
all
wrap
up
in
a
tidy
red
and
black
ribbon
and
this
chapter
be
no
different
i
do
make
that
lonely
drive
home
and
i
do
sit
on
the
porch
with
lorraine
for
a
few
hour
that
night
a
bottle
of
wine
between
us
as
we
go
through
the
logic
and
emotion
of
my
decision
and
we
do
ultimately
decide
that
reed
s
proposal
be
the
right
thing
to
do
that
i
owe
it
to
my
employee
my
investor
and
myself
to
ensure
that
the
company
would
continue
to
be
successful
even
if
it
meant
step
down
as
sole
ceo
but
as
i
finish
turn
off
the
light
and
lorraine
carefully
load
our
wineglass
into
the
dishwasher
i
sat
down
at
the
kitchen
table
to
do
a
last
check
of
email
flash
at
the
top
of
the
in
box
be
an
email
from
reed
time
pm
subj
honesty
the
email
summarize
and
reiterate
the
afternoon
s
conversation
i
be
sure
it
be
essentially
a
transcription
of
the
powerpoint
slide
there
be
bullet
point
deal
with
my
strategic
sense
hire
financial
control
people
management
and
ability
to
raise
capital
now
that
i
d
have
time
to
think
about
what
reed
have
say
it
be
easy
to
see
it
in
write
my
eye
scan
to
the
end
i
sincerely
wish
thing
be
different
marc
for
both
of
our
sake
but
in
my
heart
of
heart
i
believe
everything
i
say
today
to
be
true
then
there
be
something
new
but
in
a
similar
vein
it
be
my
best
sense
that
the
right
thing
to
do
to
reflect
the
change
be
to
re
split
our
stock
option
ivp
invest
on
the
promise
that
we
could
execute
as
chairman
ceo
it
be
not
right
to
go
back
to
them
and
say
it
didn
t
work
that
we
need
another
m
option
for
me
i
couldn
t
believe
what
i
be
reading
in
the
sentence
that
follow
reed
be
say
that
in
order
to
come
in
as
ceo
he
need
more
option
and
bad
he
be
say
that
a
big
slug
of
those
share
should
come
from
me
that
i
should
give
up
some
of
my
equity
in
the
company
since
we
would
now
be
splitting
the
responsibility
that
s
bullshit
lorraine
shout
once
i
have
explain
to
her
what
reed
be
ask
for
you
guy
start
out
fifty
fifty
even
though
you
be
do
all
the
work
pull
sixty
hour
week
as
ceo
and
he
be
sit
on
his
as
as
chairman
now
that
he
actually
have
to
come
to
the
office
suddenly
the
fifty
fifty
isn
t
good
enough
lorraine
be
furious
shake
her
head
so
hard
i
thought
she
might
hurt
her
neck
i
try
to
calm
her
down
but
it
be
a
lose
cause
it
s
bullshit
she
kept
say
bullshit
that
s
all
after
she
stomp
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
i
sat
quietly
at
the
kitchen
table
and
carefully
close
the
lid
of
my
laptop
i
knew
it
would
take
me
a
while
to
get
to
sleep
there
be
a
thousand
thing
go
through
my
mind
how
we
d
break
the
news
to
the
rest
of
the
company
what
i
be
go
to
say
to
reed
the
next
day
about
the
option
how
my
role
would
change
in
the
come
month
and
how
i
d
deal
with
the
transition
the
future
of
the
company
stretch
before
me
daunt
and
open
and
although
i
couldn
t
say
that
night
that
i
be
at
peace
with
my
decision
i
knew
that
i
would
be
someday
soon
i
be
start
to
see
how
reed
and
i
could
work
together
to
make
the
company
a
success
i
could
practically
hear
the
engine
of
our
collaboration
start
to
hum

over
the
hill
spring
one
year
after
launch
we
move
the
company
to
los
gatos
in
march
of
the
new
office
be
just
over
the
hill
on
as
close
to
santa
cruz
as
you
could
get
and
still
be
in
the
valley
it
be
fourteen
minute
from
my
house
a
far
cry
from
the
five
minute
drive
i
d
grown
accustom
to
that
first
year
but
long
enough
to
get
three
or
sometimes
four
run
throughs
of
sweet
adeline
or
down
our
way
or
whatever
barbershop
quartet
song
i
be
work
on
at
the
time
let
me
explain
a
few
year
before
netflix
in
the
mid
ninety
lorraine
be
worried
that
i
be
burning
myself
out
she
suggest
i
get
a
hobby
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
work
you
always
sing
in
the
car
she
say
why
don
t
you
join
a
choir
i
not
only
join
a
choir
i
join
the
society
for
the
preservation
and
encouragement
of
barber
shop
quartet
sing
in
america
spebsqsa
for
short
no
woman
allow
they
have
their
own
group
the
sweet
adelines
the
society
have
chapter
all
over
the
world
and
the
closest
one
be
in
santa
cruz
every
tuesday
night
there
be
a
group
sing
in
the
community
room
of
the
felton
bible
church
anyone
who
be
a
member
of
spebsqsa
could
drop
in
and
because
of
the
standard
repertoire
there
wasn
t
any
confusion
once
you
knew
the
song
and
your
part
in
them
every
sing
start
with
the
old
song
the
official
theme
of
spebsqsa
after
that
the
director
would
call
out
different
song
sometimes
rely
on
member
request
and
after
two
hour
or
so
sometimes
we
d
go
out
for
a
beer
there
be
four
voice
range
in
barbershop
sing
tenor
be
the
high
follow
by
lead
baritone
and
bass
since
there
be
only
men
sing
there
be
no
alto
or
soprano
part
and
the
range
be
much
closer
together
that
lead
to
really
tight
harmony
singer
use
to
the
wider
range
of
mixed
choir
often
have
a
difficult
time
adjust
to
the
tricky
part
that
barbershop
demand
sing
in
a
big
mixed
choir
feel
like
be
in
an
orchestra
with
the
timpani
and
double
bass
in
the
back
and
the
flute
and
violin
in
the
front
but
barbershop
feel
more
like
a
guitar
one
person
play
chord
make
up
of
string
tune
pretty
close
together
in
timbre
and
pitch
i
love
sing
barbershop
i
love
feel
like
part
of
an
instrument
feel
a
chord
come
into
be
i
rarely
sang
the
lead
melody
instead
i
be
often
tasked
with
intricate
close
harmony
just
off
the
main
line
i
be
a
support
voice
completely
necessary
but
not
the
first
thing
you
heard
barbershop
s
like
that
it
s
a
truly
collaborative
form
take
out
any
of
the
part
and
the
song
doesn
t
sound
right
i
never
perform
in
public
with
spebsqsa
that
wasn
t
the
point
the
point
be
those
tuesday
night
i
attend
them
religiously
they
be
like
aa
meeting
for
me
except
instead
of
sad
story
and
burnt
coffee
there
be
joyful
old
timey
music
those
night
kept
me
sane
they
almost
drove
my
family
nut
though
to
practice
i
sang
along
to
barbershop
tape
in
the
car
special
tape
that
isolated
my
part
on
the
a
side
would
be
just
your
part
and
the
b
side
would
be
all
the
others
with
your
part
drop
out
the
idea
be
you
could
play
the
a
side
ten
time
in
a
row
to
really
nail
down
your
harmony
part
and
then
flip
the
tape
to
practice
sing
it
with
the
rest
of
the
ensemble
this
be
a
useful
technology
but
it
s
exceedingly
annoy
for
any
passenger
not
enamor
of
barbershop
quartet
like
my
son
stop
sing
logan
use
to
yell
strap
into
his
car
seat
with
his
hand
over
his
ear
no
more
sing
i
d
stop
but
when
i
be
alone
drive
to
and
from
work
i
really
let
it
rip
it
strike
me
now
that
those
morning
sing
session
be
useful
preparation
for
the
work
i
be
do
in
the
office
in
late
and
early
every
day
i
be
redefine
my
role
i
wasn
t
always
the
lead
voice
anymore
i
wasn
t
always
in
front
of
the
ensemble
but
i
be
part
of
a
group
and
we
be
make
a
big
beautiful
noise
together
i
be
learn
how
to
sing
a
tight
close
harmony
with
reed
officially
that
spring
my
title
be
president
day
to
day
little
about
my
job
have
change
i
be
still
in
charge
of
the
aspect
of
netflix
that
i
love
and
be
good
at
customer
relation
marketing
pr
web
design
all
the
movie
content
and
our
ongoing
relationship
with
dvd
player
manufacturer
reed
take
over
the
back
end
finance
operation
and
engineering
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
the
job
title
be
irrelevant
but
title
matter
to
vcs
and
i
wasn
t
stupid
i
knew
that
when
it
come
to
raise
money
for
a
rapidly
grow
and
still
not
profitable
startup
have
reed
as
ceo
be
one
of
our
best
asset
reed
s
presence
calm
the
board
and
reassure
potential
investor
that
spring
i
be
more
than
happy
to
take
a
backseat
pitch
our
company
i
do
what
i
do
best
help
reed
soften
his
edge
with
both
investor
and
employee
another
person
tasked
with
smooth
thing
over
where
reed
be
involve
be
patty
mccord
reed
have
brought
her
into
the
fold
to
run
hr
soon
after
we
announce
that
we
d
be
run
the
company
together
she
d
be
director
of
hr
at
pure
atrium
and
she
d
long
be
reed
s
right
hand
point
person
she
be
a
sort
of
reed
whisperer
she
understood
him
like
few
people
do
and
more
importantly
knew
how
to
nudge
him
into
social
nicety
reed
can
be
blunt
patty
can
be
too
but
she
s
blunt
in
a
charm
texan
way
she
understands
social
grace
patty
knew
that
reed
didn
t
always
notice
when
he
d
ruffle
someone
s
feather
and
that
he
be
often
oblivious
to
other
people
s
hurt
feeling
especially
people
who
didn
t
know
him
well
like
i
do
if
there
be
a
contentious
meeting
patty
knew
how
and
when
to
take
reed
aside
and
gently
suggest
that
maybe
he
should
apologize
for
call
somebody
s
idea
totally
unsupported
by
reason
once
i
overheard
her
tell
reed
that
our
executive
meeting
have
be
very
productive
before
ask
him
who
d
do
most
of
the
talk
marc
and
i
do
he
say
do
you
think
other
people
in
a
meeting
should
talk
too
reed
star
at
her
for
a
second
and
i
wonder
if
he
d
answer
he
nod
point
take
patty
s
role
go
far
beyond
merely
reed
however
it
s
hard
to
overstate
how
enormous
an
impact
she
make
on
netflix
as
director
of
hr
frankly
it
s
hard
to
overstate
the
impact
she
make
on
the
entire
field
of
human
resource
she
completely
redefine
it
i
ve
write
in
this
book
about
how
netflix
s
culture
at
least
originally
wasn
t
the
result
of
careful
planning
of
aspirational
principle
or
cultural
manifesto
how
it
be
a
reflection
of
the
share
value
and
behavior
of
the
founder
how
we
trust
each
other
work
hard
and
have
zero
patience
for
traditional
corporate
bullshit
all
of
that
be
true
but
what
happens
when
the
team
grows
when
a
company
be
small
trust
and
efficiency
go
hand
in
hand
if
you
ve
get
the
right
people
on
your
team
you
don
t
need
to
tell
them
exactly
how
you
want
them
to
do
thing
in
fact
you
often
don
t
even
need
to
tell
them
what
you
want
them
to
do
you
simply
need
to
be
clear
about
what
you
want
to
accomplish
and
why
it
s
important
if
you
hire
the
right
people
smart
capable
trustworthy
they
ll
figure
out
what
need
to
be
do
and
they
ll
go
ahead
and
do
it
they
ll
solve
problem
on
their
own
before
you
even
know
the
problem
exist
and
if
you
didn
t
hire
the
right
person
it
ll
be
apparent
really
quickly
our
early
culture
at
netflix
be
born
completely
out
of
how
reed
and
i
treat
each
other
we
didn
t
give
each
other
a
list
of
task
we
expect
the
other
to
be
do
and
then
check
in
frequently
to
make
sure
everything
get
do
we
just
make
sure
that
each
of
us
understood
the
company
s
objective
and
which
aspect
each
of
us
be
responsible
for
it
be
up
to
us
to
figure
out
what
need
to
be
do
to
accomplish
those
objective
and
it
be
up
to
us
to
be
honest
with
each
other
radically
honest
i
ve
write
about
what
that
look
like
or
more
accurately
what
it
sound
like
raise
voice
argumentative
meeting
blunt
statement
about
how
an
idea
be
stupid
or
wouldn
t
work
sometimes
it
be
hard
for
people
to
understand
that
reed
and
i
really
like
each
other
that
we
d
found
that
we
be
most
productive
when
we
drop
all
the
bullshit
and
just
say
what
we
meant
reed
and
i
have
be
do
this
since
those
early
day
in
the
car
on
and
we
d
never
stop
whether
it
be
just
the
two
of
us
or
a
twenty
person
departmental
meeting
we
felt
that
we
owe
it
to
the
company
and
each
other
to
make
sure
that
we
d
tease
out
the
proper
solution
or
more
accurately
beat
it
out
of
each
other
with
iron
and
billy
club
sometimes
the
discussion
would
become
so
boisterous
that
reed
and
i
would
lose
ourselves
totally
in
academic
gymnastics
finally
stop
only
when
we
realize
that
one
or
the
other
of
our
idea
or
more
usually
some
combination
of
the
two
be
obviously
the
solution
and
that
it
be
time
to
move
on
it
be
not
unusual
for
reed
and
i
to
look
up
after
a
particularly
loud
session
to
see
the
quiet
stun
face
of
our
colleague
around
the
table
with
expression
that
seem
to
ask
why
be
mommy
and
daddy
fight
but
they
get
use
to
it
radical
honesty
freedom
and
responsibility
these
be
phenomenal
ideal
but
for
our
first
couple
of
year
they
weren
t
really
write
down
we
approach
thing
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
here
s
an
example
at
some
point
in
one
of
our
engineering
manager
come
to
me
with
a
peculiar
request
his
girlfriend
have
move
to
san
diego
and
he
be
try
to
keep
their
relationship
on
stable
footing
how
would
you
feel
he
ask
if
i
left
work
early
on
friday
to
fly
down
to
san
diego
he
explain
that
he
would
work
from
there
on
monday
fly
back
home
monday
night
and
be
in
the
office
tuesday
morning
my
answer
probably
surprised
him
i
don
t
care
where
you
work
or
what
hour
you
work
work
from
mar
for
all
i
care
if
all
you
re
ask
me
be
about
when
you
work
and
where
you
do
it
that
s
an
easy
answer
it
make
no
difference
to
me
but
i
continued
if
what
you
re
really
ask
me
be
whether
i
m
willing
to
low
my
expectation
for
you
and
your
group
so
that
you
can
spend
time
with
your
girlfriend
well
that
s
an
easy
answer
too
no
he
look
at
me
uncertainly
i
could
see
his
dream
of
san
diego
weekend
fading
away
look
where
and
when
you
work
be
entirely
up
to
you
if
you
can
run
your
group
effectively
on
three
and
a
half
day
a
week
in
the
office
all
power
to
you
go
ahead
i
m
envious
wish
i
be
smart
enough
to
do
that
just
remember
you
re
a
manager
part
of
your
job
be
make
sure
that
your
team
know
what
you
want
them
to
accomplish
and
why
it
s
important
do
you
think
you
can
do
that
without
be
around
needle
to
say
his
girlfriend
be
a
free
agent
shortly
thereafter
i
give
that
engineer
freedom
to
make
a
choice
but
also
remind
him
of
his
responsibility
to
the
team
i
be
radically
honest
with
him
i
doubt
that
he
d
be
able
to
keep
up
his
end
of
the
deal
if
he
take
off
early
for
san
diego
every
week
but
ultimately
i
left
it
up
to
him
the
manager
felt
empower
free
to
make
a
choice
about
his
own
lifestyle
and
the
company
end
up
benefiting
from
his
renew
focus
everyone
won
well
almost
everyone
the
girlfriend
in
san
diego
probably
didn
t
see
it
the
way
i
do
freedom
and
responsibility
weren
t
just
for
manager
either
take
our
receptionist
for
example
when
he
start
the
job
there
wasn
t
a
seven
page
list
of
all
the
thing
he
could
do
or
not
do
all
day
keep
the
desk
clean
don
t
eat
at
the
desk
instead
his
job
description
be
a
single
sentence
put
the
best
face
forward
for
the
company
we
give
our
receptionist
a
clear
responsibility
and
near
total
freedom
to
figure
out
how
to
accomplish
it
it
be
entirely
up
to
him
what
hour
during
the
day
someone
need
to
be
there
up
to
him
to
figure
out
how
to
cover
when
he
be
away
or
sick
or
need
a
day
off
it
be
up
to
him
to
figure
out
which
behavior
didn
t
put
the
best
face
forward
for
the
company
like
eat
lunch
at
his
desk
and
which
help
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
that
he
bought
the
popcorn
machine
and
you
know
what
we
have
a
damn
good
receptionist
as
a
result
a
culture
of
freedom
and
responsibility
couple
with
radical
honesty
work
like
a
charm
not
only
do
we
get
great
result
but
employee
love
it
people
who
have
the
judgment
to
make
decision
responsibly
love
have
the
freedom
to
do
so
they
love
be
trust
but
that
just
make
sense
right
if
you
fill
your
company
with
people
who
lack
good
judgment
then
you
have
to
build
all
kind
of
guardrail
to
keep
them
in
line
you
have
to
define
everything
for
them
how
much
they
can
spend
on
office
supply
how
many
vacation
day
they
take
when
they
be
expect
to
be
at
their
desk
most
company
end
up
building
a
system
to
protect
themselves
from
people
who
lack
judgment
and
that
only
end
up
frustrate
the
people
who
have
it
remember
the
engineer
in
the
hot
tub
if
you
treat
people
like
child
it
doesn
t
matter
how
many
beanbag
chair
and
beer
party
you
throw
at
them
they
will
resent
you
in
we
be
grow
fast
and
we
be
still
hire
people
with
good
judgment
but
even
people
with
good
judgment
have
question
about
culture
and
rule
and
they
shouldn
t
always
have
to
find
me
or
reed
to
ask
them
we
start
to
ask
ourselves
what
if
you
could
build
a
process
that
be
meant
for
people
who
have
great
judgment
what
if
you
could
free
them
from
all
the
petty
restriction
that
drive
the
top
performer
crazy
how
can
we
scale
up
this
set
of
ideal
that
come
so
naturally
to
us
so
that
a
grow
company
can
benefit
from
them
how
do
you
codify
culture
that
s
where
patty
mccord
come
in
she
be
brilliant
at
push
the
boundary
of
rule
and
freedom
she
identify
that
what
be
special
at
netflix
be
our
particular
combination
of
freedom
and
responsibility
and
then
she
endeavor
to
put
structure
in
place
not
to
limit
freedom
but
to
encourage
and
preserve
it
how
far
can
you
take
freedom
how
do
you
ensure
share
responsibility
patty
come
down
on
the
side
of
common
sense
for
example
if
you
be
travel
for
work
common
sense
say
there
have
to
be
some
mechanism
for
expense
reimbursement
but
none
of
us
want
lengthy
time
consume
and
ultimately
pointless
approval
process
for
it
if
we
be
trust
them
to
make
decision
on
the
company
s
behalf
that
could
make
or
lose
million
of
dollar
we
could
certainly
trust
them
to
make
decision
about
what
type
of
plane
ticket
they
should
book
for
themselves
same
with
vacation
day
we
hadn
t
kept
track
of
them
before
because
we
didn
t
need
to
the
attitude
be
if
you
need
to
take
a
day
off
just
take
it
i
don
t
need
to
know
about
your
root
canal
or
your
kid
s
school
schedule
just
get
your
work
do
and
cover
for
yourself
when
you
re
go
but
when
a
company
have
fifty
employee
thing
get
more
complicate
people
want
to
know
what
they
can
and
can
t
do
patty
could
have
just
replicate
the
standard
of
the
time
fourteen
day
per
year
paid
time
off
instead
she
be
curious
if
we
want
our
employee
to
take
time
off
when
they
need
it
why
couldn
t
we
also
let
them
decide
how
much
time
to
take
and
when
to
take
it
what
if
we
didn
t
have
a
set
number
of
vacation
day
what
if
we
just
trust
our
employee
to
get
thing
do
unlimited
vacation
day
and
hassle
free
expense
reimbursement
be
almost
clich
s
now
but
they
be
groundbreaking
at
the
time
in
netflix
patty
saw
an
opportunity
to
redefine
the
role
of
hr
department
no
longer
be
hr
just
a
lonely
cubicle
fill
with
employee
handbook
sexual
harassment
claim
and
benefit
summary
instead
she
envision
the
department
as
a
proactive
agent
for
culture
she
saw
an
opening
and
she
drove
a
truck
through
it
she
dismantle
all
the
system
we
have
in
place
that
limited
the
amount
of
freedom
we
grant
our
employee
and
design
system
that
be
almost
totally
on
the
side
of
employee
freedom
she
fought
hard
to
ensure
that
we
didn
t
inadvertently
create
new
paradigm
that
collar
our
worker
while
also
implement
structure
that
make
it
clear
what
we
expect
from
them
part
of
why
she
be
so
successful
be
because
she
held
everyone
include
senior
leadership
accountable
it
didn
t
matter
who
you
be
patty
would
call
you
on
your
bullshit
she
be
never
afraid
to
speak
truth
to
power
she
knew
how
to
do
something
rare
scale
up
culture
a
good
example
remember
new
employee
dress
up
day
i
d
long
assume
that
they
would
fall
by
the
wayside
as
we
get
big
ask
someone
to
make
a
costume
and
endure
a
fake
interview
be
easy
when
you
re
only
hire
one
person
a
week
but
once
we
have
five
six
or
a
dozen
new
hire
every
week
it
wasn
t
all
that
practical
but
patty
saw
the
value
in
a
quirky
film
orient
ritual
so
she
make
it
easy
and
more
efficient
she
fill
an
entire
room
in
the
new
office
with
dozen
and
dozen
of
film
related
costume
batman
outfit
wonder
woman
cape
cowboy
hat
and
fake
six
shooter
fit
for
a
western
new
hire
still
have
to
dress
up
but
everybody
have
the
same
pool
of
outfit
to
wear
the
pressure
be
off
it
be
just
fun
patty
also
smooth
over
some
of
our
rougher
edge
she
try
to
anyway
for
example
one
of
the
only
piece
of
decoration
in
my
office
be
an
austin
power
international
man
of
mystery
promotional
poster
that
a
movie
studio
have
sent
me
it
depict
the
entire
text
of
dr
evil
s
soliloquy
to
his
therapist
halfway
through
the
film
in
which
he
recount
in
baroque
language
his
bizarre
childhood
describes
in
detail
his
comically
insane
father
and
rhapsodizes
about
the
breathtaking
feel
of
a
shorn
scrotum
i
knew
it
wasn
t
the
most
hr
friendly
wall
hang
but
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
love
that
movie
and
that
scene
make
me
snort
with
laughter
it
become
an
inside
joke
between
patty
and
me
every
time
she
popped
her
head
into
my
office
and
saw
my
poster
she
d
stifle
a
laugh
and
order
me
to
take
it
down
and
i
would
at
least
until
her
back
be
turn
then
i
d
put
it
right
back
up
just
because
netflix
be
grow
and
have
an
honest
to
god
hr
person
didn
t
mean
that
we
couldn
t
have
a
little
fun
in
the
office
case
in
point
a
little
game
we
call
coin
in
the
fountain
i
don
t
remember
who
come
up
with
it
all
i
remember
be
that
the
male
employee
of
netflix
played
it
constantly
the
rule
be
simple
you
put
a
coin
in
the
bottom
of
the
urinal
the
next
person
to
use
the
facility
would
see
it
and
either
ignore
it
or
reach
into
the
bowl
and
take
it
it
be
a
sort
of
sociological
experiment
how
much
money
would
it
take
for
someone
to
do
something
disgust
and
unsanitary
and
reach
into
the
bowl
the
game
only
work
of
course
if
not
everyone
knew
they
be
play
but
whoever
seed
the
urinal
would
usually
tip
me
off
we
learn
a
lot
of
interest
thing
about
human
nature
play
that
game
for
instance
a
quarter
would
disappear
much
more
quickly
than
three
dime
no
one
would
touch
paper
money
unless
the
denomination
be
over
five
dollar
the
high
cash
value
ever
achieve
be
when
someone
threw
in
a
twenty
dollar
bill
it
languish
in
the
urinal
all
day
and
be
still
there
when
i
left
at
six
for
dinner
with
my
family
but
when
i
come
back
to
the
office
later
at
eight
or
nine
it
be
go
i
still
have
my
suspicion
another
game
we
like
to
play
involve
the
kitchen
it
be
a
typical
mid
s
setup
the
sort
of
thing
you
might
recognize
from
dilbert
cartoon
or
the
office
refrigerator
stock
with
forgotten
tupperware
microwave
stain
by
dozen
of
explode
popcorn
bag
this
be
year
before
nitro
cold
brew
tap
dominate
the
kitchen
space
of
american
startup
we
be
decidedly
more
old
school
no
on
site
chef
for
us
most
of
us
brought
our
lunch
to
work
this
game
be
also
a
kind
of
willpower
test
but
in
reverse
and
with
snack
it
arose
from
a
common
problem
with
share
kitchen
and
communal
food
anytime
anyone
brought
a
snack
to
share
among
the
whole
office
a
dozen
donut
from
the
shop
down
the
street
or
a
bowl
full
of
leftover
halloween
candy
it
would
vanish
within
minute
that
s
what
long
hour
and
stress
will
do
to
you
crumple
fun
size
milky
way
wrapper
and
powder
sugar
litter
the
tabletop
mere
second
after
a
batch
of
snack
have
be
drop
off
eventually
we
make
a
game
out
of
it
be
it
possible
to
bring
a
snack
that
would
last
more
than
a
few
minute
in
the
kitchen
could
you
bring
something
that
would
get
eat
but
only
over
the
course
of
an
entire
day
the
challenge
wasn
t
to
bring
a
food
item
so
disgust
that
no
one
would
touch
it
that
would
have
be
too
easy
just
bring
rock
the
point
be
to
bring
something
just
strange
or
unpalatable
enough
that
it
would
eventually
disappear
but
would
take
an
entire
workday
to
do
so
you
have
to
walk
a
tightrope
between
delicious
and
unsavory
familiar
and
strange
here
s
an
example
one
day
i
brought
in
a
huge
bag
of
dry
shrimp
and
seaweed
from
the
asian
market
in
sunnyvale
delicious
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
but
pungent
strange
look
and
most
definitely
not
for
everybody
i
open
the
bag
and
fill
one
of
our
popcorn
bowl
with
the
stuff
then
camped
out
at
a
table
with
a
good
view
of
the
kitchen
within
second
boris
have
sidle
up
to
the
bowl
and
his
mind
elsewhere
work
on
some
cod
problem
in
his
head
reach
in
for
a
handful
the
look
on
his
face
when
he
realize
that
he
wasn
t
eat
popcorn
or
m
m
s
be
priceless
i
cackle
inwardly
for
the
next
three
hour
i
watch
as
te
christina
and
the
rest
of
the
office
amble
up
taste
a
bit
of
the
sea
and
left
after
one
bite
the
only
person
who
show
absolutely
no
reaction
to
the
shrimp
be
one
of
the
engineer
he
take
a
little
bowl
of
them
back
to
his
desk
and
snack
away
happily
they
last
until
five
another
time
i
brought
in
a
dozen
balut

day
then

obvious
reason

preservation
and

dark
green

a
silicon

big
enough
to
grow
in
whenever

somebody
new

we
d
come
to
a
d
tente
on
the
issue
of
the
share
in
the
end
i
d
agree
that
a
third
of
the
share
reed
want
if
he
be
to
come
in
as
ceo
would
come
from

the
other
two
third
he

go
to
have
to
ask
the
board
for
which
he
do
and
which
he
get
that
spring
soon
after
the
move
reed
have
brought
in
two
major
hire
who
make
a
huge
impact
on
the
business
barry
mccarthy
be
the
first
one
a
season
executive
and
former
investment
banker
he
d
be
work
as
the
cfo
of
music
choice
which
piped
music
into
home
through
a
set
top
cable
box
he
have
an
mba
from
wharton
and
decade
of
experience
as
a
consultant
and
investment
banker
he
be
unlike
anyone
in
the
office
a
hard
edge
east
coast
preppy
with
a
diploma
from
williams
college
in
the
short
and
sandal
world
of
los
gatos
his
brook
brother
blazer
stuck
out
like
a
sore
thumb
which
be
i
suspect
exactly
why
reed
like
him
i
like
him
because
he
be
smart
no
nonsense
and
efficient
also
he
call
me
mr
founder
even
after
i
told
him
to
say
marc
barry
s
arrival
spell
the
end
of
jim
cook
s
time
at
netflix
jim
have
always
from
the
start
want
to
be
the
cfo
and
once
barry
come
in
it
be
clear
that
it
would
never
happen
his
departure
wasn
t
dramatic
these
thing
rarely
be
but
it
underscored
what
be
happen
that
spring
and
summer
the
startup
team
be
start
to
peel
off
and
the
next
phase
be
replace
them
this
be
one
of
the
fact
of
startup
life
change
when
you
re
building
something
from
nothing
you
rely
on
talented
passionate
generalist
people
who
can
do
a
little
bit
of
everything
who
buy
into
the
mission
and
whom
you
trust
with
your
time
money
and
idea
but
once
you
ve
go
from
to
and
the
seed
you
ve
plant
be
start
to
grow
some
shuffle
happens
often
the
person
who
be
right
for
the
job
at
the
begin
be
not
right
for
the
middle
sometimes
bring
in
people
with
decade
of
experience
and
institutional
know
how
be
the
necessary
thing
to
do
that
be
definitely
the
case
with
tom
dillon
whom
we
brought
in
as
head
of
operation
after
jim
left
in
early
tom
be
semi
retire
in
his
mid
fifty
and
have
spent
his
entire
life
manage
global
distribution
for
massive
company
most
recently
as
chief
information
officer
at
seagate
and
candescent
these
be
huge
business
seagate
in
particular
be
massive
and
complex
they
have
twenty
four
factory
all
over
the
world
staffed
by
more
than
employee
it
s
hard
to
fathom
what
it
take
to
be
in
charge
of
tech
for
a
company
of
that
size
and
scale
even
more
amaze
tom
preside
over
a
time
when
seagate
decide
to
automate
all
its
factory
which
allow
the
company
to
cut
the
number
of
factory
and
employee
in
half
i
don
t
know
where
patty
mccord
found
him
but
i
think
tom
be
one
of
the
most
important
hire
that
netflix
ever
make
i
m
still
kind
of
astound
that
we
get
him
we
be
do
two
thousand
movie
a
week
all
ship
within
the
united
state
and
this
be
a
guy
who
have
overseen
company
do
million
of
shipment
all
over
the
world
frankly
he
be
way
beyond
our
pay
grade
literally
we
could
only
pay
him
about
twenty
percent
of
what
he
be
probably
use
to
but
tom
dillon
s
a
different
kind
of
cat
he
s
a
total
type
b
personality
surprising
for
someone
charge
with
the
extreme
detail
work
his
job
require
a
tall
somewhat
shamble
fellow
he
have
a
big
beard
and
a
shock
of
recede
white
hair
he
favor
loose
clothes
and
laid
back
joke
i
never
saw
him
stress
he
be
like
a
real
life
embodiment
of
jeff
bridge
as
the
dude
in
the
big
lebowski
everyone
s
favorite
stoner
grandpa
tom
dillon
abide
he
saw
our
little
company
as
a
kind
of
retirement
hobby
i
think
he
like
the
challenge
i
mean
we
have
one
warehouse
and
be
still
sort
everything
by
hand
on
card
table
it
be
like
hire
mile
davis
to
play
your
kid
s
bar
mitzvah
we
have
a
new
office
fill
with
new
face
but
we
have
the
same
old
problem
no
one
want
to
rent
dvd
from
us
sound
insane
doesn
t
it
within
a
year
netflix
would
be
almost
synonymous
with
rental
but
from
to
the
only
way
we
could
convince
people
to
rent
dvd
from
us
be
to
do
it
for
free
we
be
a
year
and
a
half
in
and
we
d
try
everything
we
could
think
of
rent
one
get
one
free
give
a
way
bundle
promotion
we
d
try
every
single
possible
home
page
design
we
could
think
of
but
we
be
come
up
short
we
still
hadn
t
developed
a
way
of
obtain
customer
and
then
a
way
of
get
them
to
come
back
that
make
more
money
than
it
cost
to
acquire
them
in
the
first
place
not
exactly
a
stellar
business
plan
but
amazon
as
we
d
always
know
they
would
have
start
sell
dvd
the
previous
november
and
after
a
few
month
of
direct
our
customer
to
amazon
when
they
want
to
buy
reed
have
quietly
shelve
the
initiative
we
d
invest
hundred
of
hour
add
amazon
link
to
our
site
all
design
to
send
our
customer
to
amazon
to
buy
their
dvd
we
fully
expect
them
to
make
the
same
effort
push
their
customer
back
to
us
to
rent
but
the
return
have
be
paltry
amazon
s
link
back
to
us
be
lackluster
and
hard
to
find
we
be
send
them
ten
of
thousand
of
customer
they
be
send
us
hundred
when
the
deal
collapse
reed
inform
us
that
it
have
never
be
that
important
everyone
be
crestfallen
especially
christina
from
the
begin
she
have
oppose
the
deal
but
as
always
she
d
be
a
complete
team
player
and
have
work
hard
on
the
netflix
end
a
lot
of
conversation
with
reed
and
with
patty
be
need
to
get
him
to
realize
how
demoralize
it
could
be
when
you
make
something
a
priority
ask
people
to
break
their
back
do
something
they
didn
t
agree
with
and
then
didn
t
honor
the
work
they
put
in
also
demoralize
be
the
fact
that
without
new
renter
from
amazon
and
now
without
dvd
sale
to
keep
us
afloat
we
be
hemorrhage
money
reed
and
i
put
on
a
good
face
in
front
of
our
team
spin
our
depress
result
as
a
kind
of
blessing
if
we
be
ever
go
to
figure
out
a
way
to
make
netflix
work
we
point
out
the
company
have
to
focus
on
one
thing
and
that
thing
be
rental
by
the
summer
of
thing
have
reach
a
break
point
i
be
spending
most
of
my
lunch
break
jogging
through
the
park
next
to
our
office
hop
that
at
some
point
during
my
sweaty
peregrination
on
the
los
gatos
creek
trail
i
d
land
on
a
solution
that
would
keep
people
rent
from
us
there
be
one
idea
i
couldn
t
shake
on
one
of
my
last
trip
to
our
warehouse
in
san
jose
i
notice
that
we
have
thousand
no
ten
of
thousand
of
disc
just
sit
unused
and
unwatched
on
the
warehouse
shelf
when
i
come
back
to
the
office
and
share
my
observation
with
reed
it
spark
another
interest
reed
and
marc
conversation
why
be
we
store
all
those
dvd
in
a
warehouse
maybe
we
could
figure
out
a
way
to
let
our
customer
store
the
disc
at
their
house
on
their
shelf
just
keep
the
dvd
as
long
as
they
want
what
if
we
do
away
with
late
fee
the
more
we
thought
about
this
idea
the
more
we
like
it
we
knew
that
one
of
the
big
problem
with
our
current
rental
program
be
that
it
rely
on
a
somewhat
organize
prepared
renter
someone
who
thought
several
day
in
advance
about
what
they
might
want
to
watch
in
other
word
pretty
much
nobody
that
any
of
us
knew
most
people
and
loath
as
i
be
to
admit
it
i
include
myself
in
this
category
figure
out
what
movie
they
want
to
watch
right
around
the
time
they
pull
into
the
parking
spot
in
front
of
blockbuster
and
in
my
world
that
would
have
be
consider
prepared
most
people
make
the
decision
what
to
rent
about
ten
second
after
they
spot
it
on
the
new
release
rack
but
if
they
could
keep
the
disc
as
long
as
they
want
that
change
thing
now
they
could
let
that
disc
sit
on
top
of
the
tv
as
long
as
need
and
when
the
mood
struck
that
it
be
time
to
watch
a
movie
it
would
be
instantaneous
even
faster
than
drive
to
a
blockbuster
and
if
you
have
a
bunch
of
movie
sit
there
you
could
choose
what
to
watch
base
on
your
mood
be
the
thin
blue
line
a
little
bit
too
intense
after
a
hard
day
at
the
office
fine
let
it
languish
luckily
groundhog
day
be
happy
to
step
into
the
breach
and
lift
your
mood
in
a
single
stroke
this
would
completely
turn
our
big
weakness
into
our
great
strength
and
when
they
be
do
with
a
disc
here
we
weren
t
sure
what
should
happen
well
what
if
user
simply
mail
the
disc
to
the
next
renter
a
peer
to
peer
approach
in
other
word
we
be
basically
pull
thing
out
of
our
ass
but
by
mid
summer
after
week
of
debate
and
about
a
hundred
mile
of
run
we
d
come
up
with
three
idea
that
we
didn
t
think
be
total
trash
they
be
the
home
rental
library
when
we
sent
out
an
informal
e
mail
survey
about
the
possibility
of
eliminate
late
fee
we
d
gotten
a
warm
response
so
we
d
design
a
format
that
allow
user
to
rent
four
dvd
at
a
time
for
a
month
and
keep
them
as
long
as
they
want
as
soon
as
they
have
return
one
of
the
dvd
they
could
come
back
to
the
site
and
rent
another
serialize
delivery
we
suspect
that
we
might
have
problem
with
the
come
back
to
the
site
and
rent
another
part
people
be
busy
once
a
watch
dvd
be
in
the
mailbox
it
would
be
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
so
maybe
we
could
have
each
customer
create
a
list
of
dvd
they
want
that
way
when
they
return
a
dvd
to
us
we
could
automatically
te
use
the
term
auto
magically
send
them
the
next
movie
on
their
list
i
suggest
we
call
our
list
the
queue
i
knew
that
queue
meant
line
but
i
also
love
the
idea
that
i
could
call
the
help
section
for
this
feature
queue
tip
subscription
have
people
hold
on
to
our
disc
for
as
long
as
they
want
seem
good
for
customer
but
we
weren
t
sure
what
the
business
model
should
be
do
you
pay
a
rental
fee
each
time
you
swap
what
if
you
never
send
one
back
we
decide
that
we
should
test
a
monthly
fee
that
we
charge
you
every
month
you
use
the
service
our
plan
be
to
test
each
of
these
initiative
separately
to
see
what
work
and
what
didn
t
we
d
do
this
from
the
begin
at
netflix
we
d
design
our
site
so
that
the
impact
of
even
the
slightest
change
could
be
measure
and
quantify
we
d
learn
before
launch
how
to
test
efficiently
it
didn
t
matter
in
the
end
how
great
a
test
look
there
could
be
broken
link
miss
picture
misspell
word
you
name
it
what
matter
be
the
idea
if
it
be
a
bad
idea
even
more
attention
to
detail
in
our
test
wasn
t
go
to
make
it
a
good
one
and
if
it
be
a
good
idea
people
would
immediately
fight
to
take
advantage
of
it
despite
obstacle
or
sloppiness
on
our
end
face
with
a
problem
on
our
website
they
would
try
again
and
again
to
make
it
work
they
would
reboot
the
site
try
to
find
a
way
to
work
around
the
problem
call
us
up
to
place
their
order
and
we
have
an
unlisted
number
if
people
want
what
you
have
they
will
break
down
your
door
leap
over
broken
link
and
beg
you
for
more
if
they
don
t
want
what
you
ve
get
change
the
color
palette
won
t
make
a
damn
bit
of
difference
so
by
mid
we
be
old
pro
at
test
we
could
do
it
quickly
but
even
quickly
each
test
would
take
about
two
week
when
i
ran
this
by
reed
he
look
at
me
like
i
be
crazy
that
make
no
sense
he
say
we
don
t
have
the
time
for
that
listen
i
told
him
we
ve
get
to
do
something
we
can
t
retain
anyone
and
no
one
s
rent
and
exactly
that
s
why
you
should
just
test
everything
at
once
reed
say
cut
me
off
i
start
to
argue
but
then
i
remember
the
previous
year
of
test
it
wasn
t
a
bad
idea
and
it
fit
in
with
our
ethos
of
faster
more
frequent
test
we
be
always
try
to
avoid
one
of
the
number
one
pitfall
of
startup
entrepreneurship
building
imaginary
castle
in
your
mind
meticulously
design
complete
with
turret
drawbridge
moat
overplanning
and
overdesigning
be
often
just
overthinking
or
just
plain
old
procrastination
when
it
come
to
idea
it
s
more
efficient
to
test
ten
bad
one
than
spend
day
try
to
come
up
with
something
perfect
what
the
hell
i
thought
i
told
christina
and
eric
to
combine
all
three
test
into
one
offer
at
this
point
we
have
a
pretty
good
flow
of
customer
come
to
our
site
to
redeem
their
free
rental
coupon
so
it
wouldn
t
take
long
to
get
some
result
we
set
it
up
so
that
every
tenth
customer
click
the
redeem
button
on
the
site
would
be
direct
to
a
custom
page
offering
them
the
opportunity
to
try
for
free
a
monthly
subscription
to
the
netflix
marquee
program
no
due
date
no
late
fee
we
would
send
them
four
dvd
and
when
they
sent
one
dvd
back
we
would
send
them
another
one
as
many
time
as
they
want
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
if
they
didn
t
cancel
we
would
automatically
and
here
it
be
me
describe
it
as
automagically
hit
them
up
for
only
a
month
payable
by
any
major
credit
card
home
rental
library
serialize
delivery
subscription
just
the
last
three
halfway
decent
idea
we
d
have
thrown
into
one
pot
this
probably
won
t
work
i
told
christina
but
hey
at
least
we
ll
know

nobody
know
anything
fall
a
year
and
a
half
after
launch
it
work
people
didn
t
just
like
no
late
fee
a
flat
monthly
rate
plus
serialize
delivery
with
a
queue
they
love
it
the
first
day
of
the
test
percent
of
the
people
who
clicked
on
the
banner
ad
give
us
their
credit
card
information
that
s
insane
i
d
expect
something
closer
to
percent
that
s
usually
what
happens
when
you
ask
someone
for
sixteen
digit
even
if
they
re
get
a
month
free
and
can
cancel
before
any
charge
and
it
wasn
t
a
fluke
day
after
day
the
sign
up
rate
be
that
high
visitor
to
the
website
be
signing
up
for
subscription
at
four
or
five
time
the
rate
they
have
chosen
our
la
carte
rental
if
people
saw
this
new
offer
they
be
take
the
bait
hook
line
and
sinker
we
scramble
to
build
a
service
that
could
actually
do
what
we
be
promising
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
to
figure
out
how
to
run
a
roll
serialize
delivery
system
alongside
our
normal
operation
how
to
do
automatic
subscription
billing
how
to
build
a
serviceable
queue
system
but
within
a
week
the
result
be
so
positive
that
we
knew
we
have
a
winner
several
time
a
day
i
d
pop
over
to
suresh
s
desk
suresh
extract
all
the
important
data
from
the
river
of
information
we
create
each
day
and
put
it
into
a
form
that
we
could
all
digest
and
play
with
i
m
sure
he
grow
to
dread
my
caffeinated
approach
to
his
desk
my
jittery
request
for
number
but
i
want
to
know
be
there
more
than
yesterday
few
how
many
be
signing
up
for
the
plan
how
many
saw
it
and
ignore
it
where
in
the
process
be
they
drop
off
we
d
know
for
sure
after
a
month
when
people
who
have
sign
up
for
their
free
trial
and
give
us
their
credit
card
information
could
cancel
their
subscription
but
thing
be
look
up
it
have
take
hundred
of
fail
experiment
thousand
of
hour
of
work
and
many
million
of
dollar
but
it
appear
that
we
have
finally
come
up
with
a
workable
model
for
dvd
rental
by
mail
no
one
be
more
surprised
than
me
not
only
have
i
fought
against
take
the
risk
of
test
all
three
of
our
idea
simultaneously
but
this
be
perhaps
the
least
likely
solution
i
could
ever
have
imagine
if
you
have
ask
me
on
launch
day
to
describe
what
netflix
would
eventually
look
like
i
never
would
have
come
up
with
a
monthly
subscription
service
even
if
you
have
try
to
make
it
easy
for
me
and
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
three
part
multiple
choice
question
i
still
would
have
have
a
one
in
three
shot
at
pick
the
right
answer
a
few
day
after
we
launch
the
test
lorraine
brought
the
kid
over
to
los
gatos
for
lunch
no
more
jogging
for
now
instead
we
order
a
pizza
and
have
a
picnic
in
the
park
afterward
logan
morgan
and
i
climbed
up
into
the
steam
power
train
that
ran
along
the
park
s
periphery
lorraine
slid
into
the
row
behind
us
hold
a
grunt
hunter
as
we
circle
the
lake
in
the
middle
of
the
park
and
i
talk
through
our
excite
new
idea
with
lorraine
i
thought
of
my
father
set
up
his
steam
power
train
in
the
basement
and
call
me
down
to
watch
the
wheel
turn
guess
i
be
wrong
huh
lorraine
say
when
i
told
her
about
the
initial
number
this
thing
be
gonna
take
off
isn
t
it
i
really
think
so
i
say
but
don
t
feel
bad
it
wasn
t
that
good
of
an
idea
a
few
year
ago
and
besides
nobody
know
anything
lorraine
laugh
she
knew
i
be
quote
william
goldman
whose
book
adventure
in
the
screen
trade
we
d
both
just
finish
you
might
not
have
heard
of
goldman
he
writes
screenplay
so
he
largely
labor
behind
the
scene
and
out
of
the
headline
people
of
my
generation
can
thank
him
for
write
butch
cassidy
and
the
sundance
kid
those
a
bit
young
may
have
enjoy
the
script
he
write
for
the
princess
bride
he
also
do
misery
heat
magic
marathon
man
the
general
s
daughter
and
over
twenty
five
more
he
s
won
two
academy
award
for
screenwriting
but
william
goldman
be
most
famous
for
write
three
word
nobody
know
anything
accord
to
goldman
those
three
word
be
the
key
to
understand
everything
about
hollywood
nobody
really
know
how
well
a
movie
be
go
to
do
until
after
it
s
already
do
it
for
instance
how
be
it
possible
that
you
can
have
a
film
direct
by
an
academy
award
win
director
michael
cimino
star
a
best
actor
academy
award
winner
christopher
walken
with
a
can
t
miss
script
and
a
million
budget
and
end
up
with
heaven
s
gate
one
of
the
big
hollywood
flop
of
all
time
on
the
other
hand
how
can
you
have
a
film
with
a
first
time
director
a
handful
of
amateur
actor
no
script
at
all
a
budget
under
and
end
up
with
the
blair
witch
project
which
after
gross
more
than
million
be
one
of
the
most
successful
independent
film
of
all
time
there
s
a
simple
explanation
it
s
because
nobody
know
anything
and
it
s
not
just
in
hollywood
it
s
true
in
silicon
valley
too
nobody
know
anything
isn
t
an
indictment
it
s
a
reminder
an
encouragement
because
if
nobody
know
anything
if
it
s
truly
impossible
to
know
in
advance
which
idea
be
the
good
one
and
which
aren
t
if
it
s
impossible
to
know
who
be
go
to
succeed
and
who
isn
t
then
any
idea
could
be
the
one
to
succeed
if
nobody
know
anything
then
you
have
to
trust

silicon

brainstorming
session
often
begin
with
someone
say
there
be
no
bad
idea
i
ve
always
disagreed
there
be
bad
idea
but
you
don
t
know
an
idea
be
bad
until
you
ve
try
it
and
as
netflix
show
sometimes
bad
idea
have
a
way
of
become
good
one
not
only
have
all
the
people
who
told
me
that
netflix
would
never
work
include
my
wife
gotten
it
wrong
but
so
have
i
we
all
have
we
d
all
know
that
the
idea
could
work
but
in
the
end
nobody
knew
anything
about
how
until
it
do
we
have
conceive
of
netflix
as
an
online
version
of
mitch
s
video
droid
a
video
store
informally
we
even
call
it
that
we
never
call
netflix
com
a
website
or
a
rental
service
it
be
still
always
the
store
but
now
we
have
a
new
model
one
we
never
could
have
brainstorm
into
existence
the
most
revolutionary
structure
in
e
commerce
be
the
result
of
year
of
work
thousand
of
hour
of
brainstorm
dire
finance
and
an
impatient
ceo
the
subscription
model
save
netflix
and
quickly
come
to
define
it
but
it
wasn
t
something
that
we
thought
our
way
toward
it
wasn
t
something
anyone
could
have
predict
ahead
of
time
it
take
a
lot
of
hard
work
a
lot
of
hard
thought
it
also
take
a
lot
of
card
fall
just
right
other
people
call
that
luck
i
call
it
nobody
know
anything
a
subscription
model
have
the
potential
to
solve
a
lot
of
our
problem
but
it
also
provide
a
number
of
new
one
the
first
be
our
exist
promotion
i
have
finally
convince
the
dvd
manufacturer
to
include
our
coupon
in
their
box
after
they
d
say
no
countless
time
i
have
promise
them
that
we
could
be
count
on
to
fulfill
our
promise
and
now
as
a
result
there
be
hundred
of
thousand
of
coupon
promising
free
dvd
rental
in
circulation
and
due
to
the
lag
in
the
dvd
manufacturer
supply
chain
they
would
be
come
out
of
the
woodwork
for
year
we
knew
that
the
best
way
to
jump
start
our
subscription
program
would
be
to
substitute
every
request
for
free
dvd
rental
with
a
free
month
of
unlimited
rental
fulfil
through
marquee
but
would
customer
accept
that
or
would
they
consider
it
a
bait
and
switch
we
be
also
worried
about
the
manufacturer
themselves
who
would
have
every
right
to
insist
that
we
fulfill
the
term
of
the
coupon
to
the
letter
the
second
issue
be
our
first
month
free
promotion
in
which
we
give
each
customer
a
free
month
to
evaluate
the
program
for
themselves
before
have
to
decide
to
continue
pay
for
it
we
like
the
free
month
plan
it
have
brought
thousand
of
new
user
to
our
service
but
we
couldn
t
quite
agree
on
what
be
go
to
happen
after
that
first
month
how
could
we
convert
user
take
advantage
of
a
promotion
into
pay
customer
you
could
always
just
ask
them
if
they
want
to
continue
but
i
felt
strongly
that
we
should
utilize
a
negative
option
that
be
not
even
ask
instead
we
would
automatically
roll
customer
into
their
next
month
of
membership
and
bill
their
credit
card
unless
they
proactively
cancel
you
see
this
all
the
time
now
amazon
prime
and
virtually
every
subscription
plan
do
it
but
at
the
time
it
seem
like
an
overly
aggressive
money
grab
verge
on
sleazy
reed
hat
it
the
third
issue
be
our
la
carte
dvd
rental
service
while
it
have
never
reach
the
point
of
be
able
to
support
the
company
on
its
own
quite
a
few
people
like
be
able
to
rent
dvd
one
at
a
time
with
no
long
term
commitment
but
just
as
almost
exactly
twelve
month
earlier
we
have
be
confront
with
the
complexity
of
do
rental
and
sale
at
the
same
time
and
realize
that
our
best
chance
of
success
be
to
focus
on
one
we
now
have
to
make
a
similar
decision
should
we
focus
all
our
effort
and
resource
on
the
program
that
might
save
us
or
try
to
offer
both
model
simultaneously
the
first
problem
be
easy
to
solve
than
i
expect
turn
out
it
s
easy
to
negotiate
with
an
enormous
consumer
electronics
company
when
you
ve
be
work
with
them
for
a
year
and
your
new
initiative
be
prove
to
be
a
massive
success
with
user
what
be
obvious
to
us
be
obvious
to
the
sonys
and
toshibas
of
the
world
too
a
subscription
model
be
a
game
changer
it
s
hard
to
imagine
that
now
that
tech
startup
offer
subscription
for
everything
from
sock
to
sex
toy
but
in
we
be
do
something
that
no
one
have
do
before
we
be
convincing
people
to
pay
for
potential
by
say
that
they
would
be
pay
the
same
amount
no
matter
how
many
movie
they
watch
we
be
in
effect
dare
them
to
use
our
service
as
much
as
possible
and
by
eliminate
the
penalty
for
keep
disc
for
day
or
week
at
a
time
we
be
provide
a
viable
alternative
to
the
video
store
for
the
heavy
renter
traditionally
the
store
most
valuable
customer
we
be
operating
from
a
position
of
confidence
in
other
word
so
when
i
approach
mike
fidler
and
steve
nickerson
at
sony
and
toshiba
i
didn
t
ask
if
we
could
change
the
term
of
our
promotion
i
explain
the
shift
in
our
business
model
and
give
them
some
number
about
the
popularity
of
the
program
customer
would
still
get
their
dvd
and
for
free
but
they
d
be
signing
up
for
a
subscription
to
do
it
it
take
all
my
persuasive
power
to
craft
a
perfectly
pitch
argument
but
in
the
end
it
work
nobody
jumped
ship
the
issue
of
the
negative
option
be
a
little
thornier
you
can
t
just
charge
people
s
card
without
ask
them
reed
say
it
s
totally
unethical
it
s
totally
the
norm
reed
i
told
him
haven
t
you
ever
subscribed
to
a
magazine
i
don
t
like
it
they
have
a
chance
to
get
something
for
free
i
say
we
have
a
chance
to
get
them
hooked
that
s
the
trade
off
they
know
it
when
they
start
maybe
they
forgot
listen
if
they
like
the
offer
enough
at
the
begin
to
hand
over
credit
card
information
chance
be
they
ll
like
us
enough
to
let
us
keep
it
reed
frown
he
didn
t
agree
but
in
the
end
i
won
after
all
we
be
send
them
a
hundred
dollar
worth
of
dvd
customer
have
to
input
their
credit
card
to
take
advantage
of
the
trial
that
didn
t
feel
funny
to
them
let
s
just
start
from
the
assumption
that
everyone
be
go
to
like
it
i
argue
if
that
s
the
case
they
ll
be
happy
to
have
their
subscription
automatically
continued
and
their
credit
card
automatically
charge
despite
my
optimism
i
m
not
completely
crazy
four
week
after
we
launch
the
free
trial
i
be
half
prepared
for
a
rash
of
cancelations
all
day
i
shuffle
back
and
forth
between
my
desk
and
suresh
s
check
on
the
number
by
five
o
clock
he
be
start
to
shout
them
at
me
before
i
d
gotten
to
him
all
day
the
message
be
essentially
the
same
they
re
do
it
he
say
they
re
let
us
charge
them
the
thorniest
problem
by
far
be
the
issue
of
la
carte
rental
some
renter
love
it
especially
low
volume
renter
who
didn
t
watch
a
ton
of
movie
but
like
the
convenience
of
online
order
but
a
lot
of
renter
love
the
subscription
service
in
the
first
three
month
of
its
existence
marquee
drove
up
our
site
traffic
by
percent
the
question
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
be
be
it
worth
try
to
offer
both
model
or
do
it
make
more
sense
to
focus
on
subscription
jettisoning
some
of
our
early
user
to
answer
that
question
i
d
like
to
tell
you
about
something
i
call
the
canada
principle
netflix
for
its
first
twelve
year
limited
its
service
to
the
united
state
when
we
be
just
start
out
we
didn
t
have
the
infrastructure
or
the
money
to
serve
the
international
market
we
have
a
couple
of
guy
in
a
bank
safe
hand
stuff
envelope
and
our
entire
business
model
be
base
on
u
s
postage
rate
nonetheless
we
thought
frequently
about
expand
into
canada
it
be
close
the
regulation
be
easy
and
the
postage
and
transport
cost
be
low
when
we
ran
the
number
we
saw
that
we
could
probably
get
an
instant
revenue
bump
of
about
percent
but
we
didn
t
do
it
why
two
reason
first
we
knew
that
it
be
inevitably
go
to
be
more
complicate
than
it
look
because
french
be
the
main
language
spoken
in
some
part
of
canada
we
would
have
translation
headache
canadian
use
a
different
currency
which
would
have
complicate
our
pricing
and
the
fact
that
canada
also
call
that
currency
a
dollar
threaten
to
be
a
communication
nightmare
postage
be
different
too
so
we
would
have
have
to
use
different
envelope
in
other
word
even
something
seemingly
simple
be
bound
to
be
a
pain
in
the
as
but
the
big
reason
for
stay
out
be
even
simpler
if
we
take
the
amount
of
effort
manpower
and
mind
power
canadian
expansion
would
require
and
apply
it
to
other
aspect
of
the
business
we
d
eventually
get
a
far
great
return
than
percent
expand
to
canada
would
have
be
a
short
term
move
with
short
term
benefit
it
would
have
dilute
our
focus
when
reed
start
advocate
for
drop
la
carte
rental
i
be
initially
against
it
even
though
the
number
be
good
i
be
nervous
about
the
financial
hit
of
jettisoning
that
part
of
our
customer
base
why
couldn
t
we
do
both
for
a
little
while
longer
ease
the
transition
for
our
user
and
our
bottom
line
but
once
i
realize
that
the
decision
be
similar
to
the
one
we
have
face
six
month
earlier
when
we
d
decide
to
drop
dvd
sale
once
i
realize
in
effect
that
we
be
face
an
opportunity
to
apply
the
canada
principle
i
be
on
board
reed
be
right
if
we
knew
that
the
subscription
model
be
the
future
there
be
no
point
in
continue
to
work
on
the
la
carte
past
la
carte
user
only
make
up
a
small
percentage
of
our
user
we
be
only
divert
energy
money
and
talent
to
a
model
we
have
outgrown
plus
as
with
dvd
sale
we
be
confuse
customer
give
them
too
many
option
by
february
of
we
d
drop
la
carte
rental
and
switch
entirely
to
the
subscription
service
which
now
cost
a
month
now
netflix
be
marquee
and
marquee
be
netflix
focus
it
s
an
entrepreneur
s
secret
weapon
again
and
again
in
the
netflix
story
drop
dvd
sale
drop
la
carte
rental
and
eventually
drop
many
member
of
the
original
netflix
team
we
have
to
be
willing
to
abandon
part
of
the
past
in
service
of
the
future
sometimes
focus
this
intense
look
like
ruthlessness
and
it
be
a
little
bit
but
it
s
more
than
that
it
s
something
akin
to
courage
move
the
business
entirely
to
marquee
almost
immediately
take
one
of
our
big
liability
delivery
time
and
in
one
fell
swoop
turn
it
into
one
of
our
big
advantage
now
we
weren
t
several
day
slow
than
go
to
a
blockbuster
we
be
many
time
faster
if
you
want
to
watch
a
movie
no
more
drive
to
the
store
there
be
already
a
stack
of
movie
wait
for
you
right
on
top
of
your
tv
it
be
as
close
to
movie

demand
as
we
could
get
we

a
user
with
a
rotate
constantly
refresh
library
of
dvd
watch
a
movie
at
night
drop
it
into
the
mailbox
on
the
way
to
work
the
next
morning
and
by
afternoon
get
an
email
that
the
next
dvd
be
on
the
way
not
quite
instant
gratification
but
close
we
didn

know
what
this
meant
for
our
shipping

restructure
all
the
pick
pack
and
shipping
system
we
d
be
use
for
the
previous
year
to
make
them
more
efficient
and
user
friendly
he
d
also
figure
out
that
it
be
much
cheaper
and
more
efficient
to
ship
all
dvd
separately
and
as
they
become
available
even
if
a
user
have
order
more
than
one
i
m
remind
of
this
every
time
i
go
to
a
hip
new
small
plate
place
with
lorraine
and
they
inform
me
that
they
ll
be
bring
each
dish
out
as
soon
as
it
s
be
cooked
sound
like
a
chill
din
philosophy
but
really
it
s
just
easy
for
the
kitchen
that
way
but
although
marquee
didn
t
necessarily
require
faster
shipping
since
our
customer
already
have
movie
they
could
watch
sit
on
top
of
their
tv
we
thought
it
would
be
pretty
cool
if
subscriber
could
get
a
new
movie
the
day
after
return
one
it
would
be
like
magic
and
after
all
who
want
to
wait
a
week
for
a
dvd
some
of
our
local
customer
be
already
enjoy
next
day
delivery
by
virtue
of
proximity
netflix
user
in
san
jose
where
our
warehouse
be
tend
to
get
their
dvd
within
a
day
of
order
them
while
user
in
florida
often
wait
six
or
seven
but
when
we
look
at
the
number
we
didn
t
see
any
correlation
between
delivery
time
and
customer
retention
after
a
few
month
the
customer
retention
level
in
the
bay
area
and
in
florida
be
roughly
equal
what
give
i
ask
reed
one
afternoon
bounce
a
tennis
ball
off
the
side
of
a
cubicle
you
d
think
those
people
in
florida
would
say
screw
it
this
ain
t
worth
the
fifteen
dollar
they
re
probably
just
use
to
it
he
say
they
know
we
re
across
the
country
and
probably
just
assume
thing
will
take
longer
for
them
we
might
be
dodge
a
bullet
here
if
we
don
t
have
to
build
warehouse
all
over
the
country
to
facilitate
overnight
shipping
we
ll
save
a
lot
of
money
it
just
doesn
t
make
sense
i
say
next
day
delivery
should
move
the
needle
there
have
to
be
something
we
re
not
see
i
toss
the
ball
slightly
too
hard
and
it
bounce
past
me
to
reed
s
desk
i
have
an
idea
i
say
we
ve
never
turn
on
next
day
delivery
for
a
city
offering
it
from
the
begin
if
we
do
that
we
can
measure
the
impact
on
all
our
variable
see
if
it
matter
reed
shrug
i
ll
never
forget
the
look
in
tom
dillon
s
eye
when
i
told
him
we
need
to
test
next
day
delivery
in
another
market
just
to
make
sure
i
wasn
t
quite
certain
how
to
do
it
obviously
we
couldn
t
just
build
an
entirely
new
distribution
center
to
test
the
service
in
one
city
right
just
do
it
in
sacramento
he
say
chuckle
don
t
build
a
warehouse
just
drive
everything
up
from
here
every
night
for
a
month
and
drop
it
off
at
the
sacramento
post
office
be
you
volunteer
hell
no
he
say
it
be
your
idea
which
be
how
dan
jepson
found
himself
drive
a
panel
van
two
hour
up
i
all
the
window
down
the
edge
of
thousand
of
netflix
mailer
flutter
gently
behind
him
in
the
breeze
for
the
next
few
month
dan
drove
to
sacramento
every
morning
to
pick
up
the
mail
and
bring
it
back
to
los
gatos
and
then
a
few
hour
later
he
do
the
entire
trip
a
second
time
to
drop
it
back
off
in
sacramento
again
for
month
we
measure
the
result
what
we
found
be
incredibly
surprising
next
day
delivery
didn
t
really
change
our
cancelation
rate
where
it
matter
be
in
new
customer
sign
ups
this
make
no
sense
i
say
stand
next
to
christina
s
desk
with
a
printout
of
new
sign
ups
in
my
hand
we
re
not
tell
them
ahead
of
time
that
they
ll
be
get
their
movie
the
next
day
we
re
just
do
it
do
they
just
intuit
that
they
ll
be
get
thing
quickly
christina
roll
her
eye
marc
no
you
re

the

for
the

i
wait
they
re
tell
their
friend
it
s
word
of
mouth
advertising
christina
be
right
the
longer
we
ran
the
test
the
more
apparent
it
be
that
next
day
delivery
be
a
real
game
changer
just
not
in
the
way
we
thought
it
didn
t
affect
retention
it
affected
sign
ups
next
day
delivery
inspire
real
dedication
the
kind
that
make
you
tell
all
your
friend
about
this
new
service
you
re
use
over
time
we
notice
that
our
penetration
into
the
sacramento
market
be
approach
silicon
valley
level
silicon
valley
where
all
the
early
adopter
of
dvd
technology
live
the
whole
saga
have
provide
a
valuable
lesson
trust
your
gut
but
also
test
it
before
you
do
anything
concrete
the
data
have
to
agree
we
d
suspect
that
next
day
delivery
be
important
but
we
d
be
myopic
in
our
analysis
of
our
test
so
we
hadn
t
understood
why
it
take
an
additional
test
with
a
truly
outside
the
box
execution
to
understand
what
we
d
already
intuit
to
be
true
and
once
we
understood
it
we
could
refine
the
idea
and
maximize
its
potential
which
be
huge
next
day
delivery
be
like
magic
we
knew
it
have
to
be
part
of
our
plan
go
forward
now
we
just
need
to
figure
out
a
way
to
make
it
work
without
drive
the
dvd
ourselves
or
building
enormous
warehouse
all
over
the
country
i
m
on
it
tom
dillon
say
whenever
anyone
asks
me
what
my
favorite
movie
be
i
never
tell
the
truth
the
public
answer
the
convenient
lie
be
pulp
fiction
all
the
cinephiles
and
tough
guy
in
the
audience
nod
their
head
with
approval
when
i
mention
it
and
it
s
true
i
love
that
movie
i
love
the
write
i
love
the
cinematography
i
love
the
performance
by
samuel
l
jackson
and
john
travolta
and
uma
thurman
i
ve
probably
see
pulp
fiction
more
than
any
movie
but
the
wizard
of
oz
but
it
s
not
my
favorite
movie
my
real
favorite
movie
be
doc
hollywood
a
comedy
you
ve
probably
forgotten
about
if
you
saw
it
at
all
in
doc

a
young
michael

as

he

at
the
local

it

essentially
a
fish

story
he
s
a
big
city
surgeon
in
a
small
town
with
small

and
he
eventually
realizes

what
he
really
love
doc
hollywood
be
no
one
s
idea
of
a
masterpiece
but
it
speaks
to
me
i
m
not
sure
why
maybe
it
s
simply
because
it
tap
into
some
deep
desire
to
live
an
uncomplicated
life
with
a
real
connection
to
people
family
and
place

many
way
doc

be
my
fantasy
it
make
me
yearn
for
the
simple
life
for
a
place
where
everyone
know
and
care
for
each
other
where
you
go
to
work
you
come
home
sit
on
the
porch
and
then
get
ask
to
judge
a
barbecue
cook
off
doc
hollywood
be
not
the
first
movie
i
d
name
if
you
ask
me
for
the
great
film
of
the
twentieth
century
or
even
the
s
or
even
but
if
i
see
my
copy
lie
around
the
house
i
ll
slide
it
into
the
dvd
player
more
time
than
not
it
s
not
the
best
movie
or
a
classic
or
a
hot
new
release
it
s
just
my
favorite
help
people
find
their
favorite
movie
movie
they
d
love
be
our
real
goal
at
netflix
from
the
begin
we
d
know
that
our
company
couldn
t
be
tie
to
a
shipping
service
or
a
mere
product
because
if
it
be
we
d
be
obsolete
the
second
the
technology
change
if
we
want
any
chance
of
survive
long
term
we
have
to
convince
customer
that
we
be
give
them
something
well
than
an
online
library
and
quick
shipping
neither
the
technology
nor
the
delivery
method
matter
what
count
be
seamlessly
connect
our
user
with
movie
we
knew
they
d
love
that
would
be
relevant
regardless
of
what
direction
future
technology
take
us
easy
say
than
do
of
course
one
disadvantage
of
be
an
online
store
be
that
it
make
browsing
difficult
if
you
knew
what
you
be
look
for
you
could
just
search
for
it
but
if
not
find
movie
be
surprisingly
difficult
you
could
only
view
one
page
at
a
time
and
there
be
a
limited
number
of
movie
you
could
fit
on
a
page
you
have
to
make
a
snap
judgment
base
on
the
cover
art
or
a
synopsis
this
be
a
problem
in
brick
and
mortar
too
of
course
accord
to
mitch
most
people
walk
into
video
store
completely
unsure
of
what
they
be
look
for
and
simply
drift
from
section
to
section
but
in
a
brick
and
mortar
you
could
ask
a
clerk
for
help
or
at
the
very
least
you
could
wander
the
aisle
and
hope
that
you
d
serendipitously
stumble
across
something
that
look
promising
we
want
to
make
browsing
easy
and
we
also
want
to
connect
user
with
recommendation
and
review
so
christina
the
editorial
content
team
and
i
design
content
rich
land
page
for
a
variety
of
genre
if
you
be
look
for
a
thriller
we
have
an
entire
page
dedicate
to
them
replete
with
top
ten
list
review
of
recent
and
classic
thriller
and
highlight
selection
from
our
inventory
if
you
like
tom
cruise
movie
same
deal
the
idea
be
to
provide
gentle
suggestion
and
guidance
something
akin
to
what
a
sympathetic
and
knowledgeable
video
store
clerk
could
offer
we
want
to
offer
a
personalize
touch
the
problem
be
it
be
enormously
expensive
not
to
mention
time
consume
to
do
it
all
manually
when
we
have
title
it
be
somewhat
feasible
to
create
content
to
match
but
by
late
we
have
almost
movie
to
work
with
it
be
hard
to
keep
up
and
even
harder
to
browse
reed
in
typical
reed
fashion
push
for
automation
forget
the
land
page
he
say
we
re
redesign
the
site
anyway
instead
of
hard
cod
page
how
about
we
just
do
it
like
this
create
a
frame
on
the
home
page
that
have
slot
to
display
four
movie
at
a
time
each
slot
can
show
the
cover
of
the
movie
run
time
date
of
release
a
little
capsule
synopsis
the
data
we
already
have
then
just
make
a
list
of
fifty
movie
you
might
want
to
have
appear
there
and
have
the
site
randomly
pick
which
four
to
display
or
well
yet
just
define
how
to
build
the
list
maybe
call
the
list
thriller
and
let
the
system
randomly
pick
from
any
movie
we
have
that
be
tag
as
a
thriller
if
i
recall
correctly
i
react
with
horror
to
this
suggestion
i
hat
it
it
seem
cold
computerize
random
all
the
thing
we
weren
t
try
to
be
but
have
you
use
netflix
lately
reed
s
slot
structure
survives
with
alteration
the
most
crucial
of
which
be
that
the
film
in
the
slot
aren
t
randomly
chosen
they
re
the
product
of
a
complex
algorithmic
match
service
one
that
s
calibrate
to
both
your
taste
and
netflix
s
need
that
algorithmic
match
service
can
be
trace
directly
back
to
and
reed
s
slot
because
he
be
right
of
course
user
need
a
more
efficient
easy
way
to
find
movie
they
would
like
something
even
more
intuitive
than
an
editorially
curated
land
page
put
dvd
into
slot
be
a
start
now
we
just
need
to
figure
out
some
way
to
arrange
them
that
wasn
t
random
in
talk
all
that
fall
we
discuss
way
to
build
a
service
that
would
give
user
movie
they
d
love
while
also
make
our
life
as
a
distributor
easy
and
more
profitable
when
user
sat
down
to
decide
which
movie
to
order
next
we
want
them
to
see
a
list
of
film
that
have
be
customize
to
their
taste
and
optimize
for
our
inventory
if
we
could
show
customer
what
they
want
to
watch
they
d
be
happier
with
the
service
and
if
we
could
also
show
them
what
we
want
them
to
watch
win
win
put
simply
even
if
we
be
order
twenty
time
more
new
release
than
any
blockbuster
an
enormously
expensive
gambit
we
wouldn
t
be
able
to
satisfy
all
demand
all
the
time
and
new
release
be
expensive
to
keep
our
customer
happy
and
our
cost
reasonable
we
need
to
direct
user
to
less
in
demand
movie
that
we
knew
they
d
like
and
probably
like
even
well
than
new
release
for
example
say
i
rent
and
love
pleasantville
one
of
the
best
movie
of
and
a
clever
dark
comedy
about
what
happens
when
two
teenager
from
the
ninety
tobey
maguire
and
reese
witherspoon
be
suck
into
a
black
and
white
television
show
set
in
s
small
town
america
the
ideal
recommendation
engine
would
be
able
to
steer
me
away
from
more
current
new
release
and
toward
other
movie
like
pleasantville
movie
like
doc
hollywood
that
be
a
tall
order
the
thing
about
taste
be
that
it
s
subjective
and
the
number
of
factor
in
play
when
try
to
establish
similarity
between
film
be
almost
endless
do
you
group
film
by
actor
by
director
by
genre
release
year
award
nomination
screenwriter
how
do
one
quantify
a
thing
like
mood
i
work
with
reed
and
the
engineer
for
month
on
a
solution
the
problem
be
come
up
with
an
algorithm
that
actually
spat
out
movie
that
make
sense
together
since
it
could
only
use
the
data
available
to
it
thing
like
genre
actor
location
release
year
language
and
so
forth
the
algorithm
often
make
suggestion
that
make
sense
to
a
computer
but
didn
t
really
take
into
account
any
kind
of
real
world
similarity
or
it
would
give
unhelpful
suggestion
you
like
top
gun
here
s
another
movie
that
come
out
in
in
the
end
we
realize
that
the
best
way
to
give
user
what
they
want
be
to
crowdsource
data
from
them
at
first
we
do
what
amazon
do
use
a
process
call
collaborative
filter
amazon
would
suggest
product
to
you
base
on
common
buying
pattern
they
still
do
this
essentially
if
you
buy
a
wrench
from
amazon
it
group
you
with
other
user
who
have
bought
a
wrench
and
then
suggests
that
you
buy
other
thing
that
they
ve
bought
here
s
how
it
work
with
rental
let
s
say
reed
and
i
each
rent
three
movie
from
netflix
i
rent
armageddon
the
bridge
of
madison
county
and
casablanca
and
reed
rent
armageddon
the
bridge
of
madison
county
and
the
mighty
duck
collaborative
filter
would
say
that
since
we
d
both
rent
two
of
the
same
movie
we
would
probably
each
enjoy
the
third
movie
that
the
other
person
rent
therefore
the
site
would
recommend
that
i
rent
the
mighty
duck
and
that
reed
rent
casablanca
the
problem
with
this
method
of
course
be
that
filter
for
rental
history
doesn
t
really
tell
you
whether
i
like
casablanca
or
if
reed
like
the
mighty
duck
it
just
tell
us
that
we
both
rent
those
movie
we
could
have
hat
them
we
could
have
rent
them
for
our
kid
or
our
wife
if
we
be
go
to
use
collaborative
filter
to
group
customer
and
recommend
film
we
need
to
know
what
customer
enjoy
rather
than
just
what
they
rent
we
need
a
review
system
a
movie
rating
system
group
customer
by
rating
by
cluster
user
accord
to
overlap
positive
or
negative
review
meant
that
we
could
efficiently
recommend
film
to
user
base
not
on
what
they
d
rent
but
what
they
like
ultimately
the
algorithm
would
become
much
more
complex
than
that
but
for
it
to
work
at
all
we
need
user
to
review
movie
lot
of
them
ultimately
we
decide
that
we
would
ask
our
customer
to
rate
movie
by
assign
each
movie
from
one
to
five
star
five
star
for
a
movie
they
love
one
star
for
a
complete
time
waster
it
sound
simple
enough
but
that
stupid
star
rating
system
be
the
source
of
hundred
of
hour
of
argument
more
battle
about
few
pixel
have
never
be
wag
could
you
give
something
zero
star
should
we
offer
a
half
star
option
when
you
give
a
rating
it
be
whole
star
but
when
we
predict
a
rating
should
it
be
in
whole
star
or
in
tenth
when
should
a
user
be
prompt
to
review
a
film
where
should
the
widget
go
in
the
end
we
ask
netflix
user
to
review
film
early
and
often
we
would
ask
them
to
rate
film
whenever
they
visit
the
site
whenever
they
return
a
movie
and
whenever
they
rearrange
their
queue
the
great
thing
about
movie
rental
be
that
you
don
t
have
to
rent
a
movie
to
have
already
see
it
unlike
buying
a
wrench
a
review
didn
t
have
to
be
tie
to
a
sale
theoretically
a
user
could
review
every
movie
he
or
she
have
ever
see
even
if
he
or
she
have
never
rent
a
single
movie
from
us
and
it
turn
out
that
people
love
to
be
ask
for
their
opinion
everyone
s
a
critic
it
be
remarkably
easy
to
amass
enough
review
to
build
a
collaborative
filter
function
that
could
actually
predict
with
reasonable
accuracy
what
someone
might
like
after
that
reed
s
team
go
to
work
integrate
these
taste
prediction
into
a
broader
algorithm
that
make
movie
recommendation
after
weigh
a
number
of
factor
keyword
number
of
copy
number
of

the
result
which
launch
in
february
of
as
cinematch
be
a
seemingly
more
intuitive
recommendation
engine
one
that
outsource
qualitative
assessment
to
user
while
also
optimize
thing
on
the
back
end
in
many
way
it
be
the
best
of
both
world
an
automate
system
that
nonetheless
felt
human
like
a
video
store
clerk
ask
you
what
you
d
see
lately
and
then
recommend
something
he
knew
you
d
like
and
that
he
have
in

actually
it
felt
well

it
felt
invisible

it

of
the
most
innovative
and
influential

in
the
history

quickly

key

we
file
our

with
the

permission
to

over
the
follow
month
as
the

deutsche
bank
have
continued
to
project
false
enthusiasm
offering
steadily
weaken
reassurance
that
we
would
be
okay
by
the
fall
though
it
have
become
obvious
to
everyone
that
the
number
we
d
be
excitedly
bandying
back
and
forth
as
the
solution
to
all
our
problem
million
million
have
evaporate
into
thin

i
d
gotten
the
call
that
deutsche

the
offering
one
rainy
saturday
morning
in
september
while
i
be
shopping
with
lorraine
in
carmel
needle
to
say
we
didn
t
buy
anything
at
the
time
not
go
public
have
felt
like
a
major
blow
but
in
retrospect
it
be
possibly
one
of
the
best
thing
that
ever
happen
to
us
if
we
d
go
public
in
the
fall
of
we
would
have
be
tie
to
the
portal
idea
and
to
the
unrealistic
financial
expectation
that
we
have
built
around
it
and
that
would
have
be
a
disaster
we
never
would
have
be
able
to
make
any
money
as
an
all
thing
to
all
people
site
become
a
movie
portal
be
the
complete
opposite
of
the
canada
principle
it
didn
t
allow
for
the
rigorous
focus
that
set
us
apart
and
which
ultimately
provide
us
with
the
business
model
to
succeed
on
our
own
term
we
quietly
start
abandon
most
of
our
portal
orient
effort
if
the
people
who
want
movie
showtime
and
in
depth
critic
review
and
top
ten
list
be
just
the
bank
and
their
customer
and
the
bank
didn
t
want
to
take
us
public
then
why
keep
them
so
by
september
we
be
back
to
where
we
start
we
didn
t
have
million
in
our
pocket
and
we
be
lose
money
lot
of
money
up
until
now
with
reed
at
the
helm
we
d
be
able
to
find
funding
fairly
easily
and
we
have
long
reassure
ourselves
that
as
long
as
we
could
continue
to
use
silicon
valley
money
to
support
our
growth
we
would
be
okay
but
in
a
post
bubble
era
get
it
from
our
usual
vc
source
would
be
hard
really
hard
i
worried
about
how
the
bursting
of
the
dot
com
bubble
would
affect
netflix
s
finance
but
i
have
to
confess
that
i
wasn
t
sad
to
see
some
sort
of
adjustment
come
down
the
pike
all
of
the
dot

hype
have
seem
crazy
to
me
watch
the

upward
of

for

that
be
more
money
out

than
netflix

spent
its
entire
first

at
the
height
of
the

boom
the

attitude
at
many

be
spend
now
worry
later
it
have
become
routine
for

i
m
ready
to

a
disgust
frivolous

that
wasn
t
us
netflix
have
long
since
outgrown
its
card

we

pretty
frugal

or

for
every

frankly
i
don
t
understand
it
even
now
it
have
be
an
age
of
decadence
in
other

and
like
all

and
i
view
these
failure
with
i
have
to
admit
it
a
little
bit
of
schadenfreude
one
of
our
pastime
that
year
be
scroll
through
entry
on
fuck
company
the
cynical
website
of
record
for
troubled
and
fail
dot
coms
think
that
could
have
be
us
even
when
reading
about
obviously
mismanage
and
doom
from
the
start
entry
but
we
be
especially
concerned
to
read
about
the
trouble
of
kozmo
com
an
urban
delivery
service
that
have
launch
in
promising
to
deliver
a
huge
range
of
product
include
dvd
to
customer
home
within
an
hour
in
we
d
worried
that
kozmo
would
enter
the
rental
market
and
use
its
one
hour
delivery
to
crush
our
slow
service
but
as
kozmo
flounder
through
first
squander
the
million
it
have
raise
from
investor
include
a
million
investment
from
amazon
and
then
cancel
its
plan
ipo
we
found
ourselves
wonder
if
the
company
s
prominent
failure
would
doom
everyone
else
in
their
category
no
matter
how
tangentially
fortunately
unlike
dr
koop
boo
com
or
webvan
we
actually
have
a
business
model
that
make
sense
a
subscription
to
netflix
cost
a
user
per
month
on
average
more
than
it
cost
us
to
actually
provide
the
service
we
make
money
on
every
transaction
basic
economics
we
have
a
different
problem
than
the
dr
koops
or
webvans
of
the
world
we
be
successful
and
success
be
expensive
in
fact
we
be
drown
in
our
own
success
the
faster
new
customer
pour
in
the
faster
money
pour
out
our
business
model
be
hard
to
explain
to
potential
customer
but
we
knew
that
if
people
try
our
service
they
d
be
hooked
that
s
why
everyone
who
want
to
try
netflix
get
their
first
month
free
that
be
expensive
what
s
more
we
be
a
subscription
service
rather
than
charge
our
customer
an
annual
fee
when
they
sign
up
we
charge
them
a
small
amount
each
month
so
when
you
add
it
up
we
be
in
a
perpetual
cash
crunch
we
have
to
pay
the
full
cost
of
every
free
trial
all
at
once
up
front
but
the
money
we
could
use
to
pay
it
all
back
dribble
in
slowly
month
after
month
the
faster
we
gain
customer
the
more
these
up
front
payment
outweigh
the
much
small
amount
we
collect
in
monthly
charge
basic
economics
again
and
unfortunately
not
so
favorable
to
us
our
company
be
successful
but
it
have
a
voracious
appetite
for
cash
in
an
environment
where
cash
be
hard
to
come
by
after
the
dot
com
bubble
burst
venture
capital
which
have
once
be
comically
easy
to
acquire
if
you
have
a
com
in
your
name
have
become
not
just
hard
to
get
but
almost
completely
unavailable
it
be
time
to
seek
strategic
alternative
sound
like
jargon
that
s
because
it
be
silicon
valley
be
full
of
nonsense
phrase
just
like
it
for
instance
when
someone
say
that
he
s
leave
to
spend
more
time
with
his
family
what
that
really

someone

need
some

what
they
really

this
suck

need
to

someone
say
we
decide
to
pivot
what
they
really

be
we
fuck
up
royally
and
when
a
company
decides
to
seek
strategic
alternative
what
they
re
say
be
we
ve
get
to
sell
this
sucker
and
fast
we

come
a
long
way
since

amazon

revamped
its
business
model
undergone
enormous
growth
and
become
synonymous
with

so
the
obvious
strategic
alternative
this
time
wasn
t
amazon
but
our
big
brick

mortar
competitor
blockbuster
blockbuster
have
be
the
brainchild
of
wayne
huizenga
who
in
the
late

saw
an
opportunity
to
roll
up
the

mostly

pop

that
dot
the

rapid
expansion
in
the
s
at
one
point
the
company
be
opening
one
new
store
every
day
have
give
them
a
near
monopoly
on

have
make
them
one
of
the
most
ubiquitous
brand
in
the
country
they
be
king
of
the
world
in
but
we
have
no
idea
if
they
even
knew
who
we
be
or
if
they
care
as
big
a
deal
as
we
be
online
we
do
a
fraction
of
the
business
they
do
we
be
on
track
to
do
million

we
knew
that

the

if
blockbuster
want
to
survive
it
need
to
develop
an
alternative
to
brick

if
they
recognize
that
they
might
want

always

in

ask
barry
mccarthy
to
reach
out
to
his
contact
at
blockbuster
to
try
to
get
a
meeting
we
d
ask
our
vcs
to
tap
into
their
network
we
d
do
whatever
we
could
to
try
to
get
blockbuster
s
attention
but
as
of
the
corporate
retreat
that
september
we
d
heard
nothing
not
even
cricket
silence
it
look
like
we
would
have
to
get
out
of
this
on
our
own
it
s
common
knowledge
that
thing
in
silicon
valley
be
pretty
casual
there
s
not
a
lot
of
room
for
suit
tie
that
sort
of
thing
people
have
come
to
understand
that
it
s
a
sign
of
great
respect
if
i
shave
for
a
meeting
i
think
the
reason
the
valley
be
so
casual
be
because
unlike
most
industry
tech
be
about
as
close
to
a
true
meritocracy
as
you
can
get
in
many
discipline
be
a
smooth
talker
or
a
snappy
dresser
can
grease
your
ascent
to
the
executive
suite
but
in
silicon
valley
the
only
thing
that
really
matter
be
the
quality
of
your
work
it
s
a
programmer
s
world
with
a
programmer
s
ethos
every
programmer
be
accustom
to
have
their
code
subject
to
peer
review
in
which
fellow
coder
evaluate
its
brevity
elegance
cleverness
simplicity
and
ultimate
effectiveness
it
s
all
there
in

it
matter
not
at
all
what
you
look

dress
like
what
you
talk

solely
on
the
quality
of
your
work
no
one
really
care
about
your
appearance
that
carry
over

even

it

around

bikini
babe
in
case
you
re
wonder
why
i
bought
harley
davidson
rub
on
tattoo
the
answer
be
simple
i
thought
it
would
be
funny
that
s
the
ruling
criterion
for
a
lot
of
my
behavior
despite
the
casual
dress
code
of
the
normal
workweek
employee
at
netflix
be
require
to
wear
shirt
in
the
office
so
no
one
up
to
this
point
knew
whether
or
not
i
be
sport
ink
under
the
corporate
brand
swag
i
usually
wore
i
be
pretty
sure
no
one
suspect
that
the
forty
five
year
old
dad
would
be
inked
up
even
if
he
be
from
santa
cruz
so
how
well
to
lighten
the
atmosphere
than
to
peel
off
my
built
to
last
tank
top
at
the
pool
and
let
the
gossip
fly
what
can
i
say
i
m
easily
amuse
when
i
think
back
to
our
retreat
i
don
t
remember
any
of
the
business
that
we
conduct
i
don
t
remember
discussion
about
apportionment
of
investment
realignment
of
priority
departmental
initiative
or
any
of
the
other
corporate
bullshit
we
might
have
felt
honor
bound
to
spend
some
time
on
what
i
remember
be
the
thing
that
built
culture
alisal
offer
the
usual
activity
that
i
m
sure
most
company
would
have
engage
in
horseback
ride
trust
fall
tennis
but
at
netflix
we
be
wire
a
little
bit
differently
inspire
by
our
employee
onboarding
the
highlight
of
our
retreat
be
to
be
a
skit
throw
down
between
the
netflix
department
each
of
which
would
enact
a
scene
from
a
recently
release
dvd
as
luck
would
have
it
one
of
the
big
dvd
release
of
that
summer
be
the
kirsten

later
that
night
we
have
a
full
banquet
with

of

hot
it
be
loud
and
the
group
be
quickly
feel
the
effect
of
the
open
bar
which
serve
cocktail
in
quart
size
mason
jar
boris
have
somehow
convince
one
of
the
bartender
to
give
him
a
bottle
of
ice
cold
vodka
a
tray
and
dozen
of
shot
glass
and
he
be
drunkenly
wander
around
the
mess
hall
solemnly
ask
everyone
he
encounter
the
same
question
be
you
een
this
be
remarkable
in
and
of
itself
because
boris
rarely
spoke
i
m
sure
most
of
the
office
didn
t
know
what
his
voice
sound
like
or
that
he
have
a
strong
accent
until
that
night
be
you
een
he
d
say
hold
the
tray
on
his
shoulder
like
a
waiter
a
solemn
expression
on
his
face
many
people
i
m
sure
have
no
idea
what
he
be
talk
about
many
people
i
m
sure
get
vodka
shot
that
night
just
because
they
look
confuse
and
didn
t
say
no
boris
at
any
rate
take
shot
regardless
of
what
your
answer
be
for
a
while
anyway
i
faintly
recall
see
him
asleep
on
a
picnic
table
before
dinner
be
even
over
just
as
thing
be
start
to
get
wonderfully
out
of
hand
i
decide
that
i
would
bring
the
whole
group
together
in
song
pull
several
fold
page
out
of
my
pocket
i
clamber
up
onto
one
of
the
long
bench
and
wobble
slightly
bang
a
spoon
on
the
regrettably
empty
mason
jar
that
have
once
held
my
gin
and
tonic
the
crowd
quiet
use
the
melody
from
god
rest
you
merry
gentleman
i
begin
come
join
me
friend
and
raise
a
glass
to
toast
our
newfound
luck
each
week
from
every
member
we
now
extract
a
buck
it
seem
marquee
be
just
the
key
to
prove
that
we
don
t
suck
and
we
soon
will
be
roll
in
dough
at
this
point
i
held
off
wait
for
the
lackluster
call
and
response
a
few
in
the
group
sober
enough
to
realize
what
i
be
look
for
weakly
respond
roll
in
dough
and
we
soooon
will
be

by
the
way
although
reed

make
a
decision
pretty
early
on
not
to
ship
the
really
hard
core

fiasco
aside
we
be

still
they
will
not

how

can
turn
and
we
stop

of
cash
at
this
point
people
couldn
t
wait
to
blast
out
the
response
amplify
with
alcohol
fuel
enthusiasm
the
next
stanza
be
largely
about
reed
and
barry
and
as
i
begin
to
sing
it
i
look
over
to
try
to
catch
their
eye
reed
s
seat
be
empty
though
and
just
across
the
table
barry
sat
with
his
head
down
his
right
hand
cup
his
phone
to
his
head
the
index
finger
of
the
other
push
into
his
ear
to
block
out
the
noise
as
i
lean
into
one
of
the
last
stanza
they
fix
each
tweak
but
then
next
week
reed
make
us
change
it
back
i
could
see
a
commotion
start
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
i
could
just
barely
make
out
who
it
be
be
that
kate
in
her
red
gingham
dress
i
could
barely

through
the
crowd
which
be
now
hoot
and
holler
face
away
from
me

even
more
distract
as
the
red
gingham

get
closer
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
then
i
saw

when

do
he
make
it
count
i
be
just
on
my
way
to
see
if
he

his
eye
at
me
when
barry
grabbed
me
by
the
arm
and
pull
me
into
the
hallway
away
from
the
noise

a
faint
glow
on
the
horizon

that
it
be
close
to
dawn
but
in
front
of

almost
invisible
dark
and
shade
by
the
overhang
oak
tree

line

almost
expect
one
of
them

oz
on
us
and
start
pelt
us
with

of
time

i
d
never

barry
lean
forward
and
squint
try
to
make
out
the
faint
letter
on
a
sign
that
way
point
reed
from
the
front
passenger
seat
stretch
a
finger
toward
an
even
darker
driveway
cut
off
the
main
road
as
barry
turn
and
steer
the
car
slowly
onto
the
gravel
i
could
just
make
out
the
sign
general
aviation
within
a
minute
or
two
we
pull
into
a
parking
lot
in
front
of
a
low
wooden
building
flower
box
be
in
the
window
the
roof
be
shingle
it
look
residential
vaguely
new
england
less
like
an
airport
facility
than
a
forgotten
cottage
just
beyond
it
be
an
ornate
wrought
iron
fence
about
eight
foot
tall
through
the
bar
i
could
see
the
blinking
wing
light
of
a
small
plane
park
on
the
runway
barry
pull
up
to
a
gate
in
the
fence
even
in
the
pre
tsa
era
it
be
clear
that
this
be
one
of
those
entrance
you
need
some
kind
of
authority
to
enter
and
that
in
this
case
authority
translate
to
money
luckily
we
d
wire
it
earlier
that
morning
barry
roll
down
his
window
and
push
a
small
red
button
on
the
call
box
mount
next
to
the
gate
tail
number
a
scratchy
voice
croaked
what
s
a
tail
number
i
whisper
to
reed
lean
forward
into
the
gap
between
the
two
front
seat
reed
turn
his
head
and
give
me
a
look
the
same
one
i
often
found
myself
give
my
kid
at
any
restaurant
fancier
than
mcdonald
s
the
look
that
meant
i
can
t
take
you
anywhere
the
password
give
the
gate
start
to
glide
silently
open
barry
roll
up
his
window
and
crept
the
car
forward
as
we
pass
through
onto
the
tarmac
and
drove
slowly
toward
the
plane
i
look
back
and
saw
the
gate
slide
noiselessly
back
into
place
behind
us
no
go
back
now
i
thought
to
myself
less
than
twelve
hour
earlier
as
soon
as
the
commotion
over
reed
s
grand
in
gingham
entrance
have
subside
barry
reed
and
i
have
retreat
to

near
one
of
the
alisal
swim
pool
not
just
tomorrow
barry
be
complain
that
would
have
be
bad
enough
but

thirty
tomorrow

at
eleven
thirty
in
the
goddamn
morning
impossible
barry
picked
up
his
mechanical
pencil
with
one
hand
and
use
the
fist
of
the
other
to
scrub
a
clean
spot
on
the
wood
of
the
picnic
table
first
he

scribble
a
number
right
into
the

dallas

time
so
that
mean
nine
thirty
our
time
then
it
s
a
three
and
a
half
hour
flight
from
san
francisco
so
probably
about
the
same
from
santa
barbara
plus
if
you
add
on
enough
time
to
get
to
the
airport
he
pause
add
some
figure
onto
the
table
you
would
have
to
leave
here
by
five
a
m
and
i
don
t
even
need
to
check
to
know
there
isn
t
a
nonstop
from
santa
barbara
at
five
in
the
morning
we
re
screw
barry
slump
back
retract
the
lead
of
his
pencil
and
somewhat
guiltily
try
to
erase
the
figure
from
the
table
so
we
fly
private
reed
say
opening
up
his
palm
to
the
two
of
us
as
if
it
be
self
evident
we
take
off
at
five
land
at
ten
thirty
have
a
car
wait
we
ll
be
there
right
on
time
probably
even
have
enough
time
for
marc
and
me
to
grab
an
espresso
barry
didn
t
react
as
if
try
to
figure
out
what
be
more
absurd
the
fact
that
reed
be
propose
spending
money
on
a
private
jet
or
the
fact
that
he
be
do
so
while
wear
a
dress
reed
for
his
part
seem
to
have
forgotten
all
about
his
new
attire
reed
barry
finally
blurt
out
that
s
gotta
be
at
least
twenty
thousand
round
trip
he
move
to
write
something
again
then
thought
well
of
it
and
i
don
t
need
to
tell
you
that
we
don
t
have
that
type
of
money
barry
reed
say
we
ve
wait
month
to
get
this
meeting
we
re
on
track
to
lose
at
least
fifty
million
dollar
this
year
whether
we
pull
this
off
or
not
another
twenty
grand
won
t
make
a
difference
yeah
barry
i
piped
up
twenty
grand
isn
t
that
what
you
finance
guy
call
a
round
error
you
guy
be
a
piece
of
work
barry
mutter
to
no
one
in
particular
from
behind
the

an
orange
vested
worker
appear
hold
an
illuminate
torch
and
wave
barry
s
car
to
a
position
just
off
the
wing
as
our
headlight
swept
the
area
i
saw
that
a
red
carpet
have
be
roll
out
from
the
base
of
the
plane
s
stair
a

in

down
and
walk
over
to
us
i

and
extend
his
hand
he
gesture
toward
the
trunk
of
the
car
can
i
grab
your
bag
reed
and
i
look
at
each
other
and
laugh
reed
open
his
briefcase
and
pull
out
a
fold
white
t
shirt
this
be
it
luckily
for
me
we
be
only
on
day
two
of
the
retreat
so
some
of
my
clothing
be
still
clean
dress
in
the
dark
that
morning
i
have
put
on
my
one
remain
clean
item
my
tie
dyed
t
shirt
i
d
opt
to
leave
the
lederhosen
behind
as
well
as
the
harley
davidson
tattoo
and
have
instead
substitute
an
almost
new
pair
of
short
accent
with
black
flip
flop
reed
grabbed
hold
of
the
cable
handrail
and
bound
up
the
stair
then
ducked
through
the
doorway
and
vanished
into
the
plane
i
follow
him
up
not
quite
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
private
jet
gold
plat
bathroom
fixture
a
giant
king
size
bed
a
stand
up
bar
this
latter
amenity
be
actually
the
last
thing
in
the
world
i
want
to
see
since
i
be
still
struggle
with
the
aftereffect
of
the
previous
night
s
mason
jar
the
interior
of
the
jet
be
surprisingly
businesslike
if
you
consider
a
huge
platter
of
breakfast
pastry
and
slice
fruit
a
thermos
of
coffee
and
a
pitcher
of
freshly
squeeze
orange
juice
perch
on
the
counter
of
a
jet
businesslike
bottle
of
water
and
soda
be
visible
through
the
glass
door
of
a
half
size
refrigerator
a
wicker
basket
overflow
with
granola
bar
the
plane
a
learjet
a
be
small
than
i
have
imagine
but
much
nicer
every
surface
seem
to
be
either
leather
or
rosewood
it
look
like
someone
have
take
steve
kahn
s
living
room
and
fold
it
around
the
inside
surface
of
an
airplane
fuselage
as
i
start
down
the
single
narrow
aisle
i
notice
i
could
stand
up
straight
but
barely
immediately
to
my
right
face
to
the
front
of
the
plane
be
a
single
leather
captain
s
chair
nicer
than
any
piece
of
furniture
i
own
directly
behind
it
be
a
group
of
four
chair
face
each
other
two
forward
and
two
back
with
enough
legroom
that
you
could
fit
a
din
room
table
between
them
in
fact
as
i
found
out
later
there
be
a
din
room
table
neatly
fold
into
the
windowsill
between
the
seat
reed
be
already
settle
in
the
front
right
rear
face
seat
his
long
leg
stretch
lazily
into
the
open
space
i
later
learn
that
private
jet
aficionado
like
home
theater
aficionado
have
a
money
seat
although
in
a
jet
you
re
look
for
the
safest
smoothest
and
most
comfortable
ride
not
acoustic
and
that
reed
accustom
to
private
plane
ride
knew
enough
to
snag
it
immediately
reed
stretch
out
an
arm
gesture
toward
a
seat
face
him
and
as
i
struggle
to
figure
out
the
four
point
harness
barry
casually
settle
in
across
the
aisle
from
me
balance
a
plate
of
fruit
on
top
of
his
laptop
despite
my
effort
to
play
it
cool
barry
knew
that
i
be
get
a
kick
out
of
all
of
this
like
it
he
say
neatly
spear
a
piece
of
fruit
i
be
talk
to
rob
outside
this
jet
belongs
to
vanna
white
she
charter
it
out
when
she
s
not
use
it
i
guess
flip
letter
for
a
living
pay
well
than
i
thought
he
take
a
bite
of
pineapple
pretty
cool
huh
then
flash
me
a
quick
smile
he
lower
his
voice
to
a
stage
whisper
don
t
get
use
to
it
we
land
well
past
rush
hour
in
dallas
but
you
wouldn
t
have
know
it
from
the
traffic
all
the
time
we
have
save
by
hire
a
car
to
meet
us
at
the
foot
of
the
plane
s
stair
be
waste
as
we
crawl
through
downtown
that
s
it
right
there
say
our
driver
pull
the
car
to
the
curb
he
lean
his
head
forward
look
up
through
the
windshield
and
gesture
at
the
office
building
across
the
street
that
s
the
renaissance
tower
tallest
building
in
dallas
probably
the
most
expensive
one
too
the
building
rise
straight
up
out
of
the
sidewalk
without
setback
spire
or
feature
of
any
kind
it
be
an
unbroken
cube
of
steel
and
glass
its
only
gesture
toward
decoration
be
a
giant
x
of
slightly
darker
window
diagonal
line
stretch
across
the
entire
height
and
width
of
the
building
the
building
s
immensity
and
lack
of
adornment
make
it
seem
serious
it
be
clear
that
this
be
not
a
building
to
be
trifle
with
there
be
no
playfulness
here
no
joy
this
be
where
business
be
do
as
the
elevator
open
onto
the
rd
floor
i
be
relieve
to
see
that
thing
look
a
bit
more
familiar
and
less
intimidate
the
wall
of
blockbuster
s
lobby
be
cover
with
frame
movie
poster
and
even
though
i
recognize
many
of
the
same
one
that
we
have
back
at
the
office
i
couldn
t
help
but
notice
that
blockbuster
s
be
all
frame
considerably
more
tastefully
each
movie
in
its
own
gleam
stainless
steel
frame
encircle
by
a
ring
of
lightbulb
like
the
marquee
poster
you
see
in
theater
lobby
do
you
know
what
those
thing
cost
i
couldn
t
help
but
mutter
to
reed
as
we
be
ushered
into
the
conference
room
i
be
happy
to
see
that
their
conference
room
be
almost
like
ours
if
ours
have
be
about
fifty
time
big
and
with
a
view
across
the
entirety
of
dallas
rather
than
the
dumpster
between
us
and
the
park
and
with
a
thirty
foot
conference
table
make
from
an
endanger
hardwood
with
hidden
power
outlet
and
audiovisual
plug
rather
than
an
eight
foot
fold
table
with
an
extension
cord
and
surge
protector
so
you
know
pretty
much
the
same
i
be
already
feel
a
little
like
a
country
mouse
in
the
big
city
and
in
my
short
and
t
shirt
a
little
chilly
in
the
arctic
blast
of
texan
ac
when
the
blockbuster
boy
come
in
and
introduce
themselves
blockbuster
ceo
john
antioco
come
in
first
he
be
dress
casually
but
expensively
no
suit
but
his
loafer
probably
cost
more
than
my
car
he
seem
relaxed
and
confident
and
with
good
reason
too
antioco
have
come
to
blockbuster
after
nearly
ten
year
as
a
turnaround
specialist
know
for
parachute
into
struggle
company
circle
k
taco
bell
and
pearle
vision
among
them
figure
out
which
core
aspect
of
the
business
show
promise
restore
company
morale
and
coax
the
balance
sheet
back
into
profitability
blockbuster
have
need
him
after
explosive
growth
and
massive
profit
in
the
eighty
and
half
of
the
ninety
the
company
have
flounder
at
the
turn
of
the
millennium
a
string
of
poor
decision
like
sell
music
and
clothing
in
the
store
have
largely
backfire
and
the
company
have
be
slow
extremely
slow
to
adapt
to
new
technology
like
the
dvd
and
to
the
internet
although
he
have
no
experience
in
entertainment
antioco
have
recognize
in
blockbuster
the
characteristic
he
be
intimately
familiar
with
a
struggle
chain
with
thousand
of
store
ten
of
thousand
of
demoralize
employee
and
the
opportunity
to
bring
thing
back
to
profitability
antioco
s
method
have
show
promise
almost
immediately
renter
be
return
to
the
store
revenue
be
up
and
the
stock
price
of
blockbuster
s
parent
company
viacom
have
double
in
no
small
part
because
of
blockbuster
s
success
so
as
antioco
strode
into
the
conference
room
that
morning
in
september
of
i
m
sure
he
be
feel
self
assure
he
have
take
blockbuster
through
an
ipo
just
a
year
earlier
raise
more
than
million
in
cash
and
he
be
now
the
ceo
of
a
publicly
trade
company
he
be
ready
to
hear
us
out
but
what
we
say
have
well
be
good
as
we
shook
hand
with
antioco
and
his
general
counsel
ed
stead
it
be
hard
not
to
feel
a
bit
intimidate
it
be
partly
the
loafer
antioco
be
wear
beautiful
italian
shoe
and
i
be
in
short
a
tie
dyed
t
shirt
and
flip
flop
reed
s
t
shirt
be
crisp
but
it
be
still
a
t
shirt
and
barry
always
the
best
dress
of
the
group
well
at
least
his
hawaiian
shirt
have
button
really
though
we
be
intimidate
because
blockbuster
be
in
a
much
strong
position
than
us
flush
with
cash
from
their
recent
ipo
they
weren
t
dependent
on
the
good
grace
of
vcs
to
keep
them
afloat
they
weren
t
struggle
with
the
scarlet
letter
com
and
bad
of
all
they
knew
it
there
s
nothing
like
go
into
a
negotiation
know
that
the
other
side
hold
almost
all
the
card
notice
that
i
write
almost
there
be
in
fact
a
few
point
in
our
favor
to
start
everyone
hat
blockbuster
this
after
all
be
a
company
that
have
manage
dissatisfaction
as
a
central
pillar
of
their
business
model
they
knew
that
most
customer
didn
t
enjoy
the
experience
of
rent
from
them
so
their
goal
as
a
company
wasn
t
so
much
to
make
the
customer
happy
as
it
be
to
not
piss
them
off
so
royally
that
they
d
never
come
back
and
there
be
a
lot
to
piss
them
off
late
fee
crappy
selection
dirty
store
poor
service
the
list
go
on
and
on
and
it
wasn
t
just
customer
who
hat
them
the
movie
industry
do
too
the
studio
felt
burn
by
the
hard
bargain
that
ed
stead
have
negotiate
on
blockbuster
s
behalf
as
the
chain
have
gain
market
share
they
also
resent
blockbuster
s
insistence
that
it
be
blockbuster
itself
that
be
create
demand
for
their
movie
rather
than
just
fulfil
the
demand
that
the
studio
felt
they
have
create
but
the
most
important
point
in
our
favor
be
the
inexorable
march

just
as
he
have
work
on
the

as

there

market
position
that
netflix
have
obtain
to
position
itself
more
strongly

a
number
what

we
talk
about
here
we
have
rehearse
this
or
at

we
have
rehearse
it
about
as
well
as
three
people
can
at
a
m
on
a
plane
after
a
night
of
drinking
at
a
dude
ranch
we
ve
take
a
look
at
recent
comparables

and
we

also
try

what
the

might
be
be
netflix
to
be
roll
out
to
the
blockbuster
user
base
we
ve
also
consider
how
to
make
this
accretive
rather
than
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
reed
fidget
i
have
see
this
before
it
be
just
a
matter
of
time
before
he
lose
all
patience
hold
hold
fifty
million

finally
interrupt
barry
stop
he
look
at

his
hand
fall
into
his
lap
then
smile
at

what
more
be
there
to
say
we
wait
through
reed
s
pitch
and
barry
s
windup
i
have
be
watch
antioco
i
knew
his
reputation
as
a
gift
empath
a
great
listener
someone
who
could
make
anyone
feel
that
they
be
important
and
have
something
to
say
worth
hearing
during
the
pitch
i
have
see
him
use
all
the
trick
that
i
d
also
learn
over
the
year
lean
in

contact
nod
slowly
when
the
speaker
turn
in
your
direction
frame
question
in
a
way
that
make
it
clear
you
re
listen
but
now
that
reed
have
name
a
number
i
saw
something
new
something
i
didn
t
recognize
a
different
expression
in
his
body
a
slight
tension
in
his
face
his
earnest
expression
slightly
unbalanced
by
a
turn
up
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
it
be
tiny
involuntary
and
vanished
almost
immediately
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
i
knew
what
be
happen
john
antioco
be
struggle
not
to
laugh
the
meeting
go
downhill
pretty
quickly
after
that
and
it
be
a
long
quiet
ride
back
to
the
airport
we
didn
t
have
a
lot
to
say
to
each
other
on
the
plane
either
we
left
the
tray
of
sandwich
and
cooky
on
the
counter
by
the
door
untouched
the
champagne
in
the
refrigerator

by
vanna
and
available
for
purchase
go
unpopped
each
of
us
be
lose
in
his
own
thought
reed
i
m
sure
have
put
the
meeting
behind
him
and
be
already
puzzle
through
some
new
business
problem
before
we
hit
cruise
altitude
barry
i
could
tell
be
run
number
in
his
head
try
to
figure
out
how
long
our
exist
cash
would
last
how
he
could
slow
the
rate
at
which
we
be
burning
through
it
what
clever
financing
rabbit
he
might
be
able
to
pull
from
his
hat
to
buy
us
a
few
extra
month
but
i
be
on
a
different
wavelength
we
d
be
in
trouble
before
but
the
dot
com
crash
be
different
the
spring
be
dry
up
and
we
couldn
t
count
on
unlimited
venture
capital
anymore
sell
have
seem
to
be
our
only
way
out
and
goliath
didn
t
want
to
buy
us
he
want
to
stomp
us
into
the
ground
as
long
a
shot
as
blockbuster
have
be
i
have
genuinely
held
out
hope
that
they
could
be
the
deus
ex
machina
that
would
save
us
that
in
one
bold
stroke
we
d
be
out
of
the
mountain
and
safely
on
the
trail
back
to
camp
now
it
be
clear
that
if
we
be
go
to
get
out
of
the
crash
alive
it
be
entirely
on
us
we
would
have
to
be
ruthless
in
our
focus
on
the
future
we
would
have
to
look
within
as
my
father
use
to
tell
me
sometimes
the
only
way
out
be
through
as
vanna
white
s
plane
swept
us
quietly
and
quickly
back
to
santa
barbara
and
as
we
all
sat
lose
in
our
own
thought
i
grabbed
an
empty
champagne
flute
and
tapped
it
with
a
plastic
spoon
from
the
fruit
tray
reed
look
up
sleepily
and
barry
pause
the
number
crunch
long
enough
to
look
me
in
the
eye
well
i
say
pantomime
a
toast
shit
i
pause
take
in
the
absurd
particular
of
the
scene
the
lear
s
leather
interior
barry
s
billowing
hawaiian
shirt
the
tray
of
fruit
big
enough
for
a
family
of
five
i
smile
feel
resolve
flood
my
chest
blockbuster
doesn
t
want
us
i
say
so
it
s
obvious
what
we
have
to
do
now
i
smile
couldn
t
help
it
it
look
like
now
we
re
go
to
have
to
kick
their
as

the
belt
tightens

among
climber
it
s
a
matter
of
dogma
that
if
you
haven
t
reach
the
summit
by
early
afternoon
it
s
time
to

what

a
no

we

neither
be

entirely
out

the
end

but
our
subscription
model
be
fundamentally
expensive
we
be
still
hemorrhage
money
and
the
landscape
we
found
ourselves
in
be
a
far
different
one
than
we
d
encounter
a
year
before
burning
cash
at
the
rate
that
have
be
normal
the
year
before
now
look
irresponsible
we
need
to
speed
thing
up
we
didn
t
have
to
become
profitable
necessarily
but
if
we
ever
want
to
go
public
bank
and
the
investor
they
recommend
our
stock
to
would
have
to
see
a
path
to
profitability
if
we
be
still
in
the
cycle
of
raise
million
every
year
and
then
post
million
in
loss
we
wouldn
t
look
like
a
very
good
bet
we
knew
that
if
we
want
any
chance
of
survive
in
a
post
bubble
world
we
have
to
be
ruthless
in
our
dedication
to
the
canada
principle
over
the
course
of
late
and
throughout
we
streamline
our
process
the
com
suffix
that
have
be
a
ticket
to
free
money
in
be
now
an
albatross
so
we
cut
it
from
our
name
the
portal
ethos
that
have
rule
the
world
and
the
boardroom
a
year
before
have
crashed
and
burn
alongside
dr
koop
so
we
shelve
it
we
call
this
ruthless
streamline
scrap
barnacle
off
the
hull
company
be
like
boat
sometimes
you
have
to
put
them
in
dry
dock
to
remove
the
barnacle
that
have
accrete
on
the

slow
down

in
the
wake
of
the
blockbuster
fiasco
and
the
crash
of
the
dot
com
market
we
take
time
to
self
ass
then
mercilessly
prune
back
all
program
test
addition
and
enhancement
that
weren
t
contribute
anymore
we
d
always
do
this
and
it
hadn
t
always
be
easy
sometimes
what
look
like
a
barnacle
to
you
be
someone
else
s
favorite
feature
for
instance
when
we
be
determine
the
price
point
for
marquee
we
have
test
dozen
of
price
and
dvd
quantity
we
d
have
some
customer
get
four
disc
at
a
time
for

and
still
others
we
d
allow
people
to
keep
two
disc
at
a
time
eight
and
every
number
in
between
and
while
the
standard
plan
be
to
swap
as
often
as
you
like
some
customer
be
limited
to
just
a
handful
of
swap
we
be
eventually
sue
over
one
of
our
more
interest
experiment
in
which
we
expedite
service
to
some
customer
to
see
if
that
encourage
the
light
renter
bird
in
netflix
parlance
and
artificially
slow
down
service
to
discourage
heavier
user
internally
and
secretly
call
pig
all
of
this
test
be
undeniably
useful
because
of
it
we
didn
t
have
to
argue
about
whether
high
price
slow
down
sign
up
rate
increase
churn
or
encourage
high
usage
we
have
prove
whether
it
do
each
of
these
thing
and
knew
exactly
by
how
much
but
once
we
d
learn
what
we
need
to
learn
the
usefulness
of
the
test
fell
to
zero
for
us
unfortunately
the
cost
stayed
the
same
and
each
new
feature
we
add
on
to
the
service
have
to
then
work
flawlessly
with
the
old
one
so
as
to
accommodate
all
our
customer
no
matter
which
plan
they
be
on
do
so
meant
that
design
get
complicate
test
get
harder
and
everything
slow
down
an
outdated
feature
be
a
barnacle
the
drag
it
impose
might
be
tiny
but
multiply
by
a
thousand
it
slow
us
down
and
cost
us
money
so
we
scrap
every
meeting
before
we
could
launch
into
any
discussion
of
what
we
plan
to
do
go
forward
we
have
to
start
by
look
backward
come
up
with
a
list
of
what
we
could
decide
to
stop
do
it
wasn
t
easy
most
time
decide
what
not
to
do
be
harder
than
decide
what
to
do
yes
the
customer
who
be
on
the
plan
be
delighted
to
have
their
test
terminate
and
get
switch
onto
the
group
not
so
much
the
lucky
few
pay
for
the
same
service
or
get
eight
disc
at
a
time
after
a
while
we
get
pretty
callous
about
it
let
em
scream
we
would
rationalize
we
re
okay
with
upset
a
thousand
if
it
mean
we
get
it
right
for
ten
thousand
as
slid
into
with
the
blockbuster
opportunity
steadily
recede
in
the
rearview
mirror
and
the
idea
of
an
ipo
shelve
for
the
foreseeable
future
barry
be
furiously
scrap
barnacle
from
every
aspect
of
the
business
desperate
to
make
our
boat
go
faster
at
first
the
item
on
the
cut
list
be
easy
to
tackle
if
we
weren
t
go
to
go
forward
as
a
portal
we
didn
t
need
to
develop
technology
to
serve
up
advertising
on
our
page
christina
and
her
team
could
drop
their
effort
to
develop
a
showtime
feature
and
the
content
team
no
longer
need
to
assemble
data
for
every
movie
on
the
planet
we
could
just
focus
on
the
dvd
catalogue
but
we
didn
t
need
barry
s
spreadsheet
to
tell
us
what
be
become
increasingly
obvious
to
everyone
who
sat
around
our
e
staff
table
every
monday
we
have
more
people
than
we
need
under
ordinary
circumstance
be
a
little
heavy
would
have
be
okay
at
the
rate
we
be
grow
we
could
have
easily
absorbed
extra
employee
by
wait
a
quarter
or
two
until
the
add
volume
and
complexity
of
the
business
both
warrant
and
economically
support
have
more
staff
but
thing
be
different
now
as
barry
work
through
the
number
and
confront
the
new
post
crash
landscape
it
be
clear
that
we
have
to
be
not
just
a
lighter
company
we
need
to
be
a
different
one
in
a
post
bubble
landscape
we
couldn
t
look
like
a
money
pit
there
have
to
be
a
point
where
not
only
be
we
make
money
from
each
customer
each
month
but
there
be
enough
customer
to
cover
the
fix
cost
of
run
the
business
in
the
past
we
have
mostly
focus
on
only
one
side
of
the
equation
get
more
customer
now
it
be
become
increasingly
obvious
that
we
have
to
focus
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
spending
less
money
run
the
business
there
be
only
so
many
cost
we
could
cut
by
eliminate
big
thing
and
we
be
run
out
of
barnacle
to
scrape
we
have
a
clean
hull
and
the
destination
be
clearly
define
but
the
boat
be
still
too
heavy
if
we
be
go
to
make
it
to
shore
we
d
need
to
lighten
the
ship
our
usual
tuesday
e
staff
meeting
always
begin
with
the
same
agenda
item
who
fuck
up
that
wasn
t
the
official
name
for
it
of
course
but
that
s
what
i
call
it
in
the
interest
of
transparency
and
radical
honesty
each
of
us
would
go
around
the
room
and
say
something
that
wasn
t
work
we
didn
t
need
to
know
what
be
go
well
thing
that
be
work
didn
t
need
any
attention
from
the
rest
of
us
instead
we
want
to
know
what
wasn
t
work
who
in
my
elevate
parlance
be
fuck
up
it
s
a
maxim
of
startup
life
you
re
go
to
get
thing
wrong
you
just
don
t
want
to
get
the
same
thing
wrong
twice
at
one
meeting
in
the
summer
of
just
after
the
morning
s
ritual
flog
be
complete
reed
gesture
to
barry
that
it
be
time
for
new
business
barry
stood
up
from
his
seat
and
walk
to
the
whiteboard
grabbed
a
green
marker
and
write
in
large
letter
that
s
the
number
barry
announce
turn
toward
us
at
our
current
overhead
level
that
s
how
many
subscriber
we
ll
need
to
get
to
profitability
he
lean
down
and
squint
at
his
laptop
but
that
s
seventy
three
week
away
and
every
month
between
now
and
then
we
re
burning
money
we
ll
run
out
long
before
we
ll
get
there
and
i
don
t
need
to
remind
anyone
that
people
aren
t
exactly
line
up
to
throw
money
at
our
foot
barry
pause
then
squint
down
at
his
laptop
again
we
have
to
cut
our
expense
and
deep
we
have
to
be
lean
enough
to
make
it
to
profitability
on
the
money
we
already
have
and
the
only
way
we
do
that
be
by
lower
our
cost
so
that
we
can
be
profitable
on
a
small
subscriber
base
he
picked
up
the
green
marker
and
turn
back
to
the
board
with
the
edge
of
his
palm
he
erase
the
at
the
head
of
the
number
and
replace
it
with
a
we
ll
only
survive
if
we
can
be
profitable
on
one
million
subscriber
and
this
he
say
opening
a
manila
folder
and
slide
a
staple
set
of
paper
around
to
each
of
us
this
be
how
we
re
go
to
do
it
layoff
that
be
barry
s
plan
after
his
dramatic
reveal
reed
patty
barry
and
i
met
for
lunch
every
day
chew
through
dozen
of
scenario
which
department
should
we
cut
to
the
bone
which
should
survive
unscathed
should
we
cut
highly
paid
but
more
valuable
employee
or
make
it
up
in
volume
by
drastically
reduce
the
rank
of
customer
service
agent
these
be
complicate
question
we
need
to
cut
expense
dramatically
but
we
have
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
wouldn
t
damage
our
ability
to
grow
our
business
after
a
particularly
grueling
session
i
swung
by
joel
mier
s
desk
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
joel
be
my
director
of
research
and
analytics
in
his
role
he
have
to
straddle
art
and
science
data
and
intuition
and
his
appearance
support
that
at
he
be
a
powerful
presence
but
he
held
himself
in
a
gentle
way
that
make
him
approachable
in
an
office
full
of
short
and
unwashed
t
shirt
joel
dress
like
a
university
professor
button
down
shirt
cardigan
corduroy
pant
and
black
oxford
he
be
extremely
measure
in
his
speech
and
chose
his
word
carefully
he
be
an
even
more
thoughtful
listener
nod
slowly
and
considerately
at
even
the
stupidest
utterance
as
if
the
failure
to
find
some
genius
in
them
must
lie
with
him
but
his
professorial
manner
hid
a
sharp
wit
and
a
hooligan
in
the
back
row
sense
of
humor
joel
love
a
good
practical
joke
he
be
a
consummate
player
of
coin
in
the
fountain
and
love
nothing
more
than
to
stock
the
netflix
kitchen
with
half
edible
delicacy
he
d
once
put
out
a
bowl
of
freeze
dry
garbanzo
bean
that
have
prompt
an
enrage
mitch
lowe
to
scream
you
almost
broke
my
tooth
motherfucker
i
still
laugh
when
i
think
about
it
joel
s
combination
of
data
driven
intelligence
and
sophomoric
humor
have
make
us
fast
friend
from
day
one
it
didn
t
happen
often
but
whenever
we
could
joel
and
i
like
nothing
well
than
to
sneak
away
at
lunch
to
a
booth
at
the
black
watch
the
sole
dive
bar
in
los
gatos
to
carefully
dissect
our
colleague
our
head
collapse
helplessly
in
laughter
onto
the
beer
stain
table
how
s
it
hangin
bos
joel
murmur
now
barely
look
up
from
his
screen
up
and
to
the
right
i
say
give
the
ritual
response
to
our
usual
greet
i
flip
my
head
toward
the
stair
let
s
go
for
a
walk
earlier
that
week
reed
barry
and
i
have
brought
all
the
netflix
director
into
the
cone
of
silence
and
share
our
intention
with
them
since
the
majority
of
the
employee
in
the
company
directly
report
to
this
group
they
have
the
best
idea
of
who
be
actually
get
thing
do
who
be
irreplaceable
and
who
could
be
easily
do
without
i
have
gotten
in
the
habit
of
take
daily
walk
with
most
of
them
make
lazy
circle
around
the
building
as
we
talk
out
loud
about
each
person
in
the
department
i
need
their
help
because
decide
whom
to
let
go
be
complicate
talent
and
indispensability
turn
out
to
be
the
easy
dimension
to
figure
out
it
be
the
other
stuff
that
get
us
tangle
how
much
weight
should
be
put
on
personal
situation
what
if
an
employee
be
the
sole
breadwinner
in
her
family
with
a
new
baby
should
she
stay
on
rather
than
someone
young
and
single
but
more
talented
and
what
about
the
handful
of
married
couple
work
at
netflix
would
it
be
just
too
cruel
to
fire
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
joel
be
pull
on
his
jacket
as
he
push
open
the
building
s
front
door
with
his
hip
and
join
me
on
the
sidewalk
without
say
anything
we
turn
and
begin
the
loop
circle
clockwise
around
the
building
i
ve
be
think
bos
joel
begin
as
soon
as
we
be
safely
out
of
earshot
of
an
employee
get
out
of
his
car
that
s
always
dangerous
i
reply
joel
smile
and
continued
i
know
we
have
talk
about
do
this
lifo
but
i
m
not
feel
it
lifo
stood
for
last
in
first
out
meaning
that
the
last
people
hire
have
the
least
tenure
would
be
the
first
one
to
be
let
go
we
d
borrow
the
term
which
usually
apply
to
inventory
although
lifo
for
our
purpose
didn
t
necessarily
correlate
to
talent
it
do
correspond
to
experience
on
the
job
and
to
some
degree
it
make
people
feel
like
there
be
a
rational
basis
to
a
process
that
could
often
feel
pretty
random
it
s
kyle
that
i
m
worried
about
joel
finally
blurt
out
he
s
definitely
not
next
in
line
to
go
when
you
use
seniority
but
his
attitude
joel
left
the
thought
hang
i
knew
exactly
what
he
meant
in
one
of
the
analytics
meeting
that
we
periodically
held
where
we
brought
together
people
from
different
discipline
in
the
company
to
wrestle
with
particularly
challenge
analytical
problem
kyle
be
consistently
prove
himself
to
be
how
shall
i
put
this
difficult
at
netflix
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
disagreement
in
fact
disagreement
be
a
critical
component
of
our
culture
of
radical
honesty
we
expect
disagreement
because
we
encourage
vigorous
debate
in
netflix
meeting
there
be
no
seniority
and
no
one
s
opinion
be
more
valuable
because
of
their
title
age
or
salary
everyone
be
expect
to
fight
for
their
point
of
view
until
a
consensus
have
be
reach
still
no
matter
how
passionate
the
argument
there
be
a
share
expectation
at
netflix
that
once
the
self
evidently
correct
conclusion
have
be
reach
it
be
time
to
fall
in
and
implement
it
disagreement
be
collaborative
not
ego
driven
it
didn
t
matter
who
be
right
all
that
matter
be
that
we
get
it
right
and
that
be
where
kyle
be
fall
short
he
just
couldn
t
get
over
it
when
thing
didn
t
go
his
way
and
his
bad
attitude
be
infect
everyone
i
get
it
he
s
out
of
here
we
ll
keep
markowitz
i
say
to
joel
refer
to
one
of
joel
s
direct
report
good
he
say
flatly
without
look
up
at
me
i
d
know
joel
long
enough
to
understand
that
there
be
something
on
his
mind
as
we
turn
the
corner
and
pass
the
picnic
table
that
sat
in
a
small
courtyard
to
the
side
of
the
building
i
finally
figure
it
out
by
the
way
i
say
quietly
if
i
haven
t
already
make
it
clear
you
re
safe

desert
the
cluster
of
empty
chair
and
cubicle

somber
premonition
of
what

in
less
than
twenty
four
hour
i
caught
joel
s
eye

curt
nod

intently
and
gesture
at
something

and
with
her
pen
drew
a
line
through
a
row
of

longer
right
for
the
challenge
ahead
of
us
as
for
everyone
else
after
two
final
marathon
session
over
the
weekend
we
have
come
to
our
final
list
now
it

time
to
act

up
from
her
notebook
push
up
her
sleeve
to
check

out
right
on
schedule
at
on
tuesday
morning
it
be
short
and
to
the
point
there
would
be
an
important
announcement
at
in
front
of
the
building
the
company
have
long
since
swell
past
the
point
where
we
could
fit
everyone
in
a
single
room
not
even
the
lobby
could
hold
us
now
when
we
need
to
assemble
the
entire
company
we
have
to
rent
the
year
old
los
gatos
theater
on
santa
cruz
avenue
or
just
gather
like
a
mob
outside
in
the
picnic
area
by
our
front
entrance
today
it
be
the
courtyard
there
be
no
sense
rent
a
theater
to
tell
percent
of
your
company
that
they
be
lose
their
job
that
would
just
be
cruel
as
i
walk
through
the
row
of
cubicle
on
my
way
to
the
stairwell
i
instinctively
step
into
the
conference
room
at
the
head
of
the
stair
this
would
be
where
my
department
would
be
do
their
layoff
and
i
thought
i
should
do
one
last
check
to
ensure
that
at
the
very
least
there
be
two
chair
in
there
get
fire
be
bad
enough
i
thought
you
should
at
least
get
a
chair
to
sit
in
but
it
be
okay
two
chair
an
empty
table
a
clean
whiteboard
nothing
to
indicate
that
there
wouldn
t
be
a
regular
meeting
there
outside
there
be
already
a
big
crowd
gather
in
the
courtyard
people
stood
in
small
group
nervously
talk
i
found
joel
and
stood
stoically
next
to
him
a
few
minute
after
reed
climbed
up
onto
one
of
the
picnic
table
the
crowd
quiet
for
more
than
three
year
we
have
all
work
tremendously
hard
to
get
netflix
where
it
be
today
work
we
should
all
be
very
proud
of
but
we
ve
all
know
that
there
would
be
day
that
we
have
to
make
hard
decision
i
m
afraid
that
today
be
one
of
those
day
reed
pause
and
look
around
there
wasn
t
a
sound
from
across
the
park
beyond
the
fence
i
could
just
hear
the
steam
whistle
from
the
park
railroad
and
the
scream
of
excite
child
somewhere
at
least
somebody
be
have
fun
it
should
be
clear
to
everyone
reed
continued
that
the
funding
environment
have
change
dramatically
over
the
last
twelve
month
not
just
for
us
but
for
every
company
in
the
valley
we
can
no
longer
count
on
venture
money
to
carry
us
along
we
need
to
become
self
sufficient
we
need
to
control
our
own
destiny
to
do
so
we
have
to
reduce
our
expense
such
that
we
can
achieve
profitability
with
a
small
subscriber
number
and
we
have
to
reduce
our
spending
level
to
ensure
that
we
have
enough
money
to
last
us
to
that
point
across
the
crowd
i
could
see
joel
s
employee
markowitz
visibly
shaken
face
pale
upper
lip
sweat
he
be
tear
a
napkin
to
shred
in
his
hand
i
nudge
joel
you
should
probably
reassure
him
i
say
guy
look
like
he
s
about
to
pas
out
joel
nod
and
weave
his
way
through
the
crowd
i
saw
him
take
markowitz
by
the
shoulder
whisper
something
in
his
ear
instantly
markowitz
s
expression
change
he
look
enormously
relieve
reed
on
the
other
hand
appear
to
be
waver
perch
atop
the
picnic
table
above
a
now
visibly
restless
crowd
he
look
like
a
revolutionary
start
to
realize
that
he
be
fail
to
inspire
the
mob
he
glance
down
at
patty
for
reassurance
she
be
look
up
at
him
and
slowly
nod
there
be
go
to
be
layoff
today
he
say
gathering
his
strength
some
of
our
friend
and
colleague
will
be
leave
us
but
this
be
not
because
they
have
do
anything
wrong
it
s
purely
because
this
be
what
must
be
do
to
make
the
company
strong
go
back
inside
and
wait
for
your
manager
to
give
you
instruction
about
your
particular
situation
the
crowd
disperse
noiselessly
and
i
let
myself
be
swept
along
toward
the
entrance
and
up
the
main
stair
something
about
be
surround
by
my
scar
employee
make
me
see
the
situation
from
their
perspective
how
have
it
come
to
this
we
be
there
we
figure
it
out
no
due
date
no
late
fee
we
focus
relentlessly
on
what
be
important
we
get
cinematch
off
the
ground
we
figure
out
next
day
shipping
we
figure
out
how
to
get
new
customer
efficiently
why
retreat
now
as
i
turn
at
the
top
of
the
stair
i
notice
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
that
there
be
something
different
about
the
conference
room
i
d
checked
out
not
more
than
twenty
minute
earlier
there
be
now
something
on
the
table
a
powder
blue
box
of
kleenex
perch
in
the
exact
center
one
tissue
puffed
artfully
out
of
the
top
we
even
figure
out
how
to
do
a
layoff
i
thought
not
without
some
bitterness
it
be
all
over
by
people
stood
in
small
group
some
cry
some
relieve
some
just
shell
shock
the
office
be
almost
empty
when
it
start
everyone
have
be
on
edge
as
manager
have
move
silently
through
the
office
summon
employee
to
their
respective
conference
room
if
you
be
call
early
in
the
process
it
be
pretty
clear
what
be
go
on
for
the
rest
of
the
group
each
person
call
away
that
wasn
t
you
be
one
more
dodge
bullet
until
finally
a
manager
would
emerge
from
their
conference
room
and
give
a
relieve
all
clear
to
their
department
for
the
people
do
the
fire
there
be
no
avoid
the
discomfort
we
have
all
be
through
hell
together
these
be
friend
they
be
colleague
some
like
vita
who
get
the
ax
that
day
have
be
there
from
the
begin
and
now
i
be
tell
them
it
be
time
to
leave
i
cry
with
all
of
them
when
it
be
all
over
i
just
lay
there
on
my
couch
emotionally
drain
toss
a
soccer
ball
up
in
the
air
over
and
over
again
replay
in
my
mind
what
i
d
do
my
last
layoff
have
be
jennifer
morgan
one
of
our
newer
analyst
when
i
approach
her
cube
she
sat
with
her
back
to
me
engross
in
her
screen
even
then
able
to
concentrate
on
the
problem
in
front
of
her
i
touch
her
shoulder
and
as
she
slowly
turn
to
me
i
saw
that
there
be
tear
in
her
eye
i
knew
it
be
all
she
say
as
she
gather
up
her
purse
and
prepared
to
follow
me
to
the
conference
room
i
just
knew
it
shortly
after
we
be
finish
i
gather
the
remainder
of
my
department
together
i
give
them
a
short
talk
about
move
forward
and
the
solemn
responsibility
we
have
to
demonstrate
to
ourselves
and
everyone
else
that
this
layoff
have
not
be
do
capriciously
or
cruelly
but
with
the
sole
focus
of
ensure
that
netflix
survive
we
owe
it
to
everyone
to
make
sure
that
happen
later
after
everyone
disperse
some
for
lunch
some
for
home
some
just
to
do
slow
lap
through
the
building
to
see
who
be
still
left
joel
come
to
join
me
in
my
corner
we
didn
t
talk
much
there
wasn
t
much
to
say
the
future
could
start
tomorrow
we
just
sat
there
toss
the
soccer
ball
back
and
forth
until
i
notice
a
lone
figure
at
the
periphery
of
my
vision
just
from
the
tennis
shoe
i
knew
it
be
an
engineer
when
i
look
up
i
saw
someone
i
have
hire
myself
many
year
ago
a
hard
worker
a
skilled
coder
a
nice
guy
he
just
hadn
t
make
the
cut
sorry
marc
he
start
i
don
t
want
to
interrupt
you
but
i
want
to
come
back
and
make
sure
you
be
okay
this
must
have
be
really
tough
on
you
i
held
the
soccer
ball
and
cocked
my
head
i
didn
t
know
how
to
answer
it
didn
t
make
sense
he
d
just
be
laid
off
and
he
be
wonder
if
i
be
okay
well
anyway
he
awkwardly
continued
after
a
few
second
thanks
for
everything
he
turn
and
start
to
walk
away
but
then
just
before
he
pass
the
end
of
the
row
of
cube
he
stop
as
if
he
have
suddenly
remember
something
hey
he
shout
back
a
smile
on
his
face
crush
blockbuster
okay
and
with
that
he
be
go

go
public
may
month
post
launch
in
the
week
and
month
follow
september
s
painful
layoff
we
start
to
notice
something
we
be
well
we
be
more
efficient
more
creative
more
decisive
winnow
our
staff
make
us
leaner
and
more
focus
we
no
longer
have
time
to
waste
so
we
didn
t
waste
it
and
while
we
certainly
have
to
lay
off
some
very
talented
individual
we
d
be
left
only
with
superstar
player
with
superstar
player
do
all
of
the
work
it
be
no
wonder
that
our
quality
of
work
be
very
high
you
see
this
often
in
successful
startup
the
business
get
off
the
ground
because
of
the
focus
dedication
and
creativity
of
a
small
group
of
dedicate
people
it
hire
grows
big
and
then
contract
itself
it
rededicates
itself
to
its
mission
and
often
accomplishes
it
through
the
renew
focus
and
energy
of
its
most
valuable
member
hire
and
keep
star
player
be
about
much
more
than
just
quality
of
work
however
it
s
a
culture
thing
when
you
retain
only
star
player
you
create
a
culture
of
competitive
excellence
it
s
more
fun
to
come
to
work
when
you
know
you
re
part
of
the
handpicked
elite
plus
it
s
much
easy
to
attract
other
elite
talent
to
your
team
when
you
ve
establish
a
reputation
for
superstar
talent
in
some
way
netflix
in
late
be
like
june
all
over
again
a
handpicked
team
of
extremely
capable
people
work
very
hard
on
a
singular
goal
one
million
subscriber
and
just
like
we
hit
it
this
time
month
in
advance
by
christmas
we
reach
the
finish
line
early
in
large
part
because
tom
dillon
have
found
a
way
to
guarantee
quick
shipping
next
day
shipping
to
user
all
over
the
country
in
many
way
it
be
an
extension
of
our
sacramento
test
and
our
old
idea
about
user
mail
dvd
to
each
other
turn
out
you
didn
t
need
to
build
huge
expensive
warehouse
all
across
the
country
to
ship
dvd
if
percent
of
the
dvd
people
want
be
already
in
circulation
tom
have
apply
to
shipping
a
principle
we
all
understood
intuitively
when
it
come
to
movie
people
be
lemming
they
want
to
watch
what
everyone
else
be
watch
if
you
d
finish
apollo
yesterday
then
it
be
highly
likely
that
somebody
else
want
it
today
conversely
if
the
next
movie
in
your
queue
be
boogie
night
it
be
just
as
likely
somebody
else
be
return
it
that
day
tom
s
brilliant
idea
be
to
recognize
that
when
a
user
mail
a
dvd
back
to
us
it
didn
t
need
to
go
to
a
warehouse
the
size
of
a
costco
it
didn
t
even
need
to
go
back
on
a
shelf
it
could
go
right
back
out
the
door
to
someone
else
and
we
could
run
that
business
from
a
shoebox
tom
analyze
hundred
of
thousand
of
data
point
to
figure
out
where
to
place
small
netflix
shipping
hub
basically
storefront
the
size
of
your
neighborhood
greek
restaurant
his
data
show
that
you
could
service
percent
of
the
country
with
next
day
delivery
if
you
judiciously
place
about
sixty
of
these
hub
all
across
the
country
they
weren
t
warehouse
they
be
reflection
point
nothing
be
really
store
there
dvd
come
in
would
almost
immediately
bounce
right
back
out
to
other
customer
here
s
how
tom
s
reflection
point
method
work
customer
mail
their
watch
dvd
to
the
post
office
closest
to
that
region
s
reflection
point
at
each
morning
a
local
employee
would
pick
up
the
mail
and
for
the
next
three
hour
that
employee
and
four
or
five
others
would
use
a
slitter
to
open
the
mailer
remove
the
disc
and
scan
each
dvd
into
a
netflix
inventory
program
the
dvd
would
temporarily
go
into
neat
pile
on
the
table
the
employee
would
transmit
all
that
data
to
headquarters
in
los
gatos
and
while
they
take
their
lunch
break
our
server
would
match
up
all
the
dvd
that
have
come
in
with
all
the
movie
those
customer
want
next
after
lunch
the
employee
would
scan
each
disc
again
but
this
time
the
system
would
spit
out
a
mail
label
bearing
the
address
of
the
customer
who
want
the
disc
next
the
process
work
obscenely
well
out
of
every
hundred
disc
that
arrive
each
day
ninety
of
them
have
a
customer
in
that
region
who
want
them
so
out
the
door
they
would
go
another
seven
or
eight
of
the
hundred
dvd
would
be
new
release
or
high
demand
item
that
no
one
want
that
day
but
which
we
be
pretty
sure
somebody
would
want
within
a
day
or
two
these
disc
be
store
in
the
reflection
point
s
tiny
shoebox
library
of
the
hundred
dvd
come
in
there
be
usually
only
two
or
three
for
which
we
didn
t
have
an
immediate
customer
or
anticipate
there
be
one
soon
these
and
only
these
be
sent
back
to
the
mothership
warehouse
in
san
jose
this
might
sound
like
hyperbole
but
tom
s
method
be
one
of
the
great
innovation
in
the
history
of
shipping
it
be
efficient
fast
and
cheap
it
meant
that
we
didn
t
have
to
waste
money
on
big
warehouse
since
we
didn
t
have
movie
sit
on
shelf
even
overnight
our
utilization
of
inventory
be
exceptionally
high
all
we
need
be
a
few
dozen
cheap
storefront
a
couple
hundred
remote
employee
and
a
bunch
of
shoebox
and
bingo
next
day
delivery
to
almost
every
mailbox
in
america
we
d
survive
we
be
hit
our
goal
but
thing
be
different
so
many
part
of
the
original
found
team
be
go
jim
be
work
for
an
amazon
affiliate
call
wineshopper
te
be
work
for
zone
lab
an
internet
security
startup
vita
have
be
laid
off
in
september
and
so
have
eric
christina
have
take
time
off
for
a
health
issue
in
and
have
never
be
able
to
return
full
time
the
original
crew
of
skilled
generalist
have
be
replace
with
superstar
specialist
i
be
glad
to
be
work
alongside
some
of
the
most
brilliant
mind
in
silicon
valley
but
as
one
of
the
last
link
to
the
original
team
i
be
start
to
wonder
about
my
future
role
in
the
company
where
do
i
fit
more
importantly
where
do
i
want
to
fit
by
early
i
be
spending
most
of
my
time
in
product
development
to
me
that
s
where
the
energy
really
be
we
be
even
then
look
toward
a
day
that
didn
t
include
dvd
the
growth
of
broadband
dsl
technology
in
the
early
s
be
make
it
newly
feasible
to
stream
content
online
we
knew
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
stream
begin
to
compete
with
physical
medium
and
we
want
to
position
ourselves
to
take
advantage
of
technological
shift
it
be
kind
of
funny
really
we
d
finally
figure
out
a
way
to
make
our
original
idea
of
dvd
by
mail
work
and
here
we
be
look
ahead
to
a
future
without
either
dvd
or
mail
we
knew
digital
delivery
be
the
future
but
how
soon
would
that
future
arrive
and
what
form
would
it
take
would
people
download
their
movie
or
stream
them
would
they
lean
forward
and
watch
on
their
computer
or
lean
back
and
watch
on
their
television
what
kind
of
infrastructure
would
have
to
exist
before
the
technology
could
be
widely
adopt
and
what
about
the
content
do
you
start
by
focus
on
a
single
genre
and
if
so
which
one
and
how
do
you
convince
the
studio
that
their
movie
once
in
digital
form
and
so
easily
copy
and
share
be
safe
in
your
hand
to
answer
these
question
i
talk
to
movie
studio
television
network
software
company
and
hardware
manufacturer
a
few
thing
be
clear
the
first
be
that
the
studio
and
network
be
terrify
of
be
napster
ed
they
d
watch
the
music
industry
fall
victim
to
widespread
piracy
and
cratered
sale
so
they
weren
t
very
keen
to
give
up
digital
right
no
matter
how
many
assurance
i
give
them
they
didn
t
trust
the
digital
future
the
way
they
saw
it
once
tv
show
and
movie
be
digitize
they
d
lose
all
control
of
their
product
along
with
any
ability
to
make
money
off
it
the
second
be
that
hardware
and
software
company
be
go
full
speed
ahead
digital
right
be
damn
apple
microsoft
and
pretty
much
every
other
major
computer
company
be
work
overtime
to
take
advantage
of
the
jump
in
bandwidth
speed
and
be
design
product
that
could
conceivably
deliver
very
large
file
movie
size
file
directly
into
viewer
home
everyone
be
compete
for
the
same
prize
who
would
own
the
portal
that
would
deliver
entertainment
directly
into
viewer
living
room
would
it
be
the
producer
of
the
content
like
movie
and
television
studio
would
it
be
the
developer
of
the
hardware
and
software
necessary
to
view
it
in
the
home
or
would
it
be
the
cable
company
which
be
already
deliver
content
to
million
of
home
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
that
fall
and
winter
spitballing
with
neil
hunt
who
have
join
netflix
in
and
be
now
in
charge
of
our
programmer
tall
and
rail
thin
neil
rarely
venture
out
of
his
cube
without
a
coffee
cup
in
his
hand
sometimes
glide
into
a
conference
room
with
a
full
french
press
which
he
would
punch
down
a
few
minute
later
ideally
at
the
exact
moment
he
be
try
to
make
a
point
neil
be
soft
spoken
delicate
and
somewhat
reserve
many
time
when
he
knew
he
would
soon
need
to
do
a
code
review
for
a
colleague
i
would
watch
from
my
window
as
he
do
lap
through
the
parking
lot
steel
himself
to
deliver
the
bad
news
he
be
undeniably
brilliant
at
a
company
where
meeting
usually
hit
decibel
level
just
short
of
a
stanley
cup
final
neil
didn
t
need
to
shout
as
soon
as
he
begin
to
speak
people
would
lean
in
to
listen
like
me
neil
saw
the
national
increase
in
internet
bandwidth
as
a
possibility
a
way
to
use
digital
mean
to
deliver
netflix
movie
directly
to
tv
set
and
far
shrink
the
time
between
finish
one
movie
and
get
the
next
one
instantaneous
stream
wasn
t
possible
in
and
downloads
would
take
hour
but
we
be
bet
that
even
so
passively
download
a
movie
while
you
be
asleep
or
at
work
be
still
preferable
to
get
in
the
car
and
drive
to
blockbuster
in
our
ideal
spitballing
world
customer
would
always
have
a
few
download
movie
ready
to
watch
in
a
device
on
top
of
their
tv
and
an
even
big
list
of
movie
in
their
queue
they
could
choose
a
movie
to
watch
and
when
they
be
finish
they
could
just
mark
it
as
complete
then
their
queue
would
automatically
start
download
the
next
film
on
the
list
the
next
day
boom
new
movie
to
watch
still
it
be
tough
sled
convincing
the
studio
and
tech
company
that
our
idea
be
a
good
one
and
even
more
difficult
try
to
convince
them
that
we
be
the
one
to
pull
it
off
as
far
as
they
be
concerned
we
be
just
a
content
company
that
have
figure
out
how
to
use
the
post
office
digital
delivery
leave
it
to
the
big
boy
i
ll
never
forget
drive
out
of
microsoft
s
headquarters
with
neil
after
a
particularly
dispirit
meeting
with
some
of
their
executive
we
be
in
redmond
a
suburb
of
seattle
and
i
couldn
t
help
but
think
of
my
trip
to
amazon
with
reed
three
year
before
but
this
time
instead
of
a
shabby
office
building
in
a
rough
part
of
town
i
be
drive
through
a
glitter
corporate
campus
shade
by
tower
redwood
and
border
by
pristine
artificial
lake
instead
of
rough
look
men
huddle
outside
a
methadone
clinic
there
be
microsoft
employee
play
ultimate
frisbee
on
manicure
lawn
our
meeting
have
be
with
two
of
the
technical
guru
work
on
their
upcoming
xbox
game
station
they
be
only
a
few
week
away
from
launch
but
microsoft
be
already
late
to
the
party
and
be
in
a
desperate
scramble
to
catch
up
to
sony
and
nintendo
in
an
effort
to
leapfrog
these
competitor
the
xbox
would
include
two
killer
feature
an
ethernet
port
and
a
hard
disc
which
would
allow
the
xbox
to
connect
to
the
internet
and
then
store
whatever
it
download
publicly
microsoft
be
position
these
feature
as
a
way
to
enhance
the
game
experience
but
we
knew
that
they
be
look
into
use
them
for
download
television
and
movie
and
we
d
be
eye
a
potential
partnership
the
way
we
saw
it
microsoft
have
the
technology
and
we
have
the
content
but
the
whole
thing
have
fizzle
as
usual
the
answer
be
cloaked
in
politesse
but
the
message
be
the
same
why
do
we
need
you
what
a
waste
of
time
neil
be

no
thanks
no

no
i
say
and
smile
neil
groan
and
wave
off
what
i
d
say
as
a
platitude
a
lie
to
make
him
feel
well
stop

me
up

over

i
d
listen
to

tell
us
no
and
then
watch
as
slowly
they
change
their
mind

to

your

my
dream
come
out
of
college

to
land
a
job
in
advertising
quite
a
leap
for
someone
who

i
m
optimistic
and
persistent
the

accessible
to

the
advertising
agency
s
creative
team
although
this
be
predominantly
a
job
that
go
to
mba
graduate
some
agency
do
extend
their
recruitment
to
undergraduate
so
i
jumped
at
the
chance
to
interview
when
a
representative
of
n
w
ayer
come
to
campus
to
my
surprise
i
make
the
first
cut
and
be
invite
with
a
dozen
other
student
to
come
down
to
new
york
city
to
interview
after
a
full
day
of
meeting
with
representative
from
almost
every
department
i
again
get
the
news
that
i
have
make
the
cut
the
only
one
from
my
school
to
do
so
i
be
now
one
of
only
five
student
from
throughout
the
northeast
all
of
us
compete
for
a
single
job
i
didn
t
get
it
i
bounce
back
quickly
so
my
disappointment
in
not
have
gotten
this
dream
job
quickly
turn
to
confusion
what
could
i
possibly
be
miss
that
some
other
candidate
have
ignorant
of
all
the
invisible
criterion
that
be
be
apply
to
me
and
that
i
would
be
especially
aware
of
when
it
be
later
my
turn
to
be
on
the
hire
side
of
the
table
i
frankly
couldn
t
conceive
of
what
i
be
miss
so
i
decide
to
ask
i
write
a
long
letter
to
every
single
person
who
have
interviewed
me
take
the
opportunity
to
recap
for
them
all
of
my
positive
trait
i
explain
that
while
i
have
conclude
that
i
must
be
miss
something
important
i
be
hop
they
might
be
able
to
explain
to
me
exactly
what
that
be
you
see
i
explain
since
there
be
a
one
hundred
percent
certainty
that
i
will
be
apply
for
this
job
next
year
i
would
like
to
take
the
time
to
work
on
whatever
skill
i
be
deficient
in
i
m
cringe
think
about
this
now
but
it
work
just
four
day
later
i
get
a
call
one
of
the
senior
partner
in
the
agency
want
to
meet
with
me
this
be
the
guy
who
ran
the
whole
business
side
of
the
agency
several
day
later
as
we
sat
in
a
plush
corner
office
forty
two
story
above
sixth
avenue
he
offer
me
the
job
it
turn
out
that
none
of
the
candidate
have
actually
be
offer
the
job
the
first
time
around
n
w
ayer
knew
that
be
an
account
executive
be
a
sell
job
a
turn
a
no
into
a
yes
type
of
job
so
they
have
say
no
to
all
of
us
and
i
be
the
only
one
of
the
candidate
who
hadn
t
take
no
for
an
answer
microsoft
didn
t
agree
to
partner
with
us
but
someone
would
in
the
meantime
i
be
quietly
redefine
my
role
at
netflix
i
wasn
t
president
anymore
technically
i
be
an
executive
producer
even
then
we
be
start
our
transformation
from
geeky
software
startup
to
full
fledge
entertainment
company
now
if
i
could
only
remember
which
dry
cleaner
have
my
new
medium
outfit
reed
have
the
rein
and
he
deserve
them
raise
over
million
in
capital
would
never
have
be
possible
without
him
his
leadership
have
take
us
through
the
dot
com
bubble
s
age
of
irrational
exuberance
and
beyond
it
i
be
in
a
funny
position
i
d
found
netflix
i
have
see
the
come
internet
wave
and
have
paddle
in
at
just
the
right
moment
it
have
be
in
the
begin
my
company
but
slowly
ever
since
that
fateful
powerpoint
from
reed
thing
have
shift
i
be
fine
with
that
reed
s
emergence
as
the
face
of
the
company
have
save
our
ass
but
it
have
also
left
me
somewhat
maroon
between
the
past
and
the
future
and
the
future
be
something
i
be
think
a
lot
about
in
i
have
family
i
adore
three
young
child
and
a
beautiful
marriage
with
my
best
friend
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
future
be
assure
for
each
of
them
and
though
i
d
earn
enough
at
my
previous
startup
to
live
comfortably
this
be
go
to
be
a
financial
event
of
a
totally
different
magnitude
put
simply
i
didn
t
want
all
my
asset
to
be
tie
up
in
one
company
s
stock
no
matter
how
much
faith
i
have
in
it
i
have
see
too
many
people
lose
everything
due
to
circumstance
beyond
their
control
and
i
be
smart
enough
to
know
that
i
didn
t
want
that
to
be
me
if
we
be
go
to
go
public
in
and
after
we
hit
one
million
subscriber
in
december
and
barry
start
make
the
round
again
with
bank
and
potential
investor
that
be
look
likely
i
want
to
be
able
to
sell
my
stock
the
problem
of
course
be
that
bank
and
investor
don
t
usually
view
a
high
rank
executive
in
the
company
sell
off
massive
amount
of
stock
as
a
good
thing
it
look
bad
like
he
know
something
they
don
t
that
wasn
t
the
case
for
me
i
have
complete
confidence
that
netflix
be
go
to
succeed
i
d
never
be
surer
that
the
company
we
d
built
be
destine
for
long
term
success
i
just
want
the
option
to
sell
for
that
to
happen
i
need
to
be
way
less
visible
to
bank
and
investor
i
couldn
t
be
list
as
president
on
our
s
that
meant
two
thing
need
to
happen
first
i
need
a
title
that
didn
t
make
it
look
like
i
be
in
charge
and
second
i
need
to
give
up
my
seat
on
the
netflix
board
the
first
be
easy
i
don
t
care
about
title
and
i
never
have
founder
and
executive
producer
be
fine
with
me
leave
the
board
be
a
little
harder
though
i
d
fought
hard
for
that
seat
and
i
d
already
almost
lose
it
once
soon
after
assume
the
role
of
ceo
reed
have
ask
me
to
give
up
my
seat
so
that
an
investor
could
take
it
i
d
refuse
adamantly
argue
that
i
d
give
up
my
title
as
ceo
i
d
even
give
up
some
share
but
i
wouldn
t
give
up
my
seat
on
the
board
of
director
that
be
one
step
too
far
i
want
some
control
over
the
direction
of
the
company
and
i
thought
it
be
important
that
a
found
member
of
the
company
be
there
to
counterbalance
the
interest
of
the
vcs
everyone
who
s
ever
be
on
a
board
say
that
they
re
only
interested
in
the
success
of
the
company
i
d
told
reed
but
you
and
i
both
know
that
success
mean
a
slightly
different
thing
to
vcs
than
it
do
to
a
company
s
founder
this
be
true
by
the
way
it
s
something
i
tell
startup
founder
all
the
time
now
vcs
will
always
say
that
they
re
align
with
your
mission
that
they
want
what
s
best
for
the
company
but
what
they
really
want
be
what
s
best
for
their
investment
in
the
company
which
isn
t
always
the
same
thing
everyone
be
align
when
the
wind
be
blowing
the
right
way
it
s
when
a
storm
come
up
that
all
of
a
sudden
it
becomes
apparent
that
people
have
different
goal
and
objective
reed
hadn
t
quite
see
it
that
way
but
patty
the
reed
whisperer
have
agree
with
me
if
thing
go
bad
she
d
ask
him
who
do
you
want
around
the
table
who
do
you
want
there
so
that
when
you
need
to
ask
a
tough
question
you
know
you
ll
get
a
straight
answer
reed
later
told
me
that
the
second
patty
ask
that
question
he
knew
that
keep
me
on
the
board
be
the
right
thing
to
do
not
just
for
me
but
for
the
company
so
give
up
my
seat
in
after
i
d
fought
so
hard
to
keep
it
be
a
somewhat
bitter
pill
to
swallow
but
it
be
a
decision
i
have
to
make
if
i
want
the
financial
security
of
liquidate
any
material
amount
of
my
stock
it
be
clear
by
early
in
the
year
that
no
dot
com
bubble
be
go
to
stop
us
this
time
we
be
go
to
go
public
and
it
be
go
to
be
a
life
change
event
too
bad
i
have
no
idea
what
that
change
be
go
to
look
like
dad
what
s
a
tail
number
logan
strain
against
his
seat
belt
in
an
attempt
to
see
out
over
the
dashboard
i
roll
up
my
window
as
the
metal
gate
slowly
open
in
front
of
our
car
ahead
of
us
a
plane
sat
wait
for
us
on
the
runway
its
wing
light
blinking
in
the
predawn
sky
i
drove
out
to
meet
it
on
the
tarmac
i
ask
the
same
question
last
time
i
do
this
i
told
him
it
be
may
the
day
before
our
ipo
and
about
five
year
after
i
d
first
lobbed
the
idea
of
dvd
by
mail
across
the
car
to
reed
i
wasn
t
drive
a
volvo
anymore
six
month
earlier
my
economic
confidence
grow
i
d
finally
take
the
plunge
and
bought
a
new
car
an
audi
allroad
it
have
four
wheel
drive
for
drive
through
snow
adjustable
height
suspension
for
back
road
approach
to
my
favorite
surf
spot
and
of
course
space
for
two
car
seat
in
the
back
it
wasn
t
a
luxury
car
in
most
people
s
eye
but
it
felt
like
one
to
me
i
cover
my
embarrassment
about
such
conspicuous
consumption
by
never
wash
the
exterior
and
always
keep
a
surfboard
a
bicycle
or
a
wet
suit
stash
in
the
back
the
audi
wasn
t
the
only
upgrade
in
my
life
since
our
ill
fat
trip
to
blockbuster
hq
in
dallas
the
plane
be
a
step
up
too
we
weren
t

anymore
instead
reed
have
charter
a
gulfstream
g
where
the
learjet
be
small
and
delicate
like
a
toy
plane
the
gulfstream
be
heavy
powerful
and
menace
the
stair
lead
up
into
it
be
solid
and
substantial
unlike
the
lear
s
flimsy
dangle
step
upholstered
and
plush
with
huge
leather
club
chair
the
interior

ceiling
be
full
height
the

barely
seem
to
curve
without
the
circular
window
it
would
be
easy
to
forget
that
this
lounge
would
soon
be
head
east
at
almost
mile
per
hour
logan
could
barely
believe
his
eye
push
past
me
as
he
come
through
the
doorway

excitedly
yell

then
jumped
again
to
a
new
position
a
few
cushion
down
after
a
few
moment
he
chose

settle
in
turn
to
look
out

could
just

through
all
the
reason
netflix

a
compelling
investment
it
take
them
a
while
to
hone
their
pitch
to
figure
what
work
what
be
confuse
what
they
should
leave
out
at
one
point
mid
tour
after
a
tough
night
with
a
cry
child
i
have
come
to
the
office
at
five
in
the
morning
to
find
joel
and
suresh
already
at
their
desk
you
re
here
early
i
d
say
feel
as
groggy
and
disorient
as
joel
and
suresh
look
we
ve
be
here
all
night
actually
joel
reply
explain
that
reed
and
barry
have
be
get
a
lot
of
pushback
about
churn
the
rate
at
which
subscriber
cancel
their
subscription
we
ve
be
look
at
how
different
segment
be
behaving
but
every
time
we
send
reed
the
data
he
s
look
for
he
come
back
with
another
question
doesn
t
that
man
ever
sleep
suresh
ask
rub
his
eye
the
answer
to
that
question
be
barely
but
even
reed
get
tire
by
the
time
he
and
barry
get
to
new
york
the
two
of
them
be
basically
sleepwalk
through
the
presentation
luckily
they
d
hone
it
to
a
fine
focus
point
by
the
end
of
the
tour
barry
told
me
later
they
be
finish
each
other
s
sentence
anticipate
investor
question
before
the
word
be
even
out
of
their
mouth
once
barry
and
reed
finish
the
tour
the
baton
be
pass
to
merrill
and
its
fleet
of
salesperson
who
follow
in
their
footstep
gathering
in
whatever
demand
barry
and
reed
have
create
and
then
funnel
it
to
the
main
desk
in
new
york
where
it
be
tabulate
in
a
detailed
electronic
register
still
call
by
tradition
the
book
the
book
wasn
t
write
in
indelible
ink
of
course
all
of
the
preliminary
order
excuse
me
expression
of
interest
have
be
make
with
only
a
rough
idea
of
price
some
customer
want
netflix
regardless
of
what
it
be
go
to
cost
while
others
have
a
clearer
view
of
what
price
it
would
eventually
trade
at
and
could
then
set
strict
upper
limit
below
that
price
they
be
in
above
it
and
they
be
out
the
bank
s
challenge
the
morning
of
our
ipo
would
be
to
figure
out
the
ideal
number
to
use
as
the
opening
price
for
individual
share
set
the
price
too
high
and
interested
purchaser
would
drop
out
and
we
would
miss
our
million
target
set
it
too
low
and
netflix
would
leave
million
on
the
table
another
complicate
factor
give
the
choice
the
bank
didn
t
really
mind
a
price
that
be
too
low
part
of
the
reason
they
d
fought
so
hard
for
a
deal
with
us
above
and
beyond
the
big
commission
be
the
opportunity
to
give
their
best
customer
an
opportunity
to
buy
low
at
the
opening
and
sell
high
at
the
closing
bank
call
that
an
opening
day
bounce
a
bounce
be
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the
quick
jump
in
price
can
show
the
public
that
a
company
be
hot
and
have
momentum
but
if
somebody
be
go
to
make
a
ton
of
money
on
day
one
we
want
it
to
be
us
not
merrill
lynch
s
customer
we
want
a
healthy
bounce
but
we
didn
t
want
to
feel
like
we
be
be
launch
off
the
trampoline

cream
into

then

up
more
of
the
brownie
at
the
bottom
of
his
sundae
pretty
cool
right
i
couldn
t

at
his
enthusiasm

a
call

to
you
logan
grabbed
the
phone
and
fill
lorraine
in
about
the

barely
take
a
breath
until
he
recount
the
menu
for

when
i
finally
manage
to
get
the
phone
back
a
little
wound
up
but
very
happy
you
should
have

him
when
we
get
to
cruise
altitude
he
be
do
somersault
down
the
aisle
no
joke
a
forward
roll
between
the
seat
well
i
m
glad
he
s
happy
lorraine
answer
and
imitate
barry
lower
her
voice
to
a
stage
whisper
tell
him
not
to
get
use
to
it
i
look
over
to
where
logan
be
scrap
at
his
dish
try
to
coax
the
last
bit
of
chocolate
sauce
into
his
spoon
i
wasn
t
any
less
excite
than
he
be
i
be
just
well
at
hiding
it
truth
be
told
i
think
that
be
true
for
all
of
us
if
we
be
honest
we
would
have
all
be
do
somersault
right
along
with
him
it
be
well
after
dark
when
the
town
car
crunched
to
a
stop
under
the
portico
of
my
parent
house
in
chappaqua
logan
be
fast
asleep
slump
against
my
shoulder
i
be
home
again
welcome
back
mr
new
medium
executive
my
mom
say
hold
open
the
door
for
me
as
i
carry
logan
up
the
front
step
and
into
the
kitchen
he
blink
sleepily
in
the
sudden
light
when
i
set
him
down
you
can
sleep
in
the
den
my
mother
say
to
him
he
nod
and
shuffle
up
the
stair
i
slept
that
night
in
my
childhood
bedroom
surround
by
my
book
my
beer
bottle
collection
and
my
little
league
trophy
in
some
way
it
felt
like
i
d
never
left
i
be
forty
four
year
old
i
be
married
and
have
three
kid
of
my
own
i
own
a
big
house
and
an
audi
allroad
but
inside
i
still
felt
like
i
be
in
high
school
excite
about
the
next
day
s
soccer
match
against
fox
lane
how
would
i
feel
the
next
day
after
it
be
over
would
i
feel
like
more
of
an
adult
and
what
about
the
money
would
that
change
me
lorraine
and
i
would
certainly
worry
less
i
knew
that
but
i
didn
t
think
we
would
be
any
happier
if
grow
up
in
chappaqua
have
taught
me
anything
it
be
that
happiness
exist
on
a
totally
different
axis
than
money
i
grow
up
around
fabulously
wealthy
fantastically
miserable
people
you
could
spot
them
a
mile
away
impeccable
loafer
beautiful
bespoke
suit
and
an
empty
half
smile
on
their
face
i
toss
and
turn
most
of
that
night
my
mind
endlessly
anticipate
everything
that
could
possibly
go
wrong
what
if
i
woke
up
and
the
market
have
collapse
overnight
what
if
there
be
another
terrorist
attack
what
if
reed
be
hit
by
a
bus
what
if
after
all
this
work
i
have
to
go
back
to
square
one
the
only
thing
that
calm
me

the
first
time
in
my
adult

i
never
would
have
to

the
cab
stop
for
a
red
light
and
i
found
myself
gaze
out
the
window
at
the
people
in
the
crosswalk
in
front
of
us
a
man
in
a
suit
frown
over
a
donut
a
woman
in
a
nurse

uniform
tire
after
a
twelve
hour
shift
a
construction
worker

yellow
hard
hat
in

same
as
them
but
now
suddenly
thing

different
i
didn
t
know
how
i
felt
about
the
shift
it
wasn
t
a
question
of
money
it
be
a
question
of
usefulness
of
the
pleasure
of
utility
work
for
me
be
never
about
get
rich
it
be
about
the
thrill
of

pleasure
of
solve
problem
at
netflix
those
problem
have
be
incredibly
complex
and
the
joy
come
from
sit
around
a
table
with
brilliant
people
and
try
like
hell
to
solve
them
i
didn
t
love
netflix
because
i
thought
it
would
make
me
rich
i
love
netflix
for
the
nerf
gun

limerick
coin
in

fountain
epic
argumentative
battle

it
for

passenger
seat
of
a
car
for
meeting
in
a
diner

a
hotel
conference
room
or
a
swim
pool

love
building
the
company
watch
it
stumble
then
rebuild
it
again
i
love
the
arrival
and
the
departure
the
triumph
and
the
loss
the
raucous
laughter
at
the
offsite
and
the
stun
silence
on
vanna
white
s
jet
i
love
it
for
christina
mitch
te
jim
eric
suresh
and
all
the
hundred
of
other
people
who
have
sacrifice
their
night
and
weekend
work
holiday
cancel
plan
and
move
appointment
all
to
help
reed
and
i
make
a
dream
come
true
it
wasn
t
about
the
money
it
be
about
what
we
do
before
we
ever
knew
we
d
get
it
so
what
happen
now
i
wouldn
t
be
get
the
money
right
away
in
the
interest
of
prevent
a
flood
of
sell
the
bank
have
require
that
all
of
us
agree
to
hold
our
share
for
six
month
so
in
a
way
nothing
be
really
change
in
a
few
hour
i
d
get
on
a
plane
and
fly
back
to
california
and
i
d
probably
head
straight
back
to
the
office
to
deal
with
email
for
a
few
hour
before
head
home
after
all
we
still
have
a
lot
to
do
blockbuster
be
gun
for
us
we
be
hearing
disturb
whisper
about
walmart
enter
online
rental
we
still
have
ton
of
thing
we
want
to
test
and
i
be
eager
to
get
back
to
my
research
on
stream
but
a
part
of
me
knew
that
one
phase
of
the
journey
have
just
end
the
dream
be
a
reality
we
d
do
it
we
d
turn
an
envelope
and
a
patsy
cline
cd
into
a
publicly
trade
company
it
be
the
sort
of
success
we
d
all
hop
for
the
thing
that
we
have
promise
the
people
who
have
invest
their
money
in
us
and
have
held
out
as
a
reward
for
those
who
have
invest
their
time
the
sort
of
success
that
for
most
people
would
call
for
caviar
champagne
and
steak
the
size
of
dinner
plate
a
long
dinner
at
le
bernardin
follow
by
a
nightcap
or
three

a
moment
before

scene

open
the

we
make
it
epilogue
randolph
s
rule
for
success
when
i
be
twenty
one
year
old
fresh
out
of
college
and
about
to
start
my
first
job
my
father
give
me
a
handwritten
list
of
instruction
the
whole
thing
take
up
less
than
half
a
page
in
my
father
s
neat
engineer
s
handwrite
it
read
randolph
s
rule
for
success
do
at
least
more
than
you
be
ask
never
ever
to
anybody
present
as
fact
opinion
on
thing
you
don
t
know
take
great
care
and
discipline
be
courteous
and
considerate
always
up
and
down
don
t
knock
don
t
complain
stick
to
constructive
serious
criticism
don
t
be
afraid
to
make
decision
when
you
have
the
fact
on
which
to
make
them
quantify
where
possible
be
open
mind
but
skeptical
be
prompt
that
original
list
survives
frame
and
behind
glass
hang
next
to
the
mirror
in
my
bathroom
i
reread
it
every
morning
when
i
brush
my
teeth
i
ve
give
a
copy
to
each
of
my
kid
and
i
ve
try
for
my
entire
life
to
live
up
to
all
eight
rule
randolph
s
rule
for
success
be
wide
range
broad
mind
and
idiosyncratically
punctuate
my
kid
and
i
laugh
about
the
miss
comma
in
all
the
time
they
somehow
manage
to
be
both
extremely
general
be
open
mind
but
skeptical
and
charmingly
precise
i
love
how
the
succinct
be
prompt
end
the
list
it
seem
like
the
most
minor
rule
but
its
placement
implies
the
opposite
the
conduct
they
prescribe
be
one
of
openhearted
hardworking
rationalism
an
ideal
my
father
a
curious
decent
and
devote
man
exemplify
in
his
own
life
randolph
s
rule
help
me
at
school
they
help
me
in
the
outdoors
and
they
help
me
immeasurably
in
my
career
in
them
i
see
the
basis
for
my
practice
of
constant
test
my
ethos
of
curiosity
and
creativity
and
my
willingness
to
take
risk
in
service
of
a
goal
i
see
the
seed
for
netflix
s
culture
of
radical
honesty
in
s
admonition
to
stick
to
constructive
serious
criticism
and
of
course
there
s
a
direct
path
from
rule
do
at
least
more
than
you
be
ask
to
all
the
espresso
and
pizza
fuel
late
night
in
the
netflix
office
my
father
very
rarely
get
to
see
the
professional
side
of
his
son
since
my
parent
live
on
the
east
coast
they
hadn
t
really
gotten
to
encounter
me
in
my
professional
element
sure
i
d
hit
my
mom
up
for
money
in
the
seed
round
for
netflix
and
i
told
them
all
about
my
work
at
borland
at
integrity
at
netflix
by
when
i
come
to
new
york
to
give
a
speech
to
a
bunch
of
dvd
executive
and
invite
them
they
knew
that
netflix
be
successful
and
grow
but
they
d
never
quite
see
it
in
person
at
least
not
until
that
night
i
remember
be
nervous
also
proud
immensely
proud
to
look
out
at
a
full
auditorium
and
see
my
parent
in
the
back
row
afterward
my
dad
and
i
sat
in
the
empty
auditorium
the
stage
be
bare
in
front
of
us
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
congratulate
me
say
he
be
proud
then
he
told
me
that
his
doctor
have
picked
up
something
strange
in
a
cranial
x
ray
and
that
he
be
go
in
for
a
brain
biopsy
at
mount
sinai
the
next
day
my
breath
caught
in
my
throat
my
mother
have
already
told
me
that
he
d
be
act
a
little
funny
lately
hence
the
visit
to
the
doctor
in
the
first
place
but
this
didn
t
sound
good
i
cover
my
anxiety
the
way
i
usually
do
with
a
joke
you
need
that
like
you
need
a
hole
in
the
head
i
told
him
he
laugh
we
have
the
same
sense
of
humor
my
father
die
of
brain
cancer
in
march
of
it
be
an
intensely
painful
time
for
me
and
it
happen
largely
in
the
background
of
the
story
i
ve
be
tell
throughout
and
early
as
we
be
test
various
aspect
of
what
would
become
marquee
and
put
the
finish
touch
on
cinematch
i
be
fly
back
to
new
york
at
least
once
a
month
as
my
dad
underwent
treatment
it
be
the
most
time
we
d
spent
together
in
year
my
dad
face
his
diagnosis
with
the
same
attitude
he
face
most
thing
in
life
he
be
open
mind
but
skeptical
when
give
positive
feedback
about
his
progress
he
didn
t
complain
he
be
courteous
and
considerate
to
everyone
he
dealt
with
in
the
health
care
system
doctor
and
surgeon
nurse
orderly
and
assistant
and
he
be
prompt
to
appointment
and
meeting
when
he
die
i
take
about
a
week
off
to
grieve
with
my
mother
in
new
york
then
i
flew
back
to
california
but
something
be
different
from
then
on
my
father
s
death
put
thing
in
perspective
for
me
it
lead
me
to
evaluate
what
truly
matter
in
my
life
what
fulfil
me
as
a
father
a
husband
an
entrepreneur
as
a
person
i
start
to
realize
that
the
pride
i
felt
that
night
in
the
auditorium
in
low
manhattan
wasn
t
about
the
fact
that
the
room
be
full
or
that
my
parent
could
see
how
successful
i
d
become
well
it
be
partly
about
that
but
more
importantly
the
pride
i
felt
come
from
the
message
i
be
give
that
night
how
the
medium
landscape
be
change
and
what
you
can
learn
from
the
company
that
be
change
it
my
father
die
just
day
before
the
collapse
of
the
internet
bubble
as
a
value
investor
he
d
never
understood
the
hype
never
understood
the
frenzy
he
would
have
be
unspeakably
delighted
to
have
see
that
he
be
right
all
along
i
wish
he
could
have
see
it
and
i
wish
he
could
have
see
us
survive
it
he
never
get
to
see
us
take
the
company
public
he
never
heard
my
story
about
take
a
private
plane
to
new
york
with
my
son
in
tow
he
never
get
to
hear
me
talk
about
the
financial
windfall
of
the
ipo
and
all
that
it
entail
for
my
family
but
you
know
what
it
didn
t
matter
because
he
get
to
see
me
onstage
talk
about
the
thing
i
love
solve
problem
team
building
building
a
culture
that
work
how
to
refine
your
startup
mentality
he
saw
me
do
what
i
love
that
s
what
really
matter
as
you
get
old
if
you
re
at
all
self
aware
you
learn
two
important
thing
about
yourself
what
you
like
and
what
you
re
good
at
anyone
who
get
to
spend
his
day
do
both
of
those
thing
be
a
lucky
man
by
the
begin
of
my
seventh
year
at
netflix
the
company
have
change
dramatically
my
role
have
change
as
well
i
still
ran
the
website
continually
tweak
how
we
sign
customer
up
what
we
charge
them
how
they
chose
their
movie
and
in
what
order
we
ship
to
them
but
i
have
gradually
transition
many
of
the
other
aspect
of
the
company
to
more
capable
executive
we
have
long
since
pass
the
one
million
subscriber
mark
we
have
move
headquarters
twice
as
a
swell
workforce
successively
burst
our
figurative
seam
we
have
finally
figure
out
a
way
to
get
next
day
delivery
to
the
majority
of
the
country
and
the
positive
word
of
mouth
that
this
generate
accelerate
our
growth
we
d
go
public
with
the
money
that
provide
and
our
grow
reputation
we
be
able
to
attract
amaze
people
to
come
work
for
us
people
who
be
star
in
their
field
people
who
have
run
their
own
company
or
have
do
the
logistics
for
multinational
corporation
or
have
built
the
infrastructure
of
the
internet
we
be
now
deep
in
the
throe
of
our
battle
with
blockbuster
for
rental
supremacy
by
then
reed
have
start
trot
out
the
familiar
origin
story
for
the
company
remember
it
it
go
something
like
this
reed
come
up
with
the
idea
for
netflix
when
he
found
an
old
rental
copy
of
apollo
in
his
house
go
to
return
it
to
blockbuster
and
saw
a
late
fee
then
he
thought
what
if
i
never
have
to
do
this
again
if
this
book
have
taught
you
anything
i
hope
it
s
show
you
that
the
story
behind
netflix
be
a
little
more
complicate
than
that
and
i
also
hope
it
s
show
you
how
useful
narrative
can
be
when
you
re
try
to
take
down
a
juggernaut
the
story
of
your
company
s
found

t
be
a

oft
repeat
origin

branding
at
its
fine
and
i
don
t
begrudge
him
for
it
at
all
be
it
a
lie
no
it
s
a
story
and
it
s
a
fantastic
one
the
truth
be
the
patrimony
of
any
innovation
be
complicate
there
be
always
multiple
people
involve
they
struggle
they

they

they

might
even
take
year
this
group
of
people
come
up
with
something
new
and
different
and
great
and
as
you
ve
see
in
our
case
the
result
be
netflix
but
that
story
be
messy
and
when
you
re
talk
to
the
press
to
an
investor
or
to
a
business
partner
people
really
don
t
want
to
hear
it
they
want
a
version
that
s
neat
and
clean
with
a
bow
on
it
reed
recognize
that
almost
immediately
and
so
reed
come
up
with
a
story
it
s
a
great
one
simple
clear
and
memorable
that
story
capture
the
essence
of
what
netflix
be
about
and
it
solve
a
big
problem
for
us
that
story
give
us
a
narrative
by
netflix
have
be
around
long
enough
to
write
its
own
story
david
versus
goliath
and
it
be
look
like
david
might
have
a
shot
netflix
have
grown
up
but
so
i
realize
have
i
i
still
love
the
company
i
love
it
with
the
passion
only
a
parent
would
know
i
right
wrong
dispatch
enemy
and
be
always
push
the
company
even
harder
to
succeed
but
as
quarterly
number
mechanically
come
and
go
each
successive
year
i
slowly
realize
that
although
i
love
the
company
i
no
longer
love
work
there
it
turn
out
that
i
do
know
what
i
like
and
what
i
m
good
at
and
it
wasn
t
a
company
as
big
as
netflix
it
be
small
company
struggle
to
find
their
way
it
be
newly
hatch
dream
for
which
no
one
have
yet
discover
a
repeatable
scalable
business
model
it
be
wad
into
company
rife
with
crisis
to
solve
really
complex
problem
with
really
smart
people
and
i
ll
blow
my
own
horn
here
for
a
minute
i
m
pretty
damn
good
at
it
every
startup
have
hundred
of
thing
go
wrong
at
the
same
time
all
clamor
for
attention
i
have
a
sense
of
which
two
or
three
issue
be
the
critical
one
even
if
they
be
not
the
one
scream
the
loud
but
they
be
the
issue
that
if
you
fix
them
then
all
the
rest
will
take
care
of
itself
i
have
an
almost
obsessive
ability
to
focus
on
those
singular
thing
single
mindedly
attack
them
at
the
expense
of
everything
else
until
i
have
wrestle
them
to
the
ground
i
have
the
ability
to
inspire
people
to
quit
their
job
take
a
pay
cut
and
help
wage
an
improbable
battle
against
an
apparently
implacable
foe
these
be
critical
skill
for
run
a
startup
they
re
less
applicable
to
run
a
company
with
hundred
of
employee
and
million
of
subscriber
the
time
have
come
i
think
i
knew
that
for
a
while
after
the
ipo
but
it
didn
t
become
real
until
the
spring
of
when
i
ask
to
work
on
develop
a
netflix
kiosk
with
mitch
lowe
we
have
often
try
to
figure
out
how
to
compete
with
blockbuster
s
ability
to
provide
immediate
service
to
its
user
although
netflix
customer
have
a
ready
supply
of
movie
on
top
of
their
tv
that
be
as
close
to
instant
gratification
as
we
get
if
a
customer
later
decide
they
want
something
different
they
be
out
of
luck
but
blockbuster
customer
could
just
drive
to
one
of
their
thousand
of
store
instead
of
wait
for
the
mail
it
be
our
achilles
heel
we
be
deathly
afraid
that
blockbuster
would
roll
out
a
blend
model
combine
online
with
retail
we
knew
that
would
be
compelling
for
customer
mitch
lowe
have
be
a
relentless
advocate
for
a
kiosk
solution
in
which
netflix
subscriber
could
use
small
outpost
of
the
service
to
rent
and
return
dvd
well
before
join
netflix
he
d
dream
of
develop
the
technology
as
a
facet
of
video
droid
and
now
it
be
look
like
reed
be
amenable
to
test
the
idea
out
mitch
and
i
found
a
great
site
for
the
test
in
la
vega
i
told
reed
and
i
m
think
i
should
be
there
with
him
i
need
to
focus
on
this
maybe
even
exclusively
that
s
fine
reed
say
we
can
move
all
of
your
front
end
stuff
over
to
neil
combine
the
project
manager
and
the
front
end
engineer
under
a
single
person
will
probably
work
well
for
everyone
but
if
this
doesn
t
work
i
say
watch
reed
s
face
as
we
both
come
to
the
same
realization
i
m
not
sure
it
s
fair
to
neil
for
me
to
yank
it
all
back
six
month
from
now
reed
swallow
and
cocked
his
head
well
he
say
i
guess
we
ll
have
to
talk
about
severance
just
in
case
there
be
an
awkward
pause
and
then
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
laugh
reed
smile
warily
i
mean
we
ve
talk
about
this
i
say
we
both
knew
it
be
come
sooner
or
later
and
it
be
true
reed
and
i
have
spoken
often
about
how
i
be
feel
he
s
too
smart
not
to
have
notice
that
my
skill
weren
t
the
one
that
netflix
would
be
need
in
the
year
ahead
and
too
honest
to
hide
that
from
me
for
very
long
now
though
he
look
relieve
under
this
arrangement
he
wouldn
t
have
to
have
an
uncomfortable
conversation
with
me
he
wouldn
t
have
to
draft
up
another
powerpoint
craft
another
shit
sandwich
because
the
decision
wasn
t
his
i
be
work
one
last
project
then
if
it
didn
t
work
i
be
leave
on
my
own
term
six
month
later
i
be
back
in
los
gatos
wear
the
new
medium
outfit
one
last
time
or
at
least
a
version
of
it
i
d
kept
the
iridescent
blazer
but
i
d
swap
out
the
khaki
for
jean
and
the
moir
shirt
be
go
replace
by
a
t
shirt
if
i
be
go
out
i
be
go
out
comfortable
netflix
have
rent
out
the
historic
los
gatos
theatre
for
my
go
away
party
the
little
company
that
go
month
without
an
office
ran
up
epic
tab
at
hobee
s
and
conduct
our
first
meeting
in
a
seedy
motel
conference
room
be
now
too
big
to
assemble
in
any
one
place
in
the
office
and
to
send
off
its
original
founder
another
mass
gathering
at
the
picnic
table
wouldn
t
do
instead
i
be
get
the
red
carpet
treatment
or
at
least
the
red
velvet
seat
treatment
the
los
gatos
theatre
be
the
kind
of
place
with
velvet
curtain
on
the
wall
and
real
velvet
on
the
seat
like
the
netflix
office
it
have
a
popcorn
machine
in
the
front
but
this
one
be
the
real
deal
make
in
the
day
when
popcorn
be
the
only
thing
you
could
buy
at
the
concession
stand
in
other
word
it
actually
work
as
i
walk
up
to
the
front
of
the
theater
with
lorraine
and
the
kid
i
couldn
t
help
but
be
struck
by
the
sheer
size
of
the
company
now
people
be
spill
out
of
the
lobby
and
onto
the
street
i
recognize
most
but
not
all
of
them
wow
lorraine
say
i
knew
it
be
big
but
part
of
me
still
imago
you
go
to
work
every
day
with
ten
other
people
sit
on
our
old
din
room
chair
i
laugh
but
she
be
right
thing
have
really
change
the
original
team
of
eight
now
numbered
in
the
hundred
our
ipo
have
instantly
net
the
company
nearly
million
go
be
the
day
of
call
up
steve
kahn
or
my
mother
for
that
initial
investment
from
my
mother
have
go
up
nearly
a
hundredfold
she
bought
an
apartment
on
the
upper
east
side
with
it
but
go
also
be
the
scrappy
underdog
day
i
miss
them
i
miss
the
late
night
and
early
morning
the
lawn
chair
and
card
table
i
miss
the
feel
of
all
hand
on
deck
and
the
expectation
that
every
day
you
d
be
work
on
a
problem
that
wasn
t
strictly
tie
to
your
job
description
i
d
felt
that
again
in
a
way
with
mitch
during
our
stay
in
la
vega
we
d
have
a
blast
for
three
month
we
d
live
together
in
a
condo
in
summerlin
a
community
west
of
vega
near
red
rock
canyon
we
d
set
up
a
prototype
kiosk
in
a
smith
s
supermarket
a
few
block
from
the
condo
offering
instantaneous
rental
for
netflix
subscriber
in
true
netflix
fashion
we
hadn
t
actually
built
an
electronic
interface
for
customer
to
use
instead
we
d
just
employ
our
usual
validation
hack
we
built
a
miniature
store
inside
the
supermarket
where
netflix
subscriber
could
pick
from
a
selection
of
dvd
and
return
movie
from
their
queue
mitch
have
use
a
shaper
in
santa
cruz
to
build
a
netflix
express
sign
make
from
a
surfboard
and
we
d
hung
it
from
the
ceiling
of
our
little
store
we
weren
t
test
whether
or
not
a
computer
kiosk
could
work
we
be
test
how
customer
would
use
one
would
they
pick
movie
up
bring
movie
back
just
add
to
their
queue
we
d
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
the
supermarket
that
summer
usually
at
night
in
the
summer
that
s
when
people
in
vega
go
grocery
shopping
it
s
too
hot
during
the
day
and
people
work
weird
hour
at
the
casino
at
one
in
the
morning
we
d
watch
the
cocktail
waitress
dealer
and
stripper
try
to
use
our
pseudo
kiosk
we
d
wander
the
aisle
with
clipboard
ask
question
about
how
they
felt
about
be
able
to
return
and
rent
movie
at
the
grocery
store
if
they
weren
t
netflix
customer
we
try
to
convince
them
to
sign
up
and
if
they
didn
t
want
to
we
listen
to
their
reason
why
we
learn
a
lot
most
importantly
though
we
learn
that
the
kiosk
idea
be
a
winner
people
love
it
i
be
sad
when
the
three
month
in
nevada
be
over
i
d
grown
accustom
to
go
mountain
biking
in
the
predawn
hour
take
early
even
hike
with
mitch
or
just
sit
around
the
desert
condo
pool
in
the
afternoon
talk
about
business
and
life
mitch
be
excite
to
show
our
finding
to
reed
he
thought
that
the
test
have
proven
that
kiosk
could
be
an
intermediary
solution
to
our
immediacy
problem
when
one
day
shipping
wasn
t
fast
enough
maybe
a
kiosk
could
bridge
the
gap
but
upon
our
return
to
california
reed
hadn
t
agree
it
s
expensive
he
d
say
once
you
go
kiosk
you
re
in
the
hardware
business
and
you
ll
have
to
hire
and
manage
a
whole
fleet
of
people
all
over
the
country
to
stock
the
kiosk
it
s
a
good
idea
but
our
focus
be
well
spent
on
our
core
business
the
canada
principle
i
say
reed
nod
it
s
a
great
principle
but
it
left
me
out
of
a
job
kiosk
be
a
no
go
that
meant
that
i
be
draw
up
my
severance
package
mitch
for
his
part
use
the
test
from
our
three
month

invite
several
of
my
colleague
to
the
stage
what
follow
be
part
of
a
grand
netflix
tradition
you
know
how
some
people
say
they
want
their
funeral
to
be
celebration
how
instead
of
a
wake
they
want
a
parade
well
that
s
how
thing
be
at
netflix
when
someone
left
the
company
the
party
wasn
t
a
sad
occasion
no
dirge
be
played
instead
it
be
more
like
a
roast
there
would
be
a
succession
of
speech
but
the
state
of
the
art
be
to
deliver
your
farewell
as
a
limerick
that
even
the
limerick
be
long
inexpertly
rhyme
and
raunchy
i
have
to
cover
logan
s
ear
a
couple
of
time
but
i
be
cry
laugh
eventually
it
be
my
turn
my
speech
that
day
be
off
the
cuff
so
i
can
t
reproduce
it
here
but
it
be
about
how
much
the
company
and
the
team
have
meant
to
me
how
fortunate
i
felt
to
be
a
part
of
something
that
be
truly
change
the
world
i
thanked
my
colleague
thanked
reed
thanked
everyone
in
that
room
who
d
make
netflix
what
it
be
and
then
i
end
with
a
poem
of
my
own
it
be
the
only
part
of
my
speech
that
i
typed
out
unfold
the
paper
and
clearing
my
throat
i
begin
i
m
a
little
surprised
if
i
may
by
the
tone
of
the
rhyme
here
today
i
expect
some
toast
and
instead
i
get
roast
well
two
can
play
that
game
i
say
i
go
on
roast
many
of
my
colleague
most
of
whom
have
already
read
poem
about
me
then
i
get
to
reed
and
reed
well
the
guy
can
t
be
beat
whether
pitch
to
us
or
the
street
but
that
late
return
movie
apollo
fooey
it
be
actually
teen
vixen
in
heat
roar
from
the
crowd
i
look
at
reed
who
be
laugh
and
shake
his
head
i
be
wind
up
just
one
more
stanza
to
go
i
found
patty
mccord
in
the
audience
and
wink
at
her
then
i
take
a
moment
survey
my
audience
of
friend
and
colleague
for
the
last
time
and
smile
i
read
the
last
word
on
the
page
lastly
patty
who
s
mad
nough
to
spit
because
of

an
engineering
manager
and
he
still
have
that
silver
dollar
from
predict
the
hundredth
order
and
kho
braun
i
have
no
idea
where
kho
braun
be
netflix
have
go
on
to
do
many
thing
in
the
year
since
i
left
as
i
write
this
the
company
have
just
pass
million
subscriber
with
customer
in
nearly
every
country
in
the
world
netflix
make
its
own
tv
show
produce
its
own
movie
and
have
change
the
way
people
consume
entertainment
it
introduce
the
concept
of
binge
watch
and
be
a
popular
euphemism
for
get
laid
i
know
that
the
stock
market
be
never
an
indicator
of
real
value
but
i
can
t
help
but
note
that
as
of
this
write
the
little
dvd
by
mail
company
that
blockbuster
could
have
purchase
for
million
be
now
worth
billion
and
guess
where
blockbuster
be
they
re
down
to
one
last
store
it
s
in
bend
oregon
i
keep
think
i
ll
make
a
trip
to
pay
my
respect
but
i
haven
t
found
the
time
i
can
t
take
credit
for
all
of
netflix
s
success
in
the
year
after
i
left
but
even
though
many
of
the
company
s
initiative
take
place
after
my
watch
i
think
it
s
clear
that
a
lot
of
them
have
my
fingerprint
on
them
so
many
aspect
of
the
corporate
culture
spring
from
the
way
reed
and
i
treat
each
other
and
the
way
we
treat
everyone
else
radical
honesty
freedom
and
responsibility
those
be
there
from
the
begin
in
the
car
on
in
the
hobee
s
din
room
in
the
first
day
in
the
bank
vault
so
be
netflix
s
emphasis
on
analytics
it
s
what
happens
when
you
put
a
guy
with
direct
marketing
experience
into
a
car
and
then
a
conference
room
and
then
a
boardroom
with
another
guy
with
a
brilliant
math
mind
reed
brought
the
drive
for
scale
i
make
sure
that
we
never
stop
focus
on
the
individual
customer
and
both
of
us
come
to
realize
that
how
we
treat
individual
customer
be
as
important
at
million
subscriber
as
it
be
at
netflix
have
thousand
of
employee
now
it
s
be
sixteen
year
since
i
pull
out
of
the
parking
lot
for
the
last
time
but
whenever
i
come
across
a
news
story
about
their
movie
deal
read
an
interview
with
reed
or
just
fire
up
an
episode
of
ozark
at
home
i
feel
a
thrill
of
pride
that
be
my
company
i
think
and
it
still
carry
my
dna
the
child
may
not
look
exactly
like
me
but
it
definitely
have
my
nose
and
when
i
m
not
binge
watch
netflix
or
write
this
book
you
can
t
ever
stop
be
a
startup
guy
after
leave
in
i
knew
i
didn
t
have
it
in
me
to
immediately
start
another
company
i
d
wait
until
for
that
but
i
also
knew
i
couldn
t
walk
away
entirely
instead
i
realize
that
i
could
get
my
fix
by
help
other
founder
of
young
company
make
their
dream
come
true
over
the
past
fifteen
year
i
ve
help
score
of
startup
as
a
ceo
coach
invest
in
dozen
of
others
as
an
early
stage
investor
and
mentor
hundred
of
young
entrepreneur
from
all
over
the
world
as
i
do
at
netflix
i
still
get
to
wade
into
a
crisis
and
help
solve
complex
problem
with
smart
people
only
now
i
get
to
go
home
at
five
o
clock
while
they
stay
up
all
night
actually
make
those
thing
happen
sometimes
you
have
to
step
back
from
your
dream
especially
when
you
think
you
ve
make
it
real
that
s
when
you
can
really
see
it
in
my
case
i
left
netflix
because
i
realize
that
the
finish
product
of
netflix
wasn
t
my
dream
my
dream
be
building
thing
my
dream
be
the
process
of
make
netflix
leave
allow
me
to
keep
building
thing
and
help
others
with
the
process
of
turn
their
dream
into
reality
and
move
on
to
my
next
stage
have
give
me
the
time
to
pursue
the
other
thing
in
my
life
that
be
important
even
though
i
don
t
have
a
w
job
anymore
i
ll
never
stop
be
a
type
a
person
i
still
make
obsessive
list
of
thing
to
be
do
only
now
the
only
thing
on
my
list
be
thing
that
i
put
there
i
follow
my
passion
master
the
perfect
cappuccino
grow
my
own
grape
and
make
my
own
wine
understand
the
evolution
of
roman
church
floor
tile
i
know
i
know
once
a
dork
always
a
dork
i
m
really
proud
of
what
we
accomplish
at
netflix
it
s
be
successful
beyond
my
wild
expectation
but
i
ve
come
to
realize
that
success
be
not
define
by
what
a
company
accomplishes
instead
i
have
a
different
definition
success
be
what
you
accomplish
it
s
be
in
a
position
to
do
what
you
like
do
what
you
do
well
and
pursue
the
thing
that
be
important
to
you
by
that
definition
i
ve
do
okay
but
success
could
also
be
define
a
bit
more
broadly
have
a
dream
and
through
your
time
your
talent
and
your
perseverance
see
that
dream
become
a
reality
i
guess
i
m
proud
to
fit
that
definition
as
well
but
do
you
know
what
i
m
proudest
of
i
ve
do
all
those
thing
while
stay
married
to
my
best
friend
and
have
my
kid
grow
up
know
me
and
as
best
i
can
tell
like
me
i
just
spent
two
week
at
the
beach
with
lorraine
logan
morgan
and
hunter
do
absolutely
nothing
just
enjoy
their
company
i
think
that
s
the
version
of
success
that
randolph
s
rule
point
toward
that
my
father
always
want
for
me
fulfil
your
goal
make
your
dream
a
reality
nourish
by
the
love
of
your
family
forget
money
forget
stock
option
that
s
success
okay
one
more
time
the
story
doesn
t
end
there
because
now
the
story
be
about
you
flip
your
book
over
read
the
title
again
that
will
never
work
that
be
the
first
thing
out
of
lorraine
s
mouth
the
night
i
told
her
the
idea
for
netflix
she
wasn
t
the
only
one
i
heard
that
from
dozen
of
people
dozen
of
time
and
to
be
fair
to
her
the
idea
as
originally
conceive
wouldn
t
have
work
it
take
year
of
adjustment
change
in
strategy
new
idea
and
plain
old
luck
for
us
to
land
on
a
version
of
the
idea
that
work
but
everyone
with
a
dream
have
have
that
experience
right
you
wake
up
one
morning
with
a
great
idea
that
s
go
to
change
the
world
you
can
t
wait
to
run
downstairs
and
tell
your
husband
explain
it
to
your
kid
run
it
by
your
professor
or
burst
into
your
bos
s
office
to
lay
it
all
out
for
him
what
do
they
all
say
that
will
never
work
by
now
i
hope
you
know
what
my
answer
to
that
line
be
nobody
know
anything
i
only
get
to
write
this
book
once
and
i
d
feel
like
i
miss
an
opportunity
if
i
end
this
story
without
give
you
some
advice
the
most
powerful
step
that
anyone
can
take
to
turn
their
dream
into
reality
be
a
simple
one
you
just
need
to
start
the
only
real
way
to
find
out
if
your
idea
be
a
good
one
be
to
do
it
you
ll
learn
more
in
one
hour
of
do
something
than
in
a
lifetime
of
think
about
it
so
take
that
step
build
something
make
something
test
something
sell
something
learn
for
yourself
if
your
idea
be
a
good
one
what
happens
if
your
idea
doesn
t
work
what
happens
if
your
test
fails
if
nobody
order
your
product
or
join
your
club
what
if
sale
don
t
go
up
and
customer
complaint
don
t
go
down
what
if
you
get
halfway
through
write
your
novel
and
get
writer
s
block
what
if
after
dozen
of
try
even
hundred
of
attempt
you
still
haven
t
see
your
dream
become
anything
close
to
real
you
have
to
learn
to
love
the
problem
not
the
solution
that
s
how
you
stay
engage
when
thing
take
longer
than
you
expect
and
trust
me
they
will
if
you
ve
read
this
far
you
ve
see
that
the
process
of
turn
a
dream
into
reality
have
a
dramatic
arc
it
isn
t
quick
and
it
isn
t
easy
and
there
be
obstacle
and
problem
along
the
way
one
of
the
thing
i
learn
from
william
goldman
s
adventure
in
the
screen
trade
aside
of
course
from
nobody
know
anything
be
that
every
movie
begin
with
an
incite
event
one
that
set
the
plot
in
motion
the
protagonist
of
a
film
have
to
want
something
and
for
the
film
to
be
interest
there
have
to
be
obstacle
between
the
protagonist
and
what
he
or
she
want
in
my
own
case
there
be
quite
a
few
obstacle
or
in
screenwriter
speak
complication
between
the
dream
of
netflix
and
its
reality
but
the
great
thing
about
have
a
dream
be
that
you
get
to
write
your
own
story
you
re
both
the
protagonist
and
the
writer
of
your
movie
and
your
idea
be
your
incite
event
i
trust
that
at
least
a
few
thing
i
ve
say
have
make
you
think
about
an
idea
that
you
have
something
that
you
would
like
to
accomplish
a
company
you
want
to
start
a
product
you
want
to
make
a
job
you
want
to
land
a
book
you
want
to
write
nolan
bushnell
the
co
founder
of
atari
once
say
something
that
have
always
resonate
with
me
everyone
who
have
take
a
shower
have
have
an
idea
he
say
but
it
s
the
people
who
get
out
of
the
shower
towel
off
and
do
something
about
it
that
make
the
difference
maybe
you
re
already
think
about
whether
you
could
apply
some
of
the
tip
i
ve
give
you
to
make
that
dream
come
true
maybe
you
ve
gotten
the
confidence
that
there
be
a
way
to
take
those
difficult
first
step
toward
make
your
dream
a
reality
maybe
you
re
ready
to
get
out
of
the
shower
towel
off
and
do
something
about
it
in
that
case
my
job
be
do
from
here
it
s
all
up
to
you
acknowledgement
when
i
tell
people
i
write
a
book
their
first
question
be
usually
do
you
write
it
yourself
i
guess
they
expect
that
i
use
a
ghostwriter
or
write
an
as
told
to
tale
or
conversely
that
the
word
simply
pour
out
of
me
like
water
from
a
pitcher
stimulate
by
a
dream
about
a
late
fee
on
a
movie
but
as
i
hope
you
ve
figure
out
by
now
no
venture
whether
it
be
book
or
company
be
ever
the
product
of
a
single
person
so
do
i
write
this
book
by
myself
of
course
not
like
netflix
this
book
be
the
product
of
score
of
people
each
add
a
little
bit
of
themselves
to
the
mixture
i
ll
never
be
able
to
thank
them
adequately
but
if
you
ll
bear
with
me
through
a
few
more
page
i
m
go
to
try
first
a
huge
thank
you
to

his
patient
coach
and
countless
supportive
cry
of
this

the

jordan
i
owe
you
big
time
also
to
my
friend
doug
abrams
of
idea
architect
who
on
one
of
our
hour
long
walk
in
the
wood
convince
me
that
there
might
be
a
book
inside
of
me
and
then
spent
countless
hour
help
me
bring
it
to
life
this
book
wouldn
t
exist
without
him
to
my
editor
phil
marino
at
little
brown
who
take
the
how
to
book
that
i
initially
pitch
him
and
realize
that
it
would
be
strong
and
more
powerful
as
a
memoir
he
be
right
his
ongoing
edits
and
suggestion
make
the
book
infinitely
strong
and
to
claudia
connal
my
uk
editor
at
endeavour
who
not
only
help
me
avoid
an
international
incident
by
misspell
colour
or
endeavour
but
also
provide
numerous
great
suggestion
that
make
the
book
tighter
and
clearer
in
every
country
to
janet
byrne
my
copyeditor
who
painstakingly
found
every
misplace
comma
misspell
word
and
factual
inaccuracy
you
don
t
notice
these
thing
until
someone
point
them
out
to
you
if
not
for
her
you
may
have
gotten
the
impression
from
me
that
dr
evil
s
testicle
be
freshly
shorn
not
simply
and
more
accurately
shorn
a
huge
shout
out
to
all
the

it
to
my

sally

who
by
reading
the
entire

on
a
single
transcontinental
plane
flight
first
demonstrate
that
