october
pape
side
a
hughes
you
be
at
abbott
from
to
and
your
education
be
in
physical
chemistry
rathmann
yes
hughes
so
how
do
the
jump
from
a
chemical
background
into
the
medical
field
happen
rathmann
well
first
i
be
a
premed
when
i
be
at
northwestern
and
have
intend
to
go
into
medicine
they
wouldn
t
admit
me
when
i
be
eighteen
and
that
be
enough
of
a
blow
to
me
that
i
decide
i
would
consider
a
ph
d
in
physical
chemistry
and
i
have
an
advisor
give
me
that
story
though
i
be
admit
to
medical
school
finally
at
the
end
of
my
third
year
at
northwestern
i
be
hop
to
get
in
at
the
end
of
my
second
year
and
that
be
not
successful
so
they
admit
me
at
the
end
of
my
third
year
and
i
paid
my
fifty
dollar
admission
fee
but
i
never
go
back
i
go
to
princeton
to
get
a
ph
d
but
the
medical
interest
be
there
right
from
the
begin
so
it
s
not
something
brand
new
then
w
hen
i
graduate
from
princeton
because
have
a
very
stimulate
set
of
course
in
polymer
i
go
in
the
polymer
direction
at
m
minnesota
mining
and
manufacturing
company
rather
than
the
medical
direction
i
have
a
lot
of
knowledge
and
extreme
curiosity
about
polymer
those
be
fairly
early
day
for
polymer
some
of
the
great
work
have
just
be
do
in
the
precede
eight
or
nine
year
the
theory
have
be
developed
and
then
the
ability
to
make
thing
like
fiber
and
so
on
be
now
at
hand
and
it
hadn
t
be
ten
year
before
so
there
be
excite
opportunity
in
polymer
i
have
a
bunch
of
different
choice
at
m
they
offer
me
a
job
in
the
electrical
chemical
area
and
the
chemical
area
and
the
polymer
area
and
i
just
picked
the
polymer
one
then
i
stayed
in
that
field
for
about
ten
year
hughes
as
a
young
man
with
a
fresh
degree
you
have
the
choice
of
what
field
you
would
go
into
at
m
rathmann
well
yes
it
be
a
good
year
for
hire
in
other
word
they
be
look
to
hire
people
that
year
that
be
it
hadn
t
always
be
that
way
there
would
be
up
and
down
year
as
we
would
visit
some
of
these
company
we
would
find
that
there
be
year
that
they
wouldn
t
hire
anybody
but
that
year
dupont
be
hire
a
lot
of
people
i
have
three
job
offer
at
dupont
and
i
have
three
different
one
at
m
and
i
have
a
job
offer
from
every
one
but
one
company
so
it
be
a
good
year
to
be
hire
hughes
the
offer
come
on
the
basis
of
your
dissertation
work
rathmann
no
i
be
just
a
warm
body
and
i
be
a
ph
d
graduate
from
princeton
hughes
oh
i
see
rathmann
it
wasn
t
that
bad
actually
a
ph
d
in
physical
chemistry
have
credibility
beyond
what
it
deserves
i
be
immediately
pretty
popular
on
the
circuit
i
actually
have
solicit
m
i
heard
about
it
through
my
brother
dick
who
have
a
relationship
to
m
he
say
you
really
ought
to
look
into
m
it
s
a
great
company
when
i
go
there
i
be
dazzle

hughes
rathmann
they
be
do
so
many
different
thing
very
excite
innovation
and
the
concept
of
innovation
as
a
career
seem
more
attractive
than
just
grind
out
science
i
love
science
but
the
fact
be
that
there
be
a
spectacular
aspect
to
m
they
be
do
thing
like
make
reflective
sheet
on
highway
it
be
brilliant
science
how
do
you
figure
out
how
to
do
that
then
they
have
dry
copying
in
the
form
of
thermofax
they
have
many
program
when
i
get
there
that
be
very
excite
one
that
be
intrigue
to
me
be
fluorochemicals
i
probably
never
even
thought
about
a
molecule
that
could
contain
three
quarter
of
its
weight
in
fluorine
before
i
be
expose
to
the
m
fluorochemical
program
you
be
create
a
whole
new
class
of
molecule
and
you
have
no
idea
what
they
be
go
to
do
you
already
have
some
spectacular
result
very
low
surface
tension
very
low
solubility
very
unusual
property
so
i
go
into
the
fluorochemical
part
of
polymer
when
i
get
into
m
and
i
sort
of
forgot
about
my
medical
interest
although
a
few
year
later
one
part
of
my
responsibility
include
the
biochemistry
area
of
m
which
be
just
begin
at
the
time
biochemistry
be
very
intrigue
to
me
i
have
some
responsibility
there
about
that
time
i
left
to
go
to
litton
industry
and
that
be
a
bit
of
a
disaster
after
litton
didn
t
work
out
i
be
down
there
in
the
chicago
area
and
a
couple
of
mutual
friend
say
that
they
be
really
look
for
someone
in
the
diagnostic
field
at
abbott
i
have
be
acquaint
with
abbott
for
year
i
actually
have
some
interaction
with
them
when
i
be
with
m
but
this
be
brand
new
it
be
diagnostics
and
i
just
love
diagnostics
i
just
thought
that
be
great
thing
because
if
you
know
exactly
what
s
go
wrong
you
ll
be
able
to
fix
it
a
lot
easy
ignorance
be
not
a
very
good
thing
diagnostics
be
a
big
step
forward
in
fact
i
thought
about
diagnostics
quite
a
bit
before
i
ever
get
to
abbott
and
it
seem
to
me
that
that
be
a
very
interest
place
do
you
think
your
early
interest
in
medicine
start
you
down
the
apply
track
you
could
have
become
a
theoretical
chemist
for
example
do
that
ever
attract
you
anything
new
attract
me
there
would
be
no
deny
that
that
would
be
truth
the
fact
be
that
quantum
mechanic
and
statistical
mechanic
be
very
excite
course
and
i
have
a
little
taste
of
them
at
northwestern
but
at
princeton
i
get
right
up
to
my
eyeball
in
theoretical
science
i
love
it
i
thought
that
it
be
a
very
excite
field
i
have
never
plan
to
be
a
physician
that
really
wasn
t
why
i
do
the
premed
i
have
a
brother
in
law
frank
steldt
who
do
medical
research
at
eli
lilly
company
and
that
be
one
of
the
charm
i
be
hop
to
grab
hold
of
that
i
would
be
lucky
enough
to
have
a
job
to
do
medical
research
if
the
way
to
get
there
be
to
have
an
m
d
and
then
a
ph
d
that
s
what
i
would
do
if
you
get
it
with
the
m
d
alone
i
would
do
that
but
i
knew
if
you
be
go
to
do
medical
research
you
probably
want
to
get
at
least
an
m
d
but
when
i
couldn
t
get
into
medical
school
when
i
be
eighteen
i
decide
that
there
be
alternative
my
advisor
urge
me
to
go
to
princeton
he
be
a
princetonian
and
he
say
that
s
just
the
right
place
for
you
so
i
go
to
princeton
in
physical
chemistry
and
do
not
have
a
medical
thesis
i
have
a
thesis
on
microwave
and
it
be
a
fun
thesis
hut
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
medicine
but
when
i
thought
about
it
later
on
i
really
miss
not
have
a
medical
dimension
to
what
i
be
do
when
i
get
to
m
the
man
frank
bovey
who
be
in
charge
of
the
work
there
i
report
to
him
left
to

go
to
bell
lab
to
do
more
biologically
driven
research
it
woke
me
up
again
to
a
deep
appetite
to
be
involve
with
the
medical
side
but
i
really
didn
t
do
much
i
get
involve
a
little
bit
with
the
biochemistry
department
at
m
but
i
really
didn
t
do
much
in
the
direction
of
medicine
until
i
go
to
litton
in
what
be
call
at
that
time
the
profexray
division
i
rename
it
litton
medical
system
while
i
be
the
president
of
that
division
it
be
all
medical
it
be
medical
device
and
x
ray
film
it
wasn
t
medicine
in
the
form
of
pharmaceutical
at
all
we
have
nothing
like
that
but
i
be
still
might
turn
on
by
the
fact
that
you
re
deal
w
ith
people
and
help
sick
people
get
well
that
s
the
fun
thing
then
of
course
i
have
trouble
with
litton
we
be
lose
money
and
i
couldn
t
see
my
way
through
ever
have
a
decent
job
there
so
i
left
and
go
to
abbott
mutual
friend
told
me
about
abbott
need
a
diagnostic
head
of
research
and
then
later
on
i
be
vice
president
for
research
and
development
but
initially
i
be
just
head
of
research
now
i
wasn
t
a
ceo
like
at
litton
one
might
wonder
why
you
would
want
to
give
up
a
ceo
position
to
be
a
research
head
well
i
have
ceo
up
to
the
eyeball
i
didn
t
need
anymore
of
that
particularly
at
litton
you
learn
the
hard
way
it
s
call
the
gray
davis
effect
that
when
thing
do
not
go
well
thing
don
t
go
well
you
re
it
boy
you
do
it
all
laughter
you
make
all
the
mistake
and
eveiybody
point
their
finger
and
that
w
as
what
happen
to
me
at
litton
i
be
dead
meat
when
i
be
there
for
one
month
hughes
have
you
walk
onto
a
sinking
ship
so
to
speak
and
then
gotten
blame
rathmann
yes
it
be
a
sinking
ship
and
they
didn
t
hesitate
the
first
week
i
be
there
i
hadn
t
move
yet
i
be
still
up
in
minnesota
i
get
a
telex
up
in
minnesota
stop
the
cash
drain
your
division
s
go
to
hell
well
i
look
at
the
number
and
th
cash
drain
have
be
go
on
for
year
but
it
become
my
job
to
stop
it
and
that
s
right
i
mean
if
you
say
to
the
ceo
well
this
isn
t
your
problem
this
be
somebody
else
s
problem
they
re
never
go
to
get
it
fix
so
that
be
okay
with
me
i
knew
i
have
to
fix
it
but
i
also
knew
it
be
beyond
me
to
fix
it
i
wasn
t
a
turnaround
artist
i
wasn
t
a
deal
with
disaster
artist
what
i
be
probably
well
at
than
anybody
around
be
get
new
product
launch
and
get
the
idea
and
get
the
people
stimulate
to
want
to
do
new
thing
and
to
get
them
to
do
it
and
take
risk
and
push
new
idea
there
be
no
hope
for
that
at
litton
we
be
do
a
bailing
job
from
the
time
i
get
there
hughes
and
of
course
you
didn
t
realize
that
when
you
take
the
job
rathmann
well
there
be
an
extra
nice
twist
to
this
and
that
be
their
number
do
not
show
how
bad
off
they
be
they
have
become
very
astute
at
conceal
their
problem
but
they
do
know
them
because
they
brought
them
to
my
attention
the
first
week
i
be
there
by
the
way
you
learn
from
thing
like
this
so
the
lesson
that
i
learn
be
if
i
be
go
to
take
another
job
i
want
to
talk
to
the
top
man
in
that
organization
and
i
want
to
hear
him
tell
me
how
solid
the
book
be
and
how
solid
their
planning
be
and
so
on
hughes
and
indeed
you
do
that
at
abbott

rathmann
at
abbott
the
chairman
of
the
board
become
a
very
good
friend
later
on
we
put
him
on
the
board
of
amgen
by
the
way
hughes
what
be
his
name
rathmann
ted
ledder
he
be
a
wonderful
wonderful
human
be
so
i
couldn
t
miss
with
ted
ledder
but
it
be
an
interest
thing
that
take
the
time
to
say
i
want
to
talk
to
him
about
this
company
abbott
be
tell
me
that
this
diagnostic
thing
have
great
potential
but
i
have
be
there
once
and
it
be
a
bad
bad
problem
at
litton
because
nothing
be
what
it
appear
to
be
when
i
walk
in
the
door
they
have
profit
that
didn
t
really
exist
they
be
artificial
hughes
abbott
s
diagnostic
unit
be
the
way
it
have
be
described
to
you
rathmann
oh
yes
ted
ledder
just
say
it
would
be
fun
if
you
like
what
you
see
and
i
do
it
of
course
some
of
the
best
year
be
after
i
get
there
and
thing
really
popped
for
us
in
every
way
it
be
a
very
small
activity
when
i
get
there
it
be
the
small
division
by
far
and
later
on
it
become
one
of
the
big
hughes
thanks
partly
to
you
rathmann
oh
i
would
have
to
say
so
i
think
most
of
the
credit
should
go
to
jim
vincent
who
be
run
the
division
who
have
come
in
with
a
strong
hand
and
great
leadership
but
he
wouldn
t
have
make
it
without
other
people
hughes
who
be
abbott
s
main
competitor
in
diagnostics
when
you
arrive
rathmann
well
at
that
time
there
be
one
key
competitor
who
we
thought
about
every
day
and
that
be
technicon
technicon
have
the
smac
machine
for
do
diagnostics
with
big
sophisticated
machine
abbott
s
approach
have
be
sort
of
back
door
diagnostics
they
have
developed
a
relationship
with
oak
ridge
in
radiotracers
so
their
idea
be
to
make
kit
base
on
radioactivity
and
the
radioimmune
assay
be
a
standard
vehicle
for
be
able
to
use
radio
tag
material
to
do
diagnostics
it
have
very
very
high
precision
so
they
have
gotten
it
start
that
way
but
it
be
go
nowhere
when
jim
vincent
come
in
in
fact
he
prove
that
it
be
go
nowhere
and
he
have
to
change
the
entire
structure
so
he
have
to
hire
several
people
and
one
of
them
be
me
and
the
idea
be
that
we
would
try
to
build
the
great
diagnostic
company
that
have
ever
be
that
be
his
vision
and
it
be
very
strong
he
be
very
driven
by
this
and
he
believe
in
it
but
it
be
almost
to
the
point
where
it
be
like
really
how
sensible
be
it
that
we
re
take
on
technicon
who
s
so
big
and
they
ve
get
all
this
technology
they
have
special
technology
to
make
the
big
complicate
diagnostics
machine
possible
we
weren
t
go
to
make
a
big
complicate
diagnostics
machine
well
we
be
go
to
get
into
diagnostics
everywhere
it
look
like
we
have
a
spot
hughes
the
other
company
be
focus
on
the
radioimmune
approach
rathmann
no
that
be
abbott
s
approach
when
i
walk
through
the
door
we
say
what
may
come
after
radioimmune
assay
what
be
the
next
thing
and
i
put
some
speech
and
proposal
together
everybody
have
thought
the
next
technology
would
be
enzyme
assay
where
you
use
an
enzyme
which
also
have
high
amplification
to
signal
when

you
ve
get
a
substance
or
when
you
do
not
have
it
there
and
they
already
decide
that
that
be
go
to
be
interest
syva
a
joint
venture
between
hughes
syntex
rathmann
syntex
and
varian
yes
so
syva
be
already
do
enzyme
immunoassay
and
they
have
a
very
broad
patent
so
it
wasn
t
so
easy
to
break
into
that
so
it
occur
to
me
that
what
we
really
want
to
do
be
start
use
fluorescence
because
i
have
some
experience
with
fluorescence
at
m
and
i
thought
well
let
s
see
if
we
can
t
take
advantage
of
the
sensitivity
of
fluorescence
detection
i
hire
mick
jolley
who
have
a
fluorescence
background
which
provide
momentum
for
our
fluorescence
program
i
brought
him
over
from
england
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
before
long
we
have
a
brand
new
fluorescence
assay
which
cannibalize
syva
s
business
by
the
way
hughes
oh
really
rathmann
yes
syva
s
business
be
go
twenty
thirty
forty
fifty
sixty
seventy
head
toward
a
hundred
but
they
never
hit
the
hundred
but
the
fluorescence
assay
of
abbott
hit
a
hundred
million
within
two
year
so
we
just
take
their
business
away
from
them
hughes
well
i
know
from
reading
the
chemical
heritage
interview
with
you
that
you
thought
and
presumably
still
think
quite
a
bit
about
the
innovative
atmosphere
at
m
what
be
it
like
at
abbott
could
you
compare
rathmann
well
it
be
very
interest
what
happen
after
i
come
be
we
end
up
with
a
blend
the
approach
at
abbott
be
very
rigid
there
be
actually
three
different
approach
there
be
abbott
lab
the
old
abbott
lab
and
that
have
kind
of
deteriorate
into
a
pharmaceutical
activity
that
be
pretty
dull
and
not
very
excite
and
the
people
be
pretty
low
key
that
s
one
activity
at
abbott
the
next
one
be
the
diagnostic
area
where
jim
vincent
come
in
what
he
brought
be
a
lot
of
rigor
and
almost
so
much
rigor
that
you
have
rigidity
in
other
word
before
you
could
start
a
program
you
would
go
through
a
proposal
process
that
would
take
day
and
then
you
would
have
oversight
that
be
deep
and
thoughtful
and
everything
be
always
go
to
be
do
accord
to
the
book
which
whether
you
realize
it
or
not
i
thought
lack
that
one
dimension
that
be
so
important
to
m
which
be
the
innovative
dimension
m
ask
people
to
do
whatever
they
think
be
the
right
thing
to
do
don
t
tell
them
what
they
have
to
do
let
them
try
and
do
something
new
and
different
so
we
brought
that
in
and
jim
be
very
receptive
he
could
see
that
it
broaden
our
horizon
quite
a
lot
when
i
get
there
it
be
very
simple
we
want
a
new
hepatitis
test
and
we
want
a
new
thyroid
test
and
we
want
an
instrument
to
compete
with
syva
s
that
be
it
those
be
the
only
thing
we
want
well
that
s
too
restrictive
compare
to
what
we
be
able
to
do
and
in
fact
we
do
so
what
we
do
be
we
come
up
with
fluorescence
what
do
that
have
to
do
with
exactly
the
way
we
be
suppose
to
go
phen
we
come
up
with
not
only
hepatitis
test
but
cancer
test
and
very
big
one
and
then
we
come
up
with
infectious
disease
test
and
other
test
for
other
physiological
problem
and
so
on
unedited
transcript
of
interview
with
george
rathmann
conduct
on
september
and
by
leo
slater
and
arnold
phackray
chemical
heritage
foundation
philadelphia
pennsylvania

so
we
actually
expand
our
horizon
which
sound
like
you
re
not
really
organize
and
focus
by
comparison
with
the
diagnostic
activity
v
hen
i
get
there
we
be
unfocused
we
be
willing
to
take
on
anything
but
on
the
other
hand
we
be
very
successful
and
abbott
have
the
resource
to
push
these
thing
hughes
you
and
vincent
be
at
the
top
right
rathmann
he
be
at
the
top
i
wasn
t
hughes
you
be
just
under
him
rathmann
i
be
the
person
in
charge
of
r
d
hughes
so
what
s
the
blend
of
science
and
business
here
when
you
re
look
at
new
program
and
try
to
figure
out
which
direction
to
go
rathmann
well
i
d
have
my
taste
of
business
when
i
be
ceo
of
that
one
subsidiary
litton
medical
system
so
i
wasn
t
anxious
to
have
a
major
business
responsibility
i
really
thought
the
thing
that
i
m
good
at
which
i
learn
at
m
be
product
development
i
could
get
people
fire
up
to
do
product
development
i
could
get
idea
frequently
the
idea
that
i
get
be
simply
stimulus
like
get
the
thing
start
in
the
case
of
fluorescence
i
played
a
more
active
role
but
in
every
case
wherever
there
be
a
chance
to
show
an
idea
when
i
could
volunteer
i
would
do
it
but
i
didn
t
expect
those
idea
have
anywhere
near
great
merit
the
idea
be
stimulate
by
the
idea
that
have
idea
be
a
good
thing
when
i
get
to
abbott
the
whole
tenor
of
the
place
change
from
one
that
be
grind
it
out
grind
it
out
grind
it
out
make
sure
you
ve
get
all
your
detail
right
make
sure
you
execute
it
properly
and
all
that
i
hat
the
word
execution
i
like
the
word
innovation
and
i
brought
that
from
m
the
other
thing
i
brought
be
a
multi
product
strategy
whereas
it
have
be
very
nice
before
to
be
able
to
say
we
just
want
these
three
thing
i
say
i
want
everything
i
want
to
look
at
anything
and
everything
i
look
at
the
msr
i
guess
they
be
call
the
marketing
survey
report
and
would
note
any
assay
of
any
kind
that
have
now
start
to
look
like
it
be
go
to
work
so
somebody
have
a
new
assay
for
a
virus
well
let
s
take
a
look
at
viral
assay
someone
have
a
new
assay
for
therapeutic
drug
so
let
s
consider
therapeutic
drug
hughes
do
that
mean
hire
new
people
with
those
approach
rathmann
we
hire
a
lot
of
people
while
i
be
there
hughes
because
you
wouldn
t
necessarily
have
virologist
would
you
rathmann
well
yes
we
actually
have
one
of
everything
when
i
get
there
but
if
you
hire
biochemist
you
can
get
what
you
want
immunology
be
different
from
virology
which
be
different
from
cell
biology
and
all
the
rest
ihen
you
have
a
core
in
some
of
these
area
but
i
hire
primarily
biochemist
hughes
one
thing
i
remember
reading
about
abbott
and
it
may
have
be
a
little
after
your
time
but
abbott
s
diagnostics
become
very
competitive
they
become
the
company
to

beat
would
you
not
say
in
the
diagnostic
field
one
of
the
thing
i
remember
reading
be
that
thcj
have
very
strategically
place
machine
free
machine
in
their
customer
laboratory
rathmann
one
of
vincent
s
first
strategy
be
despite
the
fact
that
we
initially
only
have
the
aba
that
if
you
could
make
a
machine
that
everybody
want
you
could
sometimes
give
it
to
people
and
then
charge
them
for
the
consumables
that
by
the
way
be
also
a
m
philosophy
you
want
to
sell
razor
blade
not
razor
in
fact
if
you
give
away
the
razor
and
you
get
a
lot
of
razor
blade
sale
that
s
all
right
you
re
go
to
be
okay
so
he
want
to
do
that
now
the
interest
thing
be
that
the
machine
the
division
be
excite
about
didn
t
work
out
very
well
the
adc
which
be
a
machint
and
the
m
which
be
a
machine
be
both
disappointment
of
course
technicon
sell
expensive
machine
so
that
be
kind
of
a
model
out
there
and
that
be
what
you
have
to
do
i
didn
t
like
machine
at
all
and
never
thought
we
would
produce
any
kind
of
machine
until
what
happen
when
one
of
the
guy
come
along
with
a
very
neat
way
to
do
enzyme
assay
and
that
be
a
very
simple
machine
we
call
it
the
quantum
we
make
it
for
just
a
couple
of
thousand
dollar
and
we
give
it
away
vincent
say
right
away
oh
this
be
perfect
for
us
so
you
couldn
t
give
away
the
and
machine
but
the
one
that
we
come
up
with
yes
you
could
give
them
away
hughes
and
that
meant
that
the
customer
be
oblige
to
use
your
product
in
that
machine
rathmann
and
then
you
have
the
wherewithal
once
you
have
a
machine
to
introduce
additional
assay
for
that
machine
and
you
automatically
could
grow
your
business
without
ever
put
any
more
machine
out
that
machine
be
now
capable
of
do
as
much
as
a
year
in
assay
so
each
machine
be
pull
through
worth
of
reagent
that
be
pretty
nice
hughes
do
you
have
any
idea
why
abbott
spawn
a
number
of
biotech
executive
you
of
course
be
one
of
them
and
you
mention
jim
vincent
we
haven
t
mention
kirk
raab
be
there
a
reason
that
they
come
from
abbott
rathmann
there
be
actually
two
company
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry
that
furnish
more
executive
than
any
other
and
they
be
abbott
and
baxter
abbott
and
baxter
be
very
similar
they
be
just
a
few
mile
apart
there
in
chicago
and
they
both
be
a
different
kind
of
pharmaceutical
company
neither
one
have
the
big
therapeutic
pharmaceutical
abbott
get
into
erythromycin
very
early
but
it
be
not
the
backbone
of
the
medical
work
but
diagnostic
be
a
totally
different
animal
a
different
kind
of
pace
a
different
kind
of
level
of
innovation
the
people
in
the
pharmaceutical
part
of
abbott
could
not
comprehend
the
average
diagnostic
mindset
they
couldn
t
believe
that
anybody
want
to
work
that
hard
that
aggressively
or
that
innovatively
i
mean
they
be
really
grind
out
so
both
baxter
and
abbott
be
a
different
breed
of
pharmaceutical
company
now
it
s
not
surprising
that
biotech
would
be
an
attractive
place
for
an
executive
from
a
pharmaceutical
company
but
what
be
surprising
be
that
they
weren
t
pharmaceutical
executive
not
i
not
kirk
raab
not
jim
vincent
and
certainly
not
the
people
from
baxter
there
be
about
half
a
dozen
out
there
although
in
the
last
five
year
major
pharmaceutical
executive
have
move
into
the
biotech
industry
i
hire
one
bill
rutter
hire
one
jim
vincent
hire
one
as
the

biotech
industry
get
big
enough
and
strong
enough
it
be
more
attractive
not
quite
so
rag
tag
as
in
the
early
day
but
the
fit
with
the
diagnostic
mentality
be
very
good
and
even
the
baxter
mentality
which
be
a
much
more
aggressive
type
of
research
and
marketing
hughes
as
i
say
at
the
outset
it
be
to
that
you
be
at
abbott
that
s
the
time
when
recombinant
dna
be
begin
to
take
off
rathmann
yes
hughes
when
do
you
first
hear
about
it
rathmann
i
know
exactly
and
i
m
not
proud
of
this
because
i
should
have
heard
about
it
by
reading
about
watson
and
crick
in
didn
t
really
think
about
it
until
the
head
of
the
pharmaceutical
division
the
vice
president
of
pharmaceutical
there
ira
ringler
who
be
a
close
friend
we
live
as
neighbor
out
in
barrington
hill
call
me
up
one
day
and
he
say
george
we
be
go
to
take
a
trip
i
say
well
why
do
you
want
to
do
that
he
say
because
there
s
stuff
go
on
that
we
need
to
know
a
lot
more
about
his
word
not
mine
i
want
to
go
out
on
the
west
coast
mostly
out
on
the
west
coast
which
wasn
t
true
exactly
because
boston
have
its
share
of
biotech
company
let
s
go
out
there
and
we
ll
see
two
or
three
company
that
i
ve
heard
about
i
just
don
t
know
what
they
re
do
and
i
m
really
intrigue
and
we
ought
to
just
do
it
it
be
kind
of
like
a
committee
of
two
for
abbott
lab
to
see
what
we
could
learn
hughes
what
year
be
this
rathmann
this
be
about
recombinant
dna
be
the
subject
of
course
and
yet
there
seem
to
be
two
part
to
this
industry
recombinant
dna
and
monoclonal
antibody
and
we
take
on
both
we
go
out
and
saw
cetus
recombinant
dna
and
hybritech
monoclonal
antibody
we
do
not
see
genentech
we
didn
t
have
access
to
them
and
we
didn
t
know
that
much
about
it
by
cetus
be
the
old
biotech
company
for
that
time
and
they
be
also
the
big
hughes
there
weren
t
very
many
in
a
handful
rathmann
just
a
handful
hughes
have
dr
ringler
be
reading
the
literature
rathmann
he
be
well
inform
from
the
literature
and
pharmaceutical
contact
well
there
s
nothing
secret
i
could
have
be
reading
the
literature
as
well
but
i
be
pretty
much
bury
in
what
i
be
do
in
diagnostics
and
i
didn
t
think
about
therapeutic
that
much
it
be
pretty
clear
that
cetus
have
some
interest
stuff
go
on
it
be
very
scary
the
formidable
part
of
have
to
work
with
certain
kind
of
containment
and
so
on
the
fear
of
recombinant
dna
be
outlandish
hughes
that
be
the
height
of
it
wasn
t
it

rathmann
i
don
t
know
v
hether
they
have
it
when
we
start
in
but
by
abbott
have
their
own
recombinant
dna
activity
i
get
involve
in
that
when
i
be
there
but
the
first
step
be
ira
and
i
go
out
and
see
these
company
and
realize
that
they
be
tape
side
b
rathmann
and
such
an
immediate
potential
impact
on
health
care
if
you
could
have
antibody
that
be
so
highly
specific
that
they
could
be
use
in
diagnostics
but
they
could
possibly
be
use
in
therapy
as
well
that
be
just
phenomenal
hughes
what
other
antibody
company
be
around
hybritech
be
genetic
system
around
yet
rathmann
i
think
genetic
system
be
around
but
i
didn
t
see
them
hughes
be
they
talk
therapeutic
as
well
as
diagnostics
rathmann
the
general
theme
for
those
that
talk
antibody
company
be
they
would
start
out
with
antibody
for
diagnostics
then
they
would
have
antibody
in
therapy
somehow
possibly
carry
a
radioactive
tag
and
get
to
a
specific
a
magic
bullet
be
what
they
be
refer
to
in
those
day
which
would
eventually
have
a
broad
therapeutic
impact
because
it
be
clear
that
though
abbott
prove
diagnostics
could
be
a
billion
dollar
business
there
weren
t
many
people
in
that
thought
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
billion
dollar
diagnostics
industry
but
there
be
plenty
of
billion
of
dollar
in
the
therapeutic
business
so
centocor
hybritech
company
like
this
all
have
their
sequence
work
out
probably
first
of
all
diagnostics
and
then
in
vivo
diagnostics
for
example
could
image
your
tumor
if
i
administer
a
radioactively
tag
antibody
that
would
seek
out
the
tumor
and
reveal
its
location
most
company
visualize
in
vivo
diagnostics
would
pave
the
way
for
therapeutic
base
on
toxincarrying
antibody
that
would
seek
tumor
and
destroy
them
magic
bullet
hughes
how
realistic
be
that
in
rathmann
oh
it
be
true
hut
it
would
take
many
year
hughes
what
i
mean
be
do
they
have
a
scientific
path
i
m
get
way
over
my
head
but
understand
that
the
therapeutic
use
of
monoclonal
have
not
be
the
easy
road
to
actually
walk
rathmann
well
okay
w
hen
you
say
realistic
in
fact
the
big
monoclonal
therapeutic
be
not
discover
in
the
seventy
be
not
discover
in
the
eighty
be
not
discover
until
very
late
in
the
ninety
don
t
know
any
good
explanation
for
that
other
than
i
ve
watch
about
a
half
dozen
cycle
like
that
where
the
technology
be
ahead
of
commercialization
by
a
lot
of
time
the
visionary
see
the
commercial
potential
very
early
sometimes
too
early
and
eventually
everything
catch
up
with
it
antisense
which
be
so
dramatic
take
the
fundamental
property
of
dna
two
bond
strand
and
you
re
go
to
use
the
second
strand
to
turn
off
a
signal
from
the
first
one
boy
that
be
popular
stuff
with
great
potential
for
five
or
six
year
before
anybody
really
have
a
product
in
fact
some
company
like
gilead
be
antisense
company
but
they
spent
a
lot
of
time
do
everything
else
because
antisense
be
so
hard

hughes
laugh
do
you
recognize
that
at
the
outset
rathmann
well
in
most
case
i
go
along
with
the
conventional
wisdom
which
be
this
be
potentially
interest
but
it
s
ahead
of
its
time
hughes
be
these
early
company
that
have
to
get
venture
capital
and
other
funding
how
much
of
this
be
a
sell
job
rather
than
actually
executable
rathmann
well
we
always
have
an
expression
at
m
that
nothing
ever
get
start
without
a
huckster
and
i
be
one
of
the
huckster
i
be
not
as
big
of
a
huckster
as
some
of
the
other
guy
but
the
huckster
be
the
guy
that
get
you
keyed
up
he
be
the
guy
that
predict
early
success
frequently
when
there
wasn
t
one
but
without
the
huckster
you
didn
t
do
anything
so
this
be
not
view
as
a
bad
thing
by
m
if
somebody
get
behind
something
and
they
really
push
it
too
hard
or
too
soon
that
s
far
well
than
be
too
late
hughes
do
you
practice
that
philosophy
at
amgen
rathmann
oh
yes
i
always
felt
that
there
be
a
certain
downside
to
be
the
huckster
and
you
re
now
aware
that
there
s
a
very
tempt
path
the
tempt
path
be
to
be
visionary
and
be
able
to
say
to
somebody
you
know
what
we
can
do
with
this
we
can
not
only
start
here
but
we
can
do
this
and
this
and
this
and
by
be
a
visionary
you
can
convince
people
that
there
s
a
future
when
they
didn
t
recognize
it
before
and
sometimes
you
can
convince
them
that
there
s
a
future
when
there
isn
t
a
future
as
you
may
sound
so
real
and
down
to
earth
then
when
it
be
least
expect
the
idea
pay
off
monoclonal
antibody
be
discover
in
and
the
big
success
in
therapeutic
which
everybody
be
predict
in
the
early
day
be
in
the
last
five
year
liposome
i
just
heard
another
discussion
on
liposome
in
the
last
week
liposome
be
a
very
common
item
to
produce
fifteen
year
ago
and
it
meant
that
you
can
put
anything
in
these
little
particle
and
that
be
go
to
be
a
way
to
deliver
drug
well
most
of
those
never
do
succeed
i
ve
heard
in
the
last
two
month
some
thing
that
might
be
possible
for
liposome
so
they
go
through
a
period
of
great
enthusiasm
a
liposome
company
be
form
and
other
liposome
company
be
form
and
they
never
go
anywhere
because
they
be
ahead
of
their
time
they
hadn
t
figure
out
exactly
how
to
do
all
of
it
hughes
it
seem
to
me
from
probably
litton
on
maybe
before
that
you
be
a
hybrid
i
mean
you
be
act
as
a
businessman
and
as
a
scientist
for
example
w
hen
you
re
predict
the
future
therapeutic
use
of
monoclonal
obviously
there
s
a
business
aspect
to
that
but
also
you
have
to
have
some
clue
about
the
science
rathmann
well
m
training
be
very
interest
because
they
try
to
do
really
good
science
some
people
say
they
never
do
as
good
science
as
at
place
like
merck
i
think
that
s
true
but
they
also
have
their
eye
on
the
importance
that
you
have
to
bring
money
into
the
company
if
you
re
go
to
continue
to
do
excite
thing
and
that
mean
sale
and
that
mean
profit
and
all
the
rest
and
the
profit
margin
that
m
aspire
to
be
very
high
they
felt
that
be
very
important
they
felt
that
if
you
want
to
have
an
efficient
company
you
have
to
be
very
sure
that
your
profitability
on
any
product
be
very
high
ii
otherwise
you
kind
of
bleed
to
death
the
product
be
out
there
but
you
can
t
bring
enough
in
to
sustain
its
growth
it
be
very
clear
at
m
that
this
then
be
design
to
be
pragmatic
and
practical
though
good
science
be
consider
pretty
important
for
really
be
able
to
get
to
the
important
stuff
but
you
really
have
to
be
aware
of
what
the
commercial
implication
be
right
off
the
bat
and
of
course
abbott
be
much
the
same
it
be
driven
by
the
idea
of
be
a
more
successful
diagnostic
company
than
anybody
have
ever
be
and
you
do
not
do
that
by
just
think
esoteric
thing
and
sit
at
a
desk
all
day
my
father
be
a
businessman
i
be
not
embarrass
about
the
business
aspect
of
the
company
so
yes
you
re
right
it
be
a
blend
right
from
the
begin
and
when
i
look
at
recombinant
dna
that
be
the
same
thing
it
s
a
tremendously
excite
technology
i
w
ante
to
study
the
technology
i
do
not
decide
to
start
a
business
i
decide
to
study
recombinant
dna
so
i
would
understand
it
because
i
be
go
to
the
people
at
abbott
to
get
them
to
do
thing
that
i
thought
be
possible
they
would
always
explain
to
me
why
they
would
cost
you
an
arm
and
a
leg
and
it
would
take
you
forever
and
i
thought
well
i
ve
just
get
to
understand
this
for
myself
so
when
i
line
up
a
relationship
with
winston
salser
at
ucla
it
be
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
for
six
month
and
leam
recombinant
dna
hughes
now
why
winston
salser
how
do
you
know
him
rathmann
well
one
of
the
people
i
d
hire
at
abbott
be
a
ph
d
molecular
biologist
from
winston
s
lab
so
when
i
be
be
frustrate
at
abbott
that
i
couldn
t
get
some
of
the
thing
start
in
recombinant
dna
that
i
want
phil
whitcomc
say
well
i
ll
take
you
out
to
my
old
professor
winston
salser
he
can
help
you
on
that
and
in
fact
he
could
phil
knew
that
winston
have
a
hepatitis
clone
what
have
struck
me
as
be
an
important
thing
to
do
at
abbott
be
to
get
away
from
have
to
bring
in
infectious
material
in
order
to
have
our
standard
for
our
diagnostic
test
our
standard
positive
be
derive
from
infect
blood
that
meant
that
everything
in
that
place
have
to
be
special
class
biohazard
containment
and
all
that
stuff
and
i
say
gee
the
hepatitis
surface
antigen
cannot
propagate
hepatitis
it
s
a
marker
but
it
do
not
cany
the
disease
but
if
you
isolate
it
from
disease
carry
bug
then
you
have
to
assume
that
everything
be
infect
but
if
you
be
able
to
make
it
by
recombinant
dna
the
plant
would
just
be
simplify
bey
ond
belief
and
i
say
we
just
have
get
to
get
it
by
recombinant
dna
so
that
s
when
i
try
to
turn
on
the
people
in
the
recombinant
dna
area
at
abbott
which
have
be
go
on
for
about
five
year
but
they
wouldn
t
do
anything
hughes
what
be
they
afraid
of
rathmann
well
the
whole
field
be
very
new
and
the
ability
to
do
exactly
what
you
want
to
do
hadn
t
be
establish
yet
so
they
be
quite
correct
that
it
might
be
very
complicate
to
successfully
make
this
stuff
what
they
be
protect
against
be
take
on
a
job
that
might
be
too
hard
take
too
long
cost
too
much
money
or
be
deem
too
dangerous
so
they
just
simply
say
it
will
cost
a
million
dollar
it
will
take
two
year
hughes
so
it
be
consideration
like
that
it
wasn
t
the
fact
that
there
be
a
controversy
rag
on
the
political
front

rathmann
hughes
rathmann
hughes
rathmann
well
that
be
there
too
in
the
sense
that
because
of
that
it
probably
would
take
two
year
in
other
word
at
abbott
they
have
to
respect
the
idea
that
everybody
be
scar
to
death
of
this
stuff
and
therefore
the
first
thing
you
organize
when
you
organize
dna
work
be
a
biohazard
committee
the
biosafety
committee
would
have
be
a
well
name
but
the
biohazard
mean
that
you
can
scare
most
of
the
executive
in
the
company
any
time
you
want
by
say
you
ve
get
a
new
question
about
biohazard
in
what
s
go
on
what
actually
occur
as
a
result
of
that
be
an
enormous
barrier
or
i
should
say
barrier
to
get
research
do
for
example
if
anybody
in
the
dna
area
have
a
cold
they
have
to
go
home
because
of
the
risk
that
you
would
start
to
put
disease
gene
into
something
that
could
infect
human
being
and
spread
new
disease
so
anybody
with
a
disease
have
to
go
home
now
be
that
mandate
by
the
nih
guideline
or
be
that
abbott
policy
company
like
abbott
immediately
adopt
the
nih
guideline
and
then
they
say
well
we
re
go
to
do
well
than
that
so
whatever
the
nih
guideline
say
we
re
go
to
do
well
now
if
that
s
your
goal
there
s
no
limit
if
you
say
i
m
go
to
follow
a
guideline
that
s
one
thing
if
you
say
i
m
go
to
do
well
where
do
well
stop
it
doesn
t
stop
and
it
didn
t
stop
there
there
be
certain
bureaucratic
part
of
abbott
the
quality
assurance
head
and
the
medical
head
and
so
on
oh
they
get
their
hand
on
this
oh
this
be
lush
i
mean
boy
now
we
re
control
the
company
we
re
go
to
be
more
powerful
than
anybody
in
the
company
and
so
not
only
do
you
have
to
send
somebody
home
who
have
a
cold
but
before
he
come
back
into
the
laboratory
he
have
to
go
over
to
the
health
department
at
abbott
and
be
give
a
clean
bill
of
health
now
what
eventually
happen
be
that
you
would
see
these
people
line
up
outside
if
eight
people
have
a
cold
and
in
that
group
they
have
to
line
up
relative
to
any
other
people
with
cold
that
might
have
to
go
to
the
health
department
and
it
be
a
terrible
burden
everything
you
do
take
extra
time
then
you
have
the
review
of
your
protocol
so
if
you
have
an
idea
and
you
want
to
run
an
experiment
it
have
to
be
submit
to
the
biohazard
committee
and
they
would
ponder
this
thing
most
of
them
be
not
scientific
even
though
they
should
have
be
i
end
up
on
one
biohazard
committee
and
i
try
to
say
let
s
get
the
job
do
let
s
not
stand
here
and
delay
one
program
after
another
because
it
might
still
have
some
risk
we
re
never
go
to
get
anything
do
so
that
be
the
problem
at
abbott
what
do
you
think
about
the
risk
versus
benefit
issue
i
have
no
real
first
hand
sense
i
figure
i
be
go
to
leam
it
i
be
go
to
find
out
what
the
story
be
by
work
with
winston
in
his
lab
and
i
ll
find
out
how
risky
it
be
i
didn
t
know
ahead
of
time
but
i
do
know
that
when
i
start
with
winston
scientifically
i
be
expect
that
i
be
go
to
come
up
the
learn
curve
from
square
zero
i
never
do
that
because
winston
have
become
involve
in
start
amgen
so
that
s
how
i
get
link
to
amgen
winston
say
well
i
can
t
really
do
what
i
hop
to
do
with
you
to
have
you
as
a
kind
of
a
sabbatical
in
my
lab
because
i
m
go
to
be
spending
my
time
start
a
company
now
you
can
still
come
and
be
in
my
lab
but
i
m
not
go
to
be
able
to
spend
much
time
with
you
well
that
defeat
the
whole
thing
so
i
say
i
d
just
as
soon
consider
what
he
s
planning
to
do
as
an
area
of

interest
what
be
this
amgen
go
to
be
then
he
give
me
a
hard
sell
that
maybe
i
could
be
a
good
guy
to
come
to
amgen
that
s
how
it
all
start
but
it
be
clear
w
hen
we
start
amgen
and
we
have
to
pick
a
place
to
work
that
some
of
the
consideration
about
safety
loom
pretty
big
for
example
there
be
a
business
park
that
we
eventually
decide
to
go
to
though
we
look
at
a
bunch
of
different
place
this
business
park
be
on
the
outskirt
of
thousand
oak
way
away
from
downtown
and
we
be
at
ucla
so
it
be
pretty
far
out
but
it
be
a
pretty
area
in
thousand
oak
where
we
picked
this
business
park
when
we
look
at
the
business
park
there
be
three
building
that
we
could
have
use
two
that
be
really
reasonable
actually
i
remember
the
think
because
it
s
so
different
from
what
i
would
think
today
that
be
the
prevail
westerly
wind
would
carry
the
bug
whatever
you
have
the
high
risk
stuff
to
the
east
there
be
a
residential
area
right
here
and
we
didn
t
lease
that
building
because
it
would
be
butting
right
up
against
the
residential
area
and
the
risk
of
thing
be
carry
into
the
residential
area
be
much
great
well
not
really
i
mean
another
hundred
yard
what
the
heck
do
that
mean
but
just
the
same
it
be
actually
a
consideration
and
we
do
not
take
that
space
we
take
the
other
space
and
then
later
on
we
get
the
space
and
have
stop
worry
the
first
decision
be
be
influence
by
this
uncertainty
as
what
you
be
go
to
experience
you
do
have
to
say
to
yourself
how
do
you
reconcile
these
tremendous
fear
for
example
at
the
abbott
program
they
bought
an
electron
microscope
their
idea
have
to
do
with
do
the
job
right
and
that
s
because
some
work
have
be
very
successful
base
on
the
electron
microscope
they
w
ere
use
the
electron
microscope
at
amgen
for
ten
year
so
it
wasn
t
a
very
good
choice
because
you
re
take
out
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
cost
a
full
time
person
for
what
might
not
be
a
very
essential
step
but
it
be
the
way
they
start
but
the
important
thing
that
they
do
at
abbott
which
be
quite
strange
be
that
they
have
their
laboratory
in
different
place
and
they
didn
t
know
they
really
be
wrestling
for
week
with
how
to
transport
a
specimen
from
this
laboratory
to
this
electron
microscope
how
be
we
go
to
do
that
it
s
almost
as
though
people
have
anticipate
the
aid
virus
w
ithout
know
that
there
be
such
a
thing
and
assume
that
anything
you
do
in
recombinant
dna
be
potentially
more
lethal
than
anything
you
have
ever
see
before
in
any
disease
the
idea
be
that
you
w
ere
deal
with
human
gene
and
human
disease
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
re
go
to
take
a
cell
like
e
coli
a
bacterial
cell
that
multiplies
like
crazy
and
it
s
go
to
multiply
a
disease
that
s
lethal
to
man
and
that
s
what
s
scary
and
a
lot
of
time
you
can
t
prove
that
it
s
not
go
to
do
this
until
you
run
the
experiment
the
thing
that
escape
in
other
word
this
bug
that
you
now
found
out
be
very
dangerous
be
fly
through
the
air
and
everybody
know
that
these
thing
be
certainly
out
in
the
air
around
the
building
nobody
be
silly
enough
to
think
that
containment
really
mean
that
none
of
those
bacteria
ever
survive
outside
the
building
hughes
be
the
people
around
you
have
similar
concern
rathmann
well
the
big
concern
have
already
be
dealt
with
in
boston
they
be
dealt
with
by
slow
down
the
boston
contingent
of
biotech
so
that
genentech
could
beat
them
and
that
s
really
what
happen
hughes
you
think

rathmann
it
be
not
a
trivial
thing
the
mayor
of
cambridge
alfred
vellucci
get
on
his
high
horse
and
decide
that
he
be
go
to
put
in
more
constraint
and
more
restriction
and
more
regulation
than
anybody
have
ever
dream
of
and
have
scar
the
hell
out
of
everybody
so
we
all
be
concerned
about
that
and
we
all
thought
that
be
overkill
but
you
didn
t
know
how
much
you
could
back
away
from
that
overkill
once
you
set
up
a
procedure
that
say
you
have
to
do
this
this
and
this
now
you
would
have
to
work
very
hard
to
prove
that
it
wasn
t
necessary
you
almost
get
lock
in
that
s
what
happen
at
abbott
they
get
lock
in
you
have
level
of
containment
i
can
t
remember
the
term
right
now
hughes
p
physical
containment
lab
rathmann
yes
p
that
s
it
so
you
have
pl
and
p
and
p
and
then
you
have
p
abbott
already
have
a
p
that
they
be
put
in
and
they
be
shoot
for
a
p
the
idea
be
that
if
you
want
to
be
well
than
the
next
guy
you
well
have
a
high
containment
now
the
problem
be
at
p
you
have
to
put
on
suit
with
helmet
and
everything
else
you
couldn
t
move
in
p
hughes
well
a
p
lab
be
at
the
level
of
fort
detrick
isn
t
it
rathmann
yes
exactly
right
and
there
be
time
when
you
need
p
but
if
you
re
take
p
for
any
piece
of
dna
of
any
kind
and
say
well
i
m
play
with
dna
i
m
play
with
something
that
potentially
could
do
anything
horrible
i
need
p
they
set
up
their
p
lab
they
really
do
they
expect
that
they
weren
t
go
to
use
it
but
then
people
say
well
you
ve
get
the
p
so
you
might
as
well
use
it
so
that
just
burden
them
with
a
very
slow
process
of
try
to
get
anything
do
that
plus
the
biosafety
review
of
every
protocol
and
they
would
have
to
go
on
an
appeal
hughes
wasn
t
that
same
system
in
place
everywhere
rathmann
amgen
never
put
in
a
p
we
didn
t
put
in
a
p
we
do
everything
pl
hughes
so
you
re
say
that
you
weren
t
slow
down
in
the
way
the
boston
group
be
rathmann
well
genentech
have
pioneer
the
west
coast
approach
hughes
well
there
be
other
thing
at
least
to
my
mind
that
explain
why
genentech
won
the
race
for
human
insulin
and
that
s
that
they
have
a
unique
technique
rathmann
what
unique
technique
hughes
well
they
have
the
combination
of
synthetic
dna
and
recombinant
dna
isn
t
that
ultimately
why
they
won
rathmann
yes
they
won
because
of
synthetic
dna
hughes
do
the
nih
guideline
and
that
whole
paraphernalia
actually
slow
down
research
rathmann
well
it
certainly
do
but
it
be
still
very
enlighten
the
nih
guideline
to
my
mind
you
can
attribute
to
them
the
big
success
of
dna
in
the
u
s
because
it
give
people
the

comfort
level
they
need
and
you
didn
t
have
question
every
day
every
experiment
every
hour
if
you
stuck
with
the
guideline
the
guideline
be
very
helpful
in
another
sense
they
say
of
all
the
hideous
thing
that
could
come
out
of
dna
by
far
the
bad
idea
be
a
human
disease
in
which
the
disease
entity
be
be
replicate
massively
by
e
coli
and
the
e
coli
be
escape
and
possibly
be
go
to
infect
people
with
a
human
disease
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
if
we
combine
human
disease
we
may
make
a
really
horrible
disease
that
s
bad
than
ever
before
maybe
you
get
the
contagion
of
one
bug
and
the
lethal
nature
of
the
other
bug
and
they
never
be
together
in
one
single
bug
but
now
you
ve
combine
gene
and
now
you
have
this
bug
that
do
both
it
s
very
contagious
and
it
s
very
lethal
and
of
course
that
s
the
trouble
with
aid
aid
basically
be
the
result
that
people
fear
when
they
do
recombinant
dna
at
the
begin
they
fear
that
you
be
go
to
come
up
with
something
that
s
just
absolutely
hideous
so
it
be
a
strange
benefit
be
able
to
synthesize
the
human
gene
instead
of
take
it
and
the
strange
benefit
be
come
on
now
if
you
look
at
this
scientifically
if
i
ve
get
the
human
insulin
gene
here
and
i
ve
get
the
one
that
i
ve
synthesize
here
be
there
any
possible
way
in
which
this
one
s
safer
than
this
one
but
suddenly
it
s
safer
because
the
guideline
deal
with
human
gene
and
it
s
not
a
human
gene
it
s
a
synthesize
gene
but
the
fact
be
it
s
identical
so
that
be
really
a
weird
way
to
get
around
the
guideline
but
genentech
do
that
and
they
be
launch
mean
they
just
take
off
biogen
in
boston
be
struggle
with
the
mayor
of
cambridge
and
get
nothing
do
and
genentech
charge
way
ahead
huglies
do
you
think
that
company
such
as
amgen
and
abbott
follow
the
nih
guideline
which
of
course
thej
didn
t
have
to
do
because
they
weren
t
receive
federal
fund
because
they
have
a
genuine
concern
about
biohazard
or
be
it
the
politically
expedient
course
to
take
rathmann
it
probably
be
politically
expedient
but
what
be
terribly
politically
unastute
at
abbott
be
one
little
simple
extra
thing
and
that
be
we
re
go
to
comply
with
the
nih
guideline
the
hew
guideline
but
we
re
go
to
do
it
a
little
well
and
that
one
thing
be
really
punitive
the
fact
be
if
you
analyze
what
be
the
most
efficient
way
for
a
company
to
behave
it
be
to
understand
the
guideline
and
adhere
to
them
rigorously
not
one
iota
more
nor
one
iota
less
that
sound
very
rigid
and
terribly
uninspired
but
that
be
by
far
the
best
thing
remember
the
debate
at
abbott
well
we
re
try
to
do
well
than
the
guideline
so
we
don
t
want
to
stop
right
there
how
will
we
do
well
well
we
could
put
the
whole
building
under
positive
pressure
no
we
ll
put
the
dna
room
under
negative
pressure
and
the
other
room
under
positive
pressure
and
that
mean
the
air
will
always
be
flow
into
the
room
so
there
s
a
much
low
chance
of
stuff
go
out
oh
it
go
on
and
on
some
people
who
have
little
understand
of
the
science
be
rub
their
hand
because
they
be
literally
control
the
whole
course
of
this
activity
within
abbott
and
they
have
not
lose
control
to
the
scientist
who
be
potentially
dangerous
hughes
biosafety
would
have
be
a
problem
that
you
would
have
have
to
deal
with
almost
immediately
as
soon
as
you
become
associate
with
amgen
so
how
be
that
experience
at
abbott
translate
to
amgen
in
how
you
handle
this
whole
recombinant
dna
thing

rathmann
the
answer
be
that
genentech
be
a
model
of
how
you
get
the
job
do
and
the
people
at
amgen
include
winston
salser
have
gotten
pretty
well
acquaint
with
the
genentech
approach
so
there
be
a
west
coast
can
do
approach
that
be
very
very
strong
and
very
justified
they
knew
that
you
could
stick
with
the
guideline
you
didn
t
have
to
do
well
than
the
guideline
to
be
safe
and
if
you
stuck
with
the
guideline
you
could
live
with
that
they
be
pretty
relaxed
already
the
guideline
be
set
up
as
i
say
very
intelligently
they
told
you
which
experiment
you
should
shy
away
from
human
virus
don
t
put
those
anywhere
near
a
recombinant
system
a
whole
lot
of
guideline
that
be
design
to
do
the
safest
experiment
first
the
safest
experiment
be
really
safe
and
make
it
possible
to
do
some
really
wonderful
important
thing
so
you
didn
t
need
to
start
right
out
with
a
human
virus
and
embed
it
into
your
dna
and
all
that
you
didn
t
need
to
do
that
and
we
didn
t
do
that
hughes
well
let
s
go
back
we
left
you
strand
without
an
opportunity
to
go
to
salser
s
lab
because
salser
wasn
t
go
to
be
there
so
talk
about
the
offer
to
become
ceo
of
amgen
and
what
you
thought
about
all
that
rathmann
well
that
come
very
quickly
and
i
can
tell
you
the
date
it
be
april
of
that
i
take
a
leave
of
absence
from
abbott
i
take
a
leave
to
learn
dna
and
they
all
kind
of
wonder
what
be
wrong
with
me
but
i
have
convince
joy
that
recombinant
dna
be
the
most
important
thing
i
have
ever
see
and
that
we
ought
to
try
to
learn
about
it
joy
s
a
biologist
she
understood
that
this
be
very
excite
j
rathmann
winston
offer
me
a
job
too
rathmann
you
re
right
i
do
remember
that
hughes
and
what
be
your
job
to
be
j
rathmann
i
don
t
know
laugh
rathmann
well
salser
wasn
t
so
sure
that
he
have
a
supporter
for
make
a
change
to
amgen
so
what
he
decide
be
to
bribe
joy
with
this
idea
that
wouldn
t
you
like
to
be
right
there
in
the
lab
with
him
it
be
kind
of
interest
so
anyway
winston
have
decide
that
he
be
go
to
help
start
this
company
amgen
that
be
a
funny
story
because
the
venture
capitalist
who
have
start
amgen
have
decide
that
they
be
go
to
put
together
a
scientific
advisory
board
that
be
one
approach
to
building
one
of
these
new
company
take
a
scientific
board
of
real
preeminent
scientist
and
then
have
that
as
a
kind
of
lightning
rod
to
attract
scientist
and
investor
and
to
guide
your
research
there
be
some
flaw
in
this
think
but
it
be
very
well
accepted
at
the
time
so
they
want
to
organize
a
scientific
advisoryboard
and
they
picked
bob
schimke
at
stanford
to
do
that
but
bob
end
up
with
a
dad
who
be
very
sick
and
he
have
to
bow
out
i
ve
know
bob
now
since
all
those
year
but
he
do
not
start
amgen
because
he
have
the
burden
of
a
very
very
sick
father
up
in
seattle
so
he
have
to
factor
himself
out
and
he
propose
that
they
pick
somebody
else
he
say
why
don
t
you
pick
winston
salser

rathmann
hughes
rathmann
hughes
tape
side
a
what
winston
have
do
which
have
gotten
everybody
s
attention
out
here
on
the
west
coast
be
that
he
have
decide
to
build
his
department
in
a
very
straightforward
way
at
ucla
what
he
knew
be
the
more
student
you
have
the
more
space
you
get
the
more
space
you
have
the
more
you
could
attract
additional
people
that
spiral
which
you
want
to
get
yourself
into
could
be
facilitate
if
you
could
bring
some
money
into
your
department
you
could
hire
people
you
have
the
people
then
you
get
the
space
you
get
the
space
you
get
more
people
and
so
on
so
he
concoct
an
idea
for
make
money
for
his
lab
he
have
note
that
radioactive
tracer
be
be
package
in
very
large
bulk
size
by
the
people
sell
them
and
yet
a
small
academic
lab
only
need
a
very
very
small
quantity
he
realize
that
because
of
the
huge
difference
in
quantity
there
be
an
ability
to
do
some
very
interest
thing
with
pricing
namely
if
you
broke
down
a
package
that
cost
you
a
hundred
dollar
into
the
small
package
that
be
quite
satisfactory
for
many
lab
you
could
convert
it
into
a
thousand
dollar
worth
of
sale
so
he
have
a
money
machine
and
once
he
have
that
machine
he
hire
people
with
the
money
come
in
the
difference
between
a
hundred
dollar
and
a
thousand
dollar
the
people
he
hire
be
graduate
student
and
so
on
and
so
he
now
have
that
many
more
graduate
student
than
anybody
else
what
his
guy
be
do
be
make
money
but
they
be
in
the
lab
and
they
need
space
and
he
parlayed
this
into
a
lot
more
space
that
be
what
schimke
note
here
be
a
guy
who
be
clearly
of
that
kind
he
be
a
business
guy
strange
business
but
winston
would
do
anything
to
make
money
the
reason
i
have
actually
met
winston
be
to
come
out
here
and
buy
his
hepatitis
clone
from
him
for
ten
thousand
dollar
phil
whitcome
have
say
if
that
s
what
you
want
and
you
can
t
get
it
out
of
abbott
let
s
go
out
there
together
we
get
there
and
i
say
to
winston
i
d
like
to
get
my
hand
on
that
clone
because
i
want
to
do
it
and
the
people
at
abbott
be
say
oh
it
will
take
forever
so
for
ten
thousand
dollar
i
brought
them
back
this
clone
so
that
we
could
make
the
very
thing
that
i
be
hop
we
could
make
and
avoid
the
big
biohazard
stuff
and
everything
else
because
this
be
absolutely
safe
be
that
the
go
price
be
there
a
go
price
there
be
no
go
price
in
fact
i
be
astonish
that
i
could
even
get
the
clone
because
most
of
the
thing
be
shepherd
and
very
precious
and
so
on
but
he
have
do
the
impressive
thing
and
gotten
himself
a
clone
when
i
offer
him
something
why
he
have
dollar
sign
for
eye
he
be
obviously
go
to
go
for
it
he
get
his
ten
thousand
dollar
and
that
pack
more
money
into
his
lab
more
space
more
student
but
the
sad
part
be
that
a
couple
year
later
i
have
left
abbott
of
course
go
back
to
find
out
well
how
do
you
do
with
that
hepatitis
clone
it
be
still
in
the
refrigerator
it
be
one
of
those
thing
your
own
idea
be
much
more
interest
than
the
other
guy
s
idea
and
if
you
ever
want
to
have
an
idea
lead
to
something
you
d
well
work
on
it
yourself
because
if
you
think
that
automatically
it
s
go
to
get
picked
up
by
somebody
else
it
won
t
be
but
that
s
amaze
isn
t
it
it
seem
to
be
a
no
brainer
that
a
hepatitis
b
vaccine
would
have
a
huge
market

rathmann
yes
that
s
true
except
that
abbott
be
not
interested
in
the
vaccine
i
be
only
interested
in
the
diagnostic
see
our
kit
have
to
have
a
positive
in
there
that
have
a
surface
antigen
so
it
be
not
a
huge
thing
to
do
it
would
be
a
very
significant
saving
in
the
factory
because
you
re
not
go
to
have
everything
thrown
into
a
biohazard
mode
i
mean
biohazard
mode
be
a
real
pain
i
remember
when
we
design
one
of
our
room
oh
my
god
because
of
the
biohazard
issue
the
floor
have
to
be
pull
up
at
the
side
and
all
the
material
have
to
be
prove
to
be
a
special
grade
you
be
afraid
that
your
air
conditioning
system
if
it
be
just
ordinary
steel
would
gradually
rust
and
then
the
rust
would
possibly
hold
bacteria
and
mean
thing
so
everything
have
to
be
stainless
steel
from
begin
to
end
the
imposition
of
biosafety
consideration
on
your
space
be
what
kill
cetus
cetus
decide
to
move
ahead
and
when
ira
and
i
go
out
they
be
show
us
their
new
p
facility
and
it
wasn
t
ready
and
it
wasn
t
ready
the
second
time
we
come
out
and
they
be
do
it
up
right
genentech
meanwhile
through
their
synthesis
of
course
do
everything
pl
and
they
be
fly
they
flew
right
by
cetus
cetus
be
start
in
and
genentech
be
start
in
so
genentech
be
five
year
behind
and
genentech
have
flown
by
them
by
hughes
so
you
think
that
the
resource
put
into
building
the
p
lab
be
one
of
the
thing
that
account
for
cetus
s
problem
rathmann
well
the
whole
process
not
just
the
financial
resource
the
delay
and
make
sure
that
everything
be
okay
on
top
of
okay
on
top
of
okay
and
when
you
ve
get
people
that
can
say
no
when
i
m
pretty
sure
they
could
say
yes
it
s
go
to
lead
to
interminable
delay
that
s
exactly
what
happen
they
be
not
much
far
along
after
about
a
year
after
we
first
met
them
than
they
be
at
the
begin
because
they
be
just
go
through
this
process
they
eventually
solve
the
problem
but
the
much
well
solution
be
to
be
able
to
do
it
safely
and
surely
in
a
pl
facility
in
fact
all
the
way
along
when
we
be
do
this
at
amgen
we
would
go
into
place
phillips
petroleum
be
set
one
up
i
remember
go
to
theirs
man
oh
man
they
have
rigidity
in
their
system
that
you
wouldn
t
believe
you
couldn
t
get
from
one
place
to
another
without
a
lock
door
and
a
pas
and
then
certain
people
could
get
in
and
some
people
couldn
t
get
in
nobody
have
any
more
hazard
than
anybody
else
but
it
be
treat
as
though
in
one
case
you
have
to
do
enormous
thing
and
then
in
the
genentech
case
you
do
very
little
hughes
in
contrast
to
the
other
story
that
i
ve
heard
about
the
beginning
of
biotech
company
amgen
be
the
vision
of
venture
capitalist
who
then
look
around
for
some
scientist
be
that
really
the
way
it
go
rathmann
i
think
that
s
true
yes
hughes
do
any
other
company
start
that
way
rathmann
i
don
t
know
these
venture
capitalist
have
be
involve
in
the
start
of
cetus
and
in
the
start
of
biogen
so
to
say
that
biogen
wasn
t
form
the
same
way
would
be
kind
of
hard
to
argue
for
because
moshe
alafi
be
at
biogen
and
several
of
the
other

venture
capitalist
that
we
dealt
with
be
bill
bowes
have
be
involve
at
cetus
and
so
have
sam
wolstadter
the
two
of
them
be
venture
capitalist
hughes
so
they
knew
the
business
as
well
as
anybody
guess
rathmann
yes
as
much
experience
as
there
be
in
the
financing
of
recombinant
dna
hughes
but
you
could
also
argue
that
because
they
have
be
involve
with
these
other
biotech
company
they
would
say
well
that
niche
have
be
fill
how
be
another
biotech
company
go
to
get
off
the
ground
rathmann
i
think
a
version
of
that
be
what
i
understood
and
that
be
there
be
undoubtedly
room
for
another
biotech
company
that
be
the
statement
that
be
make
to
me
when
there
be
the
question
of
my
go
to
amgen
hughes
on
what
basis
do
people
say
that
rathmann
just
the
belief
that
there
be
room
for
another
biotech
company
they
figure
that
it
be
go
to
be
very
important
and
in
fact
it
prove
to
be
true
laugh
dozen
of
biotech
company
form
after
that
ihere
be
two
thing
one
be
that
there
be
plenty
of
room
because
there
be
lot
of
thing
to
do
the
other
be
that
it
hadn
t
be
do
quite
right
the
cetus
plan
wasn
t
quite
right
they
become
very
sluggish
they
get
very
big
very
fast
and
they
have
a
number
of
different
problem
they
try
to
organize
cetus
immune
and
cetus
palo
alto
and
cetus
here
and
cetus
there
the
net
effect
be
that
they
lose
control
of
what
they
be
try
to
do
they
be
building
up
cost
fast
and
not
building
up
effectiveness
so
cetus
have
certain
unique
problem
biogen
be
form
in
combination
with
international
nickel
whether
that
be
good
or
bad
i
haven
t
any
idea
but
it
be
different
i
be
sure
that
if
you
get
yourself
allied
with
a
company
too
early
they
might
not
want
to
spend
the
money
or
something
else
i
think
it
be
the
venture
capital
arm
of
international
nickel
moshe
alafi
say
i
d
like
you
to
come
to
biogen
he
be
one
of
the
guy
i
met
to
get
amgen
start
but
he
also
have
be
a
founder
of
biogen
so
he
be
very
interested
in
biogen
and
he
say
george
i
want
you
to
see
biogen
because
maybe
you
ll
like
it
well
so
he
have
me
go
out
to
visit
boston
ana
biogen
he
be
pretty
much
a
prime
mover
both
there
and
at
amgen
hughes
and
what
do
you
think
of
biogen
rathmann
well
i
thought
that
wally
gilbert
who
get
a
nobel
prize
be
an
extremely
attractive
guy
phil
sharp
be
very
capable
they
have
put
themselves
in
a
dungeon
somewhere
boston
be
not
an
easy
place
to
find
fresh
space
the
business
park
at
amgen
be
much
more
interest
to
me
than
go
into
some
crummy
place
that
wasn
t
clean
and
wasn
t
new
at
all
i
be
just
stand
there
think
oh
boy
i
ve
get
lot
of
worry
if
we
have
to
start
this
way
hughes
plus
you
have
the
legacy
of
how
cambridge
react
to
the
recombinant
dna
issue
rathmann
well
it
be
very
clear
you
didn
t
want
to
be
there
unless
that
legacy
be
go
forever
and
you
weren
t
really
sure

hughes
rathmann
the
reason
why
i
didn
t
take
the
job
be
that
biogen
at
that
time
be
a
dutch
antilles
company
because
they
have
figure
out
there
would
be
some
tax
saving
in
be
a
dutch
company
biogen
have
their
primary
operation
in
geneva
switzerland
they
have
scientific
advisor
in
ireland
and
scotland
and
germany
so
they
be
already
in
some
trouble
from
the
logistics
standpoint
they
offer
me
the
u
s
job
but
here
you
ve
get
sit
over
in
geneva
the
real
job
i
say
no
thank
you
very
much
i
didn
t
need
that
idea
that
you
be
start
out
a
subsidiary
and
there
s
some
uncertainty
here
when
thing
be
go
on
and
everybody
s
establish
you
could
work
something
out
but
when
you
re
just
get
start
and
you
start
out
with
that
kind
of
disadvantage
it
didn
t
intrigue
me
at
all
so
i
pass
it
up
you
also
have
very
senior
scientist
in
charge
of
each
of
these
lab
spread
out
over
the
european
continent
and
britain
it
seem
to
me
quite
a
different
model
than
for
example
genentech
where
the
early
scientist
be
all
fresh
out
of
academic
laboratory
they
be
start
their
career
they
weren
t
big
authority
figure
it
would
be
hard
wouldn
t
it
to
get
cohesion
in
a
group
of
men
who
have
the
prestige
of
that
group
it
be
clear
that
there
be
a
difference
in
biogen
relative
to
what
i
be
use
to
at
m
in
other
word
my
idea
of
how
you
run
a
business
the
m
way
if
you
want
to
break
it
down
into
division
that
s
fine
and
each
division
becomes
a
model
of
a
company
you
have
get
your
general
manager
your
technical
director
your
marketing
guy
and
your
manufacturing
guy
every
division
of
m
have
those
people
and
every
division
operate
as
autonomously
as
they
could
they
like
the
idea
of
autonomy
as
a
driver
of
individual
think
and
all
the
rest
so
what
you
weren
t
use
to
at
m
be
that
you
set
up
a
board
of
outside
people
everybody
in
a
m
division
be
full
time
work
on
your
program
you
could
be
like
a
little
company
all
contain
but
you
re
try
to
act
totally
independently
and
what
you
don
t
need
in
a
way
be
a
group
of
advisor
come
in
once
every
three
month
to
tell
you
what
to
do
that
be
the
scary
part
about
biogen
in
july
of
there
be
an
article
in
fortune
that
convince
me
beyond
any
doubt
that
i
want
to
be
in
recombinant
dna
i
have
plan
to
get
an
education
i
have
be
three
month
in
that
process
try
to
get
winston
to
get
me
a
place
in
the
lab
but
the
real
decision
that
this
be
where
i
want
to
spend
my
time
be
in
june
of
when
they
have
an
article
on
biogen
what
they
point
out
in
that
article
be
i
remember
the
phrase
the
scientist
have
their
hand
on
our
jugular
that
always
seem
to
me
to
be
the
right
way
to
do
it
if
you
re
go
to
be
a
science
base
business
for
gosh
sake
recognize
who
s
essential
to
that
business
it
s
the
scientist
there
be
always
a
little
feel
and
at
m
it
be
quite
clear
once
in
a
while
that
just
about
the
time
w
hen
thing
start
to
move
the
marketing
guy
would
move
in
and
they
would
take
over
to
run
the
business
i
didn
t
like
that
very
much
i
just
thought
have
a
plan
that
will
keep
the
scientist
commit
on
the
other
hand
the
article
also
reveal
that
these
guy
the
so
call
advisory
board
be
sort
of
all
powerful
they
report
to
the
board
of
director
they
didn
t
report
to
the
president
but
when
i
come
to
amgen
they
say
we
have
a
scientific
advisory
board
they
introduce
me
to
four
or
five
of
the
member
and
told
me
that
that
board
be
go
to
report
to
the
board
of
director
i
say
that
s
very
interest
but
then
you
re
not
go
to
have
me
in
that
company
laugh
hughes

rathmann
rhey
say
what
do
you
mean
what
s
wrong
with
that
these
people
be
prestigious
professor
i
say
if
they
be
go
to
be
involve
in
the
company
they
will
report
to
the
ceo
or
i
m
not
go
to
be
the
ceo
there
be
a
little
bit
of
that
at
m
once
in
a
while
you
would
buy
some
technology
and
in
the
process
of
convincing
the
guy
that
brought
the
technology
to
the
company
he
would
get
access
to
the
president
of
the
company
and
by
god
there
be
time
when
these
guy
would
w
ant
to
run
right
in
to
the
president
to
tell
him
that
the
division
wasn
t
do
it
right
you
ve
get
my
technology
but
it
s
not
move
as
fast
as
it
should
be
because
the
guy
run
the
division
isn
t
do
it
right
and
he
s
second
guess
and
it
s
miserable
i
knew
all
that
so
thought
no
way
be
i
go
to
have
a
scientific
advisory
board
report
to
the
board
of
director
and
tell
them
what
a
crappy
job
i
m
do
no
way
so
say
no
if
they
report
to
me
that
s
fine
otherwise
i
m
not
go
to
do
this
they
say
oh
well
they
can
report
to
you
but
biogen
s
organization
be
pretty
autonomous
not
only
do
the
scientific
advisor
run
their
own
lab
with
some
biogen
money
and
so
on
and
preserve
their
own
individual
lab
which
be
a
little
scary
no
the
genentech
model
be
much
more
along
the
industrial
line
that
i
be
use
to
you
set
up
your
r
d
within
your
company
you
re
go
to
have
some
advisor
they
advise
through
the
management
team
of
the
company
not
tell
the
board
what
people
be
do
wrong
it
be
just
much
more
straightforward
like
what
i
be
use
to
in
a
business
environment
so
biogen
be
a
little
scary
even
though
as
i
say
i
get
talk
into
the
whole
idea
of
be
in
a
recombinant
dna
company
because
of
that
article
in
fortune
it
s
a
wonderful
article
by
the
way
the
intrigue
picture
be
these
seven
or
eight
scientist
in
a
room
talk
to
each
other
about
the
new
thing
that
could
be
discover
by
recombinant
dna
it
s
just
so
excite
to
imagine
the
extra
stimulant
of
real
genius
from
all
over
the
place
deal
with
each
other
and
kind
of
raise
your
level
kind
of
bootstrapping
you
right
out
to
the
ultimate
level
of
understand
and
insight
in
fact
we
do
have
that
at
amgen
with
our
scientific
advisory
board
we
have
the
best
there
be
there
be
many
example
of
how
just
remarkably
powerful
scientist
can
generate
remarkable
insight
hughes
the
scientific
advisory
board
have
be
set
up
before
you
come
into
the
picture
rathmann
yes
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
help
a
little
to
get
bill
rutter
but
that
s
the
only
one
the
others
be
already
there
and
they
be
set
up
by
winston
so
schimke
in
his
own
funny
way
when
he
picked
winston
to
set
up
the
scientific
advisory
board
actually
picked
the
right
guy
because
he
be
very
clever
because
what
winston
do
learn
this
after
i
get
there
go
to
john
carbon
i
say
john
why
do
you
join
he
say
oh
everybody
be
line
up
to
get
onto
this
scientific
advisory
board
so
want
to
be
on
it
i
say
that
s
really
interest
then
i
say
to
normfan
davidson
who
be
a
prestigious
guy
why
do
you
join
he
say
oh
they
have
this
scientific
advisory
board
all
set
up
and
i
be
one
of
the
last
to
get
on
arnie
berk
say
oh
be
give
the
privilege
of
join
this
scientific
advisory
board
so
that
be
winston
winston
s
tell
everybody
that
he
be
get
all
these
people
nail
down
and
in
some
case
they
weren
t
hughes
laugh

rathmann
but
eventually
a
lot
of
them
nail
down
because
the
other
guy
eventually
nail
down
too
we
give
john
carbon
an
award
once
because
he
be
the
first
member
of
the
scientific
advisory
board
and
he
say
i
can
t
take
this
i
be
the
last
one
to
come
on
we
say
no
no
we
ve
get
the
date
we
know
exactly
when
you
sign
on
you
be
the
first
member
of
the
scientific
advisory
board
laughter
so
winston
in
his
own
v
ay
didn
t
hesitate
to
get
the
job
do
by
whatever
way
he
be
go
to
get
it
do
but
it
be
very
interest
that
our
board
be
always
it
be
a
priceless
board
they
be
so
bright
and
so
capable
and
so
willing
to
meet
with
the
scientist
i
use
to
make
the
statement
the
biogen
scientific
advisory
board
would
go
off
to
meet
in
barbados
and
ours
would
meet
with
the
staff
in
our
building
try
to
stimulate
them
into
do
the
right
thing
i
thought
that
be
very
true
we
have
a
very
active
but
down
to
earth
scientific
advisory
board
hughes
and
a
lot
of
interaction
rathmann
oh
a
lot
of
interaction
eventually
the
scientist
would
just
as
soon
chuck
them
out
of
there
but
for
the
first
two
year
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
be
a
very
precious
relationship
hughes
what
be
it
in
the
end
that
convince
you
to
join
amgen
this
by
most
account
be
a
risky
thing
to
do
it
be
not
only
a
company
whose
future
be
a
bit
dubious
but
the
technology
hadn
t
produce
a
commercial
product
yet
rathmann
the
only
time
i
have
any
misgiving
be
when
i
go
out
to
biogen
at
the
suggestion
of
moshe
and
i
talk
to
wally
gilbert
whom
i
respect
a
lot
i
have
not
met
him
before
and
phil
ip
sharp
who
be
also
easy
to
respect
and
very
very
prominent
and
their
credential
be
incredible
they
say
george
we
ve
get
to
tell
you
you
re
fall
into
something
that
isn
t
what
you
think
winston
salser
doesn
t
tell
the
truth
the
very
thought
that
you
think
that
we
might
invest
in
amgen
be
an
example
we
have
no
plan
not
even
the
least
inkling
of
try
to
invest
in
your
company
we
would
never
consider
it
and
i
ll
tell
you
why
it
s
be
tout
around
for
month
that
charlie
yanofsky
be
on
your
scientific
board
we
know
charlie
he
s
not
on
your
scientific
board
he
doesn
t
intend
to
be
so
there
s
so
much
wrong
with
your
company
just
be
sure
you
understand
we
aren
t
go
to
be
buying
into
your
company
in
any
way
shape
or
form
that
s
true
they
told
me
winston
have
say
we
think
biogen
will
make
an
investment
in
our
company
and
that
would
be
so
great
boy
would
that
look
good
one
of
the
lead
biotech
company
invest
in
us
that
would
really
be
good
yes
well
it
would
be
good
but
it
have
zero
probability
of
happen
so
i
get
shook
up
from
that
i
thought
gee
be
i
get
into
the
kind
of
people
i
don
t
know
anything
about
and
the
kind
of
relationship
and
behavior
that
i
would
not
want
to
be
a
part
of
so
i
worried
what
be
your
question
hughes
well
what
really
grabbed
you
consider
these
doubt
rathmann
well
that
be
as
i
say
the
only
negative
because
the
thing
that
be
positive
be
i
really
do
believe
that
recombinant
dna
be
go
to
change
the
way
that
medicine
be
be
do
all
they
have
to
explain
to
me
in
the
early
day
be
that
with
recombinant
dna
you
can
make
a
truly
natural
human
protein
you
don
t
have
to
wait
for
a
human
body
to
make
it
you
don
t
have
to
harvest
it
from
cadaver
you
make
it
yourself
we
already
know
about
insulin
and
we
know
about
a
few
others
human

growth
hormone
but
what
we
can
t
even
imagine
be
all
the
way
in
which
that
capability
be
go
to
change
human
health
so
i
be
absolutely
turn
on
by
the
fundamental
science
and
its
power
ihe
only
thing
that
would
scare
me
once
in
a
while
be
if
somebody
would
say
it
really
isn
t
that
good
or
it
s
go
to
have
these
kind
of
difficulty
a
lot
of
the
real
worry
about
safety
be
already
behind
us
in
and
the
ability
to
do
everything
be
seemingly
pretty
much
in
place
that
be
an
easy
call
that
this
technology
be
go
to
be
important
the
easy
call
then
be
i
d
like
to
spend
six
month
of
my
life
to
understand
something
that
s
go
to
be
this
important
then
the
change
over
from
be
winston
s
scientific
collaborator
or
be
on
sabbatical
in
his
lab
to
run
the
company
be
strictly
because
i
have
a
chance
to
meet
these
scientist
that
be
on
the
scientific
board
they
be
the
only
people
we
have
that
be
go
to
be
with
the
company
but
they
be
wonderful
people
as
i
say
i
couldn
t
get
a
hold
of
marv
in
caruthers
from
colorado
they
call
me
initially
because
they
want
to
have
some
kind
of
recognition
for
him
the
lifetime
achievement
award
marv
deserves
it
he
s
just
a
wonderful
human
be
and
he
s
the
father
of
modem
gene
synthesis
you
could
not
synthesize
gene
effectively
today
without
use
marv
s
science
now
the
way
they
do
it
at
genentech
be
different
it
be
nowhere
near
as
good
as
marv
s
he
come
up
with
phosphoamidite
chemistry
and
it
be
wonderful
on
top
of
that
he
s
just
a
first
class
human
be
you
run
into
somebody
like
that
and
you
say
well
this
be
wonderful
flien
lee
leroy
hood
be
the
next
one
and
my
gosh
lee
hood
be
statured
beyond
belief
even
back
in
and
it
s
only
gotten
well
since
then
in
fact
he
wasn
t
even
a
member
of
the
national
academy
of
science
in
but
everybody
knew
he
would
be
same
with
marv
he
would
be
same
with
john
carbon
he
would
be
you
run
into
these
people
and
you
suddenly
say
i
m
go
to
have
an
opportunity
to
work
with
these
people
and
listen
to
their
wisdom
and
have
them
use
their
idea
in
our
company
i
mean
this
be
something
you
don
t
want
to
pas
up
now
abbott
ask
me
to
start
a
company
within
abbott
when
i
told
them
i
be
go
to
leave
that
be
hard
to
pas
up
because
the
chairman
and
president
be
woo
me
to
stay
and
they
say
they
would
do
whatever
i
want
they
would
pull
the
company
any
which
way
if
i
want
outside
investor
that
s
okay
if
i
want
to
sell
public
stock
that
s
okay
so
they
make
it
very
attractive
also
hughes
have
abbott
ever
do
anything
like
that
rathmann
well
no
they
never
have
they
have
their
own
recombinant
group
but
they
have
never
do
anything
in
the
way
of
start
a
company
no
they
have
bought
company
so
they
knew
they
could
handle
it
but
they
hadn
t
ever
start
one
that
be
tempt
but
i
suddenly
realize
that
there
be
some
caveat
that
would
make
it
very
difficult
to
be
fully
competitive
one
be
that
they
would
retain
percent
ownership
of
the
company
so
you
re
not
go
to
have
some
of
the
freewheel
that
genentech
have
you
would
be
constrain
hughes
and
you
be
not
go
to
be
rub
shoulder
with
the
top
scientist
in
the
field

rathmann
how
be
you
go
to
get
a
scientific
advisory
board
as
good
as
amgen
s
when
they
re
not
go
to
have
that
same
confidence
that
they
ve
get
all
these
freedom
and
all
of
this
upside
in
term
of
stock
value
and
so
on
it
be
not
trivial
by
that
time
people
have
gotten
rich
at
genentech
already
and
that
be
a
potential
for
attract
people
to
your
company
that
s
what
people
be
weigh
i
weigh
it
too
that
be
there
s
a
lot
of
risk
here
but
there
s
very
likely
a
very
fair
reward
who
s
to
determine
whether
the
ratio
s
right
or
not
it
might
be
that
the
reward
s
modest
and
the
risk
be
veiy
very
high
i
remember
before
i
go
to
amgen
i
do
see
three
or
four
other
opportunity
include
biogen
e
f
hutton
want
me
to
come
out
because
they
have
heard
that
i
might
leave
abbott
and
they
be
start
a
company
they
be
interested
in
solicit
a
ceo
there
be
several
others
in
these
case
it
be
clear
that
they
be
willing
to
talk
some
pretty
good
size
number
in
fact
the
ceo
of
hutton
say
to
me
well
how
much
money
do
you
think
that
you
d
really
like
to
make
from
go
into
this
kind
of
thing
i
don
t
know
what
get
into
my
head
but
i
say
well
ten
to
fifteen
million
dollar
he
say
well
that
s
probably
the
right
number
that
would
be
doable
i
didn
t
even
believe
i
have
say
it
i
mean
it
s
so
vulgar
to
think
that
you
re
take
a
job
to
get
ten
to
fifteen
million
dollar
i
mean
it
just
occur
to
me
he
be
expect
that
i
would
say
something
if
i
be
go
to
continue
this
discussion
i
well
have
an
answer
for
him
so
i
have
that
answer
i
think
if
i
have
told
joy
i
be
go
to
tell
people
i
want
to
make
fifteen
million
dollar
she
would
have
have
me
commit
hughes
mr
rathmann
what
be
you
say
about
all
this
risky
business
the
other
transition
your
husband
have
make
over
his
career
be
more
conservative
rathmann
well
it
turn
out
that
litton
be
more
unknown
than
i
ever
would
have
know
hughes
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
j
rathmann
well
it
be
just
sort
of
go
on
i
didn
t
want
to
be
left
behind
rathmann
laugh
oh
you
think
i
might
have
left
you
behind
that
s
not
very
likely
hughes
you
weren
t
concerned
that
he
be
get
into
a
really
risky
business
at
amgen
j
rathmann
i
think
it
s
funny
because
i
frequently
use
to
say
to
myself
well
i
can
always
go
out
and
get
a
job
laugh
hughes
i
understand
that
you
weren
t
particularly
enamor
of
the
idea
of
come
to
california
j
rathmann
i
be
terrify
laugh
rathmann
that
be
a
big
part
than
anything
j
rathmann
although
my
dad
s
family
all
grow
up
here
i
have
cousin
here
and
everything
but
it
be
scary
come
from
the
midwest

rathmann
hughes
tape
side
b
abbott
want
to
invest
five
million
dollar
into
amgen
when
abbott
be
go
to
invest
five
million
dollar
that
make
this
a
lot
more
real
than
before
that
it
be
abbott
a
very
conservative
company
and
a
company
that
we
really
love
they
have
be
very
good
to
me
and
now
they
be
go
to
be
involve
after
all
even
though
i
be
not
go
to
report
to
them
it
be
not
their
business
the
fact
that
they
make
that
investment
i
thought
it
really
be
one
of
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
ever
happen
to
me
do
that
give
amgen
legitimacy
in
term
of
potential
investor
well
we
do
it
all
at
one
time
our
legitimacy
come
very
quickly
we
have
to
decide
how
much
money
to
raise
and
i
say
i
think
i
would
like
to
raise
more
than
five
and
maybe
fifteen
the
venture
capitalist
start
explain
to
me
why
you
don
t
want
to
raise
too
much
you
re
much
well
off
to
get
the
rest
at
a
high
price
i
say
well
i
understand
all
that
but
i
have
a
little
bit
of
experience
in
st
paul
with
a
venture
company
and
i
decide
i
could
see
what
can
happen
here
the
guy
that
have
the
money
can
hold
back
and
hold
back
and
then
squeeze
the
bloody
heck
out
of
you
that
s
what
have
happen
to
a
small
group
in
st
paul
i
hadn
t
be
in
it
but
i
have
be
watch
them
they
have
to
go
to
the
point
where
they
didn
t
make
any
salary
for
about
six
month
it
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
the
squeeze
be
on
to
get
more
stock
for
less
money
on
the
part
of
these
investor
people
so
i
thought
no
way
i
m
not
go
to
stop
short
so
i
ask
for
fifteen
million
they
say
well
okay
go
after
any
number
you
want
we
ll
go
with
you
the
venture
capitalist
of
course
have
put
in
their
trivial
amount
each
one
be
able
to
get
thousand
of
share
for
nine
thousand
dollar
six
thousand
dollar
et
cetera
six
thousand
dollar
as
a
found
investor
i
mean
that
s
really
pretty
cautious
but
that
s
what
they
put
in
but
they
do
go
along
with
the
idea
of
raise
fifteen
million
so
when
we
put
our
offering
memorandum
together
to
their
surprise
we
have
the
offering
memorandum
print
and
out
twenty
one
day
from
the
day
when
be
hire
to
raise
fifteen
million
dollar
and
we
raise
nineteen
now
how
do
we
get
the
nineteen
that
s
the
answer
to
your
question
well
when
we
talk
abbott
into
three
and
a
half
and
tosco
into
three
we
have
six
and
a
half
out
of
the
fifteen
right
there
then
when
we
get
the
idea
that
abbott
might
be
willing
to
put
a
little
more
provide
tosco
put
some
more
in
then
tosco
go
up
to
three
and
a
half
and
abbott
go
up
to
five
so
we
have
eight
and
a
half
almost
half
the
amount
of
money
we
be
go
to
raise
in
fact
more
than
half
of
the
fifteen
we
thought
we
might
raise
that
make
a
difference
yes
that
sound
like
it
be
go
to
make
people
come
in
for
you
because
they
would
see
it
there
it
be
very
attractive
to
have
a
company
like
abbott
that
hadn
t
make
minority
investment
practically
ever
they
have
never
do
anything
like
that
put
five
million
dollar
in
that
be
a
great
testimonial
and
we
use
it
but
it
also
be
very
reassure
to
joy
and
to
me
if
everything
else
fail
we
still
have
five
million
from
abbott
and
we
have
abbott
s
support
then
tosco
which
be
line
up
by
the
venture
capitalist
be
the
oil
shale
company
and
their
three
and
a
half
that
be
a
big
nest
egg
you
ve
mention
moshe
alafi
but
there
be
others
involve
be
there
not

rathmann
there
be
four
of
them
the
first
day
we
come
out
winston
say
i
want
you
to
come

and
meet
some
people
because

leave
of
absence
myself
i
m
not
go
to

rather
have
you
get
involve
in
this
company
i
m
go
to
be
start
this
company
so
he
say
come
on
out
and
meet
these
people
we
go
to
a
place
that
s
about
six
block
from
here
and
that
be
franklin
pitch
johnson
s
home
he
be
the
head
of
asset
management
company
at
the
time
in
his
backyard
we
sat
there
with
moshe
bill
bowes
sam
wolstadter
and
pitch
those
be
the
four
venture
capitalist
that
i
met
that
first
day
in
pitch
s
backyard
with
these
huge
eucalyptus
tree
and
gorgeous
area
gorgeous
weather
yet
move
to
california
be
one
of
the
thing
we
be
least
interested
in
do
so
they
start
work
on
us
it
be
actually
the
combination
of
those
four
pitch
johnson
and
bill
bowes
be
both
very
well
know
even
in
chicago
moshe
and
sam
be
not
but
moshe
and
sam
played
a
very
active
role
in
get
us
sam
be
call
on
the
phone
every
day
and
moshe
be
suggest
the
trip
to
biogen
to
kind
of
round
out
my
interest
and
any
other
place
i
want
to
look
at
they
be
all
really
wonderful
hughes
now
moshe
of
course
have
previous
connection
with
biotech
but
have
the
others
rathmann
yes
bill
bowes
have
be
on
the
cetus
board
hughes
oh
that
s
right
rathmann
i
don
t
know
about
pitch
i
think
he
have
gotten
involve
with
some
small
company
like
monoclonal
antibody
something
like
that
hughes
be
they
easy
to
convince
that
this
be
worth
look
at
rathmann
oh
i
didn
t
have
to
convince
them
they
be
already
convince
they
come
to
convince
me
hughes
i
see
rathmann
you
be
right
amgen
be
basically
start
by
venture
capitalist
look
for
someone
to
start
a
scientific
advisory
board
they
try
schimke
and
then
they
go
on
to
winston
then
winston
line
up
a
tremendously
powerful
scientific
advisory
board
the
first
action
that
board
want
to
take
when
have
be
there
here
for
about
six
month
be
to
get
rid
of
winston
i
say
i
can
t
understand
this
you
guy
all
come
on
board
because
of
winston
and
then
you
want
to
get
rid
of
this
guy
there
s
something
funny
about
this
then
they
say
we
think
that
amgen
be
well
than
what
it
would
be
if
winston
be
go
to
be
heavily
involve
hughes
and
so
winston
be
out
rathmann
yes
he
be
out
hughes
how
do
he
react
to
that
rathmann
oh
terrible
a
terrible
experience
hughes
in
a
way
amgen
be
his
baby
wasn
t
it

rathmann
as
much
as
any
body
s
even
more
than
the
venture
capitalist
because
he
have
gotten
all
these
scientist
line
up
there
have
be
a
number
of
incident
one
of
which
be
just
a
week
before
i
be
give
this
assignment
the
one
that
happen
just
a
week
before
be
that
one
of
our
advisor
have
a
person
who
be
very
interested
in
some
of
winston
s
work
and
so
she
go
over
to
see
winston
winston
share
with
her
some
of
the
idea
of
what
he
be
work
on
she
subsequently
submit
a
paper
for
publication
and
winston
found
out
about
the
paper
get
his
hand
on
it
and
found
out
that
although
it
acknowledge
discussion
with
winston
what
she
put
in
that
paper
have
not
be
clear
by
winston
so
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
go
after
the
editor
of
the
periodical
and
say
that
they
must
not
publish
this
that
it
be
terribly
wrong
it
plagiarize
and
take
stuff
from
winston
salser
without
authority
and
so
on
our
entire
board
heard
the
story
and
be
so
angry
first
of
all
this
young
woman
be
be
abuse
in
the
sense
that
she
have
put
her
heart
and
soul
into
this
and
now
she
be
get
the
run
around
from
some
guy
play
power
politics
with
a
periodical
so
our
board
have
become
very
turn
off
by
winston
and
others
that
have
some
other
kind
of
experience
not
all
that
bad
decide
that
winston
be
not
the
person
they
want
to
be
run
the
scientific
advisory
board
we
have
one
scientific
meeting
and
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
i
say
i
want
to
talk
to
you
so
i
go
to
each
one
and
talk
to
them
and
they
all
say
we
ve
get
to
get
rid
of
winston
my
gosh
i
just
get
into
this
job
i
don
t
want
to
get
rid
of
somebody
that
s
a
terrible
idea
but
i
figure
i
have
no
choice
either
get
rid
of
him
or
we
re
go
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
board
because
they
have
now
united
in
their
belief
that
he
have
to
go
so
i
try
to
do
it
right
with
winston
but
i
didn
t
do
it
very
right
he
be
very
very
angry
hughes
well
maybe
there
be
no
way
to
make
it
right
rathmann
to
take
it
away
from
him
be
not
easy
but
winston
retain
a
large
portion
of
his
stock
include
unvested
share
hughes
so
who
step
into
his
shoe
rathmann
well
i
become
chairman
of
the
scientific
advisory
board
by
default
and
that
work
out
all
right
because
when
i
finally
about
a
year
later
hire
the
director
of
research
dan
vapnek
then
he
become
chairman
of
the
scientific
advisory
board
and
that
be
a
natural
transition
he
coordinate
the
meeting
of
the
scientific
board
and
what
they
do
hughes
how
do
you
actually
attract
the
scientist
rathmann
well
there
be
two
thing
we
need
and
then
i
ll
get
to
the
scientist
one
be
we
need
a
business
plan
or
proposal
to
raise
the
nineteen
million
dollar
we
need
a
document
that
be
go
to
loosen
up
nineteen
million
buck
although
as
i
say
the
key
thing
be
perhaps
get
abbott
lab
and
tosco
in
the
fold
that
document
be
a
good
document
and
we
put
it
together
in
less
than
three
week
when
i
walk
through
the
door
winston
say
to
me
i
want
to
put

be
a
lot
of
fun
isn
t
it
hughes
laugh
rathmann
it
be
a
real
blow
to
think
that
now
i
m
on
my
own
with
alan
but
alan
be
so
marvelous
that
it
be
not
a
hard
assignment
so
we
start
take
the
scientific
advisory
board
s
stuff
and
i
spent
about
a
solid
week
in
the
library
convert
phrase
like
what
we
ought
to
do
be
into
a
kind
of
formal
document
and
state
how
big
the
market
potential
be
and
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
to
the
market
and
how
valuable
this
would
be
i
do
all
that
on
my
own
and
then
i
come
back
to
alan
to
verify
what
we
have
to
do
in
respect
to
vilchek
and
the
nussenzweigs
and
lennart
olson
he
say
boy
you
ve
get
to
get
them
to
give
this
an
okay
so
i
say
to
winston
i
m
go
to
have
to
talk
to
these
people
to
get
their
permission
to
use
their
name
in
our
offering
memorandum
he
say
no
no
you
can
t
talk
to
them
i
say
winston
i
get
my
instruction
from
the
lawyer
i
have
to
talk
to
them
he
say
i
ve
take
care
of
all
that
i
say
well
that
s
good
i
ll
just
verify
no
you
can
t
talk
to
them
i
say
winston
you
re
tell
me
i
can
t
talk
to
them
he
say
yes
they
don
t
want
to
work
with
us
i
say
well
then
i
can
t
put
in
here
that
they
be
planning
to
work
with
us
well
they
don
t
understand
they
will
go
along
with
it
finally
if
we
put
it
in
there
winston
i
just
don
t
have
a
choice
we
re
go
to
have
to
take
their
name
out
unless
i
can
get
personal
approval
from
them

hughes
rathmann
and
we
left
one
in
lennart
olson
nice
guy
the
others
be
all
take
out
because
they
have
no
intention
of
work
with
amgen
as
you
might
have
guess
rhen
i
rephrase
the
whole
thing
and
it
sound
not
so
folksy
with
market
data
that
i
could
put
together
i
put
that
together
in
those
three
week
and
sent
it
out
it
be
a
necessary
step
once
you
raise
the
nineteen
million
and
you
re
out
there
recruiting
that
s
your
first
magnet
that
you
ve
get
the
money
the
second
be
that
you
have
a
scientific
advisory
board
and
i
know
i
work
that
one
to
the
hilt
that
be
of
course
high
risk
we
re
a
venture
we
may
not
succeed
but
i
ll
tell
you
if
you
impress
lee
hood
and
marv
caruthers
and
norm
davidson
and
marty
kline
and
john
carbon
that
you
re
a
good
guy
and
you
understand
what
you
re
do
you
ve
get
a
ticket
anywhere
in
the
world
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
because
those
people
be
preeminent
so
there
s
how
you
attract
the
scientist
it
help
that
genentech
have
create
their
first
scientific
millionaire
also
you
end
up
with
willingness
on
the
part
of
that
board
to
share
the
load
they
would
meet
with
the
scientist
when
you
want
them
to
we
would
bring
the
scientist
here
to
thousand
oak
and
then
you
have
the
local
guy
arnie
berk
be
a
young
professor
at
ucla
and
he
wasn
t
overburden
with
responsibility
so
arnie
probably
interviewed
three
out
of
four
of
our
new
candidate
lee
would
interview
some
the
other
southern
california
people
would
interview
so
you
would
bring
the
scientist
into
town
and
you
would
always
have
one
scientific
board
member
usually
two
that
they
could
get
take
to
then
you
would
have
them
meet
with
the
group
that
we
be
start
to
form
of
in
house
people
who
be
already
hire
it
be
not
a
hard
sell
and
it
gain
momentum
with
each
new
hire
remember
one
of
the
first
two
or
three
scientist
he
want
to
go
to
a
real
company
so
he
go
to
dupont
it
be
a
big
blow
i
thought
we
have
him
another
guy
that
be
marv
caruther
s
recommendation
who
have
be
really
good
at
gene
synthesis
wouldn
t
come
it
be
too
scary
for
him
so
you
lose
them
here
and
there
there
be
one
guy
i
offer
a
job
to
and
then
checked
with
lee
hood
who
say
he
work
with
the
nobel
prize
winner
whom
i
know
very
well
it
would
be
easy
for
me
to
help
do
this
he
say
i
ll
just
call
him
up
he
call
him
and
he
say
the
guy
s
no
good
so
i
have
to
go
back
to
this
guy
who
look
me
up
again
about
a
month
ago
well
we
didn
t
offer
him
a
job
because
lee
hood
have
say
no
don
t
do
it
and
i
didn
t
i
want
lee
s
attention
for
all
these
people
we
be
go
to
hire
be
not
go
to
second
guess
him
on
this
guy
interestingly
when
i
talk
to
the
nobel
prize
winner
he
didn
t
know
me
he
say
oh
great
fine
good
guy
knew
lee
have
a
more
valid
picture
than
mine
we
use
the
board
to
interview
scientist
and
help
select
and
actually
to
make
suggestion
of
people
in
their
lab
or
who
have
graduate
postdoc
from
their
lab
that
be
a
big
help
be
these
in
general
young
scientist
almost
all
of
them
be
very
very
young
there
be
about
two
or
three
come
from
company
i
don
t
know
how
we
get
them
a
lot
of
people
come
by
word
of
mouth
don
t
think
we
do
any
particular
advertising
dennis
fenton
for
example
one
of
our
first
hire
come
from
pfizer
he
set
up
a
fermentation
capability
by
the
second
day
he
be
there
in
a
closet
no
less
so
he
be
right
in
tune
with
the
need
of
a
young
biotech
company
he
be
really
great
he
be
really
wonderful

hughes
be
it
a
consideration
that
the
scientist
come
with
a
technology
that
the
company
need
rathmann
no
nobody
come
with
technology
to
our
company
as
far
as
i
can
say
we
would
hire
people
on
a
skill
basis
molecular
biologist
in
general
cell
biologist
some
immunologist
some
biochemist
some
yet
there
be
nobody
that
be
hire
because
they
brought
a
unique
technology
to
the
company
we
be
lucky
when
we
have
a
really
good
match
we
be
put
project
together
as
we
be
put
the
people
together
so
we
didn
t
have
a
project
wait
that
say
i
ve
get
to
have
an
immunologist
to
get
the
immunologist
you
say
what
s
a
good
project
to
put
him
on
and
what
project
do
we
want
to
start
when
i
think
about
it
it
s
a
horrendous
task
i
d
be
scar
to
death
to
try
and
do
that
today
i
know
too
much
but
at
the
time
we
just
charge
ahead
start
put
people
into
different
job
end
of
session

hughes
rathmann
hughes
rathmann
interview
october
tape
side
a
dr
rathmann
to
continue
with
the
foundation
of
amgen
we
talk
about
the
scientific
advisory
board
but
we
didn
t
talk
about
the
board
of
director
who
be
on
it
and
how
do
they
function
fhe
board
of
director
include
a
number
of
people
that
have
participate
in
the
early
think
of
form
amgen
and
that
include
bill
bowes
and
pitch
johnson
and
then
in
addition
there
be
ray
baddour
a
chemical
engineering
professor
at
mit
he
have
be
important
in
figure
out
that
maybe
tosco
the
oil
shale
company
would
invest
in
amgen
and
they
do
so
he
have
a
contact
there
that
get
him
involve
then
of
course
he
be
clearly
a
very
good
fit
a
professor
in
chemical
engineering
and
a
very
very
bright
guy
we
have
a
couple
of
others
that
left
very
soon
include
don
longman
he
have
be
the
executive
vice
president
of
schering
plough
i
think
he
have
be
the
president
of
the
schering
corporation
before
it
merge
to
become
schering
plough
he
be
suppose
to
be
bring
us
overseas
contact
and
other
thing
he
stayed
on
the
board
he
end
up
with
fifteen
thousand
share
of
founder
stock
but
he
never
be
involve
again
and
shortly
after
we
go
public
he
sell
every
single
one
of
his
share
that
be
three
year
later
however
he
have
not
participate
in
the
company
so
i
think
the
best
way
to
look
at
this
be
that
there
will
always
be
several
people
who
be
not
really
commit
to
be
on
the
board
that
won
t
stay
we
also
have
in
the
found
group
of
the
company
the
management
the
decision
that
i
have
to
reach
of
become
ceo
and
change
job
and
everything
else
i
have
come
to
california
the
whole
thing
take
about
three
month
in
that
time
they
begin
to
worry
that
they
didn
t
have
a
ceo
so
they
line
up
a
person
that
they
be
go
to
call
the
executive
vice
president
joe
rubenfeld
so
he
be
one
of
the
key
first
individual
there
he
be
literally
retain
by
the
company
to
become
ceo
if
i
didn
t
take
it
then
when
i
take
it
i
look
at
the
situation
and
i
checked
into
him
and
i
didn
t
find
that
he
be
the
guy
that
i
want
to
have
as
my
number
two
man
so
we
have
a
part
of
way
at
that
point
he
be
another
person
involve
in
the
very
early
day
that
you
wouldn
t
find
in
practically
any
of
the
literature
don
longman
and
joe
rubenfeld
moshe
alafi
stayed
as
an
advisor
but
not
on
the
board
cooley
godward
have
be
arrange
by
bill
bow
e
to
be
our
law
firm
that
be
the
deal
in
which
we
give
them
a
chunk
of
stock
and
they
operate
free
of
charge
for
a
couple
of
year
that
be
very
standa
d
at
the
time
so
that
they
could
get
some
stock
they
be
not
take
money
out
of
your
treasury
and
yet
you
be
able
to
use
them
a
very
very
fine
firm
they
have
be
attorney
for
genentech
also
alan
mendelson
be
from
cooley
godward
wasn
t
he
yes
he
be
and
he
be
dealt
to
me
right
away
as
the
guy
that
would
interface
in
get
the
offering
memorandum
he
w
as
superb
he
be
really
superb
press
the
founder
to
make
sure
that
i
have
an
audit
firm
line
up
because
they
kept
say
we
can
always
do
that
we
be
write
this
memorandum
and
we
have
to
pick
them
bill
bowes
say
well
it
ll
be
arthur
young
i
say
that
s
fine
he
give
me
a
name
up
in
san
rancisco
but
very
shortly
that
guy
correctly
decide
i
should
have
someone
down
in
los
angeles
a
very
junior
not
a
very
nice
term
but
a
relatively
junior
partner
in
fact
i
doubt
if
he
be
a
partner
at
that
time
gary
shaher
be
then

give
to
me
to
work
out
the
detail
of
what
we
should
put
in
the
offering
memorandum
arthur
young
be
willing
to
go
this
far
that
they
would
be
our
auditor
but
even
to
say
just
that
they
have
to
audit
everything
we
have
do
up
until
that
time
which
be
largely
shoebox
full
of
checkbook
in
the
audit
that
they
do
they
couldn
t
reconcile
it
by
about
forty
thousand
dollar
it
turn
out
that
two
deposit
have
be
write
as
check
cashed
so
it
be
actually
a
forty
thousand
dollar
swing
it
take
him
a
long
time
to
sort
this
out
so
he
work
over
these
shoebox
and
come
up
with
the
idea
that
we
be
very
clean
and
every
thing
be
fine
then
arthur
young
would
sign
off
and
we
then
have
our
auditor
the
only
statement
be
that
they
would
probably
be
our
auditor
or
they
be
intend
to
be
our
auditor
or
some
carefully
hedge
statement
hughes
be
this
just
standard
due
diligence
or
do
you
think
that
they
be
question
this
new
firm
rathmann
no
i
think
it
be
purely
standard
due
diligence
you
ve
get
to
make
the
book
balance
when
you
start
otherwise
you
aren
t
sure
where
you
be
i
m
sure
he
be
astonish
at
what
the
book
be
they
be
literally
a
shoebox
full
of
cashed
check
and
a
lot
of
informal
stuff
you
couldn
t
always
tell
why
check
be
write
it
take
about
two
week
and
that
seem
like
no
time
at
all
except
that
i
start
on
october
i
and
i
want
that
document
out
by
october
thought
i
would
have
it
out
even
before
then
the
last
ten
day
be
all
hung
up
with
arthur
young
wonder
why
the
book
didn
t
look
quite
right
there
be
nothing
nefarious
nothing
improper
it
wasn
t
the
typical
scandal
about
people
run
off
with
something
or
other
everything
be
straightforward
it
be
just
that
it
be
rather
casually
do
and
relatively
crude
but
they
sign
off
on
it
and
we
immediately
go
to
press
and
put
out
our
offering
memorandum
to
state
that
they
be
go
to
be
our
auditor
they
wouldn
t
be
our
auditor
until
they
be
sure
that
thing
have
be
resolve
hughes
how
do
bill
rutter
fit
into
this
i
know
he
end
up
on
your
board
rathmann
the
scientific
advisory
board
hughes
yes
the
scientific
advisory
board
i
read
something
that
make
me
think
that
at
one
point
he
have
be
offer
the
position
of
ceo
rathmann
i
don
t
know
that
it
would
have
be
a
smart
move
he
s
a
very
good
guy
hughes
it
must
have
be
before
you
come
into
the
picture
rathmann
yes
it
wasn
t
after
i
come
hughes
there
be
talk
then
of
found
an
amgen
north
rathmann
yes
that
be
my
idea
when
i
get
there
bill
rutter
be
on
the
scientific
advisory
board
along
with
about
five
or
six
others
we
have
one
meeting
and
i
be
very
impressed
i
would
have
say
of
the
people
that
participate
in
that
meeting
he
be
as
valuable
or
possibly
the
most
valuable
of
all
the
participant
i
have
heard
of
bill
because
he
have
be
a
consultant
for
abbott
and
he
have
resign
that
consultantship
at
one
point
which
be
an
ominous
part
of
his
history
that
here
he
be
a
consultant
for
abbott
and
much
to
their
surprise
suddenly
resigns

i
iughes
do
you
know
why
rathmann
he
be
not
satisfied
that
abbott
be
place
proper
emphasis
on
the
science
for
example
their
board
be
pure
business
and
i
m
sure
he
have
some
suggestion
that
be
ignore
he
decide
this
be
a
waste
of
time
now
i
don
t
know
all
that
all
know
be
that
he
resign
since
his
tie
to
abbott
be
through
a
man
who
report
to
me
i
picked
up
a
bag
of
embarrassment
because
suddenly
i
m
get
a
copy
of
this
letter
say
i
no
longer
want
to
be
a
consultant
for
abbott
a
little
bit
of
a
lecture
in
there
but
not
much
but
his
lecture
be
that
abbott
just
wasn
t
place
the
proper
emphasis
on
science
he
be
right
they
have
shift
over
to
a
much
more
commercial
focus
hughes
how
specifically
be
he
valuable
to
you
in
those
day
rathmann
well
one
of
the
first
program
that
we
be
try
to
figure
out
how
to
do
be
to
do
something
in
hepatitis
vaccine
there
already
be
one
emerge
from
the
combination
of
oh
it
hadn
t
come
out
yet
merck
have
indicate
that
they
be
go
to
have
a
hepatitis
vaccine
but
i
don
t
think
it
have
emerge
yet
we
thought
we
be
in
pretty
good
shape
we
could
get
the
clone
of
the
hepatitis
surface
antigen
and
we
could
get
expression
perhaps
because
w
e
have
a
lot
of
good
system
for
express
protein
it
do
turn
out
to
be
an
interest
challenge
because
the
most
natural
thing
to
do
with
the
hepatitis
surface
antigen
be
to
make
it
in
e
coli
but
you
can
t
it
doesn
t
work
so
we
have
a
backup
there
for
yeast
on
our
scientific
board
we
have
bill
rutter
who
knew
how
to
get
his
hand
on
a
clone
and
we
have
john
carbon
who
be
one
of
the
world
leader
in
yeast
expression
so
as
soon
as
these
guy
get
together
they
get
the
idea
let
s
do
hepatitis
vaccine
hughes
wasn
t
it
a
hepatitis
b
clone
that
you
have
bought
from
winston
salser
rathmann
bought
one
from
winston
salser
but
wouldn
t
be
able
to
put
that
into
the
equation
because
we
didn
t
own
it
exclusively
i
bought
some
of
it
but
not
all
of
it
obviously
so
that
would
have
help
get
the
program
start
right
but
what
actually
happen
be
that
about
that
time
we
have
take
very
seriously
change
the
structure
of
amgen
in
way
that
might
make
bill
happier
because
he
be
rumble
around
that
it
wasn
t
quite
what
he
want
in
particular
he
then
share
his
dream
with
me
which
thought
be
impractical
by
this
time
we
have
raise
the
nineteen
million
dollar
and
i
have
laid
out
a
plan
for
how
to
spend
it
over
a
four
year
period
and
felt
that
i
be
a
bit
lock
in
to
what
i
told
people
when
i
get
their
money
bill
knew
that
nineteen
million
be
an
awful
lot
of
money
and
it
be
kind
of
too
bad
to
waste
it
on
a
bunch
of
different
project
over
a
long
time
period
why
don
t
we
do
something
really
big
why
don
t
we
sign
on
to
amgen
every
top
west
coast
molecular
biologist
and
he
knew
them
all
and
they
all
like
him
he
would
do
another
sweep
of
the
west
coast
much
like
winston
salser
have
do
to
put
the
scientific
board
together
except
this
time
these
people
be
go
to
be
part
of
the
company
and
they
re
go
to
be
oh
i
can
t
even
name
all
of
them
there
be
at
least
ten
the
most
prominent
west
coast
biologist
and
molecular
biologist
that
be
bill
s
idea
that
we
d
just
go
get
these
guy
i
say
oh
bill
that
s
just
so
ambitious
i
feel
like
i
could
lose
the
whole
company
here
because
the
investor
would
say
they
have
be
stabbed
in
the
back
their
money
s
go
to
be
go
in
about
six
month
instead
of
four
year
they
have
nothing
to
say
about
how
we
re
go
to
move
the
company
in
a
new
direction
this
be
really

scary
to
me
it
may
be
a
well
plan
than
what
we
ve
get
but
to
me
it
s
a
long
shot
plan
and
i
don
t
think
i
m
go
to
do
it
he
be
very
disappointed
but
then
i
decide
that
i
want
bill
because
i
thought
he
be
one
of
the
best
member
of
the
board
so
i
say
well
what
we
can
do
bill
be
we
can
make
a
big
place
for
you
in
the
company
we
ll
split
the
location
and
we
ll
have
one
in
san
francisco
and
one
down
here
and
you
can
run
the
san
francisco
operation
that
intrigue
him
quite
a
bit
and
he
watch
us
move
and
i
think
he
be
impressed
that
it
take
a
matter
of
day
and
we
d
have
an
option
on
lease
property
up
in
san
francisco
we
have
start
to
talk
to
all
of
the
scientist
that
be
work
with
bill
rutter
at
the
time
and
in
fact
have
sign
up
about
percent
of
his
lab
as
amgen
employee
hughes
so
that
meant
ed
penhoet
and
pablo
valenzuela
rathmann
valenzuela
and
leslie
rawls
and
graeme
bell
and
there
be
a
whole
bunch
that
later
on
become
chiron
in
a
way
bill
be
thrill
that
we
be
move
as
fast
as
we
be
but
in
another
sense
the
message
to
bill
rutter
be
i
can
do
this
so
you
do
a
temporaiy
lease
on
something
and
you
don
t
spend
a
lot
of
money
until
you
take
it
over
and
you
do
this
and
you
do
that
and
all
the
sudden
you
ve
get
a
real
company
so
he
defect
we
have
a
lot
of
discussion
and
the
pivotal
decision
be
that
i
do
not
want
to
hire
every
west
coast
biologist
and
have
the
effort
scatter
all
over
the
west
coast
each
one
would
probably
start
his
own
r
d
program
the
discipline
at
m
be
you
put
your
research
in
one
place
if
you
need
multidisciplines
you
put
them
in
one
place
it
benefit
you
because
you
will
get
interaction
that
be
all
favorable
decide
to
decompartmentalize
and
fragment
r
d
be
just
plain
wrong
it
be
almost
immoral
to
me
at
that
point
because
the
teaching
you
learn
earlier
be
more
sacred
than
probably
any
other
kind
of
teach
that
be
the
teach
that
i
be
adhere
to
i
say
no
we
re
not
go
to
start
place
all
over
the
west
coast
i
do
not
like
the
change
in
the
strategy
that
would
probably
confuse
people
and
i
just
resist
it
didn
t
take
long
for
bill
to
decide
he
would
splinter
off
and
become
another
company
and
that
would
be
chiron
hughes
it
s
interest
that
chiron
didn
t
do
that
either
rathmann
yes
it
be
a
grand
plan
that
really
be
not
viable
it
could
have
be
it
might
have
be
but
it
be
such
long
odds
you
have
a
very
good
chance
of
do
it
the
straightforward
way
and
why
take
the
chance
that
you
bum
up
so
much
money
so
fast
that
you
run
out
of
money
hughes
it
be
the
early
biogen
model
wasn
t
it
rathmann
if
there
be
any
model
that
would
have
be
it
yes
that
be
what
they
really
do
they
do
fund
work
at
each
one
of
the
place
institution
in
which
biogen
scientific
board
member
be
locate
yes
i
guess
you
could
say
it
be
the
biogen
model
with
the
special
twist
at
biogen
that
the
scientific
board
have
great
power
probably
more
power
than
the
ceo
and
that
be
something
you
might
or
you
might
not
have
imitate
yes
it
would
be
similar
to
the
biogen
model
hughes
do
you
ever
have
any
concern
about
control
bill
rutter

rathmann
hughes
rathmann
hughes
rathmann
control
well
he
s
a
very
strong
personality
he
be
accomplish
you
ve
already
say
that
you
be
impressed
by
his
scientific
expertise
well
it
turn
out
that
i
didn
t
control
him
he
start
chiron
but
you
didn
t
worry
about
that
part
of
it
when
you
be
consider
him
for
amgen
no
well
assume
that
he
be
on
board
and
be
go
to
do
the
thing
we
have
plan
together
we
have
a
lot
of
walk
along
the
beach
of
san
francisco
and
kind
of
laid
out
what
might
happen
but
there
be
always
a
velvet
fist
there
that
if
he
didn
t
gel
what
he
want
he
be
certainly
prepared
to
defect
i
saw
that
i
thought
we
d
pull
everything
together
but
it
become
apparent
that
i
couldn
t
match
the
situation
of
his
run
the
company
that
be
just
not
possible
now
we
have
one
serious
setback
which
really
decide
the
thing
we
have
decide
to
start
to
bring
the
north
and
the
south
together
so
we
would
pay
for
have
all
of
bill
s
scientist
or
at
least
six
of
the
candidate
come
down
to
thousand
oak
and
get
acquaint
with
the
thousand
oak
people
and
start
to
lay
out
how
we
be
go
to
run
this
company
it
be
a
terrible
mistake
i
just
played
it
by
ear
and
i
didn
t
do
the
pivotal
thing
at
all
i
should
have
arrange
for
the
travel
of
these
people
to
come
to
thousand
oak
told
people
in
thousand
oak
that
there
be
a
group
that
be
be
form
to
be
amgen
north
or
a
san
francisco
branch
or
a
division
or
whatever
let
s
see
whether
we
can
t
get
some
excite
synergy
between
these
group
they
get
down
there
and
it
be
an
absolute
disaster
because
they
come
down
there
to
advise
the
people
in
thousand
oak
that
the
real
center
of
everything
be
go
to
be
san
francisco
thousand
oak
scientist
be
there
to
tell
them
that
they
be
happy
to
have
a
spur
up
there
in
san
francisco
but
that
the
real
center
of
amgen
be
and
would
continue
to
be
thousand
oak
that
clash
be
inevitable
how
i
set
it
up
be
that
each
side
be
suppose
to
give
its
input
but
there
be
nothing
to
focus
on
we
want
to
stay
together
as
one
no
sir
the
most
important
to
amgen
scientist
be
the
importance
of
thousand
oak
and
what
be
most
important
to
the
other
group
be
the
importance
of
san
francisco
so
even
though
we
have
start
to
move
ahead
i
lease
the
space
on
an
option
basis
and
all
these
people
sign
up
it
evaporate
right
then
and
there
there
wasn
t
a
single
one
of
bill
s
people
that
have
any
interest
whatsoever
in
become
the
distant
arm
of
amgen
headquarters
in
thousand
oak
and
there
wasn
t
a
single
soul
in
thousand
oak
that
be
fascinate
by
any
of
the
people
that
might
locate
in
san
francisco
and
think
that
they
be
run
the
company
that
s
when
bill
announce
that
he
be
go
to
start
chiron
interestingly
enough
several
year
later
this
be
more
than
a
coincidence
we
have
both
ripen
a
bit
by
the
summer
of
and
we
both
decide
chiron
independently
from
amgen
that
we
each
would
go
public
we
make
our
decision
and
move
very
fast
and
we
actually
go
public
june
in
what
be
a
boom
market
up
until
april
in
june
it
be
get
pretty
sick
but
we
raise
forty
three
million
dollar
and
be
launch
bill
rutter
be
rush
to
do
the
same
but
his
timeframe
turn
out
to
be
about
the
first
or
second
week
of
july
two
week
after
us
he
wasn
t
very
grateful
to
us
for
have
slam
the
window
shut
and
leave
no
financing
worth
anything
so
he

hughes
rathmann
end
up
take
half
as
much
money
at
half
the
price
to
go
public
although
it
be
evolve
during
the
early
summer
on
june
the
market
slam
we
sell
our
stock
at
eighteen
dollar
a
share
and
we
be
over
subscribed
a
half
hour
later
it
be
sixteen
dollar
a
share
shortly
after
that
it
be
nine
dollar
a
share
the
market
just
collapse
biogen
have
raise
a
lot
of
money
in
the
spring
and
they
too
have
suffer
a
little
bit
of
a
relapse
as
they
be
do
it
although
they
be
very
buoyant
and
everything
be
very
positive
if
you
analyze
the
detail
thing
be
a
lot
more
positive
at
the
begin
of
their
campaign
than
at
the
end
so
thing
have
already
become
a
little
taint
and
then
we
just
wreck
it
the
way
our
offering
be
do
be
so
bad
the
people
run
our
offering
smith
barney
have
have
no
experience
in
biotech
yet
they
didn
t
realize
that
many
of
the
people
that
they
be
put
a
lot
of
share
to
have
no
intention
of
hold
onto
those
share
they
be
go
to
turn
them
over
and
make
a
quick
profit
and
that
s
why
the
sixteen
dollar
price
be
reach
in
an
hour
and
a
half
their
idea
be
you
get
these
share
for
eighteen
and
then
you
sell
them
for
twenty
two
or
twenty
five
or
more
and
if
the
market
s
collapse
you
get
out
even
quicker
because
you
re
afraid
of
where
it
might
be
go
that
s
what
happen
to
us
we
didn
t
hit
our
offering
price
for
about
two
and
a
half
year
why
do
you
choose
smith
barney
when
they
hadn
t
have
experience
with
biotech
well
that
s
a
very
good
question
and
it
be
a
very
clear
answer
what
we
be
really
do
at
amgen
to
raise
money
be
we
be
follow
the
pattern
of
genentech
that
be
to
visit
company
all
around
the
world
and
see
if
you
can
t
get
some
company
interested
enough
to
make
an
equity
offering
a
major
r
d
partnership
some
kind
of
a
joint
venture
or
something
else
so
you
re
try
to
get
the
lead
pharmaceutical
company
as
an
ally
and
finance
so
you
don
t
have
to
use
your
treasury
money
you
finance
thing
with
what
they
pay
you
in
the
way
of
milestone
and
entry
fee
and
so
on
so
we
be
follow
just
exactly
that
pattern
we
be
find
it
increasingly
difficult
in
some
respect
thanks
to
genentech
because
they
have
go
into
the
japanese
marketplace
promise
a
lot
didn
t
deliver
much
and
cost
a
lot
of
money
so
we
be
after
the
fact
kind
of
a
second
wave
and
that
wave
didn
t
have
much
steam
it
be
immediately
apparent
that
a
lot
of
the
company
have
become
disenchant
with
the
genentech
equation
and
that
s
the
one
we
be
try
to
exercise
so
we
found
out
that
we
couldn
t
close
on
any
major
deal
with
anybody
and
we
be
a
little
behind
the
power
curve
in
other
word
when
we
thought
we
have
an
interest
new
molecule
we
hadn
t
make
any
yet
we
hadn
t
purify
it
yet
that
be
the
next
thing
they
always
want
they
always
want
the
thing
we
didn
t
have
yet
so
we
would
go
back
and
forth
with
ajinamoto
and
takeda
and
green
cross
and
a
lot
of
japanese
firm
and
meanwhile
a
couple
of
us
be
go
to
europe
a
couple
of
our
team
not
me
be
try
to
get
the
big
company
in
europe
to
pay
attention
and
they
be
strike
out
then
we
go
in
the
fall
of
to
johnson
and
johnson
and
that
turn
out
to
be
very
unfortunate
timing
because
it
be
september
of
and
they
be
all
totally
distract
with
the
tylenol
crisis
as
you
might
remember
tylenol
be
kill
people
because
somebody
put
stuff
in
the
pill
the
meeting
be
a
vast
meeting
with
all
the
right
president
and
everything
that
be
orchestrate
well
but
be
futile
because
they
have
other
thing
on
their
mind
one
of
our
last
hope
be
for
j
j
johnson
and
johnson
to
make
a
big
investment
or
something
they
be
not
interested

so
then
we
thought
about
our
situation
if
we
didn
t
change
anything
we
would
run
out
of
money
by
september
of
some
of
the
member
of
the
board
say
we
want
to
see
your
contingency
plan
since
you
re
go
to
run
out
in
september
of
we
want
to
see
what
you
re
go
to
do
each
month
to
stretch
out
those
month
and
do
some
conservative
cut
and
all
the
rest
i
look
at
that
and
thought
jeez
i
just
put
this
team
together
to
start
to
send
people
home
that
would
just
have
a
devastate
effect
on
the
company
it
could
be
do
i
suppose
you
could
do
anything
but
just
thought
that
be
a
terrible
idea
by
this
time
i
have
hire
gordon
binder
as
my
chief
financial
officer
say
gordon
you
ve
get
to
figure
out
other
solution
than
yield
to
the
pressure
of
the
board
that
we
should
have
a
contingency
plan
because
i
can
see
where
it
s
go
he
say
well
let
me
work
out
the
number
so
he
work
out
the
number
and
in
fact
he
work
them
to
show
the
follow
if
we
start
cut
and
cut
at
a
reasonable
pace
we
w
ould
last
until
december
of
but
we
would
be
out
of
people
and
out
of
money
that
wasn
t
a
happy
outlook
gordon
say
that
s
the
way
it
look
and
i
say
well
maybe
we
can
talk
the
board
out
of
the
contingency
plan
if
we
have
a
well
plan
that
would
be
that
we
would
have
another
way
to
raise
money
like
do
a
public
offering
now
genentech
have
have
their
public
offering
in
and
their
stock
have
go
up
quite
a
bit
since
that
time
though
not
as
high
as
it
be
right
during
the
offering
when
it
spurt
out
of
sight
but
the
precedent
of
be
a
public
company
be
pretty
attractive
so
we
decide
to
do
that
we
would
become
a
public
company
well
the
board
didn
t
get
talk
out
of
its
contingency
plan
they
say
you
want
to
go
be
a
public
company
why
we
think
you
re
smoking
dope
and
you
well
have
your
contingency
plan
anyway
hughes
why
do
they
think
you
be
smoking
dope
rathmann
the
company
didn
t
have
anything
yet
we
really
be
struggle
to
try
to
say
that
we
have
do
anything
we
be
very
young
we
start
our
first
research
with
a
couple
of
people
in
the
spring
of
and
it
be
now
december
of
you
really
be
hard
press
to
say
you
have
make
any
remarkable
discovery
we
certainly
didn
t
own
anything
we
didn
t
have
epo
we
didn
t
have
gcsf
later
know
as
epogen
and
nupogen
we
have
this
plan
for
hepatitis
vaccine
but
by
that
time
merck
and
chiron
have
gotten
together
and
they
have
one
so
the
best
we
have
be
a
poor
second
the
animal
program
that
we
have
hadn
t
go
anywhere
there
wasn
t
any
real
hope
for
a
lot
of
these
vaccine
for
animal
because
the
farmer
be
put
huge
pressure
on
the
pricing
and
you
couldn
t
get
what
you
need
the
chemical
program
hadn
t
gotten
off
the
ground
yet
we
didn
t
have
any
evidence
that
we
could
make
chemical
cheaper
than
the
usual
way
of
make
chemical
we
have
an
early
diagnostic
program
at
abbott
but
they
have
total
control
of
that
so
what
be
we
go
to
have
hughes
so
the
ipo
be
a
desperation
move
rathmann
yes
it
be
the
only
thing
be
that
by
the
summer
we
do
have
some
thing
to
talk
about
and
we
played
them
very
heavily
but
as
of
december
they
weren
t
too
far
off
when
the
board
say
you
re
smoking
dope
we
say
well
come
on
guy
we
need
a
little
more
help
than
that
at
fred
frank
s
suggestion
we
look
at
another
realm
of
financing
tape
interruption
fred
frank
say
you
need
money
you
raise
nineteen
million
but
it
s
go
to
be
go
by
the
summer
of
so
between
now
and
then
all
we

rathmann
hughes
rdihmann
hughes
rathmann
have
to
do
be
raise
five
million
dollar
from
the
original
investor
so
i
go
to
our
first
round
investor
most
of
whom
where
on
our
board
and
say
look
if
you
put
in
one
for
four
or
one
for
five
we
ll
be
able
to
raise
five
million
and
you
ll
help
us
attract
more
our
board
receive
this
proposal
in
total
silence
tape
side
bj
so
i
say
this
be
a
proposal
by
fred
frank
a
really
respect
financial
wizard
what
we
need
to
do
now
be
to
get
everybody
together
and
if
we
could
get
start
with
an
investment
of
maybe
one
dollar
for
every
four
or
five
and
it
be
dead
silent
i
never
get
a
no
i
didn
t
get
a
yes
i
didn
t
get
a
maybe
it
be
just
that
there
wasn
t
anybody
in
that
room
that
want
more
stock
in
there
be
nobody
in
that
room
that
have
any
appetite
for
any
far
investment
in
this
company
at
this
stage
do
your
heart
sink
i
be
very
shock
because
i
thought
fred
frank
s
name
would
mean
a
lot
i
be
not
try
to
push
for
more
investment
this
be
fred
frank
s
suggestion
that
go
over
like
a
thud
so
gordon
and
i
have
a
talk
after
that
and
say
how
be
we
go
to
raise
the
money
gordon
say
i
think
we
ve
get
to
face
reality
we
re
not
get
it
out
of
other
company
we
re
not
get
it
out
of
investor
there
s
only
one
possibility
we
have
to
go
public
well
when
you
do
something
that
desperate
why
the
board
say
we
be
smoking
dope
because
you
really
come
to
that
conclusion
by
default
you
didn
t
have
any
good
reason
except
that
you
knew
that
nothing
else
be
work
that
s
not
a
very
good
reason
so
gordon
say
george
i
know
the
people
at
smith
barney
i
think
i
could
get
them
to
agree
to
be
our
banker
so
when
we
finally
hit
the
board
with
the
idea
that
we
want
to
go
public
gordon
s
proposal
be
that
the
lead
banker
would
be
smith
barney
because
he
have
friend
and
he
d
gotten
a
kind
of
a
partial
yes
out
of
them
well
then
bill
bowes
say
if
you
get
smith
barney
i
think
i
could
get
dean
witter
and
maybe
montgomery
to
be
interested
and
why
don
t
we
pursue
that
so
we
say
at
least
we
want
authority
to
explore
this
we
re
not
go
to
ask
the
board
for
approval
to
go
public
that
s
a
long
way
away
but
we
don
t
want
somebody
think
that
we
re
off
the
wall
here
we
want
you
to
at
least
support
the
idea
that
we
re
go
to
explore
this
and
they
say
okay
you
can
explore
it
all
you
want
but
i
don
t
think
you
will
get
very
far
so
we
lock
onto
smith
barney
and
we
found
that
dean
witter
and
montgomery
be
willing
to
join
in
on
the
offering
by
the
next
board
meeting
which
be
march
we
say
we
would
like
to
go
ahead
with
three
banker
what
turn
them
towards
amgen
what
be
you
offering
at
that
point
i
suspect
more
than
anything
else
we
have
a
lot
of
different
pitch
we
kind
of
figure
out
the
idea
that
we
be
the
second
generation
we
weren
t
biogen
and
we
weren
t
genentech
therefore
we
obviously
weren
t
first
generation
so
we
be
second
generation
as
a
second
generation
company
we
be
do
thing
differently
one
be
we
have
a
very
powerful
gene
synthesis
capability
which
right
up
to
that
point
be
precious
within
about
two
year
apparatus
be
come
up
and
you
could
do
your
gene
synthesis
in
the
kitchen
but
right
then
that
be
very
valuable
we
also
have
a
very
broad
portfolio
and
although
that
be
very
suspicious
to
some
people
a
lot
of
people

be
rather
impressed
by
the
fact
that
if
this
doesn
t
work
you
ve
get
that
and
if
that
doesn
t
work
you
ve
get
that
and
so
on
and
so
ibrth
in
many
way
we
mimicked
genentech
so
we
have
animal
program
some
chemical
program
diagnostic
program
and
some
pharmaceutical
program
so
it
look
as
though
we
be
unleash
second
generation
technology
across
the
board
and
there
be
a
lot
of
potential
payoff
hie
other
thing
that
we
actually
do
talk
about
in
the
early
part
of
be
very
limited
that
s
what
the
board
saw
you
really
aren
t
ready
you
haven
t
get
much
to
talk
about
except
that
you
ve
spent
twelve
or
thirteen
million
out
of
nineteen
million
and
so
you
must
have
do
something
with
it
in
those
day
by
the
way
there
be
some
logic
in
that
that
be
that
the
value
of
what
your
company
be
some
percentage
of
what
you
d
spent
hughes
even
though
there
wasn
t
a
product
rathmann
even
though
there
wasn
t
a
product
even
more
specious
be
the
value
of
a
ph
d
on
your
payroll
a
ph
d
be
very
precious
it
suggest
that
you
d
corner
some
real
talent
so
there
be
actually
calculation
at
that
time
of
a
market
value
per
ph
d
you
would
compare
yourself
with
the
other
guy
and
i
suppose
if
you
think
about
it
that
way
genentech
s
market
value
be
about
seventy
million
dollar
they
probably
have
seventy
ph
d
s
the
go
rate
be
a
million
dollar
per
ph
d
we
have
probably
twenty
ph
d
s
we
didn
t
know
what
market
cap
we
would
shoot
for
but
it
be
about
two
hundred
million
when
we
go
out
so
we
have
a
pretty
good
yield
per
ph
d
but
it
be
mostly
because
the
market
warm
up
there
for
quite
a
while
during
then
it
cool
off
what
we
offer
these
people
be
in
a
warm
market
they
be
look
for
a
piece
of
property
with
promise
but
as
it
start
to
cool
off
of
course
they
ll
turn
their
back
there
be
no
long
term
friend
in
this
business
hughes
be
you
talk
at
that
point
about
become
eventually
a
fully
integrate
pharmaceutical
company
rathmann
no
we
didn
t
talk
that
way
and
that
be
largely
because
on
our
board
be
an
executive
vice
president
of
abbott
lab
kirk
raab
there
be
two
phrase
that
be
forbidden
at
our
board
meeting
i
ll
tell
you
it
all
change
but
at
the
begin
there
be
two
phrase
one
be
well
genentech
do
this
or
this
the
classic
pharmaceutical
mentality
be
that
genentech
be
a
fly
by
night
it
wasn
t
go
anywhere
so
don
t
give
us
that
crap
that
because
they
re
do
it
it
s
worth
do
not
quite
that
strong
but
pretty
close
then
the
other
one
be
we
want
to
be
a
pharmaceutical
company
then
we
would
get
the
lecture
from
abbott
you
don
t
have
any
idea
what
be
a
pharmaceutical
company
be
you
don
t
know
how
much
you
re
go
to
have
to
spend
and
how
much
you
re
go
to
have
to
do
and
how
many
people
you
re
go
to
have
to
add
it
s
a
mile
wide
problem
you
ve
get
you
re
nut
to
even
talk
about
it
so
those
be
two
thing
i
learn
not
to
talk
about
at
the
board
meeting
but
it
be
inhibit
too
because
if
you
re
not
go
to
be
a
genentech
and
you
re
not
go
to
be
a
fully
integrate
pharmaceutical
company
hughes
what
be
you
rathmann
a
loser

hughes
genentech
have
do
more
at
that
point
than
any
other
biotech
company
why
be
abbott
on
your
board
rathmann
well
abbott
put
in
five
million
dollar
hughes
so
they
have
to
be
on
the
board
rathmann
yes
they
want
to
be
on
the
board
and
they
also
want
to
watch
their
investment
so
they
have
a
right
to
be
on
the
board
and
they
have
an
interest
in
be
on
the
board
abbott
put
the
five
million
dollar
in
i
have
to
say
because
of
me
i
have
my
track
record
at
abbott
i
go
after
them
hammer
and
tongs
and
told
them
great
thing
that
could
be
do
by
biotech
which
be
all
true
but
in
the
early
day
more
visionary
than
they
be
reality
hughes
their
opinion
of
genentech
make
one
wonder
if
they
really
thought
that
their
five
million
in
amgen
be
go
to
get
them
very
far
rathmann
very
good
point
that
attitude
be
pretty
chill
how
long
be
these
guy
go
to
be
my
friend
before
we
actually
go
public
we
knew
we
have
to
figure
out
something
in
the
way
of
a
relationship
with
a
company
and
the
closest
company
at
that
point
be
abbott
we
have
already
found
that
j
j
have
lose
interest
because
of
other
thing
and
we
never
kindle
that
much
interest
i
try
to
get
smithkline
to
make
part
of
our
early
first
round
investment
they
wouldn
t
do
it
because
they
be
form
their
own
big
facility
internally
the
master
strategy
of
start
amgen
have
be
that
you
get
three
pharmaceutical
company
for
about
six
million
dollar
and
then
you
get
another
six
from
some
other
rich
capitalist
and
you
ve
get
a
nice
blend
the
big
pharmaceutical
company
keep
your
price
up
per
share
and
so
on
and
so
on
it
turn
on
that
the
candidate
for
the
pharmaceutical
company
be
smithkline
and
they
decide
to
do
it
themselves
another
one
be
dupont
and
they
decide
to
buy
new
england
nuclear
for
a
big
bunch
of
money
like
four
hundred
million
so
they
be
not
interested
in
put
cash
into
biotech
i
have
go
through
that
round
in
the
first
round
and
be
now
think
about
what
company
might
invest
our
best
candidate
be
j
j
and
we
miss
we
have
no
really
good
alternative
and
now
when
the
internal
board
say
that
they
be
not
interested
in
put
the
money
in
you
go
public
then
they
say
how
can
you
possibly
pull
off
as
the
default
position
go
public
that
s
pretty
ambitious
it
be
a
pretty
good
spring
in
other
word
there
be
a
lot
of
enthusiasm
for
ipo
in
the
spring
we
move
as
fast
as
we
could
move
but
we
still
almost
miss
the
window
we
just
caught
it
it
turn
out
that
bill
bowes
influence
at
dean
witter
and
montgomery
help
to
convince
them
that
this
be
a
good
thing
which
be
a
very
important
role
so
we
have
three
banker
but
as
we
say
smith
barney
be
quite
unsophisticated
in
the
biotech
industry
and
they
permit
a
lot
of
stock
to
go
to
people
and
these
be
not
fly
by
night
outfit
i
don
t
know
exactly
who
they
be
it
s
be
too
long
but
they
be
certainly
taint
investor
who
have
take
advantage
in
and
out
early
in
ipo
we
be
load
with
them
because
smith
barney
have
not
discriminate
that
way
and
they
have
not
know
the
industry
well
enough
to
know
who
these
taint
people
be
so
as
i
say
the
only
way
your
stock
can
go
from
an
eighteen
offering
price
to
sixteen
in
an
hour
and
a
half
be
that
people
have
their
hand
on
their
stock
the
second
the
bell
ring

gordon
want
to
be
in
new
york
because
when
the
bell
rang
to
sell
genentech
stock
it
just
start
go
straight
up
it
go
from
thirty
five
to
ninety
dollar
a
share
in
hour
so
gordon
want
to
be
there
in
new
york
when
it
happen
to
us
he
be
just
dumbstruck
w
hen
he
watch
the
first
offering
go
down
to
sixteen
dollar
oh
my
god
what
have
i
get
here
then
we
have
this
dreadful
period
where
it
kept
go
down
if
you
re
ask
the
other
side
of
the
coin
why
do
people
want
to
sell
our
stock
and
why
do
they
sign
on
it
be
a
pretty
frothy
time
there
in
the
spring
of
biogen
have
gotten
out
with
their
ipo
and
i
think
cetus
raise
some
money
and
the
aftermath
of
genentech
be
still
pretty
favorable
they
be
still
well
above
their
offering
price
and
we
work
hard
at
our
pitch
we
didn
t
have
much
to
say
in
december
w
hen
we
have
to
convince
the
board
that
we
would
like
the
option
of
go
public
but
they
didn
t
have
to
make
much
of
a
call
either
we
have
the
right
to
look
into
it
far
they
didn
t
say
we
would
go
by
the
time
we
go
our
public
offering
have
a
lot
of
juicy
stuff
in
there
maybe
it
didn
t
pan
out
in
every
way
but
we
have
the
gene
synthesis
that
be
well
than
anything
we
mention
erythropoetin
because
we
have
some
interest
in
a
big
pharmaceutical
company
and
wc
kind
of
played
that
up
although
we
didn
t
have
the
gene
yet
i
think
we
have
chicken
growth
hormone
and
we
d
gotten
a
lot
of
publicity
on
that
we
have
indigo
we
hadn
t
gotten
most
of
that
publicity
yet
but
we
do
know
how
to
make
indigo
and
indigo
be
a
hundred
million
dollar
business
of
course
this
variety
be
spicy
to
some
people
and
it
help
us
get
interest
up
in
the
early
day
the
true
strength
of
that
interest
be
demonstrate
very
clearly
when
you
suddenly
find
yourself
in
the
market
and
your
stock
go
from
eighteen
to
nine
in
three
month
you
know
that
if
there
be
that
much
interest
it
be
pretty
flaw
interest
then
it
go
down
from
nine
to
six
in
the
next
six
month
then
it
w
ent
down
to
three
that
be
the
trend
line
of
the
amgen
stock
price
for
the
first
year
and
half
hughes
be
you
begin
to
question
your
decision
to
become
a
ceo
of
a
biotech
company
rathmann
i
didn
t
but
i
m
try
to
think
of
a
reason
why
not
there
be
some
people
that
make
a
huge
difference
to
me
mostly
because
they
continued
to
express
a
lot
of
confidence
when
they
could
have
be
totally
cynical
one
of
them
be
moshe
alafi
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
him
at
that
time
he
be
no
longer
very
active
he
wasn
t
on
our
board
and
he
be
very
much
tie
in
with
biogen
but
for
some
reason
moshe
felt
that
we
be
go
to
do
it
more
right
than
biogen
he
express
that
to
me
more
than
once
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
his
judgment
and
the
fact
that
he
be
continue
to
show
confidence
that
we
be
do
it
right
he
be
right
you
can
t
do
anything
overnight
and
you
can
t
be
sure
that
the
first
thing
you
do
be
go
to
be
great
but
somehow
people
like
moshe
have
a
sense
that
we
be
do
it
right
hughes
he
approve
of
the
diverse
program
that
you
have
set
up
rathmann
i
don
t
think
he
spent
that
much
time
with
the
detail
i
think
he
just
felt
that
i
be
believable
and
he
knew
we
have
hire
a
wonderful
staff
very
bright
people
i
think
he
be
just
bet
on
the
odds
that
this
place
be
go
to
win
hughes
well
he
be
right
rathmann
he
be
right
we
be
a
good
bet

hughes
i
know
from
talk
to
him
that
he
put
a
lot
of
credence
in
people
and
that
he
operates
a
lot
by
intuition
that
s
what
he
told
me
so
his
intuition
be
pretty
good
tell
me
about
the
dna
synthesis
capacity
do
that
come
through
caruthers
rathmann
yes
hughes
it
be
a
system
similar
to
the
one
that
genentech
have
rathmann
no
genentech
s
come
out
of
city
of
hope
and
it
be
much
more
cumbersome
and
less
flexible
than
marv
s
marv
s
be
the
late
most
useful
gene
synthesis
it
be
call
phosphoamidite
chemistry
and
it
be
the
substance
of
what
apply
biosystems
be
built
on
the
gene
synthesis
side
what
marv
be
do
right
there
at
the
begin
and
it
be
both
helpful
and
not
so
helpful
marv
would
show
people
a
demonstration
in
which
he
would
have
three
chemical
flask
and
he
would
add
the
base
from
any
one
of
those
three
by
hand
he
have
stopcock
he
would
add
that
base
to
the
gene
sequence
and
then
he
d
add
this
base
and
then
he
d
add
that
base
he
have
three
base
and
you
could
synthesize
any
sequence
you
want
he
be
make
a
point
of
show
people
that
all
you
need
to
be
do
gene
synthesis
be
three
flask
and
a
pretty
good
ph
d
chemist
it
drove
me
crazy
because
we
be
meanwhile
say
we
have
this
unique
capability
for
gene
synthesis
now
in
reality
there
w
ere
patent
that
we
must
have
thought
we
would
get
our
hand
on
which
we
do
but
i
m
not
so
sure
that
we
assume
that
we
could
keep
anybody
from
do
it
themselves
i
think
what
kept
people
out
be
that
all
you
have
to
do
be
have
three
flask
know
the
chemistry
follow
it
carefully
and
be
in
boulder
colorado
hughes
laugh
rathmann
the
reason
for
that
be
that
the
relative
humidity
be
about
percent
hughes
oh
so
you
re
serious
rathmann
yes
i
go
around
try
to
recruit
people
that
marv
suggest
one
of
them
be
up
here
in
san
francisco
he
be
have
a
devil
of
a
time
synthesize
gene
he
say
i
just
don
t
know
how
marv
caruthers
do
it
i
say
well
why
don
t
you
bring
him
out
here
to
show
you
this
guy
be
work
in
a
very
small
company
and
he
have
no
resource
and
so
he
kept
struggle
to
try
to
make
the
gene
and
he
just
basically
didn
t
make
it
he
be
a
good
guy
one
of
marv
s
earlier
protege
marv
have
say
hire
him
he
s
a
good
guy
but
i
didn
t
hire
him
he
didn
t
want
to
move
to
southern
california
but
also
i
be
kind
of
suspicious
that
this
guy
be
a
turkey
that
couldn
t
make
the
gene
after
all
even
though
he
have
a
deal
with
marv
where
he
could
have
gotten
some
more
help
which
he
didn
t
get
he
try
to
do
it
himself
the
fact
be
that
a
very
important
part
of
marv
s
success
be
the
percent
humidity
i
m
almost
absolutely
certain
hughes
dave
goeddel
who
become
the
cloner
with
the
golden
hand
for
genentech
come
from
caruthers
lab
and
yet
the
technique
that
they
use
for
somatostatin
be
the
city
of
hope
method
now
why
be
that
have
caruthers
technique
not
be
perfect
at
that
point

rathmann
well
it
certainly
hadn
t
be
it
be
way
behind
as
i
say
the
first
manifestation
of
caruthers
s
method
be
these
three
flask
thing
and
he
would
set
up
a
lab
demonstration
with
the
flask
that
be
the
first
ability
to
do
this
with
stopcock
and
flask
and
how
idiot
proof
it
be
i
have
no
idea
what
i
think
really
be
true
be
when
you
re
in
a
dry
climate
nothing
in
the
world
can
beat
marv
s
method
hughes
what
do
that
capacity
allow
you
to
do
that
your
competitor
couldn
t
do
rathmann
what
it
meant
be
that
you
could
walk
into
the
lab
and
make
a
gene
cod
thirty
amino
acid
we
do
it
in
a
week
with
beta
endorphin
then
what
it
allows
you
to
think
about
do
and
marv
propose
this
right
away
be
that
when
goeddel
successfully
clone
gamma
interferon
man
say
i
d
like
to
make
the
gene
for
gamma
interferon
what
he
thought
be
to
kind
of
get
around
his
patent
or
at
least
to
get
a
springboard
from
what
he
s
do
to
get
us
into
the
gamma
interferon
business
marv
be
very
anxious
whether
he
be
go
to
get
second
guess
by
the
board
and
they
do
they
say
they
didn
t
think
they
want
to
see
him
do
that
marv
very
shrewdly
say
at
the
scientific
advisory
board
meeting
but
i
ll
do
it
in
ninety
day
get
you
the
interferon
gene
in
ninety
day
then
they
say
well
marv
have
such
stature
and
when
he
say
ninety
day
he
probably
mean
ninety
day
to
pas
up
an
experiment
because
it
s
too
costly
or
too
difficult
that
can
be
do
in
ninety
day
come
on
we
aren
t
that
arrogant
so
why
don
t
you
go
ahead
and
show
us
that
you
can
do
that
now
the
thing
be
and
it
be
a
challenge
for
him
even
gamma
interferon
be
probably
amino
acid
base
as
compare
to
that
we
have
already
do
so
that
be
really
very
ambitious
anything
go
wrong
along
the
way
and
you
ve
get
nothing
what
marv
create
then
be
a
brand
new
way
of
do
this
and
you
do
it
in
chunk
and
then
you
string
all
the
chunk
together
in
one
shot
the
end
of
the
chunk
be
all
so
design
as
to
link
together
with
the
next
chunk
and
in
only
one
way
so
you
could
actually
put
your
ten
base
chunk
in
a
flask
and
have
them
instantly
combine
to
form
the
gene
you
want
because
they
have
end
design
just
right
to
couple
with
the
next
one
so
he
basically
achieve
gamma
interferon
in
his
ninety
day
that
we
talk
about
a
lot
that
we
have
what
we
call
second
generation
gene
synthesis
it
be
pretty
evident
we
be
well
at
it
than
anybody
in
the
world
hughes
what
happen
to
that
gamma
interferon
since
it
have
already
be
clone
by
genentech
rathmann
right
you
wonder
just
exactly
what
position
you
be
in
hughes
right
rathmann
and
of
course
you
re
hop
to
follow
your
nose
and
find
a
position
but
you
re
not
yet
able
to
chart
it
when
you
start
we
now
have
the
protein
because
we
put
the
gene
into
a
vector
system
and
make
gamma
interferon
then
we
start
study
gamma
interferon
and
we
compare
it
to
the
gamma
interferon
that
you
can
get
from
vilchek
in
tiny
quantity
there
be
something
funny
it
didn
t
react
the
same
way
to
certain
antibody
that
be
the
lead
that
give
us
the
result
that
be
the
real
breakthrough
which
be
about
a
year
later
the
goeddel
structure
be
wrong
and
the
reason
it
be
wrong
be
that
he
didn
t
start
the
gene
in
the
right
place
he
have
a
cysteine
tyrosinecysteine
on
his
molecule
that
be
not
on
vilchek
s
molecule
it
might
not
have

matter
but
it
matter
a
lot
it
matter
in
two
way
it
make
the
product
very
hard
to
work
with
because
the
cysteine
be
couple
so
it
would
conglomerate
very
quickly
secondly
it
be
obviously
not
the
right
structure
to
get
all
the
property
you
want
out
of
gamma
interferon
so
we
synthesize
the
gene
base
on
the
know
structure
and
then
we
get
the
idea
that
one
way
to
have
a
place
in
the
sun
would
be
to
change
the
molecule
in
some
way
make
substitution
in
one
form
or
another
so
we
would
make
an
analog
of
the
gamma
interferon
we
literally
have
at
amgen
an
analog
strategy
we
now
with
gene
synthesis
be
in
wonderful
shape
to
take
any
protein
that
have
ever
be
discover
and
make
a
different
one
if
you
be
lucky
you
found
a
change
that
might
be
useful
now
there
be
those
sort
of
theological
argument
you
re
not
go
to
improve
on
nature
because
nature
s
have
a
few
billion
year
to
come
up
with
the
structure
that
she
come
up
with
but
others
would
say
it
have
to
be
of
the
million
of
structure
we
can
make
one
of
them
have
get
to
be
well
than
the
natural
product
so
we
follow
a
little
bit
of
that
lead
in
say
let
s
cut
off
the
carboxy
terminus
and
the
n
terminus
of
gamma
interferon
and
just
see
what
we
get
the
first
thing
we
get
with
careful
work
be
that
the
one
with
the
n
terminus
cut
off
the
cysteine
tyrosine
cysteine
off
behave
the
same
way
with
some
antibody
that
have
never
be
true
of
goeddel
s
so
we
knew
that
we
have
really
hit
on
a
correct
gamma
interferon
structure
and
we
file
on
it
and
thought
we
would
probably
own
gamma
interferon
hughes
be
change
the
structure
also
with
the
aim
of
get
around
the
patent
rathmann
it
be
both
you
have
a
capability
and
you
want
to
utilize
it
to
the
limit
the
first
thing
you
do
be
make
the
exact
same
thing
and
that
show
that
your
capability
be
very
powerful
it
might
have
be
a
ho
hum
because
you
might
not
be
able
to
ever
do
that
the
idea
that
you
can
make
variant
on
the
molecule
very
very
easily
and
just
pop
these
thing
in
there
and
tomorrow
morning
you
have
a
variant
and
by
the
afternoon
you
have
variant
two
with
that
capability
which
have
never
be
there
before
you
should
be
able
to
find
something
interest
then
when
you
find
out
that
you
ve
get
the
right
molecule
and
he
have
the
wrong
molecule
boy
you
think
you
re
in
the
driver
s
seat
it
be
fairly
complicate
and
probably
be
not
worth
go
into
but
we
end
up
not
get
anything
out
of
it
part
of
it
be
that
goeddel
could
show
that
in
his
first
product
he
must
have
have
some
of
the
correctly
terminate
molecule
therefore
he
make
it
first
he
get
a
little
guidance
from
us
but
that
s
all
right
the
patent
office
issue
a
patent
for
that
molecule
and
give
it
to
them
hughes
well
above
and
beyond
the
intellectual
propertj
story
there
s
the
one
about
the
interferon
themselves
you
doubtless
remember
all
the
hype
at
that
time
about
how
these
molecule
be
go
to
be
cure
for
cancer
they
be
go
to
be
useful
in
combat
infectious
disease
the
press
be
high
on
interferon
so
what
happen
with
these
interferon
project
rathmann
there
be
a
lot
more
theory
than
there
be
practical
success
there
be
people
that
would
catalog
interferon
in
term
of
type
one
and
type
two
the
type
one
would
be
good
for
cancer
and
the
type
two
would
be
good
for
infectious
disease
a
lot
of
this
stuff
be
specious
it
wasn
t
really
fundamental
and
it
wasn
t
necessarily
true
what
happen
of
course
be
that
the
people
at
schering
plough
and
roche
the
people
that
have
a
virtual
capability
for
alpha
interferon
one
or
the
other
of
them
have
hit
on
the
fact

that
hairy
cell
leukemia
could
be
treat
with
alpha
interferon
and
cure
hairy
cell
leukemia
be
a
very
very
unusual
disease
and
i
would
venture
that
not
a
thousand
people
in
the
united
state
would
have
it
but
it
s
a
dreadful
disease
and
fatal
and
here
you
have
your
first
real
demonstration
that
alpha
interferon
be
the
magic
bullet
or
the
magic
cure
so
the
word
interferon
be
the
holy
grail
for
a
long
time
and
now
you
could
understand
why
take
one
of
the
world
s
bad
disease
and
cure
it
but
from
a
commercial
standpoint
you
d
say
be
that
really
interest
you
ve
get
a
few
hundred
people
i
don
t
know
the
number
but
it
be
very
small
but
it
s
a
clue
you
re
able
to
do
something
really
very
important
from
there
you
start
look
at
kidney
disease
renal
cancer
and
some
others
and
you
re
hop
that
you
re
go
to
see
that
same
thing
happen
when
you
get
the
dose
right
eventually
the
infectious
disease
side
of
the
equation
emerge
as
probably
more
important
than
the
cancer
side
for
treat
hepatitis
that
become
a
very
very
big
application
for
alpha
interferon
but
gamma
be
really
more
of
a
magic
pill
than
we
thought
more
of
the
holy
grail
than
either
alpha
or
beta
interferon
so
in
our
offering
memorandum
we
played
up
gamma
tape
side
a
rathmann
we
place
the
high
value
on
gamma
interferon
it
seem
like
you
finally
have
the
perfect
therapeutic
that
be
go
to
be
able
to
treat
more
disease
it
be
grasp
at
straw
in
a
way
because
very
little
be
know
about
it
so
anyway
it
seem
like
a
worthwhile
thing
and
that
s
why
we
kept
work
with
it
to
the
point
where
marv
caruthers
synthesize
the
whole
gene
we
thought
we
be
roll
but
the
ruling
that
genentech
be
go
to
get
the
patent
many
year
later
after
the
fact
be
because
no
one
have
figure
out
a
really
important
application
for
gamma
it
end
up
with
some
value
for
a
specific
cancer
and
that
be
about
it
hughes
well
we
wander
into
the
research
program
which
be
fine
but
let
s
backtrack
a
little
bit
to
that
offering
prospectus
which
must
have
contain
your
first
idea
about
the
research
program
do
it
not
rathmann
well
you
want
to
go
back
hughes
what
be
you
initially
go
to
be
work
on
rathmann
that
be
not
a
prospectus
that
be
the
offering
memorandum
for
the
nineteen
million
dollar
hughes
i
use
the
wrong
term
rathmann
that
memorandum
be
available
to
look
at
i
basically
write
that
it
be
base
on
what
the
scientific
advisor
have
be
do
but
it
be
strongly
push
toward
a
more
typical
industrial
way
of
present
program
hughes
would
that
be
an
sec
security
and
exchange
commission
document
how
would
get
a
hold
of
it
j
rathmann
she
join
the
interview
how
be
you
guy
do

rathmann
hughes
rathmann
hughes
rathmann
i
didn
t
know
the
regulation
there
be
a
lot
of
hedge
in
there
it
s
not
an
sec
document
in
the
usual
sense
it
s
an
offering
memorandum
what
i
do
be
to
try
and
make
it
as
businesslike
as
i
could
i
change
all
the
folksy
phrase
that
the
scientific
advisor
have
put
in
there
and
change
it
to
a
presentation
of
ten
or
eleven
project
how
have
you
chosen
those
project
the
information
of
the
scientific
advisor
meeting
be
present
to
me
and
i
could
read
through
thing
that
they
thought
be
interest
and
decide
which
one
be
the
most
defensible
what
often
happens
when
scientific
advisor
get
together
be
that
their
most
interest
program
be
in
fact
not
very
interest
the
reason
be
that
the
most
interest
program
deal
with
the
world
s
large
population
of
sick
people
and
they
re
almost
all
third
world
disease
from
a
business
standpoint
i
remember
the
education
i
get
about
third
world
disease
at
abbott
you
can
dream
all
you
want
about
help
a
million
people
but
who
s
go
to
pay
for
the
drug
you
re
go
to
try
and
sell
it
to
people
that
don
t
have
any
money
and
you
re
not
go
to
sell
it
to
them
if
you
want
to
give
it
away
that
probably
would
work
but
the
concept
of
have
all
your
egg
in
the
third
world
basket
would
be
a
devastate
mistake
you
wouldn
t
make
that
mistake
in
present
a
program
at
abbott
i
ll
tell
you
that
you
would
get
eat
alive
by
who
s
go
to
pay
for
it
who
s
go
to
pay
for
it
so
as
soon
as
i
look
at
this
document
from
the
science
advisor
i
wasn
t
surprised
malaria
trypanosomiasis
leishmaniosis
and
a
few
others
be
all
there
in
term
of
really
big
worldwide
need
so
let
s
solve
the
big
problem
of
the
world
but
who
s
go
to
pay
for
it
it
really
make
you
stop
winston
salser
a
very
enterprising
guy
who
i
mention
get
the
scientific
advisory
board
together
be
frequently
able
to
suggest
a
clever
dimension
in
the
case
of
trypanosomiasis
that
s
the
disease
carry
by
the
tse
tse
fly
in
africa
he
decide
to
focus
on
bovine
trypanosomiasis
the
cattle
in
africa
that
they
would
like
to
raise
in
the
east
instead
of
the
west
all
die
of
tse
tse
fly
infection
trypanosomiasis
infection
because
you
couldn
t
control
the
tse
tse
fly
there
so
our
scientific
advisory
board
have
a
number
of
idea
thing
that
would
maybe
cause
the
tse
tse
fly
to
die
when
it
bit
you
and
most
importantly
a
vaccine
for
bovine
trypanosomiasis
so
you
could
save
the
cattle
population
the
economics
of
this
be
go
to
be
different
there
may
be
no
money
for
human
because
nobody
care
that
much
about
the
human
but
if
it
make
a
difference
that
you
have
meat
production
in
a
place
where
you
couldn
t
have
it
otherwise
you
could
feed
all
of
africa
from
an
area
that
before
be
totally
incapable
of
raise
cattle
because
of
the
tse
tse
fly
so
that
be
the
way
it
be
write
up
in
our
prospectus
it
be
economically
doable
because
you
re
go
to
be
sell
meat
in
the
first
world
not
depend
solely
on
third
world
financing
to
pay
for
sick
people
malaria
we
have
in
there
and
i
can
t
remember
how
much
because
i
could
not
line
up
the
nussenzweigs
by
the
time
that
i
be
write
the
memorandum
why
what
happen
be
mostly
misinformation
in
other
word
the
nussenzweigs
a
husband
and
wife
team
i
believe
be
the
pioneer
in
try
to
figure
out
how
malaria
work
and
how
you
might
handle
the
vaccine
at
one
or
another
stage
of
the
parasite
s
life
cycle
they
have
a
lot
of
idea
a
very
enterprising
guy
like
winston
salser
be
very

quick
to
point
out
who
be
the
world
leader
in
anything
he
be
very
good
at
that
almost
a
gadfly
approach
and
also
a
very
vigorous
pursuer
he
explain
to
me
in
four
phone
call
can
get
to
the
leader
of
any
field
the
first
three
phone
call
will
tell
me
who
they
think
be
the
leader
then
i
go
to
the
fourth
phone
call
and
that
s
the
guy
i
have
picked
him
very
shrewdly
from
other
people
who
be
knowledgeable
so
his
idea
be
that
the
nussenzw
eigs
be
the
leader
of
malaria
rescrach
let
s
do
recombinant
dna
toward
whatever
structure
you
want
to
try
and
make
that
s
go
to
be
a
malaria
vaccine
you
re
go
to
have
a
long
way
to
go
but
you
re
at
least
go
to
have
the
best
people
work
with
you
so
the
scientist
have
write
this
up
as
a
malaria
program
alan
mendelson
saw
this
when
i
write
it
up
that
way
alan
s
idea
be
to
purge
this
prospectus
of
anything
that
you
couldn
t
defend
so
wow
right
in
the
gunsight
of
alan
mendelson
be
this
comment
about
work
with
the
nussenzweigs
so
he
say
very
simply
to
me
george
be
you
sure
that
they
ve
agree
to
this
i
say
i
don
t
know
i
can
find
out
he
say
please
that
be
on
his
list
of
all
the
thing
we
have
to
do
that
cause
don
longman
to
walk
out
alan
say
contact
the
nussenzweigs
so
go
to
winston
and
i
say
i
m
go
to
have
to
contact
the
nussenzweigs
he
say
no
you
can
t
do
that
i
say
winston
i
m
find
out
that
i
have
to
do
it
no
you
can
t
do
it
trust
me
it
s
go
to
be
okay
now
i
m
worried
that
it
wasn
t
so
okay
i
absolutely
have
to
you
don
t
want
to
talk
to
them
well
winston
you
ve
get
to
explain
to
me
why
i
don
t
want
to
talk
to
them
when
i
m
be
instruct
by
attorney
to
talk
to
them
well
because
they
probably
won
t
say
the
right
thing
what
will
they
say
they
ll
say
that
they
really
don
t
want
to
work
with
our
company
they
re
pure
academic
and
they
don
t
want
to
be
taint
by
work
with
our
company
well
winston
how
be
we
go
to
use
their
name
if
that
s
the
way
they
feel
just
trust
me
i
think
you
can
say
it
sort
of
like
they
ll
never
know
so
i
say
winston
either
call
them
or
i
leave
it
out
of
the
prospectus
he
say
leave
it
out
i
think
what
do
be
we
left
malaria
in
but
you
won
t
find
the
name
nussenzweig
in
there
hughes
malaria
be
mainly
a
third
world
disease
didn
t
a
malaria
program
have
the
same
problem
that
you
be
describe
rathmann
oh
yes
there
s
no
question
if
you
re
go
to
view
that
problem
as
real
you
can
t
put
malaria
in
the
front
order
of
what
you
re
go
to
do
but
if
you
ask
yourself
would
there
be
a
way
to
make
a
contribution
from
recombinant
dna
here
s
a
hundred
and
fifty
million
case
of
malaria
in
this
world
it
be
a
major
problem
for
u
s
arm
force
around
the
world
the
u
s
government
might
pay
to
solve
the
problem
or
you
d
say
that
s
one
of
the
most
monumental
thing
you
could
do
and
let
s
leave
it
to
someone
else
to
figure
out
how
you
re
go
to
make
money
but
you
re
go
to
do
an
awful
lot
of
good
in
a
big
hurry
so
you
say
can
t
resist
the
idea
it
s
a
huge
benefit
therefore
someone
s
get
to
figure
out
how
to
make
it
pay
so
you
tend
to
do
it
anyway
but
you
change
the
priority
you
ve
get
much
high
priority
for
gamma
interferon
that
s
go
to
treat
cancer
than
malaria
the
trypanosomiasis
that
be
suggest
by
winston
you
play
that
one
as
a
meat
production
that
s
worth
an
awful
lot
of
money
not
necessarily
a
third
world
gift
to
the
sick
hughes
now
do
all
these
project
that
have
be
mention
actually
get
start

rathmann
hughes
rathmann
i
didn
t
know
how
to
start
a
company
but
what
seem
logical
be
first
of
all
to
present
a
very
businesslike
analysis
almost
exactly
like
you
would
at
abbott
when
you
go
to
your
annual
budget
you
break
down
the
dollar
you
want
to
spend
and
allocate
it
by
project
and
then
you
justify
a
project
base
on
its
return
or
its
economic
benefit
so
i
want
to
follow
the
same
procedure
i
have
know
all
my
life
at
m
and
at
abbott
we
have
these
ten
project
what
happens
as
soon
as
you
re
authorize
to
spend
money
you
start
allocate
your
resource
to
the
program
that
have
be
approve
i
do
the
same
thing
at
amgen
we
have
decide
that
this
be
what
investor
might
spend
their
money
on
and
they
do
now
we
have
to
decide
how
we
re
go
to
make
this
happen
so
you
hire
your
first
person
and
you
show
him
the
list
it
s
very
straightforward
he
say
oh
jeez
i
don
t
want
to
do
that
i
don
t
want
to
do
that
but
i
d
like
to
really
do
that
one
okay
that
s
your
project
in
most
case
when
you
start
everything
be
a
one
man
project
you
can
t
too
quickly
put
three
people
on
a
project
that
s
the
way
you
should
do
it
but
it
s
not
so
easy
the
first
ph
d
that
come
through
the
door
be
go
to
have
his
own
project
the
thirteenth
ph
d
be
go
to
want
to
have
his
own
project
he
doesn
t
want
to
be
on
one
of
the
other
project
or
third
on
the
list
and
yet
you
need
more
than
one
person
in
any
program
so
what
you
do
be
you
start
building
the
next
wave
of
building
be
go
to
be
add
the
people
to
help
somebody
on
their
project
so
if
they
need
a
cell
biologist
they
ll
urge
you
to
hire
that
cell
biologist
now
you
ve
get
two
people
work
the
epo
project
in
have
two
people
let
s
talk
about
epo
because
of
its
importance
who
be
those
two
scientist
and
how
do
amgen
choose
epo
there
be
so
many
protein
that
could
have
be
chosen
the
senior
scientist
be
taiwanese
fu
kuen
lin
and
his
assoicate
be
a
technician
also
with
the
name
lin
no
relation
the
concept
be
well
work
out
before
i
come
from
the
first
scientific
advisory
board
meeting
the
scientific
advisor
have
select
epo
now
it
wasn
t
such
a
remarkable
selection
because
when
i
be
at
abbott
we
talk
about
epo
gene
goldwasser
be
down
the
street
in
chicago
and
he
have
come
by
a
number
of
time
to
convince
the
people
at
abbott
that
there
be
a
big
future
in
erythropoietin
so
we
talk
about
it
a
little
bit
at
abbott
and
i
knew
of
the
molecule
when
i
get
to
amgen
they
have
already
do
the
follow
thing
they
have
line
up
gene
goldwasser
as
what
winston
call
a
major
consultant
in
other
word
he
wasn
t
broad
enough
to
be
one
of
the
scientific
advisory
board
member
he
be
very
narrow
it
be
epo
that
be
the
only
thing
we
knew
he
be
very
important
so
we
ll
make
him
a
major
consultant
we
ll
give
him
the
same
amount
of
stock
as
a
scientific
advisor
get
but
he
won
t
get
embarrass
by
the
scientific
advisor
who
might
say
he
s
not
one
of
us
we
re
super
broad
gauge
we
re
lee
hood
we
re
marv
caruthers
we
re
arnie
berk
we
re
all
these
great
people
so
we
have
some
specialized
consultant
and
he
be
one
of
them
now
what
we
knew
be
he
have
purify
epo
that
have
be
announce
in
we
didn
t
know
how
much
epo
he
have
but
we
suspect
it
be
enough
to
get
the
peptide
sequence
use
lee
hood
s
sequinator
the
state
of
the
science
at
that
time
be
that
if
you
have
a
really
purify
protein
and
it
be
stable
enough
so
you
could
work
with
it
and
if
you
go
to
lee
hood
and
his
first
protot
pe
peptide
sequencer
he
could
take

that
purify
material
and
he
could
get
the
peptide
sequence
of
the
protein
he
could
only
do
it
at
one
end
for
maybe
ten
to
twenty
amino
acid
if
your
sample
be
very
pure
if
it
s
dirty
he
can
t
do
that
as
he
start
cut
the
end
off
if
it
s
dirty
it
mean
you
re
get
mixed
up
right
from
the
begin
it
s
not
very
long
before
it
s
chaos
but
if
it
s
really
good
pure
stuff
and
gene
goldwasser
s
be
then
there
s
a
good
chance
that
if
you
put
it
into
lee
s
apparatus
then
you
will
get
the
initial
sequence
so
that
be
all
laid
out
hughes
now
do
anybody
else
have
lee
s
apparatus
at
that
point
rathmann
no
hughes
so
that
be
a
real
coup
that
be
a
real
feather
in
your
hat
rathmann
that
be
a
very
valuable
asset
that
we
have
access
to
the
real
coup
be
that
we
have
decide
to
sequence
protein
instead
of
capture
mrna
six
company
go
after
mrna
and
they
all
fail
to
get
the
gene
amgen
decide
early
that
mrna
be
too
rare
to
detect
and
fu
kuen
lin
have
the
courage
and
the
necessary
talent
to
try
to
get
the
gene
from
the
protein
hughes
amgen
be
certainly
by
no
stretch
the
only
company
work
on
epo
do
you
think
the
sequencer
be
one
of
the
leg
up
that
you
have
on
your
competitor
rathmann
well
the
actual
first
leg
up
be
that
we
get
early
small
quantity
of
gene
goldwasser
s
stuff
secondly
we
could
sequence
with
lee
s
sequinator
and
bought
one
of
the
first
two
unit
from
apply
biosystems
if
you
have
to
try
to
distribute
it
across
the
world
no
one
would
have
enough
to
do
anything
with
now
goldwasser
actually
do
distribute
it
he
set
aside
a
certain
amount
of
pure
stuff
and
would
send
small
quantity
to
anybody
that
want
it
so
he
do
that
and
that
kind
of
save
our
bacon
from
the
standpoint
of
comply
with
the
right
way
to
do
it
he
do
it
the
right
way
he
give
a
small
quantity
to
people
that
want
it
and
he
give
us
large
quantity
as
we
be
obviously
do
important
thing
but
lee
hood
s
apparatus
be
the
second
key
and
that
be
a
very
important
part
of
it
what
actually
happen
however
be
that
the
straightforward
theoretical
solution
often
don
t
work
as
well
as
they
sound
this
be
another
case
because
the
straightforward
sequence
of
epo
give
us
about
twenty
six
amino
acid
in
which
there
be
obviously
go
to
be
some
error
bad
yet
they
happen
to
be
those
amino
acid
that
be
very
redundant
in
their
gene
sequence
there
could
have
be
sequence
of
ten
or
even
less
and
there
would
have
be
enough
to
pick
the
gene
sequence
that
you
be
assume
be
the
one
that
make
epo
but
what
we
end
up
with
be
a
combination
of
certain
error
and
the
actual
protein
the
actual
amino
acid
that
we
have
be
potentially
cod
by
any
of
hundred
and
hundred
of
possible
gene
you
take
alanine
for
example
and
there
s
six
different
codon
combination
of
three
base
that
will
code
for
that
molecule
you
take
that
one
and
then
the
next
one
and
the
next
one
and
the
next
one
you
ve
get
hundred
of
possibility
and
you
re
either
go
to
try
to
test
for
all
of
these
or
you
throw
up
your
hand
and
say
i
ve
get
to
find
another
set
we
ve
get
to
find
another
sequence
in
epo
which
be
not
so
degenerate
so
i
can
narrow
it
down
i
don
t
mind
make
fifty
or
sixty
or
eighty
different
probe
to
match
up
to
try
and
pull

hughes
rathmann
hughes
a
gene
out
of
a
gene
library
but
i
can
t
make
thousand
and
yet
that
be
where
we
be
head
once
you
look
at
the
end
terminus
what
we
recognize
fairly
early
certainly
before
the
begin
of
be
that
it
would
help
a
lot
to
get
another
sequence
out
of
the
protein
and
the
most
likely
way
to
do
that
be
to
take
the
protein
and
cut
it
digest
it
so
it
break
then
purify
one
of
those
section
and
then
take
the
sequence
from
that
end
so
now
you
ve
get
internal
sequence
of
a
fragment
which
be
really
an
internal
sequence
for
epo
now
you
ve
get
another
opportunity
to
get
maybe
less
degenerate
gene
sequence
that
s
what
fu
kuen
lin
do
gene
actually
do
a
tryptic
digest
and
we
do
the
purification
of
one
of
the
fragment
and
then
get
the
end
terminus
of
that
and
now
have
another
piece
of
potential
gene
sequence
i
think
there
might
have
be
two
hundred
and
fifty
six
different
gene
that
would
fit
that
sequence
but
we
make
all
of
those
correspond
hybridization
probe
if
you
hit
on
both
that
section
and
the
other
section
the
thing
you
would
be
look
at
be
the
epo
gene
and
we
be
and
that
s
how
dr
lin
s
patent
work
the
whole
story
unfolds
as
both
a
very
excite
pursuit
of
the
theoretical
idea
and
a
very
frustrate
pursuit
because
it
never
turn
out
to
be
exactly
what
you
would
expect
dr
lin
be
successful
in
use
purify
epo
and
a
sequencer
in
a
way
to
learn
something
about
the
precious
gene
for
epo
but
when
you
start
learn
you
have
a
lot
of
learn
to
do
at
what
point
do
you
decide
that
the
epo
project
be
the
golden
egg
so
to
speak
in
the
begin
the
way
i
m
hearing
it
it
be
just
one
of
many
research
project
and
maybe
not
even
the
most
important
of
those
be
that
right
that
s
right
it
s
embarrass
to
think
that
you
ranked
fragment
oil
with
bacteria
down
in
a
well
as
equivalently
interest
a
project
as
epo
when
you
realize
the
commercial
potential
of
some
of
these
thing
of
course
if
you
solve
the
oil
industry
s
problem
that
would
be
a
huge
payoff
as
well
but
in
hindsight
you
realize
how
very
very
very
far
away
you
be
from
some
of
those
goal
and
even
malaria
and
trypanosomiasis
be
far
away
epo
be
a
relatively
short
number
of
step
if
you
get
the
purify
epo
if
you
get
the
sequence
from
lee
hood
if
you
get
some
break
and
we
get
a
lot
of
break
epo
be
a
nice
molecule
to
work
with
then
you
have
some
assurance
that
you
be
go
to
get
something
beautiful
as
compare
to
put
some
bacteria
down
a
well
we
have
a
mixed
bag
also
because
we
have
investor
with
different
interest
i
can
remember
those
first
five
year
at
amgen
when
a
potential
investor
or
a
real
investor
would
come
in
and
say
boy
i
m
really
excite
about
your
malaria
project
not
your
erythropoietin
or
i
m
really
excite
about
chicken
growth
hormone
and
you
realize
it
s
not
all
bad
if
i
m
attract
investor
by
the
diversity
of
my
portfolio
now
there
be
some
fundamental
that
be
in
violation
here
one
be
that
you
have
to
focus
when
you
aren
t
focus
you
re
probably
take
a
real
chance
of
dissipate
a
lot
of
money
but
i
kind
of
believe
that
there
s
real
virtue
in
have
different
alternative
that
be
excite
you
attract
more
money
but
you
also
already
have
a
backup
when
something
fails
you
re
not
dead
in
the
water
so
it
wasn
t
inappropriate
to
have
a
multiproject
strategy
but
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
that
from
the
begin
epo
be
the
one
that
we
have
a
lot
of
hope
for
there
must
come
a
point
however
when
amgen
becomes
a
drug
company
meaning
that
these
other
project
fade
away
be
that
not
true

rathmann
well
it
s
up
to
you
you
can
decide
you
re
a
drug
company
but
you
can
decide
also
that
a
lot
of
drug
company
do
cosmetic
and
other
thing
by
the
way
one
of
our
top
manager
decide
that
a
real
payoff
of
interferon
be
go
to
be
cosmetic
talk
to
l
oreal
and
some
of
these
people
it
be
very
interest
because
i
never
get
turn
down
it
be
no
lure
to
me
i
just
thought
don
t
want
to
be
in
the
cosmetic
industry
can
t
do
something
more
useful
that
s
a
poor
answer
if
cosmetic
be
go
to
finance
your
company
you
should
let
cosmetic
finance
your
company
but
we
invite
them
in
and
they
say
sure
they
d
be
happy
to
test
interferon
in
a
face
cream
or
something
else
hughes
what
be
that
suppose
to
do
rathmann
you
don
t
know
you
just
know
that
it
s
a
magic
molecule
hughes
like
honeybee
wax
or
whatever
it
be
rathmann
well
what
actually
happen
just
at
that
time
interferon
be
sweep
through
japan
and
there
be
ad
that
you
could
see
people
from
japan
be
tell
us
of
interferon
in
cosmetic
and
interferon
in
hairsprays
with
argument
that
you
could
rejuvenate
the
life
of
the
hair
or
the
life
of
the
face
or
whatever
there
be
bona
fide
interest
if
you
be
l
oreal
and
you
suddenly
be
the
only
guy
that
have
the
hair
spray
that
contains
interferon
you
know
that
you
re
go
to
be
able
to
play
that
out
for
a
while
now
if
there
s
nothing
there
the
fda
will
catch
up
with
you
and
say
wait
a
minute
those
claim
that
you
be
do
something
for
the
hair
you
ve
get
to
stop
that
but
you
certainly
could
say
we
ve
get
interferon
in
our
hair
spray
we
re
go
to
put
that
in
there
tomorrow
and
if
anybody
want
to
prove
that
to
me
as
something
wonderful
that
s
up
to
them
we
don
t
make
these
claim
i
think
it
would
be
okay
but
actually
the
japanese
do
make
claim
they
didn
t
have
a
lot
of
diverse
application
for
interferon
we
almost
bit
on
that
one
for
a
little
while
noel
stebbin
be
very
intrigue
by
that
we
just
thought
this
be
go
to
be
simple
what
he
learn
from
the
cosmetic
people
be
that
it
s
relatively
easy
to
prove
that
you
ve
get
something
because
you
run
a
study
of
five
people
and
you
do
it
several
time
one
of
those
time
three
out
of
five
say
this
be
really
wonderful
so
three
out
of
five
people
have
select
your
product
as
the
best
and
that
s
your
claim
sometimes
it
seem
you
don
t
have
to
have
anything
more
statistically
sound
than
the
three
out
of
five
j
rathmann
i
can
believe
it
rathmann
noel
be
fascinate
by
this
he
say
you
know
it
turn
out
you
can
almost
always
prove
whatever
it
be
you
want
to
sell
to
the
public
well
we
almost
get
suckered
into
that
one
the
people
from
the
cosmetic
firm
be
relatively
compelling
it
just
sound
like
you
can
t
miss
we
re
go
to
put
it
in
if
it
do
good
that
be
great
if
it
doesn
t
there
still
might
be
a
benefit
to
put
it
in
if
people
might
try
it
hughes
if
you
have
go
that
route
do
you
think
you
could
have
convince
your
scientist
and
your
scientific
board
i
hear
you
that
a
companj
have
get
to
make
money
but
also
there
s
a
certain
element
of
idealism
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
that
also
be
a
motivator
and
maybe
cosmetic
isn
t
it

rathmann
yes
i
think
it
would
be
hard
it
s
amaze
when
pure
scientist
decide
that
the
commercial
dimension
be
compelling
they
can
be
more
zealous
than
a
sound
businessperson
because
they
lose
their
perspective
they
suddenly
realize
that
the
survival
of
this
company
depends
on
themselves
and
they
go
for
it
we
didn
t
get
very
far
into
it
the
scary
part
be
what
if
there
be
a
huge
payoff
in
cosmetic
what
if
it
s
not
all
specious
but
there
s
some
real
substance
that
that
be
a
bona
fide
application
for
interferon
you
ve
get
to
keep
examine
that
possibility
that
you
re
in
a
position
to
provide
this
material
whose
best
application
may
be
in
a
field
that
you
don
t
happen
to
be
thrill
with
but
if
it
work
and
it
really
doc
something
that
commercialization
could
be
very
important
to
the
health
of
the
company
so
you
take
a
good
look
at
it
i
let
people
talk
about
it
i
wasn
t
one
of
those
person
that
felt
test
cosmetic
be
a
sin
and
it
s
still
true
that
if
there
be
a
place
for
our
technology
in
cosmetic
care
we
d
well
take
a
look
at
it
tape
side
b
hughes
at
what
stage
do
you
attract
noel
stebbin
and
dan
vapnek
and
for
what
reason
rathmann
the
actual
history
behind
those
two
people
be
quite
different
in
the
case
ofnoel
a
piece
of
paper
come
across
my
desk
which
be
his
cv
so
obviously
he
have
approach
a
headhunter
that
he
might
want
to
leave
genentech
if
he
get
to
the
right
job
the
headhunter
proceed
to
try
to
interest
other
company
in
noel
stebbin
his
credential
be
very
good
he
have
be
at
high
wickham
with
searle
then
come
to
genentech
in
charge
of
biology
so
he
have
a
very
nice
history
i
work
off
of
that
headhunter
s
sheet
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don
t
think
we
ever
paid
a
headhunter
because
i
picked
up
noel
s
name
from
others
and
i
call
noel
stebbin
i
say
i
d
like
to
talk
to
you
he
say
sure
come
on
up
to
san
francisco
and
meet
you
at
my
yard
that
s
what
i
do
noel
have
a
wonderful
wife
a
wonderful
daughter
and
i
be
impressed
by
all
three
of
them
these
guy
be
neat
people
very
very
bright
so
i
proceed
from
there
to
construct
the
job
that
would
attract
noel
away
from
genentech
i
suspect
because
the
paper
have
be
out
on
the
street
that
he
wasn
t
all
that
thrill
with
genentech
that
turn
out
to
be
true
he
have
gotten
a
little
bit
jaundiced
about
genentech
certain
other
people
have
move
up
a
little
faster
than
he
have
and
he
wasn
t
sure
about
swanson
ultimately
he
have
a
great
relationship
with
swanson
but
i
think
he
be
feel
like
he
be
be
overlook
at
that
point
so
anyway
he
accepted
an
invitation
to
thousand
oak
it
be
a
mixed
bag
in
the
reaction
of
people
down
there
one
guy
larry
souza
who
have
very
strong
negative
opinion
about
just
about
everything
really
like
him
he
really
like
him
because
larry
souza
like
to
see
nice
clean
decision
make
he
hate
equivocation
he
be
very
very
powerful
very
intelligent
a
very
successful
innovative
scientist
he
be
responsible
for
product
that
create
a
large
percentage
of
the
amgen
profit
larry
be
the
fourth
guy
hire
at
amgen
i
interviewed
noel
in
probably
late
we
start
the
lab
go
in
april
of
we
have
about
forty
or
fifty
people
by
the
time
noel
arrive
i
interviewed
him
and
the
question
be
what
shall
i
offer
i
think
he
would
have
like
to
be
the
ceo
hughes
laugh

rathmann
hughes
rathmann
the
job
that
i
offer
him
be
vice
president
of
scientific
affair
the
idea
be
that
it
would
be
his
job
to
help
to
bring
together
the
entire
r
d
organization
so
he
would
be
in
charge
of
hire
a
lot
of
people
from
science
and
medical
and
development
meanwhile
john
carbon
have
suggest
that
i
talk
to
dan
vapnek
at
the
university
of
georgia
and
he
be
great
he
be
a
really
good
molecular
biologist
he
be
one
of
the
first
rate
one
of
the
world
the
guy
you
would
want
to
have
run
research
so
i
get
dan
vapnek
i
didn
t
want
to
miss
him
for
run
my
research
and
then
i
d
get
noel
who
have
a
lot
of
practical
experience
to
help
us
in
the
commercial
direction
we
make
it
clear
to
noel
that
he
may
or
may
not
have
responsibility
for
research
and
we
make
it
clear
to
dan
that
noel
may
or
may
not
have
responsibility
for
research
they
be
just
to
get
along
that
sound
a
little
ambiguous
which
it
be
it
be
just
exactly
what
i
have
to
do
to
have
noel
convince
that
he
would
have
enough
of
a
course
to
run
on
and
have
dan
feel
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
be
overridden
by
this
guy
they
both
join
with
this
understand
they
didn
t
get
along
famously
but
they
always
get
along
there
be
alw
ays
a
healthy
skepticism
on
the
part
of
dan
that
noel
be
a
little
too
aggressive
a
little
too
black
and
white
i
m
sure
that
noel
be
driven
crazy
by
dan
s
ambivalence
on
so
many
thing
but
they
be
both
very
bright
how
do
they
work
out
the
division
of
labor
well
noel
kept
do
more
of
the
thing
that
be
development
downstream
you
might
say
and
less
and
less
of
the
real
research
but
he
have
strong
idea
about
how
research
should
be
do
i
think
he
be
more
intrigue
by
a
particular
area
of
make
variant
of
human
pharmaceutical
he
be
very
much
of
the
mind
that
you
should
try
variant
because
they
be
always
go
to
be
more
interest
than
the
natural
molecule
dan
be
very
much
of
the
mind
i
think
it
be
almost
religion
to
him
that
you
d
well
leave
nature
alone
she
s
have
a
long
time
to
come
up
with
the
structure
for
these
molecule
if
you
can
get
the
natural
molecule
you
ought
to
have
it
if
you
want
to
try
the
courageous
thing
of
make
some
change
go
ahead
but
be
careful
because
you
could
introduce
more
problem
than
benefit
very
easily
your
body
be
tune
to
the
natural
molecule
and
we
can
t
be
sure
any
other
molecule
can
do
the
job
history
show
you
that
variation
be
usually
more
difficult
than
you
thought
in
most
system
the
reason
noel
join
by
the
way
be
that
we
give
him
a
heavy
dose
of
the
scientific
advisory
board
we
always
do
and
one
of
those
dos
be
marv
caruthers
noel
suddenly
saw
in
marv
caruthers
this
idea
of
million
of
structure
that
be
slightly
different
from
the
natural
structure
he
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
at
genentech
look
at
the
variant
of
the
structure
of
natural
alpha
interferon
there
be
many
many
natural
variant
and
he
be
extremely
excite
about
that
if
nature
make
different
version
of
something
you
ought
to
play
with
that
because
there
might
be
a
version
that
you
could
make
that
nature
hasn
t
make
yet
one
of
the
first
thing
that
noel
get
involve
with
at
amgen
be
to
use
marv
caruthers
synthesis
capability
to
make
structure
that
be
different
the
one
that
he
work
out
with
one
of
the
other
scientist
be
what
we
call
consensus
interferon
they
work
out
that
nature
have
provide
us
with
six
ten
or
twelve
alpha
interferon
something
like
that
and
a
beta
interferon
if
we
take
a
look
at
all
those
structure
we
can
look
for
a
single
structure
that
come
closest
to
high
homology
with
every
one
so
in
other
word
you
might
differ
from
one
structure
by
five
amino
acid
you
might
vary

hughes
rathmann
hughes
one
structure
by
nine
but
there
be
a
consensus
structure
that
s
more
like
all
the
others
than
any
other
structure
so
we
then
have
to
find
consensus
interferon
we
call
it
that
the
idea
be
that
nature
be
try
to
tell
us
something
nature
be
look
for
a
structure
nature
be
look
for
the
structure
that
we
come
up
with
because
that
s
the
consensus
structure
the
first
time
that
we
measure
the
biological
activity
of
consensus
interferon
it
come
out
twenty
time
as
active
as
any
other
interferon
well
that
s
all
you
need
you
now
prove
the
point
that
nature
be
search
never
be
successful
in
get
the
exact
structure
have
a
good
average
structure
but
when
we
make
the
consensus
structure
we
have
a
superb
molecule
twenty
time
as
active
well
repeat
measurement
of
specific
activity
be
often
not
very
validate
because
the
next
time
we
do
it
it
be
ten
time
as
active
now
that
s
still
clear
the
next
time
we
do
it
it
be
between
five
and
ten
time
as
active
that
s
still
pretty
good
but
then
the
real
question
be
what
about
its
side
effect
and
those
be
really
serious
problem
with
alpha
interferon
nausea
vomit
myalgia
a
whole
bunch
of
problem
what
if
those
be
also
be
optimize
in
this
structure
the
key
be
of
course
go
to
the
clinic
and
figure
it
out
the
analyst
be
hang
with
bat
breath
joellyn
fisher
just
couldn
t
wait
for
us
to
prove
that
consensus
interferon
be
many
time
more
active
and
as
a
result
you
could
cut
down
the
dose
and
eliminate
any
side
effect
that
be
the
holy
grail
in
that
area
but
we
never
could
validate
in
a
sustain
way
the
big
activity
advantage
in
living
organism
while
there
probably
be
some
advantage
you
certainly
couldn
t
prove
that
you
could
find
a
dose
in
which
you
eliminate
the
side
effect
meanwhile
alpha
interferon
as
i
told
you
before
have
hit
the
jackpot
with
a
very
small
jackpot
name
hairy
cell
leukemia
and
it
be
not
clear
at
all
that
there
be
a
next
step
so
that
take
another
couple
of
year
before
people
realize
that
there
be
a
very
very
important
area
on
the
market
we
thought
we
couldn
t
lose
we
have
a
molecule
that
embody
all
the
alpha
interferon
and
have
a
fairly
high
homology
to
beta
interferon
and
if
there
be
a
good
interferon
why
isn
t
it
most
likely
to
be
ours
it
seem
straightforward
the
ability
to
prove
that
and
the
amount
of
money
you
re
go
to
have
to
spend
and
then
find
out
that
you
re
still
two
three
four
five
year
behind
the
lead
product
out
there
you
re
go
to
lose
your
appetite
for
consensus
interferon
that
take
probably
five
year
we
must
have
feature
consensus
interferon
when
we
come
up
with
the
structure
about
we
must
have
still
be
talk
about
it
in
or
remember
i
express
to
the
analyst
that
we
be
go
to
decide
in
we
put
consensus
interferon
in
the
clinic
in
and
we
be
go
to
decide
in
the
next
year
as
to
whether
it
be
really
do
something
well
than
other
alpha
interferon
meanwhile
alpha
interferon
as
i
told
you
before
have
hit
the
jackpot
with
a
very
small
jackpot
namely
hairy
cell
leukemia
and
it
be
not
clear
at
all
that
there
be
a
next
step
so
that
take
another
couple
of
year
before
people
realize
that
there
be
a
very
very
important
area
on
the
market
stebbin
come
to
amgen
in
about
late
would
say
i
m
guess
that
he
come
around
to
genentech
i
don
t
think
he
d
be
there
long

rathmann
i
think
about
two
year
hughes
well
the
reason
that
i
m
interested
in
the
timing
be
that
the
rationale
for
bring
in
stebbin
that
i
ve
heard
be
that
there
be
an
increase
realization
that
it
wasn
t
enough
to
just
clone
a
gene
that
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
biology
the
realization
arose
from
xarious
unsuccessful
research
project
such
as
thymosin
at
genentech
where
they
didn
t
get
very
far
in
produce
a
drug
because
they
didn
t
know
enough
about
the
biology
rathmann
so
that
s
your
explanation
of
why
he
be
attractive
to
genentech
hughes
yes
right
because
he
represent
biology
rathmann
yes
he
be
the
director
of
biology
hughes
be
it
a
give
for
amgen
at
that
point
that
it
wasn
t
enough
to
clone
a
gene
that
there
have
to
be
biological
understand
be
that
what
stebbin
represent
to
you
rathmann
well
he
didn
t
represent
that
to
me
the
part
that
be
attractive
to
me
in
stebbin
really
relates
to
what
we
have
as
the
cross
section
of
people
at
amgen
at
amgen
most
of
our
people
be
right
out
of
academic
appointment
there
be
about
percent
that
be
different
but
most
of
them
have
be
only
as
ph
d
s
and
postdoc
what
stebbin
brought
as
far
as
be
concerned
be
a
lot
more
experience
on
the
practical
side
of
scale
up
and
go
into
the
clinic
and
development
study
dan
vapnek
have
no
experience
in
those
area
he
be
a
pure
academic
at
the
university
of
georgia
but
a
wonderful
molecular
biologist
so
it
be
pretty
obvious
that
he
could
accept
the
idea
that
noel
brought
something
that
we
have
no
experience
in
they
didn
t
get
along
all
that
well
because
about
every
six
month
or
so
noel
would
come
in
and
say
you
kind
of
told
me
when
i
start
that
we
be
go
to
have
to
do
a
little
dance
every
once
in
a
while
you
get
tire
of
dance
the
dance
be
how
you
work
with
dan
and
how
you
decide
what
your
goal
be
would
clarify
the
dance
for
him
a
little
bit
give
him
some
reassurance
that
he
have
a
spot
and
he
really
do
he
be
much
more
downstream
from
dan
dan
wasn
t
worried
at
all
about
it
now
dan
be
not
stupid
no
dan
be
a
very
very
bright
guy
if
you
told
dan
he
have
to
develop
commercial
process
he
developed
them
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
but
his
preference
be
a
very
basic
science
approach
but
they
get
along
well
enough
fhey
certainly
perform
what
we
get
out
of
the
combination
be
wonderful
result
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
hughes
saw
a
reference
to
dan
vapnek
and
his
runaway
plasmid
what
be
that
about
rathmann
well
it
be
the
source
of
an
even
more
important
breakthrough
which
be
walkaway
plasmid
hughes
walkaway
rathmann
yes
that
be
the
one
guy
s
version
of
what
they
come
up
with
at
amgen
runaway
plasmid
be
simply
a
refinement
of
what
be
go
on
in
almost
every
molecular
biologist
s
lab
but
a
very
important
refinement
the
average
molecular
biologist
s
lab
have
realize
that
if
you
want
to
put
com
gene
into
a
bacterial
cell
the
best
way
to
do
that
instead
of
try
to
just
put
dna
in
there
and
have
it
float
around
or
put
dna

in
and
integrate
it
into
the
chromosome
there
be
something
else
to
these
bacterial
cell
that
be
extremely
attractive
this
become
a
fundamental
part
of
stanley
n
cohen
and
herbert
w
boyer
s
technology
and
everybody
else
s
it
s
remarkable
but
they
all
recognize
it
very
early
and
that
be
that
within
these
e
coli
there
be
little
ring
of
dna
and
they
be
call
plasmid
if
you
want
to
do
something
quick
and
easy
it
be
easy
to
break
open
a
plasmid
and
insert
the
dna
that
you
want
and
put
it
back
into
the
cell
than
anything
else
it
be
a
very
convenient
vehicle
for
transport
gene
into
the
cell
so
the
plasmid
be
the
target
for
most
molecular
biological
splice
now
what
be
clearly
a
potential
benefit
which
i
would
have
never
thought
of
but
the
molecular
biologist
do
right
away
be
what
if
you
have
a
way
of
cause
the
plasmid
to
reproduce
itself
now
you
could
be
produce
a
whale
of
a
lot
more
of
the
thing
you
want
you
could
almost
overwhelm
the
cell
because
this
one
little
plasmid
that
now
contains
your
gene
of
choice
be
now
multiply
itself
and
become
a
runaway
plasmid
now
the
nice
thing
about
that
would
be
that
you
have
many
copy
of
your
gene
and
it
s
go
to
make
more
product
and
that
s
go
to
be
nice
the
disadvantage
however
be
that
you
never
know
where
you
be
so
you
don
t
have
much
control
of
this
process
you
might
have
ten
plasmid
or
you
might
have
a
thousand
that
mean
that
your
control
of
your
process
be
in
question
because
the
process
be
in
question
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
really
deal
with
at
any
one
time
so
if
you
have
a
walkaway
plasmid
that
would
mean
in
their
mind
that
you
would
contain
a
number
of
replication
it
would
be
significant
but
you
would
get
less
and
less
rapid
multiplication
as
you
reach
certain
level
the
way
i
picture
it
and
i
sure
don
t
know
if
this
be
right
it
s
like
i
m
go
to
make
fifty
plasmid
and
i
m
not
go
to
make
any
more
and
i
m
not
go
to
have
this
thing
run
away
from
me
but
i
still
have
make
a
lot
of
them
so
that
s
why
we
call
it
a
walkaway
a
walkaway
system
it
be
a
discovery
at
amgen
and
name
there
i
don
t
know
if
anybody
else
ever
use
walkaway
but
they
be
important
to
us
they
make
a
very
nice
control
process
with
very
high
yield
hughes
cohen
boyer
remember
there
be
a
replication
site
on
that
plasmid
that
they
use
right
i
mean
they
be
clone
as
well
as
splice
dna
right
rathmann
yes
hughes
be
that
a
runaway
plasmid
rathmann
you
re
clone
for
sure
and
you
re
go
to
replicate
for
sure
but
the
question
be
the
relative
replication
rate
of
the
dna
in
there
and
the
plasmid
every
time
the
cell
divide
you
make
another
copy
of
the
dna
and
you
probably
make
another
copy
of
the
plasmid
but
those
could
be
independent
event
you
could
be
make
multiple
copy
of
the
plasmid
without
make
multiple
copy
of
dna
hughes
i
see
rathmann
that
s
what
the
runaway
be
at
the
university
of
georgia
they
report
some
of
the
first
runaway
plasmid
of
course
amgen
people
could
have
read
it
anywhere
but
it
be
helpful
to
have
mr
guru
dan
vapnek
in
that
field
that
be
very
useful

hughes
do
amgen
in
these
early
day
ever
consider
monoclonal
base
product
rathmann
oh
yes
in
the
very
early
day
as
you
might
simplify
the
field
there
be
two
kind
of
biotech
company
hiere
be
the
recombinant
dna
which
be
really
quite
a
broad
spectrum
to
go
about
do
it
and
your
target
be
pharmaceutical
and
therapeutic
or
diagnostics
or
animal
or
something
but
there
wen
also
monoclonal
antibody
there
be
three
player
one
of
which
be
monoclonal
antibody
the
other
two
be
very
formidable
hybritech
and
centocor
the
business
strategy
of
those
company
be
base
on
the
discovery
in
of
monoclonal
antibody
they
would
make
monoclonal
antibody
they
have
a
business
strategy
in
all
case
that
you
would
start
out
by
make
some
kind
of
diagnostics
and
then
you
would
eventually
use
human
monoclonal
to
administer
to
people
the
capability
to
have
the
antibody
fasten
onto
a
tumor
site
and
possibly
kill
it
if
it
carry
a
dose
of
toxin
or
radiation
so
you
have
these
two
kind
of
company
and
centocor
and
hybritech
be
the
leader
hybritech
disappear
and
become
part
of
lilly
so
centocor
have
its
own
place
in
the
sun
hughes
people
start
with
diagnostics
because
they
be
easy
to
produce
than
therapeutic
rathmann
yes
the
idea
be
that
you
wouldn
t
have
to
go
through
twelve
year
of
fda
and
you
could
be
develop
commercial
product
much
more
quickly
but
there
be
a
limitation
although
abbott
have
prove
a
few
year
before
that
the
limitation
of
diagnostics
wasn
t
so
bad
for
those
people
that
be
try
to
attract
heavy
financing
for
a
biotech
company
you
have
to
offer
more
reward
than
a
potential
three
million
dollar
diagnostics
business
here
or
there
hughes
there
be
genetic
system
too
rathmann
genetic
system
be
the
other
one
up
in
seattle
and
they
sell
out
to
bristol
my
er
they
be
the
one
two
punch
hy
britech
sell
out
to
eli
lilly
at
a
huge
number
and
the
guy
run
genetic
system
who
i
know
very
well
because
he
be
the
ceo
of
icos
be
enterprising
enough
to
say
boy
this
be
the
time
to
get
out
of
this
business
and
get
somebody
to
buy
in
that
s
big
and
rich
so
he
sell
out
to
bristol
myers
hughes
that
be
robert
nowinski
rathmann
yes
two
of
the
company
disappear
from
the
scene
almost
within
six
month
and
for
good
reason
because
the
first
sale
be
such
a
big
price
that
people
couldn
t
believe
it
hughes
also
didn
t
it
prove
more
difficult
than
expect
to
develop
therapeutic
on
the
basis
of
monoclonal
rathmann
well
that
may
have
be
in
the
mind
of
the
people
that
sell
out
and
they
might
have
say
i
don
t
think
it
s
go
to
be
such
a
good
trip
but
it
wasn
t
obvious
to
the
rest
of
us
that
there
be
any
big
disappointment
there
it
s
always
go
to
take
a
long
time
to
develop
a
therapeutic
hughes
what
do
amgen
do
with
monoclonal

rathmann
well
we
have
the
capability
for
several
reason
one
be
that
the
ability
to
make
antibody
would
help
elucidate
the
kind
of
structure
that
you
have
then
we
sign
on
with
abbott
in
a
key
event
be
to
settle
a
dispute
that
we
have
with
abbott
the
dispute
with
abbott
be
that
when
abbott
make
their
original
investment
they
have
a
one
page
letter
agreement
these
be
very
very
standard
at
the
time
when
a
corporation
make
an
investment
in
your
company
you
give
them
something
what
you
told
the
rest
of
the
world
be
that
you
give
them
very
little
what
you
told
them
be
that
they
have
everything
and
the
letter
would
determine
what
they
have
what
amgen
agree
to
with
abbott
be
that
abbott
would
have
the
right
of
first
review
on
any
program
that
we
have
hughes
oh
really
that
be
a
big
deal
rathmann
well
careful
the
word
be
state
very
carefully
first
review
now
if
you
re
contract
correctly
there
will
be
limitation
on
what
you
can
review
how
often
you
can
review
what
right
you
really
have
there
be
term
in
there
that
would
suggest
that
you
have
day
for
that
review
and
that
be
it
if
abbott
and
amgen
have
not
reach
agreement
by
the
end
of
the
day
amgen
could
take
the
item
or
product
or
project
or
whatever
it
be
to
another
company
with
impunity
we
have
no
permanent
obligation
to
abbott
if
we
didn
t
want
to
make
a
deal
we
let
day
go
by
and
then
we
could
do
what
we
pleased
that
s
why
first
review
be
really
quite
limited
and
people
didn
t
get
too
shaken
up
over
it
on
the
other
hand
i
still
be
afraid
about
which
stuff
would
be
review
what
if
they
decide
that
they
weren
t
go
to
review
it
yet
they
would
take
their
day
period
later
that
be
a
little
scaiy
so
i
put
into
the
letter
of
agreement
with
abbott
at
our
initiation
because
if
we
have
the
need
for
some
possible
outside
financing
or
other
purpose
we
could
initiate
the
day
period
and
bring
it
to
their
attention
but
what
be
sure
that
we
couldn
t
do
be
just
take
something
out
of
our
bag
and
sell
it
off
to
somebody
without
show
it
to
abbott
but
that
s
all
they
have
when
i
m
act
like
it
s
de
minimus
in
many
way
it
be
at
the
same
time
it
be
the
basis
by
which
abbott
start
to
take
advantage
of
us
that
be
no
we
don
t
want
to
review
it
yet
and
i
say
wait
a
minute
we
ve
get
the
right
to
offer
it
to
you
and
then
you
have
day
well
let
s
talk
about
that
after
about
ninety
day
we
would
say
the
ninety
day
have
already
go
by
they
say
we
haven
t
start
yet
they
become
more
and
more
aggressive
that
what
they
really
want
be
the
ability
to
make
a
deal
on
any
one
of
our
project
whenever
they
want
to
and
that
be
not
what
we
have
in
mind
so
a
couple
of
thing
happen
one
of
them
w
as
i
go
to
jim
vincent
who
cut
the
original
abbott
diagnostic
deal
with
us
he
be
now
at
allied
and
i
get
them
interested
in
work
with
amgen
his
attorney
be
in
disagreement
and
then
they
get
all
worried
over
what
abbott
might
do
to
us
get
pretty
mad
because
i
thought
that
we
be
pretty
well
protect
and
we
be
i
felt
that
i
have
to
go
back
to
abbott
and
renegotiate
something
what
i
elect
to
do
be
to
get
abbott
interested
in
a
diagnostic
program
with
amgen
i
want
a
big
one
and
i
knew
that
i
be
valuable
property
in
diagnostics
so
i
go
to
them
and
suggest
a
four
or
five
million
dollar
a
year
program
for
five
year
a
nineteen
million
dollar
program
they
decide
to
buy
that
that
also
bury
the
hatchet
with
respect
to
this
agreement
that
they
be
start
to
misconstrue
i
heard
later
that
bob
swanson
go
nut
he
say
nineteen
million
dollar
what
do
amgen
have
that
genentech
doesn
t
have

tape
side
a
rathmann
we
knew
a
lot
more
about
diagnostics
than
genentech
we
be
way
ahead
of
them
abbott
sue
us
because
they
say
that
we
weren
t
behaving
accord
to
the
contract
then
we
threaten
to
sue
them
the
number
i
picked
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
million
dollar
it
be
an
antitrust
suit
because
felt
that
they
be
prevent
us
from
work
with
others
and
they
be
a
dominant
force
in
the
diagnostics
field
by
that
time
so
that
s
against
the
law
so
i
threaten
them
with
a
big
suit
they
threaten
back
and
then
we
say
hey
this
be
dumb
why
doesn
t
the
ceo
come
out
and
see
me
and
we
ll
see
if
we
can
t
talk
bob
shellitom
the
ceo
elect
to
come
we
met
in
palm
spring
in
one
day
in
his
own
handwritten
scrawl
we
have
a
nineteen
million
dollar
deal
with
abbott
hughes
wow
rathmann
and
that
of
course
i
felt
be
absolutely
essential
we
couldn
t
go
into
a
public
offering
in
the
summer
of
with
abbott
and
amgen
sue
each
other
so
we
have
to
settle
it
and
that
be
a
very
favorable
way
to
settle
it
because
we
now
have
nineteen
million
dollar
come
in
and
we
have
a
nice
relationship
on
diagnostics
that
become
an
important
part
of
our
research
it
be
also
a
neat
thing
for
me
because
we
have
start
this
lab
at
boulder
under
marv
caruthers
because
he
want
to
have
his
own
private
thing
and
now
i
have
something
to
put
into
boulder
that
would
pay
the
bill
the
abbott
relationship
hughes
be
it
consider
a
division
of
amgen
rathmann
well
we
call
it
a
subsidiary
amgen
boulder
hughes
what
be
it
to
do
rathmann
well
it
be
to
please
marv
caruthers
in
a
way
that
it
be
also
satisfactory
with
me
this
be
very
common
in
the
early
day
of
biotech
you
would
have
somebody
like
cohen
who
want
his
own
branch
of
cetus
cetus
immune
and
then
you
have
agracetus
and
then
you
have
this
and
that
those
thing
turn
out
to
be
horrible
mistake
primarily
for
one
reason
in
their
desire
to
elevate
the
importance
of
the
subsidiary
they
set
them
up
with
their
own
stock
so
if
you
be
in
cetus
immune
you
would
get
cetus
immune
stock
not
cetus
stock
that
be
really
neat
because
now
you
have
more
control
over
stock
value
that
wasn
t
so
neat
when
nobody
knew
how
to
make
that
stock
negotiable
what
do
you
sell
it
for
and
how
do
you
make
sure
that
someone
s
get
something
out
of
it
if
they
get
no
value
they
might
as
well
stay
at
home
if
they
get
too
much
value
suddenly
the
guy
in
the
subsidiarj
be
make
ton
of
money
and
the
home
base
guy
be
go
to
have
a
fit
so
what
do
when
set
up
amgen
boulder
i
have
see
all
that
happen
i
resist
have
a
stock
for
amgen
boulder
but
that
those
people
would
get
amgen
share
and
they
be
literally
right
smack
in
the
middle
of
our
payscale
in
the
middle
of
our
option
scale
it
didn
t
quite
work
out
that
way
because
our
personnel
people
kept
harp
on
the
fact
that
boulder
have
a
low
cost
base
than
los
angeles
therefore
we
should
maintain
some
kind
of
salary
differential
i
fought
that
tooth
and
nail
i
just
say

hey
we
re
one
company
we
can
t
punish
these
people
for
be
in
a
low
cost
base
they
say
they
be
not
be
punish
they
re
able
to
get
by
on
a
low
cost
of
living
so
they
should
be
able
to
get
by
with
less
money
no
let
s
forget
that
so
i
fought
it
quite
a
bit
and
we
end
up
with
the
same
base
scale
in
both
place
that
have
serious
consequence
that
be
you
couldn
t
pull
anybody
out
of
boulder
and
put
them
in
los
angeles
so
we
have
no
reason
to
hope
that
we
could
integrate
these
people
back
and
forth
you
couldn
t
get
anybody
to
move
out
of
boulder
they
be
get
the
same
pay
and
they
have
much
low
cost
and
they
be
in
the
mountain
so
we
never
do
get
proper
integration
but
we
have
a
very
effective
organization
hughes
how
long
do
it
last
rathmann
i
guess
it
exists
today
as
a
subsidiary
it
s
all
amgen
hughes
what
be
caruthers
initially
work
on
rathmann
the
first
thing
that
he
want
to
work
on
be
synthesize
gene
he
synthesize
gamma
interferon
gene
there
be
quite
a
few
now
that
i
think
about
it
most
of
them
weren
t
that
important
eventually
but
one
of
the
other
thing
he
point
out
to
me
be
that
with
the
ability
to
make
gene
sequence
short
one
like
ten
and
twelve
base
you
could
be
a
vendor
of
gene
sequence
if
people
want
fifteen
base
in
a
row
you
would
make
it
for
them
and
send
it
to
them
the
price
tag
for
this
if
you
count
it
out
on
a
pound
basis
be
about
a
billion
dollar
a
pound
so
you
re
sell
your
stuff
at
a
billion
dollar
a
pound
but
you
re
sell
microgram
at
a
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
becomes
a
relatively
complicate
business
for
what
might
be
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
dollar
a
year
so
you
know
on
the
one
hand
it
be
go
to
be
profitable
because
you
know
you
re
sell
something
at
an
enormous
cost
per
gram
or
per
pound
on
the
other
hand
you
re
do
a
lot
of
mickey
mouse
bookkeeping
and
everything
else
for
what
s
a
half
a
million
dollar
business
so
it
s
pretty
small
the
first
thing
marv
saw
be
that
you
could
be
a
business
sell
hybridization
probe
and
short
gene
sequence
hughes
fairly
soon
didn
t
gene
synthesizer
come
in
rathmann
yes
it
s
hard
for
me
to
picture
the
exact
date
it
be
certainly
after
and
it
be
probably
before
the
end
of
hughes
that
be
go
to
kill
that
business
wasn
t
it
rathmann
yes
that
would
kill
that
business
we
never
get
into
it
so
it
didn
t
really
kill
our
business
because
we
recognize
the
impracticality
of
the
number
of
potential
buyer
and
the
total
dollar
figure
the
price
per
pound
always
stayed
very
attractive
but
overall
it
wasn
t
an
attractive
business
hughes
i
know
from
reading
the
chemical
heritage
foundation
oral
history
that
m
have
a
policy
of
give
scientist
percent
time
to
work
on
their
own
research
project
wonder
if
you
have
anything
similar
at
amgen

rathmann
well
we
probably
do
but
it
wasn
t
give
the
visibility
of
the
m
system
m
really
advertised
that
scientist
have
percent
of
their
time
although
when
be
hire
by
m
it
wasn
t
a
factor
in
my
think
because
i
be
in
love
with
the
project
i
have
didn
t
need
percent
of
my
time
for
something
else
i
like
what
i
be
go
to
do
so
maybe
that
s
why
it
didn
t
affect
me
i
certainly
use
it
myself
when
i
be
recruiting
for
m
hughes
i
presume
that
you
coin
the
term
exploratory
research
rathmann
at
m
they
call
it
exploratory
research
project
in
every
division
there
would
be
exploratory
research
and
you
could
charge
it
even
well
than
that
be
that
you
didn
t
have
to
identify
it
and
charge
it
to
anything
you
just
do
it
there
be
certainly
a
lot
of
that
at
m
the
reason
be
that
no
matter
how
acceptable
it
be
if
some
bos
look
at
a
piece
of
paper
that
say
we
spent
last
year
on
exploratory
research
the
next
thing
he
s
go
to
say
be
what
do
i
get
for
it
all
you
have
to
do
about
exploratory
research
be
keep
ask
what
be
i
get
from
it
and
it
cease
to
exist
people
can
t
tell
you
what
they
re
go
to
do
with
it
when
they
don
t
know
what
it
be
yet
if
it
s
truly
exploratory
but
the
idea
with
m
be
pretty
well
respect
and
it
s
pretty
solid
that
be
you
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
sell
your
idea
to
management
by
have
a
certain
amount
of
time
and
money
you
can
put
in
to
test
some
idea
then
you
have
enough
information
that
you
can
sell
it
at
its
best
that
s
how
the
system
work
hughes
but
what
about
at
amgen
rathmann
i
think
we
have
the
practice
without
the
power
we
have
plenty
of
these
i
remember
joan
egrie
be
in
the
epo
program
say
i
think
there
s
something
really
funny
about
the
way
antibody
be
react
to
our
molecule
you
knew
that
she
be
investigate
on
her
own
what
be
interest
there
we
didn
t
have
a
lot
of
problem
with
that
one
of
the
way
you
accomplish
the
m
result
be
that
you
aren
t
super
quantitative
in
accounting
for
people
s
time
and
place
you
don
t
try
to
run
it
to
the
near
half
hour
and
therefore
there
be
enough
slop
in
the
system
that
someone
can
easily
put
in
six
hour
a
week
for
a
few
week
at
least
without
run
into
a
problem
and
somebody
say
oh
look
at
your
output
you
re
not
spending
enough
time
on
these
other
thing
you
must
be
spending
some
time
on
something
else
you
aren
t
that
quantitative
think
it
s
very
important
i
think
the
m
system
have
a
lot
of
value
because
what
it
do
encourage
be
initiative
and
that
s
one
of
the
key
to
really
successful
r
d
particularly
in
the
front
year
development
can
t
be
run
this
way
because
you
ve
get
time
date
and
all
the
rest
you
ve
get
to
adhere
to
hughes
well
it
seem
to
me
a
system
that
would
be
particularly
apt
in
early
biotechnology
where
so
many
scientist
come
from
academia
rathmann
what
turn
out
to
be
a
driver
of
some
level
of
bureaucracy
be
the
interdependence
of
the
scientist
that
be
on
any
kind
of
a
program
like
the
kind
we
put
together
for
amgen
in
other
word
those
ten
project
have
real
objective
and
even
though
you
re
run
a
project
you
re
dependent
upon
several
other
group
to
meet
your
goal
for
example
you
might
be
depend
upon
a
fermentation
group
to
make
fifty
microgram
of
your
material
you
might
be
dependent
upon
some
protein
characterization
group
to

hughes
rathmann
hughes
rathmann
determine
the
exact
structure
of
the
protein
which
be
make
scientist
be
very
much
a
part
of
the
right
direction
here
what
you
can
t
afford
be
to
have
someone
promise
you
a
certain
reagent
or
a
certain
result
april
and
then
find
out
you
re
still
wait
for
it
in
september
you
start
to
go
stark
rave
mad
because
your
whole
timetable
be
hinge
on
somebody
produce
something
for
you
so
the
interlock
of
the
various
type
of
group
and
the
type
of
thing
you
need
tend
to
cause
you
to
say
finally
hey
i
d
like
to
see
a
little
more
planning
around
here
i
ve
wait
for
six
week
for
the
monoclonal
antibody
people
to
give
me
a
monoclonal
antibody
and
i
m
tire
of
this
i
need
it
six
week
ago
and
so
what
you
gradually
put
together
in
the
planning
be
a
series
of
short
interval
schedule
which
tie
everybody
together
with
goal
that
be
compatible
in
the
system
if
the
guy
in
the
monoclonal
antibody
place
say
hey
look
i
m
swamp
it
s
go
to
be
at
least
six
week
before
you
get
it
you
have
some
choice
you
might
go
to
an
outside
supplier
or
you
might
suggest
way
in
which
you
could
put
more
pressure
on
this
guy
to
get
it
do
but
you
get
pretty
bruise
if
you
be
inclined
to
have
a
totally
flexible
nondemanding
timetable
because
some
people
be
injured
every
week
you
catch
on
that
some
degree
of
planning
be
very
very
helpful
the
same
thing
be
true
by
the
way
with
compensation
program
everybody
want
to
be
treat
as
individual
in
compensation
but
i
found
it
to
be
very
easy
and
very
acceptable
to
have
a
salary
policy
that
be
right
out
of
the
booklet
of
abbott
lab
in
effect
everybody
want
to
be
treat
like
an
individual
but
not
too
much
they
like
to
think
that
there
s
a
system
there
they
d
like
to
think
that
they
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
go
from
here
to
here
to
here
and
if
you
don
t
know
where
here
to
here
to
here
be
it
get
to
be
very
perplex
so
it
turn
out
yes
you
can
put
it
in
place
right
off
the
bat
i
make
a
salary
schedule
the
first
month
of
amgen
that
say
you
re
go
to
be
in
this
group
or
that
group
or
this
group
you
re
go
to
have
this
much
upside
in
that
group
before
you
must
get
promote
to
get
increase
thing
like
that
the
whole
thing
be
all
work
out
in
great
detail
and
it
actually
save
a
lot
of
grief
so
some
bureaucracy
be
very
efficient
and
the
reward
system
be
built
into
that
plan
too
oh
yes
would
you
tell
the
story
about
the
p
word
laugh
that
s
an
icos
story
if
amgen
be
largely
academic
icos
be
that
square
at
amgen
we
actually
have
some
commercial
people
like
noel
and
some
more
commercially
sophisticated
people
but
icos
form
right
out
of
academia
and
why
be
that
because
the
concept
that
robert
nowinski
have
be
as
he
say
we
be
go
to
hit
the
ground
run
and
the
way
we
be
go
to
hit
the
ground
run
be
that
we
be
go
to
pre
recruit
a
staff
and
promise
them
a
job
six
eight
nine
month
later
if
they
show
up
for
that
job
they
get
to
keep
their
founder
stock
if
they
don
t
show
up
we
get
to
buy
it
back
for
what
they
paid
for
it
a
penny
a
share
so
there
s
go
to
be
a
big
economic
incentive
for
them
to
show
up
to
work
when
we
open
our
laboratory
door
and
the
way
we
re
go
to
pre
recruit
be
we
will
promise
people
a
job
and
the
date
that
they
picked
be
in
september
of
and
you
ll
have
a
job
and
we
want
you
and
we
want
you
and
largely
we
get
who
we
want
they
all
show
up
september
icos
get
a
buy
back
price
at
the
price
that
you
paid
if
you
don
t
show
up
in
september

now
if
you
re
go
to
do
that
it
automatically
dictate
that
almost
your
entire
staff
be
academic
particularly
if
you
pick
september
that
s
a
great
time
to
be
able
to
rely
on
people
show
ing
up
for
a
new
job
if
necessary
they
ve
have
their
summer
vacation
if
they
want
it
or
they
ve
quit
their
academic
appointment
so
if
you
re
almost
all
pure
academic
it
s
pretty
straightforward
to
hire
as
we
do
sixty
five
people
to
report
to
work
on
september
th
and
that
s
exactly
what
happen
as
a
result
however
you
ve
get
a
very
academic
stiff
really
academic
very
smart
people
very
good
people
pure
academic
once
in
a
while
you
end
up
w
ith
somebody
who
really
be
so
ill
suit
for
a
company
that
you
wouldn
t
imagine
that
we
would
pick
them
out
in
the
first
place
except
they
have
no
idea
what
they
be
get
into
one
of
these
be
mary
and
mary
be
the
one
who
say
after
a
session
in
which
we
have
an
all
personnel
meeting
in
which
w
e
say
it
be
very
important
to
have
everybody
in
sync
with
what
we
be
do
and
it
certainly
turn
out
to
be
true
here
she
go
to
the
all
personnel
meeting
and
she
come
out
and
she
be
extremely
stress
she
just
never
expect
something
like
this
and
there
it
be
glare
the
p
word
when
i
heard
about
it
immediately
played
the
straight
guy
exactly
like
her
bos
have
the
p
word
what
word
be
that
and
then
she
say
well
you
know
the
p
word
profit
no
not
profit
product
oh
so
it
s
a
sin
to
be
talk
about
product
it
s
bad
enough
if
somebody
object
to
profit
that
s
pretty
tough
but
it
s
pretty
common
object
to
product
what
the
heck
be
they
there
for
well
they
be
there
for
science
their
understand
be
that
this
be
go
to
be
a
place
of
great
science
and
some
of
the
academic
be
recruit
with
that
in
mind
in
other
word
sometimes
recruiter
be
susceptible
to
tell
whatever
they
have
to
tell
somebody
in
order
to
get
them
for
some
of
these
scientist
in
order
to
get
them
someone
promise
them
the
moon
as
far
as
freedom
to
do
basic
science
that
s
what
mary
thought
she
have
understood
that
we
be
not
interested
in
profit
and
product
we
be
interested
in
good
basic
science
she
left
about
six
month
later
we
have
quite
a
few
like
that
we
have
some
at
icos
that
really
couldn
t
have
do
anything
practical
but
that
wasn
t
as
true
at
amgen
as
far
as
i
remember
we
do
hire
some
business
orient
people
right
from
the
begin
dennis
fenton
who
be
still
there
come
straight
from
pfizer
and
noel
have
have
experience
with
high
wickham
and
with
genentech
searle
be
certainly
a
big
company
and
genentech
be
a
biotech
company
so
they
be
kind
of
free
wheel
compare
to
the
rigidity
of
general
motor
we
have
at
amgen
more
people
who
have
some
business
background
but
not
many
of
them
hughes
and
then
you
yourself
of
course
rathmann
and
i
have
some
background
hughes
in
contrast
to
chiron
for
example
where
all
the
founder
be
academic
rathmann
that
s
right
the
same
way
with
ingene
which
be
form
shortly
after
amgen
be
form
they
have
tliree
professor
from
ucla
one
of
whom
be
gary
wilcox
who
be
now
up
at
icos
and
have
be
for
many
year
but
they
have
these
three
professor
and
they
just
splinter
off
from
ucla
and
start
this
company
ingene
they
be
straight
academic
and
initially
they
treat
ingene
as
an
academic
activity
they
would
go
in
monday
morning
and
review
the
science
just
the
same
way
they
do
their
lab
at
ucla

that
go
on
for
year
and
eventually
it
become
a
fairly
successful
company
then
it
be
sell
out
to
xoma
but
at
that
point
it
still
have
no
commercial
result
hughes
we
haven
t
talk
directly
about
culture
what
be
it
like
and
do
you
try
to
nurture
certain
thing
in
amgen
culture
rathmann
well
an
interest
insight
i
arrange
for
a
meeting
with
the
m
people
i
didn
t
go
out
that
time
dan
vapnek
and
several
others
go
when
they
come
back
they
have
a
remarkable
comment
man
i
know
where
we
get
what
culture
we
get
as
you
hear
the
story
of
m
there
s
a
lot
of
that
culture
that
be
bake
into
amgen
at
least
that
be
their
observation
and
i
knew
it
be
true
i
couldn
t
deny
that
i
thought
m
be
a
wonderful
place
and
i
obviously
would
like
to
do
it
at
amgen
in
many
way
the
way
they
do
it
one
of
the
first
message
of
course
be
that
culture
be
very
very
important
the
way
that
you
set
up
the
organization
will
determine
not
only
the
outlook
of
the
culture
but
the
integrity
of
the
organization
everything
else
can
hinge
on
what
kind
of
guidance
go
into
the
first
relationship
that
you
have
with
the
people
you
hire
there
be
no
question
that
all
twenty
year
of
m
put
indelible
mark
on
me
that
you
want
to
have
the
high
integrity
at
all
time
you
want
to
give
a
lot
of
respect
for
individuality
and
initiative
you
want
to
reward
initiative
whenever
you
can
you
want
to
be
very
careful
about
people
who
be
risk
averse
that
they
will
never
do
anything
at
m
it
be
consider
a
virtue
to
go
out
and
stick
your
neck
out
even
to
the
point
of
be
a
huckster
for
something
to
say
i
believe
in
this
i
want
to
do
it
that
be
consider
to
be
something
you
could
do
with
impunity
because
they
encourage
it
so
much
that
you
almost
didn
t
have
to
stick
your
neck
out
because
agressiveness
be
an
acceptable
behavior
so
when
you
have
a
chance
to
start
a
company
and
you
see
some
of
these
thing
that
seem
to
correlate
very
well
with
success
and
with
the
best
attitude
you
can
get
out
of
people
quite
naturally
you
put
that
in
place
i
think
dan
s
observation
be
correct
i
really
have
attempt
to
transport
the
m
philosophy
to
amgen
it
be
surprising
i
do
the
same
thing
to
some
degree
at
abbott
but
abbott
be
a
very
different
company
abbott
be
much
more
rigid
than
m
it
might
have
be
partly
because
of
the
great
risk
of
health
care
compare
to
make
scotch
tape
hughes
well
what
would
you
like
to
say
that
hasn
t
be
say
rathmann
i
like
to
think
about
what
really
make
the
whole
thing
very
excite
and
how
you
make
the
story
of
it
excite
i
think
it
s
partly
the
transformation
that
occurs
if
you
re
do
effective
thing
for
example
there
be
a
fairly
significant
time
on
the
epo
program
joan
egrie
ran
it
and
her
comment
be
be
there
life
after
epo
i
thought
that
be
very
reveal
because
what
it
really
meant
be
this
be
a
very
dark
tunnel
and
it
s
go
on
for
a
long
time
we
assume
that
there
be
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
and
we
hop
we
have
found
a
way
of
go
at
it
but
what
you
really
be
say
be
can
we
hang
in
there
long
enough
it
s
there
undoubtedly
something
wonderful
can
happen
but
man
this
be
tough
time
at
that
stage
we
have
a
lot
of
different
effort
to
try
to
figure
out
where
the
epo
gene
could
be
found
and
produce
to
make
epo
we
be
frustrate
from
so
many
different
angle
the
ultimate
frustration
we
be
able
to
correct
the
ultimate
frustration
be
that
the
amount
of
material
we
be
get
from
gene
goldw
asser
be
just
plain
not

enough
to
do
anything
useful
in
try
to
understand
the
structure
of
epo
well
so
that
we
could
find
the
gene
he
have
very
good
reason
to
hold
back
because
he
didn
t
know
we
might
just
waste
the
stuff
it
w
as
the
only
stuff
he
have
for
his
remain
twenty
year
career
and
he
sure
as
heck
didn
t
want
to
dissipate
the
resource
that
he
have
to
have
us
blow
it
away
the
darkest
hour
of
epo
be
when
i
sent
the
group
out
to
goldwasser
i
say
you
convince
him
that
you
re
go
to
work
with
the
thing
effectively
and
you
re
go
to
get
somewhere
the
first
thing
they
do
be
establish
by
kind
of
peruse
his
place
that
he
have
a
lot
of
the
material
and
he
be
store
it
very
fastidiously
the
next
day
he
be
convince
he
have
to
loosen
up
and
give
some
epo
to
us
the
next
thing
that
happen
within
a
month
we
have
the
gene
hughes
oh
really
that
quickly
rathmann
right
they
knew
that
the
quantity
of
the
material
could
make
a
lot
of
difference
but
if
you
keep
below
that
level
you
might
go
on
forever
and
if
you
re
wait
to
get
the
breakthrough
before
you
release
your
material
that
s
a
self
defeat
strategy
because
it
mean
you
never
get
more
material
and
you
never
get
the
breakthrough
so
it
really
lead
directly
to
the
tryptic
digest
of
those
specimen
the
information
from
other
part
of
the
molecule
as
to
what
the
gene
sequence
be
likely
to
be
be
exactly
what
we
need
to
find
the
gene
there
be
a
lot
of
dedicate
people
in
that
program
i
think
there
be
about
twenty
by
the
end
of
the
j
ear
but
there
be
six
or
eight
at
this
point
and
it
be
pretty
grim
they
be
work
hard
and
it
look
like
there
be
no
real
end
plus
the
fact
that
go
out
to
see
wally
gilbert
to
see
whether
they
already
have
it
at
biogen
i
thought
maybe
the
easy
path
here
be
to
give
up
it
be
tempt
i
might
have
breathe
a
huge
sigh
of
relief
if
i
get
the
statement
from
wally
gilbert
that
they
already
have
epo
i
would
react
this
be
the
great
we
don
t
have
to
work
on
epo
instead
i
learn
they
do
not
have
the
gene
but
thought
they
be
close
invent
with
recombinant
dna
be
different
from
what
you
encounter
in
most
research
laboratory
because
what
you
be
really
invent
be
something
that
nature
have
already
do
you
know
there
s
an
epo
gene
you
know
it
s
extremely
important
that
s
all
there
to
give
you
the
confidence
with
this
black
hole
that
you
re
mining
into
but
it
s
absolutely
true
you
know
there
be
an
answer
to
this
sometimes
in
program
that
i
do
at
m
you
do
not
know
if
there
be
an
answer
you
be
go
to
try
and
make
a
thing
that
do
this
or
that
but
you
didn
t
know
that
you
be
go
to
be
able
to
do
it
but
if
you
want
molecule
that
be
useful
that
be
self
evidently
veiy
important
you
can
bet
many
human
protein
include
epo
be
go
to
be
important
you
might
not
be
smart
enough
to
know
that
this
could
be
a
billion
dollar
business
but
you
certainly
be
smart
enough
to
know
the
thing
be
extremely
important
and
that
be
the
driver
and
you
know
it
exists
so
that
s
the
driver
tape
side
b
rathmann
the
fact
be
you
always
know
there
be
that
molecule
that
s
important
and
that
keep
you
go
it
be
like
that
for
epo
hughes
what
do
you
have
to
learn
in
run
amgen
that
you
hadn
t
experienced
before
and
what
do
you
get
from
amgen
that
you
hadn
t
gotten
before

rathmann
hughes
rathmann
you
don
t
go
through
twenty
plus
year
of
life
in
a
research
environment
without
experience
a
lot
of
important
stuff
the
thing
that
be
different
w
as
the
dependency
on
outside
finance
that
be
not
exactly
black
and
white
because
when
you
re
at
m
each
year
you
go
before
the
management
and
you
convince
them
of
your
budget
you
know
that
you
ve
get
a
job
to
do
and
if
they
don
t
approve
your
budget
you
have
tough
time
still
in
term
of
the
people
that
you
re
talk
to
they
understand
you
they
put
you
there
in
the
first
place
so
they
certainly
have
some
obligation
to
help
keep
financing
you
so
it
s
really
quite
different
from
the
biotech
industry
the
idea
that
you
re
go
to
be
totally
dependent
upon
stranger
to
loosen
up
with
their
own
private
money
to
keep
your
company
go
be
a
shock
awareness
you
re
not
without
your
negative
example
very
early
there
be
a
subsidiary
of
genentech
it
be
call
armos
they
go
under
after
the
first
five
or
six
month
of
amgen
there
be
just
enough
example
like
that
that
float
to
the
surface
you
watch
company
die
and
you
d
think
wow
this
be
a
different
world
you
can
t
ever
get
a
chip
on
your
shoulder
i
m
entitle
to
financing
the
world
owes
me
this
you
get
pretty
humble
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
be
extremely
humble
in
order
to
get
visibility
with
potential
investor
i
would
crawl
and
creep
to
their
knee
and
say
i
want
to
be
at
your
conference
if
i
possibly
could
you
ve
get
a
wonderful
conference
please
let
us
in
sometimes
we
get
beat
up
because
they
didn
t
want
you
in
because
you
weren
t
useful
you
weren
t
a
big
enough
company
yet
so
you
learn
that
get
money
be
not
only
way
way
up
there
in
your
priority
but
it
s
a
difficult
job
and
unfortunately
you
re
subject
to
such
violent
change
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
the
season
the
cycle
whatever
suddenly
you
have
to
face
the
reality
that
maybe
six
month
ago
you
would
have
do
it
this
way
but
now
you
re
not
go
to
do
it
that
way
right
now
nobody
want
to
make
an
investment
although
as
i
look
over
my
entire
career
start
with
amgen
think
the
investment
climate
have
be
bad
by
substantial
amount
in
the
last
three
or
four
year
than
it
ever
be
i
don
t
remember
it
that
bad
before
but
remember
it
be
still
a
learn
experience
and
one
that
i
certainly
have
not
be
totally
prepared
for
in
my
experience
now
the
second
part
to
your
question
the
second
part
be
what
do
you
get
from
amgen
that
you
hadn
t
gotten
before
in
your
career
it
s
terrible
to
mention
i
hate
to
talk
about
it
but
personal
recognition
when
you
re
at
abbott
lab
or
m
you
could
be
responsible
for
create
a
one
hundred
million
dollar
business
and
probably
nobody
in
the
world
will
really
know
that
and
it
absolutely
happen
you
re
not
be
burden
or
anything
it
s
just
that
you
don
t
feel
that
it
s
necessary
to
be
recognize
because
you
re
part
of
an
organization
that
s
do
it
when
you
re
a
ceo
of
a
new
start
up
right
or
wrong
you
re
go
to
get
the
lion
s
share
of
the
blame
and
the
lion
s
share
of
the
credit
and
it
s
not
a
bad
equation
it
s
fairly
symmetrical
thing
can
go
bad
because
of
change
in
the
business
climate
and
you
re
a
turkey
thing
can
go
bad
because
a
very
good
product
have
one
flaw
and
it
fail
and
you
re
a
turkey
those
be
tough
pronouncement
about
the
value
of
you
as
a
human
be
i
watch
some
wonderful
people
get
treat
pretty
badly
at
various
time
as
a
result
of
their
downturn
in
the
environment
so
you
have
a
sense
of
a
totally
different
dimension
in
term
of
leverage
of
your
own
personal
career
and
your
personal
outlook
you
can
get
pretty
dam
discourage
if
you
happen
to
hit
a
period
like
the
last
couple
of
year
where
it
s
very
hard
to
raise
money
it
s
very
hard
to
get
people
to
think
that

hughes
rathmann
you
re
a
useful
company
it
s
a
tough
life
i
think
i
be
somewhat
harden
to
this
by
some
of
my
past
experience
like
litton
i
think
that
at
amgen
you
feel
a
little
bit
like
the
lone
ranger
that
s
a
great
spot
gieat
horse
but
you
feel
like
there
might
not
be
anybody
there
if
you
need
them
the
reaction
at
amgen
where
that
be
probably
the
clearest
be
that
some
of
the
people
at
abbott
have
come
out
to
see
us
and
have
drawn
the
conclusion
either
by
what
i
say
or
what
i
didn
t
say
that
we
be
probably
fail
during
that
time
they
kind
of
pass
the
word
around
abbott
which
be
a
convenient
thing
to
share
george
be
really
sorry
he
left
abbott
he
bit
off
more
than
he
can
chew
it
s
really
a
tough
thing
these
day
that
s
too
bad
because
he
s
out
there
and
it
s
tough
i
didn
t
feel
that
way
myself
so
that
s
why
i
remember
it
but
i
realize
that
it
be
probably
a
reading
that
people
be
get
from
talk
either
to
me
or
other
people
in
the
company
this
isn
t
fun
anymore
this
be
tough
i
don
t
remember
it
be
that
bad
but
i
do
remember
the
feedback
from
abbott
and
when
do
it
change
pause
well
it
change
up
and
down
when
you
look
at
the
public
offering
we
clocked
it
at
about
sixty
day
from
when
we
get
the
final
board
approval
to
go
public
we
have
sixty
day
of
almost
euphoria
you
re
go
to
go
public
the
value
of
the
company
be
go
to
go
to
two
hundred
million
dollar
stock
option
which
we
all
have
at
one
or
two
dollar
a
share
be
now
worth
eighteen
dollar
a
share
it
s
a
high
but
w
hen
the
stock
get
drubbed
after
go
public
at
its
low
low
you
re
bad
off
than
you
be
before
you
become
a
public
company
i
think
that
change
of
outlook
be
fairly
frequent
but
and
be
certainly
the
most
dramatic
but
when
you
suddenly
have
another
company
tell
you
that
they
own
the
epo
business
that
s
a
downer
beyond
anything
you
can
ever
imagine
and
your
stock
drop
from
forty
dollar
to
twenty
dollar
in
less
than
a
week
and
you
ve
now
lose
your
franchise
epo
be
go
the
genetics
institute
s
patent
issue
so
that
s
about
as
low
as
you
can
go
then
you
come
along
and
you
re
work
and
you
find
yourself
with
a
tremendous
amount
of
talent
work
for
you
and
you
think
i
can
t
really
ask
for
anything
well
than
this
some
of
the
lawyer
that
we
have
be
totally
remarkable
in
this
particular
case
where
we
now
have
to
beat
genetics
institute
in
the
courtroom
when
you
suddenly
find
that
you
have
enormous
talent
work
on
your
side
you
feel
that
you
can
do
it
you
can
do
it
yet
any
bad
day
some
of
your
argument
hit
the
wall
and
don
t
stick
and
you
get
pretty
discourage
with
the
case
and
the
judge
i
watch
the
court
case
almost
day
by
day
for
about
six
month
we
have
go
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
federal
circuit
united
state
court
of
appeal
for
the
federal
circuit
their
decision
take
over
a
year
it
arrive
while
i
be
run
icos
i
get
a
call
about
seven
o
clock
at
night
from
the
top
attorney
at
amgen
say
you
wouldn
t
believe
this
george
but
we
get
it
all
what
do
you
mean
you
get
it
all
how
the
court
of
appeal
for
the
federal
circuit
have
take
our
position
with
respect
to
both
our
patent
and
the
gi
genetics
institute
patent
we
ve
be
vindicate
across
the
hoard
i
say
well
be
this
a
final
decision
he
say
well
you
never
know
but
it
be
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
three
judge
that
advocate
for
us
well
then
gi
appeal
the
decision
meaning
that
all
the
judge
in
the
court
of
appeal
have
to
take
a
vote
that
be
unanimous
in
amgen
s
favor
then
the
people
at
gi
take
it
to
the
supreme
court
to
see
if
they
could
reverse
the
court
of
appeal
decision
we
start
get
our
story

ready
for
the
supreme
court
and
they
hire
attorney
larry
tribe
larry
tribe
have
a
preeminent
reputation
for
bring
case
to
the
supreme
court
and
his
batting
average
be
about
percent
now
the
world
say
amgen
only
have
a
percent
chance
of
win
this
one
that
wasn
t
true
we
could
win
by
never
let
the
supreme
court
decide
they
want
to
take
this
case
and
that
s
what
happen
so
he
s
percent
when
the
supreme
court
decides
to
take
the
case
but
he
s
batting
zero
when
the
supreme
court
pass
it
up
so
the
supreme
court
decide
not
to
review
the
case
and
all
that
weight
drop
off
our
back
although
gradually
emerge
as
a
well
company
and
a
strong
company
with
more
recognition
we
still
have
ups
and
down
that
take
you
down
pretty
low
of
course
right
along
parallel
with
that
be
the
story
with
the
johnson
and
johnson
and
that
s
a
terrible
story
it
s
a
terrible
thing
to
find
yourself
fight
motherhood
for
gosh
sake
johnson
and
johnson
be
really
such
a
wonderful
pure
beautiful
company
with
the
top
ethic
in
the
world
and
so
on
and
you
re
absolutely
convince
they
re
scoundrel
and
they
re
treat
you
very
very
badly
they
re
suppose
to
be
your
partner
and
that
put
them
in
a
great
advantageous
position
to
hurt
you
they
re
get
your
data
and
then
they
re
take
it
to
the
fda
and
say
amgen
s
overdose
they
re
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
we
re
partner
it
be
a
really
terrible
experience
and
that
one
s
not
over
i
be
talk
to
the
attorney
about
another
lawsuit
at
amgen
and
they
say
they
still
have
a
feel
that
there
be
additional
chapter
to
be
played
in
the
j
j
suit
so
it
s
a
rollercoaster
ride
that
take
extraordinary
resilience
one
of
those
dip
be
go
to
get
you
feel
pretty
horrible
but
you
remember
the
fact
that
you
get
through
that
one
there
be
similar
story
the
icos
story
have
similar
event
we
would
think
that
we
have
our
problem
all
behind
us
and
then
would
run
into
a
big
one
and
we
would
think
that
it
be
a
black
tunnel
that
be
never
go
to
change
what
we
gain
from
amgen
be
the
ability
to
deal
with
these
kind
of
problem
a
little
well
the
next
time
probably
a
little
tougher
the
next
time
i
think
each
of
these
experience
be
comfort
so
when
your
partner
start
to
act
up
you
don
t
wait
for
him
to
literally
cream
you
you
go
after
him
right
off
the
bat
when
our
partner
at
icos
start
to
act
up
i
take
a
very
strong
position
i
have
gotten
some
very
good
legal
counsel
before
and
i
go
back
to
the
attorney
that
i
knew
at
amgen
and
he
help
chart
a
strategy
in
which
we
come
off
very
very
very
well
the
fortunate
thing
be
that
all
of
these
thing
be
learn
experience
even
some
of
the
negative
experience
be
still
learn
experience
litton
be
a
learn
experience
but
a
very
negative
experience
amgen
be
largely
positive
and
yet
i
ve
make
some
absolutely
incredible
blunder
in
the
late
company
that
i
ve
be
with
sometimes
by
apply
what
i
thought
i
d
learn
so
what
i
learn
at
icos
be
by
gosh
if
you
re
really
up
against
it
put
your
own
money
on
the
line
and
you
can
turn
it
around
you
can
change
the
worldview
of
your
company
and
turn
it
around
it
help
to
have
bill
gate
with
you
but
it
be
certainly
