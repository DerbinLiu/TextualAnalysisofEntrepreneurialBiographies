an
extraordinary
combination
of
mind
i
have
be
associate
with
warren
buffett
so
long
i
thought
i
would
be
just
a
footnote
charles
t
munger
when
he
be
first
name
to
the
forbes
magazine
list
of
richest
american
in
y
closest
affiliation
with
charlie
munger
be
a
strange
one
say
katharine
graham
retire
publisher
of
the
washington
post
at
first
i
consult
him
because
i
found
myself
in
charge
of
not
only
a
company
but
in
charge
of
child
and
grandchild
trust
and
with
no
experience
i
ask
warren
advice
and
he
do
what
he
very
typically
do
this
be
what
i
think
but
talk
to
my
partner
charlie
he
agrees
with
my
position
in
most
thing
so
i
go
to
talk
to
charlie
in
los
angeles
in
his
office
i
thought
he
be
interest
and
rather
brilliant
of
course
i
take
out
a
yellow
legal
pad
and
start
take
note
this
make
warren
laugh
to
this
day
he
tease
me
about
how
i
take
note
of
charlie
word
of
wisdom
after
warren
buffett
the
billionaire
financier
from
omaha
set
up
a
meeting
between
graham
and
munger
she
say
charlie
and
i
have
a
lively
long
correspondence
it
be
too
strange
graham
kept
a
file
folder
of
the
letter
and
review
it
when
prepare
her
pulitzer
prize
win
autobiography
personal
history
i
look
over
the
correspondence
which
be
the
main
very
close
contact
i
have
i
ca
not
make
out
from
it
why
we
start
write
this
go
on
for
about
year
both
of
us
rid
bicycle
without
use
our
hand
show
off
to
each
other
make
joke
graham
who
in
her
shy
retire
way
always
worried
that
her
best
effort
be
not
good
enough
finally
realize
that
for
the
most
part
he
be
reassure
me
that
i
be
do
well
than
i
thought
the
thing
that
strike
me
be
how
strongly
alike
warren
and
charlie
sound
the
voice
the
manner
and
the
humor
say
graham
they
play
off
each
other
and
tease
each
other
and
they
do
make
to
my
mind
a
most
extraordinary
combination
of
mind
i
heard
about
charlie
munger
in
explain
buffett
who
year
later
would
become
america
wealthy
citizen
i
be
manage

very
small
scale
in

about
dorothy
davis
be
the
wife
of
edwin
davis
the
most
prominent
doctor
in
town
i
knew
about
them
and
they
knew
about
my
family
i
go
over
to
their
apartment
mr
davis
be
very
sharp
i
explain
how
i
ran
money
dr
davis
paid
no
attention
when
i
be
do
they
confer
then
agree
to
invest
i
say
to
dr
davis

i
like
him
already
when

be
grow
up
in
omaha
in
the
s
and
s
the
davis
family
be
both
neighbor
and
close
friend
the
doctor
be
a
little
unusual
but
a
very
talented
odd
fellow
and
certainly
the
buffett
investment
work
out
very
well
for
the
davis
family
say
charlie
the
money
the
davis
place
with
warren
represent
most
of
their
net
worth
eddie
davis
be
a
little
odd
and
he
get
odder
as
he
get
old
concur
buffett
he
finally
get
a
little
senile
later
when
he
be
add
to
his
investment
with
me
he
start
make
the
check
out
to
charlie

i
told
eddie
i
do
not
mind
you
confuse
the
two
of
us
under
many
circumstance
but
make
the
check
out
to
warren
buffett
two
year
after
buffett
first
heard
charlie
name
the
two
men
met
in
when

come
back
to
help
settle
up
the
davis
arrange
a
dinner
we
hit
it
off
immediately
say
buffett
the
davis
that
warren
now
refer
to
be
not
the
doctor
and
his
wife
but
rather
the
davis
child
who
have
be
charlie
childhood
playmate
both
davis
boy
eddie
and
neil
become
doctor
and
by
then
the
daughter
willa

be
married
to
omaha
businessman
lee
seemann
it
be
neil
who
arrange

at
the
old
omaha
club
the
party
include
willa
and
lee
seemann
joan
and
neil
davis
charlie
and
warren
it
be
electric
in
a
really
nice
way
recall
willa
munger
have
heard
other
people
mention
warren
as
well
but
he
do
not
have
particularly
high
expectation
about
meeting
him
i
knew
everyone
in
the
buffett
family
except
warren
say
charlie
munger
notice
a
few
thing
about
the
bespectacled
young
man
right
away
he
have
a
crew
cut
warren
be
work
out
of
a
sunporch
at
his
house
and
his
dietary
habit
be
toward
pepsi
salt
nut
and
no
vegetable
charlie
who
considers
himself
fairly
tolerant
about
such
matter
say
even
i
get
surprised
watch
warren
eat
breakfast
his
minimal
expectation
of
the
meeting
be
unjustified
munger
who
be
reserve
in
his
judgment
be
floor
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
recognize
almost
instantly
what
a
remarkable
person
warren
be
charlie
begin
ask
question
immediately
about
what
buffett
do
for
a
living
and
how
he
do
it
and
be
fascinate
by
what
he
heard
the
follow
even
another
mutual
friend
dick
holland
invite
both
to
dinner
warren
who
be
then
and
charlie
year
old
again
fell
into
deep
conversation
charlie
be
so
wrap
up
in
what
he
be
say
that
when
he
raise
his
glass
to
sip
his
drink
he
held
his
other
hand
up
to
stop
anyone
else
from
interrupt
the
conversation
the
timing
be
propitious
for
the
two
to
meet
charlie
beloved
father
have
die
and
buffett
mentor
benjamin
graham
have
retire
from
invest
and
move
from
new
york
to
los
angeles
as
graham
become
less
interested
in
investment
problem
warren
felt
the
loss
he
need
a
new
sound
board
it
may
be
precisely
because
munger
be
so
similar
to
graham
in
his
thought
process
honest
realistic
profoundly
curious
and
unfettered
by
conventional
think
that
he
capture
buffett
attention
in
the
first
place
i
think
charlie
be
a
lot
more
like
ben
graham
than
charlie
know
explain
louis
simpson
co
chairman
of
geico
and
the
man
believe
to
stand
second
in
line
should
buffett
or
munger
become
unable
to
run
berkshire
hathaway
charlie
take
the
academic
approach
but
also
have
interest
in
a
lot
of
different
thing
in
his
reading
his
taste
be
eclectic
buffett
who
be
know
for
his
single
mind
focus
on
invest
agree
that
munger
be
like
graham
in
his
wide
range
of
interest
charlie
mind
have
a
great
span
than
i
do
he
have
read
more
biography
hundred
per
year
he
soak
them
up
and
remembers
them
by
the
time
fidel
castro
seize
power
in
cuba
and
the
youthful
john
f
kennedy
be
elect
u
s
president
buffett
and
munger
have
become
mental
partner
a
relationship
that
involve
no
contract
or
title
at
least
in
the
begin
it
be
more
like
a
brother
act
than
a
business
arrangement
buffett
say
base
on
mutual
trust
and
confidence
it
grow
discussion
by
discussion
meeting
by
meeting
deal
by
deal
though
charlie
have
live
only
block
from
the
buffett
home
in
omaha
and
have
work
in
the
buffett
family
store
as
a
teenager
the
six
year
difference
in
their
age
kept
them
in
separate
circle
yet
it
be
the
common
thread
that
allow
the
two
to
make
an
immediate
connection
if
you
think
of
charlie
and
warren
as
boy
they
be
very
similar
observe
munger
old
daughter
molly
similar

one
of
those
alone
would
make
a
friendship
munger
and
buffett
have
something
else
in
common
like
warren
i
have
a
considerable
passion
to
get
rich
say
charlie
who
early
on
earn
his
living
as
a
lawyer
not
because
i
want
ferraris
i
want
the
independence
i
desperately
want
it
i
thought
it
be
undignified
to
have
to
send
invoice
to
other
people
i
do
not
know
where
i
get
that
notion
from
but
i
have
it
charles

charlie
do
the
talk
buffett
claimed
at
one
of
berkshire
hathaway
annual
meeting
i
just
move
my
lip
one
year
buffett
field
a
question
from
a
shareholder
then
pass
the
query
on
to
munger
who
give
the
expect
reply
i
have
get
nothing
to
add
buffett
who
tease
munger
unmercifully
chuckle
sometimes
he
subtracts
warren
and
charlie
put
on
an
entertain
show
at
the
berkshire

they
also

business
and
investment
philosophy
of
one
of
america
most
talk
about
but
least
understood

yet
buffett
be
indisputably
the
star
of
the
event
and
his
personality
take
the
spotlight
charlie
munger
have
perfect
his
role
as
the
curmudgeonly
sidekick
and
in
fact
seem
to
enjoy
the
straight
man

but
that
guy
you
see
sit
next

to
get
on
with
it
i
think
he
work
well
in

at
the

as
similar

they
seem
buffett

munger
also
be
quite
differentopposites
in
some
way
whereas
buffett
specializes
in
simple
language
folksy
story
and
allegory
munger
grant
nothing
to

if
he
can
use

word
when
a
small

munger
thrives

own
seven

and
finally
munger
be
a
staunch
republican
while
buffett
call
himself
mostly
a
democrat
munger
personal
life
have
be
difficult
and
at
time
even
tragic
and
money
do
not
come
to
him
as
easily
as
it
seem
to
come
to
buffett
yet
as
with
other
great
partnership
such
as
those
involve
microsoft
founder
bill

and
paul
allen
sony

akio

masaru

or
buffett
early
mentor
ben
graham
and
his
partner
jerry
newman
there
be
a
synergy
even
a
magic
in
the
relationship
each
man
be
talented
on
his
own
each
would
have
attain
great
wealth
and
live
an
interest
life
separately
but
both
have
gap
in
their
personality
or
skill
that
be
fill
in
by
the
other
the
two
fare
much
well
as
a
duo
than
either
could
do
independently
as
munger
often
say
you
can
get
lollapalooza
result
when
you
bring
together
the
right
combination
of
factor
buffett
have
formal
training
in
business
and
finance
but
not
in
law
munger
have
be
a
corporate
lawyer
and
though
he
have
experience
in
operating
business
he
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
be
a
professional
investor
you
know
the
cliche
that
opposite
attract
munger
say
well
opposite
do
not
attract
everybody
engage
in
complicate
work
need
colleague
just
the
discipline
of
have
to
put
your
thought
in
order
with
somebody
else
be
a
very
useful
thing
in
munger
buffett
found
someone
who
share
his
value
and
goal
and
to
whom
he
could
talk
on
a
sophisticated
level
one
of
the
great
similarity
between
the
two
men
be
their
sense
of
humor
like
many
midwesterners
they
have
learn
to
deal
with
discomfort
stress
surprise
and
even
grief
by
make
joke
humor
break
the
tension
provide
psychological
protection
and
allows
them
to
assert
dominance
over
their
circumstance
munger
brought
more
than
comradeship
to
the
mix
though
buffett
have
inherit
a
group
of
former
graham
newman
investor
and
be
busily
recruiting
money
from
nebraskan
munger
spread
the
word
about
buffett
skill
in
california

million
more
dollar
into
his
investment
pool

most
of
which

of

later
buffett

that

to
catch
a

and
just
walk
off
despite
munger

he

wo
not

unflagging
conception

the
whole
point
of
fishing
as
the
welcome
opportunity
to
carry
small
boat
through
swamp
and
otherwise
suffer
in
reach
fishing
that

for
the

have
well
success
with
something
else
at
one

he
be
dedicate
to
a

jig
day
in
and
day
out

guess
it
work
but
if
i
be
out
on
a
day
when
the

be
athletic
but
he
be
not
a
highly
skilled
swimmer
i
have
to
help
warren
the
story
have
be
a
little
stretch
admit
guerin
we
know
warren
be
go
to
live
with
or
without
me
i
have
often
say
since
if
he
be
in
real
trouble
i
would
have
make
a
deal
before
i
help
him
get
a

preserver
i
would
have
be
chairman

that
mishap
conclude
guerin
be
why
charlie
friend
sometimes
call
him

despite
the
misadventure
guerin
say
that
the
time
he
spent
at
ca

that
summer
be
an
invaluable
first
step
in
his
recovery
from

he
say
it
show
him
that
munger
and
buffett
be
more
than
just
business
associate
warren
give
me
the
great
gift
he

give
three
day
of
his

charlie
give
that
too
we
try
to
be
realistic
and
smart
and
logical
all
the
time
but
there
be
another
side
to
it
the
way
buffett
react
to
the
boat
accident
be
typical
of
the
business
relationship
between
him
and
munger
even
when
i
take
him
fishing
in
minnesota

buffett
ever
join
the
family
at

munger

as
homage
to

supportive
father
although
al
munger
be
by
any
measure
a
successful
and
respect
attorney
i
think
it
be
fair
to
say

never
achieve
the
height
his
son
do
say
molly
his
great
achievement
be

al
munger
say
charlie
be
one
of
the
happiest
men
who

achieve
exactly
what
he
wish
to
achieve
no
more
or
less
he
face
all
trouble
with
less
fuss
than
either
his
father
or
his

each
of
whom
spent
considerable
time
foresee
trouble
that
never
happen
he
have
exactly
the
marriage
and
family
life
that
be
his
high
hope
he
have
pal
he
love
and
who
love
him
include
one
in
ten
thousand
type
like

mcfayden
he
own
the
best
hunt
dog
in
nebraska
which
meant
a
lot
to
him
i
do
not
see
my
father
as
less
successful
in
the
sense
that
really
matter
he
be
just
differently
aim
and
live
in
a
time
when

warren

say
that
al
and

have
none
of
the
tension
or
jealousy
that
sometimes
muddies
a
father
son
relationship
charlie
once
say
that
if
he
would
come
home
at
midnight
and
say
dad
you
have
get
to
help
me
bury
this
body
in
the
basement
his
father
would
have
gotten
up
and
help
him
bury
the
body
then
the
next
morning
he
would
have
go
to

convincing
charlie
he
would
do
something
wrong
al
munger
always
take
an
interest
in
his
son
hobby
then
as
charlie
would
outgrow
them
or
lose
interest
or
go
on
to
some
new
stage
in
life
his

carry
the

i
have
the
example
in
early

it
be
the
physicist
approach

solve
that
make
a
lifelong
impression
on
him
the

of
always
look
for
the

in
the
most
fundamental
way
available
that
be
a
great
tradition

it
save
a

of
time
in

of
course
the

be
hard
enough
that
you
have
to
learn
to
have
what
some
people
call
assiduity
well
i
have
always

how
to

munger
concedes

i

very
deep
appreciation
of

i
find
the

he
be
not

be
an
ordinary
soldier

charlie

he
never

as
that
and
for
a
professor
at
a
prestigious
university
it
be
necessary
to
be
like
homer
joe
stewart
to
go
into
a
call
where
he
would
not
be

not
in
charlie

despite
the

that
al

have
graduate
from

with

over
the
objection
of

through
the
intervention
of

native
pound
be
the
retire
dean

story
that
pound
be
a
polymathic
su
pergenius
who
as
dean
seldom
convene
faculty
meeting
because
he
figure
he
could
make
well
decision
by
himself
when
munger
face
with
rejection
ask
to
confer
with
pound
seavy
warn
charlie
that
the
dean
would
agree
that
he
should
finish
college
before
go
to

reply
we
will
see
when
charlie
call
upon
him
to
plead
his
case
pound
review
the
transcript
of
the
work
munger
already
have
complete
after
reach
a
favorable
conclusion
pound
contact
the
new
law
school
dean
and
saw
to
it
that
munger
be
admit
harvard
flexibility
prove
sound
by
the
end
of
charlie
first
year
he
won
a
sears
prize
for
place
second
in
his
class
nonetheless
in
retrospect
charlie
consider
himself
prepared
enough
for
harvard
law
but
inadequately
prepared
for
life
i
come
to
harvard
law
school
very
poorly
educate
with
desultory
work
habit
and
no
college
degree
at
the
th
anniversary
celebration
of
sec
candy
munger
and
buffett
spent
nearly
an
hour
take
question
from
the
audience
one
see
employee
ask
the
two
men
what
their
most
important
school
experience
be
i
hurry
through
school
say
munger
i
do
not
think
i
be
a
fair
example
hof
an
ideal
education
and
i
do
not
think
you
be
either
warren
i
learn
well
sort
of
plow
through
write
material
by
myself
i
have
do
a
lot
of
that
in
my
life
i
frequently
like
the
eminent
dead
well
than
the
live
teacher
buffett
confess
that
his
main
objective
in
college
be
get
out
he
be
impatient
to
get
on
with
life
and
start
his
career
as
an
investor
though
buffett
say
that
attend
graduate
school
at
columbia
university
and
study
under
the
legendary
investor
benjamin
graham
be
one
of
the
most
important
thing
he
do
charles
munger
once
described
himself
as
have
a
black
belt
in
chutzpah
and
probably
that
trait
help
him
rise
to
the
challenge
he
have
grown
up
in
the
household
of
a
judge
and
a
business
lawyer
and
have
be
expose
to
lawyerly
think
all
of
his
life
he
also
be
opinionated
almost
to
the
point
of
arrogance
when
a
professor
call
upon
him
to
answer
a
question
that
munger
be
not
prepared
for
he
respond
have
not
read
the
case
but
if
you
give
me
the
fact
i
will
give
you
the
law
munger
later
come
to
realize
that
conversational
gambit
of
that
type
be
foolish
and
impede
his
progress
in
life
remember
the
incident
munger
say
he
do
not
know
why
he
behave
so
badly
but
he
think
it
may
have
be
partly
due
to
hereditary
factor
that
he
have
subdue
but
not
conquer
he
have
admit
in
fact
that
he
apparently
be
behind
the
door
when
humility
be
hand
out
one
of
charlie
harvard
law
classmate
henry
gross
become
a
successful
investment

defend
munger
when
an
acquaintance
remark
that
prosperity
be

charlie
pompous
nonsense
say
gross
i
knew
him
when
he
be
young
and
poor
he
be
always
pompous
munger
can
be
highly
self
assure
and
sometimes
reactive
but
what
save
him
be
that
his
opinion
be
not
set
in
stone
james
sinegal

and
chief
executive
officer
for

an

if
you
do
not
buy
off
on
his
viewpoint
he
do
not

he
be

nonetheless
oberer
stayed
the

to

at

after

he
talk
to
his

about

to

law
but
despite
the
connection
that
charlie
might
enjoy
there
al
munger
advise
against
it
apparently
al
felt
that
omaha
be
too
small
it
pond
for
charlie
even
though
omaha
be
an
affluent

city
headquarters
to
the
union
pacific
railroad
several
agricultural
corporation
and
numerous
insurance
company
charlie
would
not
be
challenged
by
the
practice
that
he
could
build
there
besides
that
charlie
be
enchant
by
pasadena
and
take
with
the
californian
he
would
met
charlie
nancy

would
head
hack
west
al
munger
approve
even
though
his
personal
experience
in
california
have
be
discourage
he
have
visit
los

right
after
the
end
of

i
with
a
view
to
possibly

however
appalled
by
the
lack
of

he
have
declare
there
be
no
future
in
this

he
return

only
to
have
his
son
grow
up
and
make
the
opposite
decision
even
munger
own
child
think
it
be
odd
in
some
way
that
charlie
would
end
up
such
an
integral
part
of
the
most
nontraditional
city
in

to
surf
he

taste
for

when

when
i
be
than
i
do
when
i

i
do
not

any
feel

terrible
regret

a
different
situation
year
later
munger
compare
the
marriage
process
to
the
investment
process
though
perhaps
he
be
not
speak
specifically
of
his
own
experience
life
be
a
whole
series
of
opportunity
cost
say
charlie
you
have
get
to
marry
the
best
person
who
be
convenient
to
find
that
will
have
you
an
investment
be
much
the
same
sort
of
process
that
pragmatic
statement
mask
his
devotion
to
his
second
wife
nancy
and
certainly
throw
up
a
shield
around
the
trouble
and
sorrow
munger
experienced
before
he
finally
settle
into
a
happy
situation
the
second
nancy
insists
charlie
be
very
affectionate
but
say
he
be
a
little
uptight
about
show
his
feeling
charles
munger
jr
nancy
and
charlie
first
son
suggest
that
his
father
strength
his
ability
to
resolutely
move
on
from
the
past
also
be
his
achilles
heel
his
son
die
his
marriage
end
he
lose
a
lot
of
money
say
charles
jr
he
just
walk
away
from
that
emotionally
dad
say
to
himself
that
do
not
work
do
not
revisit
it
there
be
some
thing
my

could
deal
with
well
if
he
face
them
more
my
dad
if
he
have
a
bad
experience
in
a
town
in
a
restaurant
he
would
not
go
back
i
would
try
again
and
yet
munger
do
try
marriage
again
and
in
this
second
union
say
charles
both
mom
and
dad
found
what
they
lack
in
their
first

of
a
large

about
to
be
realize
and
munger
be
determine
that
the

would
be
raise
and
educate
well
he
knew
that
if
he
be
to
earn
sufficient
income
he
would
have
to
apply
all
his
talent
to
the
task
he
already
be
a
hard
charge
lawyer
and
gradually
his
need
for
additional
income
drew
him
into
the
business
world
he
be
always
interested
in
money
recall
molly

for
the
island
he
be
go
to
build
a
house
build
apartment
he
have
these
enthusiasm
for
his
project
and
his
future
his
present
it
be
not
as
if
you
have
to
deny
yourself
in
the
present
for
the
future
the
focus
be
on
how
interest
thing
be
today
how
much
fun
to
see
them
built
it
be
so
much
fun
be
in
the
moment
that
be
what
he
always
communicate
chapter
f
i
v
e
put
together
a
new
life
i
like
the
independence
of
a
capitalist
and
i
always
have
sort
of
a
gamble
personality
i
like
figure
thing

i
simply

everything
go
very
well

then
scold
tolles
for
not

about

that
she
have
be
a
phi
beta
kappa
student
my
mother
and
charlie
be

particularly
gladly
or
want
to
waste
time
explain
nancy
eldest

hal
borthwick

think
that

both
have
relatively
unfortunate
divorce
in
term
of
what
be
involve
in
term
of
emotional
intensity
and
what
not
i
think
they
make
a
fairly
quick
decision
as
to
whether
the
other
person
be
worth
a
second
look
it
be
clear
the
prospect
struck
them
both
as
promising
no
one
would
write
a
novel
this
way
no
one
would
ever
name
both

longer
in
the
picture
he
stuck
around
for
a
while
after

but
not
long
say

go
back
over
to
honolulu
where
the
family
have
a
mortuary
and
other

while

then
he
move
to
the
philippine
and
he
be
there
for
many
year
he
have
various
business
interest
include
some
memorial
park
and
stuff
like
that
it
be
many
year
before
hal
and
david
borthwick
natural
father
return
to
the
united
state
and
by
that
time
the
young
men
be
well
assimilate
into
the
munger
clan
for
hal
the
integration
start
quickly
but
do
not
go
smoothly
i
know
that
i
have
felt
myself
to
be
somewhat
the
man
of
the
house
even
as
young
as
i
be
say
hal
charlie
would
take
mother
out
for
a
date
and
i
would
be
up
wait
for
mother
when
she
come
home
whether
i
be
suppose
to
be
in
bed
or
not
hal
feeling
intensified
once
there
be
another
man
in
the
house
my
personality
be
one
of
want
to
acquire
whatever
amount
of
territory
i
can
expand
into
admit
borthwick
and
so
i
have
acquire
territory
that
i
be
go
to
be
depose
from
and
it
happen
it
be
as
simple
as
that
behavioral
issue
i
use
to
pound
on
my
young
brother
a
lot
and
charlie
make
short
work
of
all
that
it
be
not
easy
to
go
through
a
divorce
to
lose
your
dad
i
be
old
enough
so
i
remember
the
thing
that
kid
can
remember
about
divorce
fight
and
stuff
like
that
my
brother
david
be
too
young
so
he
do
not
have
the
same
experience
set
that
i
do
but
i
still
have
damage
from
that
borthwick
say
his
new
stepfather
be
not
afraid
to
spank
though
charlie
have
to
be
push
before
he
would
do
so
and
the
spanking
be
not
severe
borthwick
say
lie
be
the
type
of
child
who
need
discipline
and
benefit
from
it
my
brother
david
on
the
other
hand
be
not
that
kind
of
child
i
be
not
aware
of
any
of
the
other
child
that
get
paddle
as
much
as
i
do
i
be
sure
charlie
do
not
particularly
enjoy
it
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
get
the
job
do
the
territorial
issue
take
several
year
to
resolve
since
borthwick
be
a
particularly
pugnacious
boy
and
during
that
time
hal
felt
angry
i
give
those
concession
up
grudgingly
but
ultimately
i
come
to
accept
charlie
as
my
father
in
every
sense
of
the
word
other
than
biological
say
borthwick
because
what
i
be
today
you
know
he
have
contribute
to
materially
the
way
i
approach
life
my
value
structure
and
what
i
will
and
wo
not
do
in
the
meantime
the
brother
and
sister
just
kept
arrive
there
be
year
between
the
old
and
young
explain
charles
jr
molly
and
hal
be
together
david
and
wendy
now
the
age
difference
matter
less
but
most
of
the
time
the
family
be
a
fuzzy
muddle
carol
estabrook
say
that
the
commotion
at
home
suit
her
brother
perfectly
i
think
he
would
have
have
child
it
be
not
from
a
lonely
childhood
he
be
always
gregarious
friendly
he
have
lot
of
friend
perhaps
it
be
the
example
of
the
big
relaxed
family
gathering
at
his
great
grandfather
house
in
iowa
maybe
lie
be
inspire
by
the
memory
of
the
gang
of
child
at
star
island
in
the
summer
i
do
not
see
life
as
a
breeder
derby
say
charlie
however
he
add
i
be
very
glad
to
have
have
child
i
do
not
want
to
crow
that
they
be
superstar
hut
we
be
pleased
with
them
all
regardless
of
his
motivation
for
have
them
the
upbringing
of
eight
child
be
a
daunt
financial
task
the
family
go
to
star
island
in
the
summer
partly
because
it
be
an
inexpensive
vacation
for
such
a
big
crowd
the
pressure
on
nancy
be
tremendous
but
she
recognize
the
need
to
build
both
family
and
financial
stability
the
early
clay
be
the
scrap
by
clay
note
charles
jr
try
to
reestablish
themselves
after
their
life
have
hit
the
rock
she
back
the
plan
she
be
face
with
a
number
of
child
for
so
long
mother
mother
or
marv
rhodes
mom
childhood
nurse
look
after
us
sometimes
my
grandfather
barry
have
built
a
house
on
diamond
head
road
in
honolulu
and
our
parent
go
there
at
the
end
of
a
week
vacation
at
the
thought
of
go
back
my
mother
burst
into
tear
the
work
at
home
be
overwhelm
nancy
reaction
be
not
surprising
consider
her
many
duty
but
it
seem
out
of
character
mother
be
emotionally
stable
say
barry
munger
she
do
not
suffer
from
much
self
doubt
self
criticism
she
be
very
loyal
family
be
a
sacrament
charlie
be
not
the
sort
of
man
who
come
home
and
help
with
the
laundry
in
the
evening
and
nancy
do
not
expect
that
of
him
i
think
my
mother
give
him
an
incredible
amount
of
latitude
to
concentrate
on
his
affair
and
career
say
emilie
munger
she
do
everything
in
the
home
i
expect
my
husband
to
help
with
the
boy
and
go
on
family
outing
on
the
weekend
the
view
a
munger
child
have
of
charlie
presence
in
the
home
varies
somewhat
depend
on
whether
a
young
or
an
old
child
be
ask
to
the
old
child
charlie
seem
always
to
be
work
the
young
child
come
along
when
he
be
more
firmly
establish
and
to
them
lie
seem
less
busy
i
be
not
try
to
paint
an
idea
of
a
desert
devoid
of
all
interaction
between
father
and
son
say
hal
borthwick
there
be
family
trip
we
would
fish
back
in
minnesota
and
thing
like
that
but
he
be
a
very
very
busy
man
in
those
year
nevertheless
recall
one
of
the
young
child
barry
he
be
always
there
he
be
not
the
type
of
father
who
take
off
on
ski
trip
or
on
business
trip
he
be
always
principally
there
but
he
have
an
active
business
and
social
life
a
lot
of
preoccupation
to
emilie
munger
third
from
the
young
my
father
seem
like
a
traditional
father
everyone
dad
be
go
to
the
office
come
back
to
dinner
we
all
sat
down
together
for
dinner
i
do
not
have
the
feel
that
he
be
go
a
lot
he
played
golf
on
saturday
be
around
sunday
morning
he
be
not
that
involve
in
day
to
day
discipline
but
be
a
strong
figure
so
you
knew
if
you
ever
broke
a
cardinal
rule
you
would
be
in
trouble
barry
described
his
father
as
high
energy
out
the
door
early
in
the
morning
and
back
in
the
door
for
dinner
he
brought
project
home
and
turn
his
attention
to
those
after
the
even
meal
he
could
go
for
a
long
time
on
nervous
energy
on
family
flight
family
trip
he
would
get
on
a
a
m
flight
my
mother
do
not
function
early
she
get
up
early
but
would
rather
not
rush
out
the
door
charlie
habitually
do
several
thing
at
once
he
would
sit
in
a
chair
in
the
even
and
read
a
book
at
the
same
time
follow
and
interject
comment
into
the
family
conversation
both
parent
be
stiff
upper
lip
type
they
be
a
team
say
barry
you
would
never
play
one
parent
off
another
you
would
never
have
have
success
their
basic
feeling
about
raise
child
what
they
be
allow
to
do
not
do
be
similar
when
we
be
young
a
lot
of
attention
be
paid
just
to
keep
us
from
tear
up
the
car
he
be
strict
but
not
the
great
santini
you
would
not
lip
off
to
him
they
be
not
the
type
of
people
you
would
do
that
to
in
the
height
of
adolescence
i
would
mouth
off
be
sulky
i
have
the
closest
thing
to
a
classic
adolescence
of
the
young
child
but
i
would
say
in
term
of
my
peer
i
be
mild
i
do
not
run
away
from
home
we
be
not
hell
raiser
despite
the
constant
trip
to
school
conference
dental
appointment
and
load
of
luggage
when
they
go
anywhere
those
early
year
bond
three
family
into
one
mother
treat
molly
and
wendy
as
if
they
be
her
own
recall
charles
jr
father
treat
her
boy
as
if
they
be
his
own
they
forge
a
real
family
he
do
not
say
child
and
stepchild
he
simply
say
we
have
eight
child
say
wendy
munger
he
do
not
differentiate
that
be
just
typical
in
his
treatment
of
the
grandchild
there
be
no
distinguish
he
do
not
care
at
all
it
be
unimportant
to
him
even
the
soft
spoken
david
borthwick
who
buck
the
family
trend
and
become
what
charlie
call
a
coupon
clipper
be
deeply
ground
in
be
a
munger
molly
live
fifteen
or
more
mile
away
in
the
suburb
of
pasadena
with
another
set
of
parent
but
she
also
felt
part
of
her
father
life
he
bought
me
this
car
when
i
be
in
high
school
say
molly
here
he
be
struggle
away
but
i
be
drive
the
mustang
car
with
the
white
landau
top
i
have
a
clothes
allowance
he
be
always
there
for
me
i
felt
completely
take
care
of
it
be
not
just
financial
that
be
nice
but
if
he
have
not
have
that
he
would
have
have
something
else
emilie
munger
now
have
three
small
child
of
her
own
she
say
motherhood
have
prompt
her
to
wonder
how
her
parent
manage
to
raise
eight
successful
child
who
share
similar
standard
and
who
get
along
well
together
as
parent
part
of
their
success
be
in
transmit
value
human
morality
and
ethical
code
to
their
child
say
emilie
it
be
not
through
organize
religion
we
go
to
sunday
school
at
the
episcopalian
church
we
learn
the
golden
rule
the
basic
rule
but
it
almost
evolve
through
their
example
i
think
he
teach
through
tell
story
about
people
who
be
admirable
in
his
eye
and
those
who
be
not
he
be
not
hover
over
us
and
tell
us
what
be
right
or
wrong
with
our
own
behavior
the
sibling
truly
enjoy
one
another
company
there
be
not
a
lot
of
the
weird
thing
that
can
happen
between
brother
and
sister
parent
and
child
partly
because
we
be
all
pretty
moral
and
honest
the
munger
child
often
harken
hack
to
the
lesson
they
have
learn
from
grow
up
around
it
father
with
definite
idea
of
right
and
wrong
hal
borthwick
say
charlie
drum
in
the
notion
that
a
person
should
always
do
the
best
that
you
can
do
never
tell
a
lie
if
you
say
you
be
go
to
do
it
get
it
clone
nobody
give
a
shit
about
an
excuse
leave
for
the
meeting
early
do
not
be
late
but
if
you
be
late
do
not
bother
give
people
excuse
just
apologize
they
be
due
the
apology
but
they
be
not
interested
in
an
excuse
by
the
way
those
be
very
useful
rule
especially
for
people
who
have
decide
to
go
into
service
business
people
be
pay
for
your
service
with
their
own
money
return
your
call
quickly
the
other
thing
be
the
five
second
no
you
have
get
to
make
your
mind
up
you
do
not
leave
people
hang
he
ask
us
to
do
something
recall
emilie
if
we
come
hack
and
say
we
could
not
because
of
this
reason
or
that
he
would
send
us
hack
out
to
solve
the
problem
and
keep
our
word
fine
tune
your
judgment
nancy
agree
that
charlie
limited
involvement
at
home
and
her
acceptance
of
that
seem
unusual
but
it
be
typical
of
their
generation
he
be
not
much
of
a
helpmate
around
the
house
i
always
say
he
life
in
a
lovely
hotel
that
others
maintain
he
be
no
potterer
nancy
work
hard
but
the
whole
family
knew
charlie
also
work
hard
to
keep
up
his
end
of
the
domestic
bargain
he
be
in
his
midthirties
start
his
financial
life
over
again
and
manage
several
career
at
once
nancy
use
to
tell
their
friend
that
charlie
be
a
young
man
in
a
hurry
in
a
hurry
to
live
a
full
life
in
a
hurry
to
get
rich
he
often
approach
family
life
much
like
an
executive
would
deal
with
a
business
situation
nancy
explain
he
be
always
ready
to
advise
and
assist
the
child
and
the
opportunity
come
along
fairly
often
when
they
grow
old
however
we
try
to
limit
advice
to
one
or
two
important
issue
though
charlie
be
reticent
about
express
his
feeling
verbally
molly
say
it
be
clear
that
he
have
always
felt
deeply
about
his
family
it
be
just
that
a
show
of
feeling
might
be
dangerous
he
probably
feel
that
if
he
ever
begin
he
would
be
overwhelmed
by
his
emotion
say
molly
but
it
be
very
much
there
we
all
wish
he
would
show
it
more
up
front
they
both
come
from
old
fashion
repressive
background
she
be
be
very
understand
and
just
work
along
with
what
it
be
in
addition
to
her
domesticity
nancy
be
charlie
intellectual
equal
someone
with
whom
he
could
discus
idea
though
it
be
common
for
nancy
and
charlie
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
both
talk
simultaneously
on
nancy
seventieth
birthday
there
be
a
big
party
say
warren
buffett
i
thought
about
it
and
decide
to
get
her
a
purple
heart
buffett
search
around
in
omaha
until
he
found
an
old
soldier
medal
in
a
pawn
shop
in
the
manger
hancock
park
neiciii
oihiood
all
the
family
seem
equally
prosperous
nobody
make
a
big
splash
say
charles
jr
except
craig
hoffman
dad
who
ran
a
candy
company
which
we
tour
charles
jr
do
not
even
know
what
his
father
do
for
a
living
i
never
have
a
sense
of
his
career
dad
woke
up
and
left
the
house
between
and
a
m
and
would
come
home
between
and
rm
dinner
be
at
that
be
our
routine

sometimes
found

for
his

brashness
and
tendency
to
show
off
his
brain
his
friend
chuck
rickershauser
told
charlie
that
when
he
first
start
out
in

the
correct
path
be
explain
to
him
by
a
senior
partner
you
must
always
remember
that
your
duty
be
to
conduct
yourself
so
that
everyone
appraises
you
no
high
than
the
third
smartest
person
in
the
room
the
client
must
be
make
to
appear
smartest
with
me
the
next
smartest
and
only
after
this
should
any
wisdom
seem
to
reside
in
you
the
lead
partner
at
musick
peeler
be
roy
garrett
and
though
munger
admire
garrett
legal
skill
and
his
ability
to
attract
important
business
to
the
firm
he
and
garrett
never
become
as
close
as
munger
be
to
peeler
despite
the
fact
that
garrett
give
some
of
his
personal
legal
work
to
munger
for
handle
charlie
say
that
deep
down
he
knew
garrett
do
not
like
him
very
well
roy
garrett
be
a
dominant
personality
and
he
and
i
naturally
clashed
say
munger
one
day
fairly
early
in
our
relationship
he
call
me
in
and
chewed
me
out
for
run
up
of
billable

with
no
collection
on
sonic
small
look
account
he
have
assign
to
me
i
reply
roy
you
have
no
right
to
talk
to
me
this
way
until
the
first
time
i
fail
you
in
billing
and
collection
and
we
left
it
at
that
a
couple
of
week
later
i
collect
this
sort
of
be
right
get
mixed
reaction
from
roy
charlie
live
by
principle
he
would
learn
at
his
grandfather
kneefirst
the
surest
way
of
building
a
business
be
by
concentrate
on
the
work
already
on
his
desk
and
second
by
underspend
his
income
and
amass
a
pile
of
cash
that
could
be
invest
to
build
future
wealth
munger
learn
a
lot
about

as
an
attorney

in
an
international
harvester
dealership
twentiethcentury
fox
he
be
always
see
reality
he
be
unable
to
be
around
a
problem
without
think
about
it
even
thing
that
be
merely
near
at
hand
receive
close
scrutiny
include
an
excellent
mining
property
in
california
mojave
desert
i
would
like
to
own
that
boron
mine
boron
be
an
element
the
mine
be
in
an
open
pit
in
a
safe
country
it
have
low
cost
and
big
reserve
say
munger
it
would
be
a
really
nice
mine
to
own
but
it
be
already
own
by
someone
who
know
it
be
a
very
nice
mine
some
of
his
client
unfortunately
be
not
the
type
that
charlie
would
have
like
them
to
be
he
begin
to
think
more
about
his
father
reaction
when
they
discuss
one
of
al
client
omaha
auto
dealer
grant
mcfayden
i
once
complain
that
he
al
munger
should
have
more
client
like
grant
mcfayden
and
few
like
a
certain
other
man
charlie
say
i
can
remember
my
father
mock
horror
when
he
explain
how
mcfayden
treat
his
customer
right
his
supplier
right
and
his
employee
right
a
lawyer
family
would
starve
my
father
say
if
all
his
client
behave
like
mcfayden
it
be
a
lesson
i
have
never
forgotten
and
it
have
help
my
business
career
even
though
i
find
like
other
businessmen
that
it
be
harder
to
starve
the
lawyer
now
than
it
use
to
be
the
lesson
help
me
prefer
mcfayden
type
as
client
and
mcfayden
behavior
as
the
right
example
for
myself
the
problem
with
law
munger
felt
be
that
the
people
he
most
enjoy
work
with
do
not
get
in
much
legal
trouble
and
the
people
who
need
him
most
sometimes
be
defective
character
on
top
of
that
in
the
s
and
s
practice
law
be
not
necessarily
a
road
to
wealth
munger
gradually
accumulate
money
from
his
legal
practice
and
begin
invest
in
security
and
join
friend
and
client
in
business
endeavor
some
of
which
prove
to
he
graduate
level
course
in
the
school
of
hard
knock
he
would
do
some
legal
work
for
a
small
transformer
manufacturing
company
in
pasadena
and
get
along
well
with
the
client
charlie
hop
they
would
come
back
to
him
for
more
business
one
morning
while
drive
past
the
company
office
on
his
way
in
to
work
charlie
decide
that
he
be
be
too
shy
he
should
not
wait
for
the
client
to
call
him
he
should
make
a
personal
visit
to
them
he
do
a
uturn
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
go
back
after
chat
with
the
business
owner
for
a
while
he
do
get
more
work
eventually
he
take
an
ownership
position
in
the
business
borrowing
some
of
the
necessary
fund
munger
first
formal
partner
be
ed
hoskins
who
now
be
in
his
mid
s
and
life
in
a
golfing
community
near
a
small
mid
california
city
ed

be
a
great
guy
he
have
create
transformer
engineer
he
reach
a
disagreement
with
his
venture
capitalist
who
want
to
replace
him
we
work
out
a
deal
for
him
to
buy
them
out
use
large
amount
of
credit
it
be
an
early
leveraged
buyout
it
be
a
nonlegal
solution
to
what
look
like
a
legal
problem
the
company
be
a
job
shop
make
highly
specialized
transformer
that
hoskins
design
for
military
rocket

the
like
because
the

be
in
progress
an
enormous
amount
of
military
work
be
underway
in
southern

the
opportunity
present
by

die
slowly
of
cancer
and
as
he
do
so
be
carry
financially
by
his
partner
it
be
obvious
that
the
company
would
have
to
expand
rapidly
to
pay
off
the
debt
from
the
buyout
at
the
same
time
however
compete
company
spot
the
wartime
opportunity
and
also
expand
rapidly
soon
there
be
too
many
producer
the
business
aspect
of
their
life
become
miserable
accounting
for
much
of
the
financial
pressure
on
munger
around
the
time
of
his
divorce
the
upside
of
the
story
be
that
hoskins
and
munger
become
good
friend
ed
work
hour
a
week
recall
charlie

in
the
early
day
i
ca
not
tell

how
close
we
be
and
what
a
wonderful
man
he
prove
to
be
we
have
trouble
that
make
his
hair
fall
out
terrible
struggle
the
bad
trouble
come
from
buying
william
miller
instrument
inc
that
be
not
a
good
idea
it
produce
a
complicate
cathode
ray
record
oscillograph
that
business
take
forever
to
get
off
the
ground
finally
the
product
start
to
move
and
hoskins
and
munger
sell
the
company
it
be
none
too
soon
the
cathode
ray
record
oscillograph
rapidly
be
make
obsolete
by
more
sophisticated
magnetic
tape
technology
in
the
end
all
we
have
be
the
transformer
business
say
charlie
that
be
a
bad
business
when
the
war
be
over
we
be
stretch
financially
with
the
help
of
harry
bottle
the
controller
we
finally
right
it
by
fire
all
the
customer
who
would
not
let
it
make
money
and
downsize
to
a
much
small
company
it
be
a
lot
of
struggle
a
lot
of
nerve
pain
we
damn
near
lose
everything
we
finally
make
it
work
out
but
not
fabulously
but
we
get
a
very
respectable
return
on
investment
eventually
munger
go
into
the
partnership
with
hoskins
in
the
s
and
get
out
of
it

and
munger
get
a
good
start
on
a
business
education
during
those

thing
i
never
go
back

love
and
respect
for

additionally
charlie
begin
to
realize
that
buying
high
quality
business
have
certain
advantage
it
be
not
that
much
fun
to
buy
a
company
that
you
hope
liquidates
at
a
profit
just
before
it
be
destine
to
go
broke
he

to
define

a
powerful
automobile
engine

around
for
somewhere

some
place
he
say
gun

across
the

to
a

obviously
have
several
facelift
over

it
swarm
with
shopper
he
found
a
baker
square
coffee
shop
and
told
the
hostess
oh
seat
us
anywhere
then
change
his
mind
and
ask
for
a
booth
a
cheerful
young
hispanic
waiter
introduce
himself
and
enthusiastically
described
the
chicken
stir
fry
salad
the
stir
fry
pita
sandwich
with
french
fry
and
the

order
a
club
sandwich
with
french
fry
and
iced
tea
save
some
room
for
pie
advise
the
zealous
waiter
at
the
end
of
the
meal
gabriel
explain
that
although
charlie
have
not
request
it
he
would
give
him
the
senior
citizen
discount
i
be
not
old
enough
for
that
munger
chortle
charlie
picked
up
the
check
and
stop
at
the
cash
register
gabriel
dash
forward
i
will
take
care
of
that
for
you
sir
the
young
waiter
have
no
idea
that
the
gentleman
in
the
chino
pant
and
tweed
jacket
built
the
entire
city
block
of
condominium
opposite
the
coffee
shop
he
do
not
know
that
he
would
just
serve
a
sandwich
to
a
billionaire
and
it
be
obvious
that
it
would
not
have
matter
if
gabriel
do
know
he
would
give
the
same
service
to
anyone
be
you
our
waiter
blurt
munger
yes
sir
well
keep

charlie
shove
two
bill
across
the
counter
for
a
bill
that
could
not
have
be
more
than
munger
then
charge
for
the
door
i
do
not
look
at
waiter
face
so
i
never
recognize
them
later
grumble
charlie
it
be
a
terrible
habit
to
live
with
very
embarrass
why
do
not
he
look
at
people
i
be
always
think
about
other
thing
i
forget
to
look
around
charlie
have
enormous
power
of
concentration
say
otis
booth
munger
partner
on
his
first
two
real
estate
project
when
he
concentrate
everything
else
go
away
at
the
berkshire
hathaway
annual
meeting
a
shareholder
ask
why
warren
and
charlie
shy
away
from
real
estate
investment
here
be
an
area
in
which
we
have
a
virtually
perfect
record
extend
over
many
decade
say
munger
we
have
be
demonstrably
foolish
in
almost
every
operation
have
to
do
with
real
estate
that
we
have
ever
touch
every
time
that
we
have
a
surplus
plant
and
do
not
want
to
accept
the
bid
of
some
developer
that
plan
a
development
we
would
have
be
well
off
later
if
we
would
accepted
the
bid
and
do
something
with
the
sale
proceeds
in
a
field
where
we
have
expertise
it
be
true
that
berkshire
seldom
put
money
into
real
estate
venture
as
a
passive
investment
although
after
munger
make
this
statement
buffett
invest
an
undisclosed
sum
in
motel
operate
by
the
red
roof
inn
chain
while
it
be
quite
possible
that
berkshire
have
a
poor
record
in
manage
the
real
estate
property
that
become
surplus
to
normal
operation
of
its
company
it
be
misplace
modesty
to
say
that
munger
personally
have
a
certify
record
of
failure
in
real
estate
in
fact
the
story
be
quite
different
while
charlie
be
at
first
fascinate
with
industrial
company
he
found
that
make
money
in
manufacturing
be
fraught
with
danger
on
the
other
hand
people
be

rate
of

in
the
late
s
when
he
go
to
consult
with
his

attorney
roy

both
in
their
mid

hungrier
more

be
unionized
booth
thought
that
the
newspaper
management
would
not

would
be
pleased
to
have
him
own
it
as
a
reliable
supplier
of
service
to
his
former
newspaper
but
at
that
juncture
in
the
time
history
they
be
just
begin
to
diversify

the
pleasure
of
bailing

for
them
later

build
and
sell
own
your

this
be
such
a
good
idea
and
you
be
so
sure
it
will
work
why
do
not
you
put
up
some
of
the
money
and
join
me
i
wo
not
do
it
without
you
he
sham
me
into
demonstrate
the
wisdom
of
my
own
advice
chuckle
munger
this
happen
not
long
after
the
own
your
own
concept
of
apartment
occupancy
start
to
become
popular
in
california
charlie
and
i
go
in
together
say
booth
we
each
own
half
we
bought
the
other
half
adjacent
to
caltech
it
be
still
there
when
munger
and
booth
join
force
in
real
estate
development
and
construction
it
be
a
totally
new
experience
for
them
but
munger
fell
back
on
principle
and
skill
he
would
learn
in
other
business
the
unit
across
from
caltech
be
more
than
year
old
and
have
become
so
integrate
into
the
neighbor
landscape
that
they
fade
into
the
background
yet
in
a
part
of
the
country
where
housing
sometimes
seem
disposable
the
project
have
endure
and
still
hold
their
own
in
a
respectable
neighborhood
we
give
our
occupant
more
land
and
a
well
size
and
it
turn
out
people
really
like
it
moreover
we
have
a
good
location
say
munger
it
work
out
very
well
it
be
slow
there
be
a
recession
we
have
to
wait
out
agree
booth
but
in
the
end
there
be
a
very
substantive
profit
percent
we
put
in
get
back
when
the
caltech
unit
complete
in
be
sell
charlie
and
otis
then
go
to
work
on
a
site
in
pasadena
on
orange
grove
avenue
a
broad
street
where
apartment
now
encroach
on
era
mansion
with
this
project
they
apply
the
lesson
they
learn
on
the
caltech
unit
and
make
more
money
faster
charlie
and
otis
notice
that
the
ground
floor
apartment
in
the
first
project
sell
out
quickly
but
the
upstairs
unit
seem
to
sell
molasses
slow
they
decide
to
make
the
next
project
one
story
with
a
price
that
reflect
a
low
density
of
land
use
even
with
a
high
price
tag
the
single
level
condo
sell
quickly
munger
stuck
with
the
single
level
floor
plan
on
a
third
fourth
and
fifth
project
and
again
despite
boom
andbust
real
estate
market
the
unit
be
profitable
munger
continued
to
practice
law
and
be
involve
in
other
activity
while
he
work
on
the
real
estate
venture
for
year
he
take
no
money
out
rather
he
invest
in
one
project
after
another
munger
say
that
throughout
the
process
he
be
learn
from
booth
and
booth
say
he
too
learn
much
especially
about
munger
he
come
to
understand
charlie
somewhat
taciturn
nature
charlie
be
not
secretive
say
booth
but
simply
very
compartmentalize
in
his
communication
he
follow
the
need
to
know
rule
charlie
stepson
hal
borthwick
point
out
that
today
lawyer
seldom
get
involve
in
deal
with
their
client
because
their
firm
fear
loss
from
malpractice
claim
but
in
the
s
and
s
it
be
a
common
occurrence
relationship
be
more
genteel
he
say
it
be
a
different
era
with
so
many
project
underway
munger
free
time
be
limited
the
kid
would
spend
the
day
with
dad
at

the
risk
but

which
turn

al
marshall

still
a
relatively
small
state
at
the
time
and
family
who
have
be
around
for
a
while
often
found
they
be
connect
in
some
way
as
it
turn
out
marshall
a
petroleum
engineer
have
be
a
classmate
of
nancy
first
husband
at
stanford
charlie
and
al
be
introduce
at
the
first
tee
on
the
second
hole
charlie
ask
what
do
you
do
marshall
have
work
for
shell
oil
and
some
small
independent
oil
company
the
oil
business
be
in
a
rocky
period
and
marshall
do
not
want
to
make
too
much
of
the
fact
that
he
be
unemployed
instead
he
told
charlie
about
some
oil
right
he
be
bidding
for
on
the
third
hole
charlie
ask
how
marshall
be
go
about
the
bidding
when
marshall
told
him
charlie
reply
you
be
do
it
all
wrong
i
say
okay
if
you
be
so
smart
why
do
not
you
do
the
legal
and
financing
work
and
i
will
do
the
rest
say
marshall
munger
structure
the
deal
in
an
abc
trust
which
be
a
type
of
tax
shelter
that
be
legally
correct
at
the
time
but
be
so
much
abuse
that
it
have
since
be
outlaw
but
marshall
say
that
their
abc
trust
be
properly
do
and
have
held
together
i
be
still
get
two
to
three
thousand
dollar
a
month
from
that
we
only
put
up
each
and
we
have
each
probably
make
a
half
a
million
out
of
it
the
marshall
still
own
their
share
but
munger
give
his
to
his
child
when
the
alhambra
project
come
along
munger
ask
marshall
if
he
be
interested
in
put
up
and
go
into
the
project
with
him
marshall
be
still
cast
around
for
employment
and
although
the
money
be
a
stretch
for
him
he
agree
the
business
he
be
in
be
go
to
hell
under
him
and
he
have
five
child
say
munger
i
knew
he
be
a
great
guy
and
he
need
something
else
to
do
i
brought
him
in
to
do
sale
i
told
him
build
your
own
department
he
would
never
do
it
before
but
he
be
naturally
talented
he
like
what
he
do
it
be
screamingly
successful
marshall
often
tease
munger
that
he
would
advertise
the
alhambra
unit
as
rancho
sewage
because
the
land
have
previously
serve
as
the
city
of
pasadena
sewage
treatment
plant
booth
have
opt
out
because
the
property
be
not
own
but
rather
come
with
a
year
lease
from
the
city
ordinarily
lender
would
not
issue
loan
for
development
with
less
than
a
year
lease
but
that
do
not
deter
munger
he
knew
that
a
local
saving
and
loan
state
mutual
have
recently
rake
in
million
by
increase
its
passbook
rate
by
one
half
of
percent
the
lender
be
race
to
get
the
money
out
and
earn
interest
in
the
form
of
loan
when
charlie
and
al
met
with
the
loan
officer
to
look
at
the
property
al
say
the
lender
all
but
ask
if
they
want
an
even
big
loan
than
they
have
apply
for
the
way
munger
handle
the
situation
convince
marshall
that
charlie
have
the
ability
to
think
through
a
future
event
and
come
to
a
conclusion
different
from
what
others
assume
it
would
be
and
i
have
hardly
ever
see
him
wrong
charlie
saw
thing
this
way
just
out
of
our
respective
graduate
school
my
friend
warren
buffett
and
i
enter
the
business
world
to
find
huge
predictable
pattern
of
extreme
irrationality
these
irrationality
be
obviously
important
to
what
we
want
to
do
but
our
professor
have
never
mention
them
understand
the
problem
of
irrationality
be
not
easy
i
come
to
study
the
psychology
of
human
misjudgment
almost
against
my
will
i
reject
it
until
i
realize
that
my
attitude
be
cost
me
a
lot
of
money
and
reduce
my
ability
to
help
everything
i
love
i
munger
originality
in
deal
with
business
problem
be
comfort
to
marshall
one
of
the
good
thing
about
work
with
charlie
say
marshall
be
that
there
be
no
doubt
about
who
should
be
bos
when
marshall
agree
to
run
the
sale
and
marketing
operation
of
alhambra
village
green
he
warn
charlie
that
he
do
not
know
much
about
sale
marshall
say
he
do
not
ever
want
to
tell
prospective
buyer
something
that
be
not
true
when
customer
inquire
about
the
ground
lease
and
what
might
happen
after
the
year
expiration
date
marshall
told
them
that
he
do
not
know
what
would
happen
it
would
be
up
to
the
homeowner
and
the
city
to
work
something
out
about
two
third
of
the
potential
customer
hack
away
at
that
point
but
the
unit
sell
out
quickly
despite
the
fact
that
los
angeles
be
go
through
one
of
the
bad
real
estate
recession
that
it
have
ever
experienced
part
of
the
attraction
be
the
one
story
unit
but
another
advantage
be
a
location
just
minute
from
downtown
in
time
the
city
change
its
policy
and
sell
the
underlie
land
to
the
homeowner
association
although
munger
venture
into
real
estate
come
with
its
own
set
of
problem
they
be
relatively
mild
there
be
never
any
lawsuit
or
follow
on
problem
from
the
own
your
own
apartment
once
they
be
sell
and
later
when
the
financing
be
repaid
the
project
be
do
and
behind
them
furthermore
in
the
process
of
development
charlie
discover
that
he
have
the
soul
of
an
architect
he
have
vision
and
a
passion
that
translate
itself
into
durable
and
liveable
space
munger
enjoy
development
and
construction
but
it
worried
him
that
a
successful
builder
be
dependent
on
debt
financing
on
an
ever
increase
scale
charlie
and
al
marshall
developed
one
more
project
but
decide
it
would
be
their
last
on
the
final
project
the
huntington
granada
munger
put
up
a
comparatively
small
number
of
unit
on
huntington
drive
the
land
actually
be
in
alhambra
but
it
be
so
close
to
upscale
san
marino
that
it
seem
to
be
part
of
the
more
desirable
address
again
the
project
sell
off
in
a
flash
the
hard
work
at
last
paid
off
munger
walk
away
from
the
real
estate
phase
of
his
career
with
enough
money
to
finance
his
foray
into
the
world
of
independent
invest
when
it
be
over
i
have
million
as
the
result
of
my
real
estate
involvement
say
munger
that
be
a
lot
of
money
at
that
time
some
be
in
second
trust
deed
and
so
forth
from
people
who
bought
apartment
later
the
second
be
paid
it
be
a
substantial
backlog
of
economic
security
i
do
a
total
of
five
project
then
stop
i
do
not
like
constantly
borrowing
more
money
also
it
be
an
activity
with
many
detail
each
crucial
difficult
to
handle
as
a
full
time
activity
and
extremely
difficult
as
a
part
time
activity
charlie
be
not
totally
new
to
construction
when
he
take
on
the
project
he
have
built
his
own
home
on
edgewood
drive
shortly
after
he
arrive
in
los
angeles
then
in
he
acquire
a
mansion
on
two
large
lot
in
hancock
park
he
demolish
the
large
house
and
sell
one
lot
at
a
substantial
profit
on
the
remain
lot
he
built
a
house
for
his
new
family
the

on
her
first
birthday
the
new
home
make
life
much
easy
for
the
monger
since
charlie

no
longer
have
to
drive
across
los
angeles
in
rush
hour
traffic
to
and
from
his
law
office
we
rode
our
bike
to
school
and
rode
around
the
neighborhood
say
emilie
now
it
be
in
the
middle
of
the
city
then
it
be
like
a
little
town
i
have
eight
girlfriend
in
the
house
around
us
i
be
lucky

group
of

time
though
occasionally
a
movie
star
child
would
attend
marlborough
be
not

a
hollywood
school
it
be
more
traditional
i

a
great
biology
teacher
i
love
that
class
charlie
and
nancy
munger
still
consider

june

primary
residence
it
be
pretty
amaze
to
be

to
go
back
and
have
the
same
house
my
friend
be
still
there
most
of
my
friend
many
family
would
have
fall
apart
or
at
least
move
it
be
a
gift
to
kid
to
be
in
the
same
neighborhood
say
emilie
munger
coincidentally
buffett
too
have
stayed
in
the
relatively
modest
house
in
omaha
where
his
child
be
raise
and
the
buffett
child
express
similar
feeling
to
those
articulate
by
emilie
to
see
some
tangible
result
from
his
work
plea
munger
and
he
still
like
to
be
involve
in
construction
project
munger
often
tell
people
i
do
not
believe
in
do
everything
with
lily
white
hand
nor
would
i
care
to
be
like

be
buying
small
company
say
molly
with
warren
they
have
so
much
more
capital
though
munger
have
work
with
several
partner
already
buffett
have
be
work
mostly
on
his
own
we
saw
that
we
have
odd
personalty
that
happen
to
fit
fairly
well
and
we
have
be
partner
in
one
way
or
another
ever
since
say
buffett
we
be
not
formally
business
partner
but
intellectually
we
have
be
partner
ever
since
buffett
sometimes
call
munger
his
junior
partner
in
good
year
and
senior
partner
in
bad
year
although
they
agree
to
collaborate
shortly
after
meeting
the
partnership
evolve
gradually
and
naturally
base
on
trust
and
a
solid
respect
for
one
another
intelligence
we
be
certainly
business
partner
at
blue
chip
stamp
recall
munger
we
certainly
be
business
partner
when
we
form
diversified
retailing
to
buy
department
store
buying
at
less
than
the
liquidate
value
of
the
company
a
ben
graham

of
play
from
the
s
and
through
the
turn
of
the
century
the
two
analyze
business
opportunity
often
on
the
telephone
talk
many
time
a
week
when
the
time
come
to
close
a
deal
they
get
together
in
the
same
place
when
one
could
not
be
reach
the
other
have
the
authority
to
act
we
know
so
much
about
how
each
other
think
that
we
may
move
pretty
far
along
even
if
the
other
be
not
available
buffett
say
buffett
be
only
when
he
met
munger
but
he
already
have
strong
investment
credential
he
grow
up
listen
to
his
stockbroker
father
talk
and
hang
out
at
the
brokerage
office
in
howard
buffett
building
money
fascinate
warren
and
invest
be
his
obsession
from
boyhood
on
as
a
student
at
the
university
of
nebraska
buffett
read
a
recently
publish
book
the
intelligent
investor
by
ben
graham
and
his
course
be
set
the
year
be
and
graham
know
as
a
sort
of
intellectual
dean
of
wall
street
be
one
of
the
most
successful
and
best
know
money
manager
in
the
country
buffett
enrol
in
the
graduate
business
school
at
columbia
university
where
graham
taught
and
later
he
briefly
work
at
graham
new
york
investment
firm
when
ben
retire
and
close
the
business
buffett
return
to
omaha
to
set
up
his
own
investment
operation
his
first
client
be
relative
who
already
knew
how
bright
he
be
and
some
former
graham
investor
who
be
look
for
the
next
ben
graham
and
have
reason
to
believe
buffett
could
pull
the
sword
from
the
stone
munger
brought
a
business
law
perspective
to
this
rich
mix
but
from
his
independent
foray
into
the
commercial
world
he
also
understood
how
business
work
charlie
can
analyze
and
evaluate
any
kind
of
deal
faster
and
more
accurately
than
any
man
alive
he
see
any
valid
weakness
in
second
he
be
a
perfect
partner
as
they
study
and
acquire
retail
store
and
company
such
as
blue
chip
stamp
and
see
candy
both
munger
and
buffett
be
push
themselves
and
venture
into
high
realm
they
also
be
learn
how
to
be
effective
partner
a
partner
ideally
be
capable
of
work
alone
explain
munger
you
can
be
a
dominant
partner
subordinate
partner
or
an
always
collaborative
equal
partner
i
have
do
all
three
people
could
not
believe
that
i
suddenly
make
myself
a
subordinate
partner
to
warren
but
there
be
some
people
that
it
be
okay
to
be
subordinate
partner
to
i
do
not
have
the
kind
of
ego
that
prevent
it
there
always
be
people
who
will
be
well
at
something
than
you
be
you
have
to
learn
to
be
a
follower
before
you
become
a
leader
people
should
learn
to
play
all
role
you
can
divide
up
in
different
way
with
different
people
when
he
work
with
rick
guerin
munger
relationship
be
different
from
the
one
he
have
with
buffett
even
though
what
they
do
be
similar
in
fact
guerin
be
sometimes
a
partner
in
the
deal
munger
and
buffett
put
together
charlie
be
old
than
i
and
have
legal
experience
say
guerin
he
be
the
senior
partner
you
might
say
he
be
always
willing
to
listen
always
have
an
open
mind
if
you
say
charlie
stop
talk
and
listen
to
me
to
what
i
be
try
to
say
he
would
listen
a
friend
once
note
that
charlie
be
about
as
much
like
warren
as
you
can
get
one
of
warren
strength
be
that
lie
very
good
at
say
no
but
charlie
be
well
warren
us
charlie
as
one
last
litmus
test
if
charlie
ca
not
think
of
it
reason
for
not
do
something
they
will
do
it
buffett
have
call
munger
the
abominable
no
man
but
lou
simpson
say
that
be
more
of
a
joke
than
anything
there
be
more
to
charlie
than
negativity
charlie
think
outside
of
the
box
he
think
quite
differently
and
this
lead
him
to
some
interest
conclusion
he
have
the
ability
to
zero
in
on
thing
that
be
really
crucial
to
make
good
decision
charlie
will
give
lot
of
negative
but
he
and
buffetti
finally
come
up
with
a
similar
conclusion
the
tendency
for
him
and
buffett
to
think
alike
have
not
always
be
an
advantage
if
a
mistake
go
through
one
filter
it
be
likely
to
go
through
both
say
charlie
the
relationship
between
munger
and
buffett
however
be
more
than
a
business
arrangement
though
munger
can
be
self
will
preoccupy
and
abrupt
say
buffett
he
be
just
the
best
pal
a
guy
could
have
a
less
obvious
element
of
this
mental
matrix
one
that
be
woven
deeply
into
the
background
be
the
old
master
of
the
investment
game
ben
graham
because
graham
be
now
living
in
the
same
town
with
munger
the
two
become
acquaint
in
certain
way
the
similarity
between
buffet
two
closest
associate
be
eerie
both
men
admire
and
purposely
emulate
benjamin
franklin
all
three
franklin
graham
and
munger
lose
their
beloved
first
son
to
disease
that
have
they
occur
even
a
few
year
later
most
likely
would
have
be
cure
or
prevent
both
graham
who
die
in
and
munger
share
a
wry
and
occasionally
silly
sense
of
humor
and
a
deep
interest
in
literature
science
and
the
teaching
of
the
great
thinker
both
like
to
quote
the
classic
one
of
munger
favorite
idea
be
from
aristotle
the
best
way
to
avoid
envy
be
to
deserve
the
success
you
get
like
munger
graham
be
know
for
his
integrity
and
dedication
to
objectivity
and
realism
graham
often
told
his
student
that
there
be
two
requirement
for
success
on
wall
street
the
first
be
to
think
correctly
and
the
second
be
to
think
independently
munger
also
urge
independent
thought
if
in
your
think
you
rely
entirely
on
others
often
through
purchase
of
professional
advice
whenever
outside
a
small
territory
of
your
own
you
will
suffer
much
calamity
charlie
recognizes
the
need
to
hire
a
doctor
when
he
need
medical
advice
an
accountant
or
other
professional
help
when
necessary
but
he
do
not
take
the
expert
entirely
at
their
word
he
considers
what
they
say
continue
his
research
seek
other
opinion
and
in
the
end
reach
his
own
conclusion
as
lou
simpson
point
out
munger
probably
do
not
realize
how
much
his
mind
work
like
graham
that
say
there
be
major
difference
between
munger
and
graham
graham
be
an
unrepentant
lady
man
until
the
end
of
his
life
but
munger
have
no
such
reputation
the
important
woman
in
charlie
life
be
his
wife
and
three
daughter
difference
in
investment
philosophy
become
increasingly
apparent
as
munger
career
progress
munger
be
among
those
who
attend
a
now
famous
conference
that
buffett
organize
in
coronado
california
in
a
group
of
buffett
invest
buddy
met
with
graham
to
discus
the
best
way
to
react
to
the
flag
stock
market
at
that
meeting
buffett
introduce
munger
and
his
law
partner
roy
tolles
to
friend
he
would
make
when
study
and
work
in
new
york
the
graham
acolyte
include
bill
ruane
founder
of
the
sequoia
fund
tom
knapp
of
tweedy
brown
walter
schloss
henry
brandt
david
sandy
gottesman
marshall
weinberg
ed
anderson
buddy
fox
and
jack
alexander
these
be
investor
of
the
high
caliber
that
would
impress
munger
however
charlie
do
not
share
the
special
affection
and
admiration
that
buffett
felt
for
graham
some
of
graham
precept
do
not
impress
him
at
all
i
thought
a
lot
of
them
be
just
madness
he
say
they
ignore
relevant
fact
specifically
say
munger
ben
graham
have
blind
spot
he
have
too
low
an
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
some
business
be
worth
pay
big
premium
for
s
yet
charlie
agree
with
graham
most
fundamental
teaching
and
they
have
be
part
of
the
buffett
munger
success
formula
from
the
start
the
basic
concept
of
value
to
a
private
owner
and
be
motivate
when
you
be
buying
and
sell
security
by
reference
to
intrinsic
value
instead
of
price
momentum
i
do
not
think
that
will
ever
be
outdated
say
munger
though
munger
be
not
interested
in
graham
old
fashion
cigar
butt
stock
that
have
one
puff
left
in
them
charlie
be
still
too
conservative
to
overpay
for
an
asset
i
never
want
to
pay
above
intrinsic
value
for
stock
with
very
rare
exception
where
someone
like
warren
buffett
be
in
charge
say
munger
there
be
people
very
few
worth
pay
up
a
bit
to
get
in
with
for
a
long
term
advantage
the
investment
game
always
involves
consider
both
quality
and
price
and
the
trick
be
to
get
more
quality
than
you
pay
for
in
price
it
be
just
that
simple
buffett
have
have
a
lifelong
connection
with
most
of
the
people
who
be
in
coronado
with
him
that
summer
and
he
give
graham
a
lot
of
credit
for
what
happen
to
them
afterward
they
be
all
moderately
well
to
do
then
they
be
all
rich
now
they
have
not
invent
federal
express
or
anything
like
that
they
just
set
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
ben
put
it
all
down
it
be
just
so
simple
it
may
not
have
be
obvious
in
coronado
that
munger
be
replace
the
ail
graham
as
buffett
confidant
and
advisor
but
the
transition
have
begin
carol
loomis
an
editor
and
writer
at
fortune
explain
that
while
buffett
maintain
his
respect
for
graham
idea
munger
help
him
expand
his
approach
to
take
the
next
big
step
forward
when
he
met
buffett
munger
have
already
form
strong
opinion
about
the
chasm
between
good
business
and
bad
lie
serve
as
a
director
of
an
international
harvester
dealership
in
bakersfield
and
saw
how
difficult
it
be
to
fix
up
an
intrinsically
mediocre
business
as
an
angeleno
he
observe
the
splendid
prosperity
of
the
los
angeles
time
in
his
head
he
do
not
carry
a
creed
about
bargain
that
have
to
be
unlearned
so
in
conversation
with
buffett
over
the
year
he
preach
the
virtue
of
good
business
by
blue
chip
stamp
a
berkshire
affiliate
that
have
since
be
merge
into
the
parent
be
pay
three
time
book
value
to
buy
see
candy
and
the
good
business
era
be
launch
buffett
agrees
with
loomis
explanation
charlie
shove
me
in
the
direction
of
not
just
buying
bargain
as
ben
graham
have
taught
me
this
be
the
real
impact
he
have
on
me
it
take
a
powerful
force
to
move
me
on
from
graham
limit
view
it
be
the
power
of
charlie
mind
he
expand
my
horizon
buffett
say
he
slowly
come
around
to
munger
point
of
view
on
many
point
i
evolve
buffett
say
i
do
not
go
from
ape
to
human
or
human
to
ape
in
a
nice
even
manner
to
that
buffett
have
add
a
simple
observation
boy
if
i
have
listen
only
to
ben
would
i
ever
be
a
lot
poorer
in
spite
of
what
he
say
it
do
not
take
long
for
buffett
to
put
together
what
he
have
learn
from
graham
and
what
he
be
learn
from
munger
i
become
very
interested
in
buying
a
wonderful
business
at
a
moderate
price
he
say
the
meeting
that
buffett
organize
in
coronado
developed
into
a
combination
study
group
party
held
every
other
year
the
original
buffett
group
be
comprise
of
investor
now
more
than

pretty
verbal
bunch
emilie

emilie

analytical
that

philip

have
he
like

twice
won
the
california
state
championship

there
be
no
grand
plan
but
the
munger

have
tend
to
follow
family
tradition
when
it
come
to

to
lawyer
molly
munger
be
the
first
of
her
sibling
to
take
the
step
though
she
probably
chose
law
more
by
instinct
than
by
reason
my
family
have
no
particular
consciousness
girl
grow
up
and
get
married
and
you
should
have
something
to
do
in
case
your
husband
die
or
something
that
think
have
an
influence
on
me
my
last
year
at
radcliffe
in
the
spring
the
other
girl
all
have
the
diamond
ring
i
do
not
think
i
be
go
to
harvard
law
like
my
dad
but
when
i
realize
i
do
not
have
a
job
i
thought
i
should
go
to
grad
school
i
be
not
good
enough
in
math
for
economics
then
i
fill
out
this
harvard
law
questionnaire
which
ask
do
any
member
of
my
family
attend
harvard
for
molly
a
light
go
on
she
knew
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
charlie
munger
usually
reticent
about
express
his
emotion
let
his
first
daughter
know
how
he
felt
about
her
decision
in
an
indirect
way
only
extremely
rarely
have
he
do
anything
at
christmas
or
birthday
other
than
a
check
or
cash
say
molly
the
idea
of
him
out
shopping
be
extremely
funny
he
bought
us
all
brook
brother
gift
certificate
he
love
brook
brother
or
once
he
be
enamor
with
a
certain
type
of
briefcase
so
he
bought
all
of
us
one
he
be
the
kind
of
man
that
when
i
graduate
from
college
i
say
i
have
graduate
then
i
say
i
think
it
would
be
nice
if
you
bought
me
a
watch
he
look
up
from
his
paper
and
say
oh
yes

be
very
appropriate
go
out
and
pick
yourself
out
a
watch
and
send
me
the
bill
and
as
i
left
he
look
up
again
and
say
and
have
it
engrave
from
your
love

he
have
the
same
kind
of
mind
he
would

value
his

at
the
time
her
father
respect
for
carla

a
signal

some
of
the

brought
client
with

because
he
do
we
get

with
a
healthy
burst
and
quickly
get

all
of
a
sudden
i
be
rich
i
would

make
a
suggestion
about
a
tax
shelter
investment
i
say
charlie
i
have
get
this
terrific
investment
opportunity
i
thought

a
much
well
idea

tax
shelter
he

give
me
the
money
i

be
eternally
grateful
for

my
lesson

since
only
about
half
the
lawyer
on
the
staff
be
associate
perhaps
one
of
the
most
nurture
thing
charlie
munger
do
for
mto
be
to
bring
in
a
small
group
of
company
as
client
it
group
that
later
become
berkshire
hathaway
inc
as
berkshire
grow
in
size
influence
and
prestige
so
do
munger
tolles
berkshire
hathaway
have
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
firm
the
ability
to
work
for
warren
buffett
and
the
opportunity
to
be
the
lawyer
for
berkshire
hathaway
note
hal
borthwick
and
i
be
not
say
by
the
way
that
berkshire
business
produce
massive
amount
of
gold
its
consistent
work
but
by
and
large
warren
and
charlie
run
that
business
so
as
to
stay
out
of
trouble
at
the
same
time
in
the
early
day
they
bought
business
that
have
trouble
they
thought
they
could
fix
blue
chip
stamp
be
a
case
in
point
where
they
take
over
control
of
a
company
that
have
i
do
not
know
case
against
it
their
calculate
judgment
be
that
they
would
win
or
cheaply
settle
all
the
case
they
do
it
cost
some
money
take
a
long
time
but
they
get
a
good
deal
right
but
it
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
help
to
have
something
like
berkshire
built
into
the
client
base
it
be
a
stamp
of
approval
some
general
counsel
will
say
you
know
if
they
be
good
enough
for
warren
buffet
i
think
they
be
okay
for
us
too
give
em
a
call

berkshire
business
grow
at

this
must

very
brutal
say
john
frank
a
munger
tolles
partner
it
be
open
but
it
be
not
brutal
you
ca
not
give
a
whole
lot
of
money
to
one
person
without
take
it
away
from
others
which
imposes
a

they

a

the

if
charlie
get

sensitive
call
from
a
client
he
ask
al
and
vivian
their
secretary
to
step
outside
so
that
he
could
maintain

al

would
stand
around
in

then
the

and

within
three
year
of

munger
tolles
charlie
drop
out
he
finally
left

never
again

to
rely
on

fee
he
transfer
his
remain
balance

clearly
munger
have
be
plot
his
escape
from
law
for
quite
a
while
al
marshall
say
charlie
once
sum
up
practice
law
this
way
too
often
if
you
absolutely
kill
yourself
over
an
impossible
client
and
get
a
ten
strike
your
reward
be
you
get
to
do
it
all
over
again
for
an
equally
impossible
client
despite
his
love
of
his
father
and
grandfather
and
respect
for
their
work
it
be
a
relief
to
munger
to
quit
the
law
i
hire
lawyer
oversee
lawyer
it
be
not
that
i
do
not
use
law
or
lawyer
but
i
be
entirely
willing
to
give
up
work
for
other
people
as
a
lawyer
say
munger
i
have
a
huge
family
nancy
and
i
support
eight
child
and
i
do
not
realize
that
the
law
be
go
to
get
as
prosperous
as
it
suddenly
do
the
big
money
come
into
law
shortly
after
i
left
it
also
i
prefer
make
decision
and
gamble
my
own
money
i
usually
thought
i
knew
well
than
the
client
anyway
so
why
should
i
have
to
do
it
his
way
so
partly
it
be
have
an
opinionated
personality
and
partly
it
be
a
desire
to
get
resource
permit
independence
munger
hop
to
use
his
wealth
when
he
felt
secure
with
it
to
emulate
his
childhood
idol
benjamin
franklin
franklin
be
able
to
make
the
contribution
he
do
because
he
have
financial
freedom
munger
come
to
understand
that
in
order
to
be
truly
wealthy
a
person
need
to
build
ownership
in
a
business
it
be
a
classic
thing
my
mother
in
law
talk
about
explain
hal
borthwick
she
say
it
be
always
the
lawyer
who
have
the
wonderful
lifestyle
with
the
kid
in
the
school
and
the
nice
home
in
the
nice
neighborhood
she
say
of
course
you
be
living
at
a
level
your
client
be
living
at
right
what
you
forget
be
your
client
be
building
capital
where
as
an
attorney
you
be
not
there
be
no
capital
value
to
your
practice
so
when
you
do
retire
one
day
your
income
disappears
you
have
nothing
other
than
maybe
your
house
and
so
you
sell
the
house
and
move
to
the
desert
or
whatever
charlie
change
the
profession
of
law
be
change
but
even
if
he
have
stayed
in
the
practice
he
probably
would
have
be
dissatisfied
there
be
now
more
money
to
be
make
from
law
but
less
time
to
enjoy
it
i
think
many
lawyer
now
have
love
hate
relationship
with
themselves
and
their
profession
and
it
be
definitely
the
case
now
that
you
really
have
to
work
very
hard
to
have
traditional
relationship
with
your
client
say
borthwick
because
thing
have
really
change
a
lot
in
law
practice
it
be
now
a
business
where
you
have
to
he
a
good
lawyer
and
a
good
businessperson
to
survive
before
you
could
just
be
a
nice
person
with
a
good
sense
of
value
borthwick
a
member
of
charlie
hang
out
the
california
club
say
that
to
year
earlier
after

domino
today
there
be
practically
nobody
there
in
the
early
afternoon
the
lawyer
and
broker
and
other
professional
people
often
take
lunch
at
their
desk
or
if
they
do
go
out
it
be
for
a
business
lunch
and
they
rush
back
to
their
office
as
soon
as
possible
it
be
a
different
deal
now
say
borthwick
the
gentility
have
go
out
of
these
thing
and
you
have
to
make
the
best
with
a
limited
amount
of
time
although
munger
be
disassociate
from
the
profession
of
law
his
connection
with
his
former
firm
remains
solid
you
know
even
though
he
have
not
drawn
any
income
out
of
that
firm
for
probably
year
he
be
always

just
change
his
relationship
to
the
firm
he
be
a
client
instead
of
a

ron
olson
say
that
the
lawyer
at
mto
consider
munger
a
resource
as
well
as
a

the

bob
denham

from
the
firm
standpoint
it
would
be
crazy
to
change
it
from
charlie

it
give
him
a
certain
satisfaction
as
his

munger
discard
the
element
from
his

built
upon
those
he
found
valuable
relationship
with
his

a
big
risk
when
he
would
venture
into

the
situation
seem
less
risky
i
never
thought
i

that
we

his
dual

side
of
this
transaction
guerin
realize
he
want
to
be
where
wheeler
be
go
not
where
he
have
be
guerin
intuition
be
correct
in
part
wheeler

between
investment
partner
be
tricky

judgment
and
trustworthiness
if
partner
be
incompatible
in
any
of
these
area
even
a
small
issue
grate
like
sand
in
a
shoe
munger
have
advise
wheeler
to
simply
get
out
of
his
former
arrangement

concentrate
full
time
on
wheeler
munger
use
the
only
he
then
have
guerin
bought
into
the
less
promising
half
of
a
splitting
partnership
and
later
lose
the
entire
investment
but
by
then
say
munger
he
would
learn
a
lot
and
be
do
very
well
with
the
advent

if
he
would
like
to
come
into
wheeler
munger
as
business
manager
munger
have
discover
that
his
style
differ
from
jack

and
he
need
someone
around
who
be
more
compatible
wheeler
be
not
from
omaha
but
he
be
a
very
smart
man
say
marshall
he
once
told
me
that
he
would
take
a
course
in
late
s
style
pool
and
the
management
of
pool
which
of
course
be
totally
illegal
today
he
be
a
big
spender
live
big
he
be
very
good
at
what
he
do
but
he
also
would
suffer
big
revers
once
in
a
while
which
do
not
appeal
to
charlie
finally
charlie
persuade
wheeler
to
turn
the
operation
of
wheeler
munger
over
to
himself
and
marshall
and
they
would
pay
wheeler
a
cut
of
the
profit
there
be
no
acrimony
between
them
insist
marshall
wheeler
just
sort
of
retire
marshall
who
ultimately
become
a
general
partner
be
not
surprised
that
charlie
approach
him
a
second
time
to
join
in
a
business
venture
if
he
trust
you
he
trust
you
completely
say
al
it
still
amazes
marshall
that
for
year
charlie
list
him
as
a
signatory
on
a
personal
check
account
charlie
knew
al
character
and
do
not
think
for
a
minute
that
marshall
would
run
off
with
the
money
and
of
course
he
do
not
munger
ever
the
absent
mind
professor
have
nancy
to
keep
thing
straight
at
home
at
the
office
he
need
a
lieutenant
like

we

vivian
say
marshall
when
she
left
we
have
two
or
three

after
her
but
charlie
just
kept
call

of
them
vivian
i
have
always
say
it
be
a
good
thing
his
second
wife
be
name
nancy
too
otherwise
he
would
never
have
remember
her
name
marshall
like
his
new
position
but
it
also
have
drawback
one
of
my
more
obnoxious
job
be
to
watch
the
specialist
post
say
marshall
floor
trader
tend
to
be
action
orient
individual
who
have
a
lot
of
adrenaline
in
their
system
once
one
of
marshall
trader
object
to
something
that
have
be
say
and
jumped
up
and
slug
another
trader
it
take
marshall
several
day
to
negotiate
a
peaceful
settlement
with
the
batter
trader
and
the
exchange
governor
but
the
trader
also
be
clever
and
creative
one
of
wheeler
munger
men
set
up
a
complex
four
way
arbitrage
in
the
security
of
the
pharmaceutical
company
alza
which
at
the
time
be
just
a
start
up
marshall
establish
a
million
line
of
bank
credit
to
finance
the
arbitrage
but
at
one
point
the
credit
line
be
drawn
out
to
million
a
banker
come
over
to
the
stock
exchange
to
investigate
and
to
ask
marshall
again
what
the
credit
line
be
be
use
for
even
after
marshall
explain
the
banker
go
away
confuse
the
trader
unwound
the
arbitrage
after
three
week
with
a
profit
of
marshall
recall
that
one
even
he
need
to
talk
to
charlie
about
a
business
situation
so
he
go
over
to
the
mungers
june
street
home
marshall
have
five
child
of
his
own
so
he
knew
what
a
busy
household
be
like
but
even
he
be
surprised
that
charlie
could
concentrate
under
the
circumstance
charlie
be
sit
in
a
big
chair
and
one
kid
be
climb
on
his
shoulder
another
be
pull
his
arm
another
be
yell
it
be
bedlam
but
he
do
not
send
them
out
or
correct
them
it
do
not
bother
him
a
bit
while
wheeler
kept
an
eye
on
the
specialist
post
charlie
concentrate
on
invest
the
surplus
capital
sometimes
he
buffett
or
guerin
or
all
three
together
invest
in
the
same
company
they
scour
the
exchange
the
newspaper
and
talk
to
friend
search
for
deal
buffett
described
both
buffett
partnership
and
wheeler
munger
as
classic
hedge
fund
similar
to
those
that
again
become
popular
in
the
late
s
we
bought
some
operating
business
say
munger
include
a
company
that
make
automotive
chemical
at
one
time
as
part
of
a
bargain
price
package
we
bought
a
manufacturer
of
car
wash
machine
and
a
group
of
loan
to
car
wash
operator
every
time
it
rain
people
call
marshall
to
explain
why
they
be
not
pay
that
be
not
one
of
my
happier
moment
so
we
have
a
lot
of
experience
good
and
bad
because
the
company
they
bought
be
small
and
sometimes
closely
held
the
investor
become
involve
in
peculiar
situation
this
be
the
case
with
the
tiny
automotive
chemical
company
k
w
product
i
spot
it
in
the
newspaper
an
estate
sale
say
rick
guerin
it
turn
out
it
be
a
company
that
make
a
substance
that
when
pour
into
an
automobile
radiator
would
seal
up
a
leak
in
the
car
engine
block
the
inventor
of
the
product
have
launch
it
into
the
market
by
time
after
time
drive
his
car
into
an
auto
repair
shop
call
together
the
mechanic
and
then
drilling
a
disastrous
hole
in
his
car
engine
block
which
he
fix
by
pour
his
product
into
the
car
radiator
this
prove
quite
effective
as
a
sale
aid
and
the
company
make
a
fair
amount
of
money
the
company
come
up
for
sale
because
the
control
shareholder
not
the
original
inventor
have
die
it
be
rumor
that
this
owner
a
doctor
have
die
because
he
over
prescribed
addictive
drug
to
himself
he
have
borrow
money
from
his
wife
aunt
to
invest
in
the
company
and
the
estate
owe
the
aunt
each
the
only
asset
in
the
estate
be
the
stock
for
some
reason
the
doctor
left
his
estate
to
his
wife
but
make
his
mistress
the
executor
needle
to
say
this
cause
some
rancor
between
the
executor
and
family
member
the
aunt
have
not
be
receive
interest
payment
and
for
several
year
be
not
able
to
get
any
money
charlie
propose
that
he
and
guerin
buy
the
two
note
held
by
the
elderly
aunt
under
the
circumstance
it
would
be
typical
to
bid
less
than
face
value
say
guerin
but
charlie
insist
on
pay
the
full
for
each
note
charlie
be
not
willing
to
benefit
from
their
distress
he
could
have
take
advantage
of
them
but
do
not
i
do
the
leg
work
i
found
the
old
lady
charlie
and
i
become
the
creditor
then
later
trade
the
note
for
ownership
next
munger
who
be
at
best
a
little
awkward
when
deal
with
woman
telephone
the
mistress
executor
and
invite
her
to
lunch
at
the
california
club
so
that
they
could
discus
the
matter
munger
be
take
aback
when
the
woman
show
up
at
the
office
she
have
flame
red
hair
eye
enhance
by
bright
green
contact
lens
and
be
wear
a
snug
nurse
uniform
that
show
off
her
ample
bosom
charlie
be
fluster
but
there
be
no
way
of
get
out
of
accompany
the
woman
to
lunch
at
his
conservative
businessmen
club
with
its
dark
panel
wall
leather
furniture
and
valuable
collection
of
old
california
art
eventually
charlie
and
rick
become
fifty
fifty
owner
of
a
control
block
of
stock
in
the
company
with
its
management
own
the
rest
after
some
time
pass
a
situation
arose
where
guerin
need
to
cash
out
of
the
investment
i
still
be
very
poor
we
have
an
informal
understand
that
one
would
take
the
other
out
if
either
need
to
get
out
i
go
to
charlie
and
say
i
need
to
use
that

elsewhere
he
say
fine
figure
out
what
you
want
guerin
look
over
the
accounting
statement
and
thought
about
it
i
told
him
it
be
worth
charlie
say
no
you
be
wrong
about
that
i
say
to
myself
oh
darn
because
i
need

say
it
be
worth
and
he
pull
out
a
check
and
write
it
i
would
have
be
delighted
with
i
would
have
be
the
happiest
man
on
earth
it
be
an
opportunity
for
him
to
show
me
how
stupid
i
be
guerin
say
with
a
chuckle
charlie
have
a
say
think
about
it
a
little
more
and
you
will
agree
with
me
because
you
be
smart
and
i
be
right
the
automotive
chemical
business
be
fully
acquire
in
the
mid
s
and
ultimately
become
part
of
berkshire
hathaway
berkshire
sell
it
in
to
a
group
of
investor
that
include
a
former
president
of
the
company
though
otis
booth
be
too
concerned
about
the
risk
to
participate
in
munger
final
real
estate
venture
he
quite
willingly
put
money
into
the
new
wheeler
munger
partnership
i
become
the
large
participant
and
i
remain
so
when
he
initially
go
into
wheeler
munger
booth
have
some
concern
about
what
he
be
do
i
worried
about
partnership
interest
be
just
piece
of
paper
i
be
take
them
on
trust
this
guy
be
straight
but
there
be
not
a
great
deal
of
documentation
but
i
do
not
think
it
be
go
to
go
south
i
knew
charlie
well
enough
charlie
partner
say
he
have
a
flair
for
structure
a
company
in
the
most
effective
form
and
for
postpone
the
tax
consequence
as
long
as
possible
when
it
come
to
wheeler
munger
charlie
borrow
a
format
from
warren
that
warren
have
borrow
from
ben
graham
the
structure
of
the
buffett
and
munger
partnership
be
very
important
explain
otis
booth
at
the
end
of
each
year
profit
be
distribute
and
ownership
be
reallocate
the
reallocation
be
not
a
taxable
event
profit
be
give
accord
to
partnership
interest
at
the
previous
year
end
first
percent
to
capital
limited
and
general
partner
alike
after
that
a
huge
majority
share
to
capital
and
a
much
low
share
to
general
partner
when
there
be
tax
to
pay
all
partner
bore
their
share
accord
to
their
interest
buffett
explain
that
munger
follow
the
fundamental
of
value
invest
though
his
portfolio
be
far
less
diversified
than
those
establish
by
the
manager
of
traditional
value
fund
such
as
buffett
friend
and
former
co
worker
at
graham
newman
walter
schloss
charlie
portfolio
be
concentrate
in
very
few
security
and
therefore
his
record
be
much
more
volatile
but
it
be
base
on
the
same
discount
from
value
approach
say
buffett
he
be
willing
to
accept
great
peak
and
valley
of
performance
and
he
happens
to
be
a
fellow
whose
whole
psyche
go
toward
concentration
with
result
show
some
analyst
might
claim
that
charlie
be
willing
to
assume
more
risk
than
graham
buffett
or
schloss
would
tolerate
yes
agree
otis
booth
but
charlie
feel
he
have
well
insight
and
assessment
of
risk
and
he
say
yes
i
will
do
that
but
warren
also
bought
stock
that
be
out
of
favor
such
as
american
express
the
real
risk
be
less
than
the
perceive
risk
at
the
time
as
he
become
more
and
more
experienced
in
business
munger
found
small
but
reliable
way
to
make
risk
more
tolerable
in
no
way
be
there
a
desire
to
run
foolish
risk
as
many
gambler
do
explain
booth
none
of
that
and
particularly
when
we
be
young
and
hungrier
he
would
look
for
each
little
edge
you
could
get
the
seat
on
the
stock
exchange
ability
to
get
an
option
on
land
where
the
zone
could
be
change
whatever
charlie
do
not
consider
himself
more
dare
than
buffett
where
investment
be
concerned
warren
be
very
adventurous
when
it
relates
to
his
lifelong
interest
when
it
have
to
do
with
berkshire
he
will
try
new
thing
but
when
it
come
to
try
the
leg
of
lamb
versus
the
prime
rib
he
be
not
at
all
interested
molly
munger
say
during
the
time
he
be
building
his
business
her
father
become
acutely
aware
of
the
impact
of
tax
when
capital
gain
be
compare
to
ordinary
income
he
make
a
lot
of
money
in
this
or
that
deal
and
do
not
have
to
pay
as
much
in
tax
he
say
if
i
be
a
lawyer
i
have
to
pay
more
the
capital
gain
tax
be
less
and
in
my
case
it
do
not
seem
fair
during
those
year
at
wheeler
munger
charlie
and
warren
kept
up
the
telephone
conversation
although
they
do
not
always
buy
the
exact
same
security
in
the
same
quantity
their
portfolio
overlap
in
part
they
share
investment
in
two
chain
of
retail
store
own
through
a
company
name
diversified
retailing
together
with
rick
guerin
they
bought
work
control
of
blue
chip
stamp
buffett
be
the
large
shareholder
and
munger
the
next
large
in
the
california
retail
trading
stamp
company
we
be
of
a
raider
generation
observe
guerin
that
of
sol
steinberg
harold
simmons
and
so
forth
but
we
be
not
like
them
the
group
never
make
a
tender
offer
without
management
consent
and
never
engage
in
a
proxy
fight
by
the
time
he
quit
practice
law
in
have
more
confidence
that
wheeler
munger
would
work
out
and
i
have
much
great
wealth
say
munger
i
be
not
particularly
surprised
when
he
give
up
law
say
munger
sister
carol
that
be
what
happens
when
someone
find
something
that
be
his
real
love
munger
be
get
close
to
his
dream
of
financial
independence
observe
his
stepson
david
borthwick
he
need
to
work
for
himself
even
with
friendly
partner
in
a
law
firm
you
be
still
in
service
of
client
who
call
on
your
time
to
fit
their
schedule
in
his
book
the
big
test
nicholas
lemann
say
that
daniel
defoe
not
benjamin
franklin
be
behind
munger
lust
to
be
his
own
man
when
charlie
grandparent
read
and
reread
robinson
crusoe
to
him
they
plant
a
notion
in
his
head
he
want
to
be
rich
so
he
could
be
completely
independent
like
crusoe
on
his
island
and
not
have
to
do
what
anybody
else
say
in
an
essential
way
however
charlie
munger
remain
in
the
service
of
client
those
client
be
the
other
investor
in
wheeler
munger
the
fact
that
many
of
the
investor
be
family
member
former
colleague
or
friend
do
not
ease
the
pressure
as
fate
would
have
it
during
wheeler
munger
existence
while
the
stock
market
have
ups
and
down
the
overall
direction
be
sideways
by
the
late
s
buffett
be
talk
about
get
out
and
eventually
at
the
end
of
do
liquidate
his
partnership
munger
and
guerin
stayed
in
longer
especially
with
a
large
investment
that
be
make
late
in
a
register
investment
company
name
fund
of
letter
bob
denham
have
arrive
at
munger
tolles
and
part
of
his
early
work
for
munger
be
the
acquisition
of
the
fund
of
letter
the
stock
market
in
the
late
part
of
the
s
the
go
go
year
have
be
torrid
a
popular
investment
at
the
time
be
letter
stock
a
security
sell
without
sec
registration
and
therefore
not
saleable
for
an
extend
period
of
time
in
ordinary
stock
market
transaction
under
the
security
law
it
be
necessary
to
put
it
rider
on
the
stock
say
that
the
investor
be
not
allow
to
sell
until
an
sf
c
registration
or
some
other
key
event
have
occur
the

be
a
venture
capital

that
its
founder
have
form
in
a
highly

but
when
underwriting
fee
and
other
cost
be
subtract
only
million
remain
for
investment
purpose
it
be
as
if
say
charlie
the
customer
have
ask
their
broker
what
shall
i
do
with
my
money
and
the
broker
have
respond
first
give
percent
of

with
it
close
end

the
fund
of

soon
trade
well
below
its

moreover
when
the

go
into
a
prolong
decline
the

tanked
with
it
after
guerin
and
munger
bought
control
of
the
troubled

they
change
almost
everything
about
it
they
rename
it
the
new
america

reorganize
the
board
and
redirect
the
investment
style
to
a

approach
they
quickly
liquidate
asset
chosen
by
former

a
very
unpleasant
stretch
others
be
also
find

unpleasant
for
example
berkshire
hathaway
still
mostly
a

operation
saw
its

price
fall
from
in
december
to
in

gloom
and
doom
permeate
the
news
of
wall
street
headline
proclaim
the
death
of
equity
the
main
cause
of
wheeler
munger
poor
relative
performance
be
its
ownership
of
big
block
of
common
stock
in
new

fund
and
blue
chip
stamp
they
have
purchase
new

predecessor
the

of
letter
during
a
time
of
stock
market
exuberance
at
the
end
of
pay
per

substantially
under
liquidation
value
for
their
control
block
and
even
after
the
great
stock
market
decline
as
business
week
note
in
october
fund
share
have
an
asset
value
of
a
little
high
than
munger
and
guerin
have
paid
in
so
why
munger
agony
after
all
munger
and
guerin
have
make
a
big
investment
at
an
unpropitious
time
but
have
dodge
the
natural
consequence
mostly
because
of
the
margin
of
safety
of
the
purchase
as
require
by
the
principle
of
benjamin
graham
moreover
the
fund
possess
a
tax
loss
carryforward
that
would
enable
it
to
make
large
gain
for
many
future
year
with
no
income
tax
clue
munger
distress
be
cause
by
the
limited
partnership
structure
the
fact
that
some
borrow
money
have
be
use
in
buying
fund
stock
increase
decline
in
partnership
net
worth
and
the
fact
that
by
fund
share
have
a
market
price
very
much
low
indeed
over
percent
low
than
the

value

that
could
have
be
paid
out
in
a

like
it

not
munger
have
to
report

the

large
block
of

stock
at
only

wheeler

be
in
a
similar
position
with

this

a

any

a

fact
the

then
only
intrinsic

be
damn
as
wheeler

number
go
to
hell
charlie
realize
that
sonic
partner
would
suffer
hard
to
hear
distress
after
all
an
investment
of
on
january
would
have
shrunk
to
by
january
if
the
partner
have
never
take
any
money
out
during
the
period
in
contrast
a
similar
investment
that
perform
in
line
with
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
over
the
same
period
would
have
shrunk
much
less
leave
moreover
follow
precedent
in
the
graham
and
buffett
partnership
all
wheeler
munger
partner
drew
cash
from
their
partnership
account
at
one
half
a
percent
per
month
on
start
of
the

therefore
after
regular
monthly
distribution
be
deduct
limited

in
to
go
down
in

even
more

crunch
the

sell
at
per

plus
share
of

sell
at

from
this
nadir
what
be
the
subsequent

history
of
these
two

do
fine
by

s
each

the

each

with

due
for

there
be
no

from

after
the
ravage
of
tax
inflation
and
withdrawal

the

much
well
limited

stayed
the

otis

stood

stood

again
with

distribute
in
wheeler

liquidation
at
the
end
of
there
be
one
major
gall
exception
a
new

have
put
in
just
before
the

crash
and
panicked
out
at
the
bottom
for
this

more
than
half
the

vanished
charlie
could
not
talk
the
partner
out
of
the
decision
to
withdraw
a
lawyer
be
suppose
to
be
an
expert
in
persuasion
and
i
flunk
a
persuasion
test
that
i
think
i
should
have
pass
say
munger
there
be
something
in
the
mix
of
personality
include
a
low
pain
threshold
and
a
strong
will
in
the
limited
partner
that
somehow
make
me
fail
when
deal
only
with
his
own
money
investment
loss
never
bother
munger
much
to
him
it
be
like
a
lose
night
in
a
regular
poker
game
where
you
knew
you
be
one
of
the
best
player
you
would
make
up
the
difference
later
but
he
now
found
that
report
temporary
quotational
loss
in
the
wheeler
munger
limited
partnership
account
give
him
tremendous
pain
and
so
by
the
end
of
he
have
resolve
like
buffett
to
stop
manage
money
for
others
in
a
limited
partnership
format
he
would
liquidate
wheeler
munger
after
its
asset
value
make
a
substantial
recovery
and
he
would
liquidate
soon
enough
so
that
he
would
not
take
any
general
partner
override
when
the
main
investment
position
be
distribute
in
wheeler
munger
do
make
an
impressive
recovery
with
a
gain
of
percent
and
munger
and
marshall
liquidate
the
partnership
early
in
even
counting
the
dreadful
time
during
the
year
wheeler
munger
operate
the
partnership
turn
in
an
average
annual
return
of
percent

the
general

when
the

my
family
have
about
million
from
wheeler
munger
and
about
million
more
from
real
estate
and
so
on
say
munger
it
be
a
lot
of
money
at
that
time
and
it
be
a
good
time
to
have
that

i
own
wonderful
security
and
other
wonderful
bargain

be
then
available
in
the

when
wheeler
munger
be
liquidate
the

get

that

compete
in
the
baltimore
metropolitan
area
from
the
begin
have
be
mostly
own
by
the
buffett

by
now
be

by
former

own

the

acquire
make
it
a
classic
ben
graham
type
of

diversified

have
borrow
about
half
the

use
a
bank
loan
quickly
replace
by
longterm
debenture
that
have
almost
no
covenant
limit
the
borrower
very
soon
thereafter
buffett
and
munger
realize
how
intense
baltimore
retailing
competition
be
and
that
they
have
make
a
mistake
they
reverse
course
and
sell
the
baltimore
department
store
chain
for
cash
at
almost
no
loss
the
debenture
be
left
in

offset
by
cash
meanwhile
diversified

have
purchase
for
nearly
nothing
another
chain
of
store
that
threw
off
a
profusion
of
cash
and
so
during
the
great
to
stock
market
crash
diversified
retailing
have
large
amount
of
investable
asset
considerably
more
then
twice
what
buffett
and
munger
have
paid
for
their
original
stockholding
with
stock
price
at
such
a
low
level
it
be
a

spree
in
a

basement
for
buffett
and
munger
it
have
be
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
me
for
decade
that
such
a
poor
start
be
turn
into
a
large

say
munger
and
again
shareholder
who
stuck
with
them

reward
we
do
not

diversified

i
told

it
be
there

they

this
be

when

it
a
try

flew
out

in

we

in
the

insist
that
something
have
to

do
to
improve
the

and

say
he
would
like
to
try
it
himself
she
be
impressed
with
his
self
confidence
but
ask
a
question
that
would
be
pose
again
and
again
as
berkshire
grow
mr
buffett
if
i
buy
you
what
happens
if
you
get
hit
by
a
truck
at
the
intersection
who
would
save
wesco
then
buffett
assure
her
that
charlie
munger
be
wait
in
the
wing
warren
persuade
peter
to
vote
against
the

and
to
ride
along
with
her
family
wesco
share
remain
as
a
wesco
director
on
a
board
that
munger
would
join
this
turn
out
well
for
peter
since
financial
corp
go
bust
and
wesco
prosper
mightily
with
the
help
of
buffett
and
munger
aboard
after
squelch
the
merger
munger
and
buffett
could
legally
buy
only
another
percent
of
wesco
outstanding
stock
and
they
set
out
to
do
so
they
have
be
pay
about
per
share
right
up
to
the
time
the
merger
be
cancel
they
knew
that
wesco
stock
be
sure
to
decline
in
the
short
term
nonetheless
they
offer
per
share
think
it
only
fair
since
it
be
they
who
have
interrupt
the
merger
we
decide
in
some
quixotic
moment
that
it
be
the
right
way
to
behave
say
munger
after
some
period
of
time
pass
and
the
regulatory
hurdle
be
leap
blue
chip
make
several
subsequent
tender
offer
and
eventually
raise
its
wesco
stake
to
percent
by
mid
blue
chip
own
the
majority
of
wesco
share
munger
and
buffett
would
have
acquire
more
wesco
share
but
stop
at
percent
at
the
request
of
peter
who
remains
a
large
minority
shareholder
buffett
let
peter
set
wesco
divide
policy
and
she
increase
the
payout
slightly
every
year
all
through
this
however
the
sec
for
some
reason
have
be
track
the
activity
of
buffett
and
munger
and
have
some
question
about
the
wesco
deal
i
have
always
suspect
that
someone
who
want
the
financial
corp
merger
to
go
through
complain
to
the
sec
say
munger
and
yet
he
admit
the
convolute
ownership
at
blue
chip
do
appear
suspicious
when
the
sec
start
look
there
be
all
these
criss
cross
ownership
that
happen
by
accident
but
it
be
complicate
and
because
so
many
people
create
complication
to
hide
fraud
the
sec
delve
and
delve
and
finally
fix
its
attention
on
something
how
we
get
wesco
people
assume
if
what
you
be
do
be
enormously
complicate
you
be
probably
do
something
wrong
indeed
buffett
munger
and
to
some
extent
guerin
own
stake
in
an
incredibly
intertwine
bundle
of
company
the
three
men
investment
have
grown
this
way
and
that
take
whatever
structure
seem
logical
and
fair
at
the
time
the
organization
be
a
little
too
disorganize
for
the
taste
of
the
sec
but
there
also
be
a
legal
question
the
sec
concern
be
whether
blue
chip
have
unlawfully
manipulate
the
stock
of
wesco
in
some
way
the
sec
rightly
conclude
that
munger
and
buffett
bought
share
at
an
obviously
high
than
necessary
price
and
suspect
sonic
sort
of
preemptive
motive
rather
than
a
benevolent
one
buffett
respond
to
the
inquiry
by
shipping
three
carton
of
document
memo
stock
transfer
document
and
so
on
to
washington
buffett
react
calmly
munger
on
the
other
hand
be
impatient
the
sec
investigation
become
an
impediment
to
blue
chip
everyday
business
and
in
the
fall
of
munger
write
to
his
attorney
chuck
rickershauser
i
hope
the
forego
will
satisfy
everyone
at
the
sec
and
that
if
not
you
can
arrange
that
i
receive
the
promptest
possible
response
preferably
by
direct
telephone
call
to
me
so
that
we
can
clear
up
any
problem
and
get
our

consummate
instead
the

in
the
reorganization
that

when

munger

the

the
right
thing
to

it

munger

a

liability
which
have
be

disastrous
result
if

to
the

time
munger
write
to
shareholder
in
as
for
the
original
business
of

i
preside
over
a
reduction
in
trading
stamp
sale
from
over
million
down
to
less
than
so
i
preside
over
a
failure
of
percent
say
munger
even
so
the
company
do
wonderfully
with
the
capital
we
invest
elsewhere
but
in
term
of
the
trading

company
i
laid
an
egg
so
do
everyone
else
there
be
no
big
trading
stamp
company
left
in
the
united

but
we
have
no
expectation
that
the
trading
stamp
business
be
a
big
winner
as
it
turn
out
it
go
bloo
ey
meantime
we
bought
see
buffalo
news
and
wesco
and
make
successful
investment
in
marketable
security
with
the
float
and
other
capital
the
money
compound
like
crazy
say
munger
in
blue
chip
balance
sheet
net
worth
be
about
million
by
the
end
of
net
worth
have
increase
to
about

up
percent
in
year
return
on
shareholder
investment
in
the

for
the

be
percent
per
year
later
the
gain
be
large
accord
to
munger
if
blue
chip
have
remain
a
separate
company
it
would
be
it
powerhouse
today
its
former
operating
subsidiary
now
earn
over
million
pretax
moreover
wesco
have
more
than
billion
in
marketable
security
and
by
now
blue
chip
on
its
own
would
have
own
much
more
though
it
be
bury
deep
in
the
filing
cabinet
of
berkshire
hathaway
blue

remains
an
intact
company
when
people
dig
into
the
back
of
their
kitchen
drawer
or
open
their
decease
mother
trunk
and

company
just
disappear
blue

still
exists
a
minuscule
stamp
business
redeem
stamp
issue
in
and
explain
buffett
the
number
say
they
be

odd
year
ago
we
keep
this
little
redemption
company
we
have
get
a
good
look
catalog
we
offer
the

value
we

year
ago
he
and
munger
be
determine
that
the
blue

office
will
remain
open
as
long
as
they
believe
that
some
significant
number
of
unredeemed
stamp
be
go
to
turn
up
it
also
tickle
them
that
berkshire
hathaway
become
a
great
investment
for
the
small
retailer
who
fought
for
a

we

since
although
they

munger
along
with

buffett
and
his

there
be
no

that
little

be
take
advantage
of
say
buffett
claim
that
in
some
case
the
shareholder
simply
ignore
their

in
the
end
people
get
their
money
they
be
just
mad
because
the

sell
the
berkshire
share
we
have
found
berkshire
holder
from
the

if

berkshire

some

the

why
all

the

munger

simply
go
forward
on
trust
to
those
of
us
who
become
lawyer
say
wendy
munger
the
lesson
of
his
business
life
be
that
you
do
not
want
to
do
business
with
people
you
ca
not
trust
the
economics
be
irrelevant
if
you
do
not
have
trust
most
people
be
just
think
about
the
economics
think
that
the
contract
will
save
you
when
enter
into
a
transaction
with
someone
you
ca
not
trust
you
must
do
business
with
high
grade
people
that
be
all
he
will
deal
with
charlie
also
put
it
this
way
never
wrestle
with
a
pig
because
if
you
do
you
will
both
get
dirty
but
the
pig
will
enjoy

way

the
way
they
have
this
huge
crunch
in

at
christmas

of
course
the
fanaticism
about
the

of
the
product
and
service
be
the
heart
and
soul
of

way
toward
your

you
be
a
little
part
of
a

a
seamless
web

deserve
trust

serious
about
buying
see
there
be
two
thing
to
be

warren
say
harry
we
need

privately
warren

i
need

who
will
run
the
company
peck
be
ready
to
retire
so
the
question

problem

saw
me
and
say
chuck
will
that
be
how
it

have
some
experience
with
such
meeting
already
thanks
to
the
buyer
who
back
out
at
the
last
minute
he
knew
that
harry
see
have
already
told
the
potential
owner
all
the
good
thing
about
see
i
prepared
myself
by
figure
what
the
company
have
be
do
up
to
that
point
i
intend
to
tell
them
all
the
thing
i
thought
be
problem
thing
we
be
work
on
my
view
of
the
competition
the
bad
stuff
i
give
them
a
list
of
my
problem
and
solution
warren
be
very
calm
down
to
earth
recall
huggins
rick
never
do
say
much
charlie
would
volunteer
whether
ask
or
not
there
be
warren
and
charlie
talk
at
the
same
time
it
give
me
insight
but
i
like
all
three
of
them
there
be
no
blowing
of
horn
about
what
they
would
do
i
knew
charlie
be
a
lawyer
that
come
out
warren
be
like
an
old
shoe
charlie
a
college
professor
or
a
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
my
feel
about
rick
be
he
be
hip
about
everything
he
be
completely
unrelated
to
those
two
except
that
he
be
related
he
never
seem
serious
but
he
be
warren
explain
to
huggins
that
first
the
purchase
have
to
be
settle
but
if
that
happens
here
be
a
couple
of
thing
that
be
expect
first
we
want
you
to
run
see
as
president
and
ceo
and
second
we
do
not
want
any
see
left
with
a
relationship
to
the
company
some
of
the
people
have
be
around
for
a
long
time
make
a
settlement
and
they
can
go
their
way
huggins
say
warren
and
charlie
want
him
to
have
full
control
we
want
you
to
maintain
company
ethic
and
standard
say
buffett
the
see
family
be
ask
million
but
because
of
see
low
book
value
buffett
and
munger
decide
not
to
go
above
million
the
talk
end
but
later
see
call
back
and
accepted
the
million
munger
and
buffett
purchase
see
candy
on
january
pay
three
time
book
value
something
they
would
never
do
before
i
be
think
charlie
life
in
hancock
park
warren
go
back
to
omaha
say
huggins
he
be
worried
about
how
he
would
communicate
with
his
new
employer
buffett
told
huggins
that
he
realize
that
the
sale
be
come
at
see
busiest
time
since
it
make
more
than
half
of
its
profit
at
christmas
the
group
would
get
together
after
the
holiday
say
buffett
and
talk
about
how
to
proceed
next
we
shook
hand
that
be
the
last
meeting
i
have
until
after
christmas
say
huggins
i
still
do
not
have
a
sense
about
warren
i
could
not
find
out
since
that
time
huggins
have
learn
a
lot
about
both
charlie
and
warren
the
actual
contract
signing
be
january
say
huggins
and
within
a
month
charlie
and
warren
be
back
in
his
office
i
would
be
sit
at
my
desk
the
two
of
them
in
front
of
me
warren
would
ask
question
charlie
would
inject
a
lot
of
opinion
nevertheless
huggins
be
feel
positive
about
see
new
owner
i
get
the
strong
feel
that
we
be
the
lucky
people
in
the
world
warren
remind
me
of
someone
i
admire
will
rogers
homey
trustworthy
absolutely
brilliant
it
be
as
if
he
would
run
a
business
just
like
ours
charlie
be
similar
i
be
a
little
guard
with
charlie
he
be
very
absolute
warren
left
some
room
for
your
opinion
with
charlie
it
be
hep
two
three
four
but
i
get
use
to
that
it
be
just
his
style
but
huggins
learn
not
to
take
munger
lightly
if
you
have
ever
try
to
get
charlie
off
a
position
you
be
waste
your
time
he
sort
of
huff
and
toss
his
head
and
you
can
forget
anything
from
there
on
while
blue
chip
own
us
it
be
clear
warren
charlie
and
rick
be
the
owner
say
huggins
i
ask
you
will
all
disappear
exactly
how
do
you
want
me
to
communicate
with
you
warren
say
do
what
you
have
be
do
let
us
know
if
there
be
danger
sign
trouble
but
you
just
keep
us
inform
figure
out
some
way
to
do
that
he
say
if
you
can
build
on
what
the
see
family
have
do
make
it
more
grand
that
would
be
good
then
buffett
add
an
observation
about
the
candy
itself
you
be
price
well
below
the
market
despite
huggins
positive
feel
about
the
deal
there
be
problem
his
immediate
challenge
be
to
convince
loyal
customer
that
see
would
not
change
under
the
new
owner
first
in
when
the
purchase
be
publicize
in
the
newspaper
it
become
know
that
blue
chip
have
bought
it
well
say
huggins
people
do
not
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
the
company
they
would
just
be
through
an
antitrust
case
they
look
bad
that
left
a
bad
taste
in
the
mouth
of
our
most
faithful
customer
in
and
i
spent
a
lot
of
my
time
deal
with
customer
who
be
concerned
mad
that
the
family
have
sell
and
now
it
be
in
the
hand
of
a
company
that
would
ruin
see
suddenly
we
get
a
lot
of
hate
mail
people
claim
the
candy
have
change
see
long
term
customer
be
use
to
a
genteel
experience
when
visit
the
shop
and
be
in
a
near
panic
they
fill
their
local
store
to
express
their
concern
which
in
turn
upset
the
employee
huggins
write
in
the
company
newsletter
this
must
seem
like
a
time
of
the
most
profound
change
in
the
year
history
of
our
company
yet
there
be
even
more
that
have
not
change
we
will
not
change
our
personal
relationship
with
employee
or
customer
we
want
to
go
forward
without
lose
any
of
the
vital
ingredient
that
have
go
into
the
make
of
see
candy
it
take
huggins
nearly
two
year
to
smooth
over
the
uproar
cause
by
the
sale
of
see
once
the
dust
settle
see
start
expand
into
market
in
missouri
texas
and
colorado
and
even
as
far
away
as
hong
kong
see
participate
in
the
world
fair
in
knoxville
tennessee
and
the
exhibit
be
such
a
success
that
see
open
a
shop
in
knoxville
a
recession
hit
in
the
s
however
and
many
of
the
out
of
state
shop
be
close
customer
in
distant
location
be
force
to
order
by
catalog
and
telephone
during
this
same
period
the
retail
clerk
union
attempt
to
organize
the
salesforce
in
the
store
see
since
have
triumphed
in
four
attempt
to
organize
by
the
retail
clerk
union
mainly
by
pay
high
than
union
scale
wage
see
later
have
problem
with
union
truck
driver
who
deliver
the
product
but
through
a
labor
negotiator
be
able
to
cancel
their
contract
and
transfer
the
work
to
a
private
trucking
company
which
then
rehired
most
of
see
senior
driver
at
one
time
see
come
under
attack
by
a
major
candy
producer
from
the
midwest
in
russell
stover
candy
which
traditionally
be
sell
through
other
retailer
go
heavily
into
their
own
store
they
decide
to
put
on
a
campaign
with
see
and
beat
us
out
in
our
own
marketplace
recall
huggins
they
put
in
store
that
look
exactly
like
see
call
mr
stover
they
duplicate
our
identity
and
try
to
grab
our
market
of
course
i
inform
charlie
and
warren
about
the
fact
munger
say
if
they
be
infringe
on
our
trademark
in
any
way
we
can
go
after
them
then
charlie
give
me
a
lot
of
direction
of
what
to
look
for
say
huggins
huggins
hire
a
photographer
and
told
him
to
take
picture
of
thing
in
the
stover
store
that
resemble
see
trade
dress
such
as
checkerboard
floor
lattice
in
the
window
and
old
fashion
photo
on
the
wall
charlie
say
i
want
this
to
be
handle
by
a
partner
at
munger
tolles
she
be
born
in
california
teach
at
university
of
california
at
los
angeles
law
school
i
will
assign
her
to
this
action
i
want
you
to
come
to
the
office
and
meet
her
it
be
carla
anderson
hill
i
met
her
and
like
her
it
take
me
about
minute
to
realize
that
she
be
the
same
personality
type
as
charlie
what
kind
of
personality
be
that
go
get
em
say
huggins
snap
his
finger
in
the
air
it
be
fun
the
upshot
be
charlie
scar
them
to
death
with
all
these
plan
legal
response
if
they
persist
they
back
off
they
agree
they
would
not
put
in
any
more
copycat
store
and
after
a
time
would
change
the
one
they
have
part
of
see
competitive
advantage
be
that
it
be
a
leader
in
its
market
in
some
business
the
very
nature
of
thing
be
a
sort
of
cascade
toward
the
overwhelm
dominance
of
one
firm
say
munger
it
tends
to
cascade
to
a
winner
take
all
result
and
these
advantage
of
scale
be
so
great
for
example
that
when
jack
welch
come
into
general
electric
he
just
say
to
hell
with
it
we
be
either
go
to
be
number
one
or
number
two
in
every
field
we
be
in
or
we
be
go
to
be
out
that
be
a
very
tough
mind
thing
to
do
but
i
think
it
be
a
correct
decision
if
you
be
think
about
maximize
shareholder
wealth
during
that
period
huggins
come
to
the
opinion
that
munger
be
a
very
practical
person
the
ben
franklin
thing
be
appropriate
charlie
as
corny
as
hell
but
what
more
do
you
need
the
problem
with
encroachment
on
its
territory
take
several
year
to
resolve
say
huggins
and
there
be
other
difficulty
as
well
during
president
richard
nixon
wage
and
price
control
for
example
the
company
have
to
operate
differently
once
the
problem
of
the
early
day
be
under
control

discount
from
book
and
liquidate
value
it
do
not
work
those
two
thing
together
help
shift
our
think
to
the
idea
of
pay
high
price
for
well
business
when
they
bought
see
charlie
and
warren
still
be
bottom
fisher
but
as
they
learn
and
as
the
business
grow
change
be
necessary
you
could
once
find
value
by
just
root
around
in
the
less
travel
part
of
the
world
the
pink
sheet
you
would
find
a
lot
of
opportunity
say
charlie
it
be
only
luck
that
blue
chip
be
able
to
buy
see
at
the
price
they
paid
munger
credit
al
marshall
for
give
the
final
push
toward
the
correct
decision
if
they
have
want
just
more
for
see
we
would
not
have
bought
it
say
munger
we
be
that
dumb
hack
then
even
so
when
we
bought
the
business
almost
nobody
be
have
much
success
sell
boxed
chocolate
except
see
and
we
want
to
know
why
that
be
and
if
the
success
be
sustainable
say
buffett
when
see
turn
out
to
be
an
excellent
ongoing
business
munger
and
buffett
realize
how
much
easy
and
pleasanter
it
be
to
buy
a
good
business
and
just
let
it
roll
along
than
to
buy
a
deeply
discount
but
struggle
business
and
spend
time
energy
and
sometimes
more
money
set
it
straight
if
we
have
not
bought
see
we
would
not
have
bought
coke
say
buffett
so
thank
see
for
the
billion
we
have
the
luck
to
buy
the
whole
business
and
that
taught
us
a
whole
lot
we
have
have
windmill
well
i
have
have
windmill
charlie
be
never
in
the
windmill
business
i
have
have
second
rate
department
store
pump
and
textile
mill
which
he
decide
be
nearly
as
problematic
as
the
windmill
munger
say
he
and
buffett
should
have
see
the
advantage
of
pay
for
quality
much
earlier
do
not
think
it
be
necessary
to
be
as
dumb
as
we
be
u
see
be
a
slow
grower
but
its
growth
be
steady
and
reliable
and
best
of
all
it
do
not
take
additional
infusion
of
capital
we
have
try
different
way
to
put
money
into
see
explain
buffett
if
we
knew
a
way
to
put
additional
money
into
see
and
produce
return
a
quarter
of
what
we
be
get
out
of
the
exist
business
we
would
do
it
in
a
second
we
love
it
we
play
around
with
different
idea
but
we
do
not
know
how
to
do
it
munger
add
by
the
way
we
really
should
not
complain
about
this
because
we
have
carefully
select
a
bunch
of
business
that
just
drown
in
money
every
year
munger
told
berkshire
shareholder
that
there
be
a
large
number
of
business
in
america
that
throw
off
lot
of
cash
but
which
cannot
be
expand
very
much
to
try
to
expand
would
be
throw
money
down
a
rat
hole
he
say
such
business
do
not
stir
acquisition
desire
in
most
corporation
but
they
be
welcome
at
berkshire
because
he
and
buffett
can
take
the
capital
and
invest
it
profitably
elsewhere
incidentally
that
be
the
same
reason
berkshire
pay
no
dividend
berkshire
hold
on
to
cash
when
buffett
believe
retain
earnings
can
produce
more
in
market
value
for
shareholder
than
would
likely
be
possible
if
the
earnings
be
not
reinvested
within
the
company
from
see
say
munger
we
have
learn
that
the
way
you
think
and
operate
must
involve
time
test
value
those
lesson
have
make
us
buy
more
wisely
elsewhere
and
make
many
decision
a
lot
well
so
we
have
gain
enormously
from
our
relationship
with
see
despite
see
place
of
honor
in
the
berkshire
crown
it
now
represent
only
a
tiny
portion
of
berkshire
value
to
its
owner
even
if
see
be
now
worth
billion
which
be
conceivable
in
light
of
its
sale
that
be
less
than
percent
of

that

charlie
i
can
tell

a

about

he
reminds

of
ben

i
can
tell
you
a
lot
about
ben
franklin
jam
a
biography
nut
myself
say
munger
and
i
think
when
you
be
try
to
teach
the
great
concept
that
work
it
help
to
tie
them
into
the
life
and
personality
of
the
people
who
developed
them
i
think
that
you
learn
economics
well
if
you
make
adam
smith
your
friend
that
sound
funny
make
friend
among
the
eminent
dead
but
if
you
go
through
life
make
friend
with
the
eminent
dead
who
have
the
right
idea
i
think
it
will
work
well
in
life
and
work
well
in
education
it
be
way
well
than
just
give
the
basic
concept
munger
have
study
the
life
and
scientific
writing
of
albert
einstein
charles
darwin
and
isaac
newton
but
his
favorite
eminent
dead
person
have
always
be
franklin
a
passion
that
he
share
with
warren
buffett
first
serious
mentor
benjamin
graham
munger
admires
franklin
for
be
the
best
american
author
of
his
time
the
best
investor
scientist
diplomat
merchant
and
great
contributor
to
educational
and
civic
cause
though
he
admits
that
franklin
have
a
lusty
side
to
his
personality
and
perhaps
neglect
his
wife
munger
say
that
story
of
how
badly
franklin
behave
reflect
a
shallow
understand
of
franklin
his
situation
and
the
tine
in
which
he
live
it
be
from
franklin
that
munger
glean
the
concept
of
become
wealthy
so
that
he
could
be
free
to
make
a
contribution
to
humankind
i
always
care
more
about
be
useful
than
die
rich
say
munger
but
sometimes
i
drift
too
far
away
from
this
idea
franklin
be
the
son
of
a
candle
maker
who
have
too
many
child
and
at
an
early
age
ben
make
his
way
from
boston
to
philadelphia
to
escape
an
apprenticeship
with
a
cruel
brother
from
an
early
age
franklin
strove
to
be
it
well
person
and
build
a
well
life
after
the
phenomenally
successful
poor
richard
almanac
make
franklin
both
famous
and
rich
he
devote
his
life
mostly
to
public
service
like
franklin
munger
have
learn
that
his
idea
about
a
good
and
proper
society
do
not
always
coincide
with
the
belief
of
others
though
most
of
the
french
continued
to
find
franklin
interest
and
entertain
during
his
sojourn
in
paris
the
king
become
so
jealous
that
he
put

out
that
it

only

fire
off
a

letter
to

claim
that
a
review
of
paul

anne
ehrlich
book
the
population
explosion
have
miss
the
point
the
book
reviewer
say
munger
argues
that
human
welfare
will
continue
to
improve
as
a
result
of
desirable
population
growth
accompany
by
even
faster
technological
development
ala
it
be
not
so
simple
in
a
finite
world
system
subject
to
the

two
variable
population

per
caput
welfare
ca
not
both
be
maximize
forever
munger
say
it
be
nonsensical
to
expect
as
the
reviewer
have
suggest
that
some
technology
now
unknown
will
step
forward
to
solve
all
the
problem
of
pollution
erosion
and
so
forth
no
one
contemplate
the
prospective
environmental
burden
described
by
the
ehrlich
can
be
confident
that
such
a
benign
demographic
transition
will
occur
or
that
the
population
growth
driven
condition
wo
not
be
ghastly
in

or
less
for
one
thing
the
technological
development
that
be
necessary
to
permit
a
peacetime
population
increase
will
also
make
weapon
both
more
effective
and
more
generally
available
in
a
more
crowd
world
buffett
be
just
as
solid
in
his
view
in
buffett
declare
that
the
world
would
have
far
few
problem
if
you
could
make
every
child
born
in
this
country
and
this

a

the
closest
thing
we

molly

that
with
the

they

take
on
a
broader
scope
move
away
from
small
regional
company

for
more
visible

it
be
the
begin
of

other

would
recognize
when
you
try

explain
what
your

for

history
for
someone
who
have
become
acclimate
to

buffalo
severe
winter
climate
may
have
be
a
shock
to
munger
in
a
letter
to
katharine
graham
charlie
refer
to
buffalo
as
a
town
where
the

washington
wear
a

the

relatively

munger
snap
why
do
a

need
a

buffett
jokingly
dubbed
it
the

munger
with
his
passion
for

be
repel
by
the
design
of
the

famous
architect
who
have
impressed
old
mr

by

the

model
of

royce
that
she
do
he
put

that

unusable
in

and
employ
an
artsy
craftsy
construction
method
that
cause
unfixable
leak
all
at
great
cost
this
be
not
charlie
concept
of
successful
design
but
in
the
year
the
boxy
cement
like
building
in
the
center
of
buffalo
age
downtown
seem
reasonably
spacious
though
austere
it
certainly
be
no
more
opulent
than
most
other
metropolitan
daily
newspaper
facility
like
graham
washington
post
a
newspaper
in
which
buffett
have
make
a
major
investment
in
the
buffalo
even

prove
to
be
a
difficult
business
proposition
in
both
situation
munger
and
buffett
prove
that
though
they
pride
themselves
on
fair
deal
they
also
could
take
tough
position
and
stick
to
them
when

the

it

the

several
other
problem
like
the
washington

the

several
extremely
active

it
also

additionally
the

the

outsold
the

during
the

its
lucrative
sunday

kept
the

the

knew
that
long

only
one

could
survive
in

and
that
their
new

would
either
perish

stand
alone
the

plainly
require
a

his
keen
sense
of
what

well
when

they
knew
full
well
that

instigate
an
old
fashion
newspaper
war
despite
the
best
effort
of
munger
and
lawyer
he
recruit
to
help
the

remain
in
place
for
two
year
a
los

friend
of

ernest
zack
be
hire
to
help
with
the
legal
battle
in
buffalo
which
be
so
difficult
and
try
that
zack
become
exhaust
when
zack
get
so
weary
or
frustrate
that
he
complain
munger
admonish
him
oh
it
be
good
for
you
during
the
drawn
out
legal
and
business
siege
people
begin
to
notice
that
munger
be
have
difficulty
with
his
vision
you
would
work
with
charlie
go
to
his
office
and
talk
to
him
about
whatever
the
situation
be
charlie
be
very
good
at
reading
document
say
bob
denham
a
lot
of
people
do
not
read
them
well
but
it
become
difficult
for
him
he
would
struggle
through
and
as
reading
orient
as
charlie
be
he
must
have
be
very
concerned
even
so
say
denham
he
be
pretty
stoic
i
think
he
found
it
quite
frustrate
he
do
not
take
it
out
on
other
people
finally
munger
have
to
admit
he
be
not
able
to
read
paperwork
the
way
he
once
do
and
warn
his
colleague
not
to
count
on
him
to
discover
error
the
way
he
use
to
he
told
denham
that
the
responsibility
for
carefully
review
document
be
now
his
at
a
relatively
young
age

the
eye
damage
could
have
be
from
over
exposure
to
the
bright
california
sunshine
without
the
benefit
of
sunglass
charlie
suspect
that
the
more
likely
cause
be
use
a
sunlamp
when
he
be
a
very
young
boy
for
some
reason
munger
say
he
become
enamor
with
the
lamp
and
use
it
extensively
without
eye
protection
unaware
of
the
possible
future
consequence
despite
his
worsen
health

a
gallon
of
gas
in
the
trunk
which
be
not
safe
at
all
say
marshall
because
he
could
never
remember
to
put
gas
in
the
thing
when
the
mungers
and
the
marshall

down
a
small

road
talk
gesture
and
look
around
at
everything
as
he
drove
al
look
up
and
saw
that
a
bridge
ahead
of

be
wash
out
stop
he
shout
to
charlie
who
do
not
slow
down
a
bit
why
charlie
ask
marshall
be
so
frighten
he
could
not
find
the
word
to
explain
but
munger
finally
notice
the
problem
and
screech
to
a
halt
just
before
go
over
the
edge
when
he
lose
his
eyesight
he
handle
it
in
a
pragmatic
fashion
recall
otis
booth
he
get
some
book
on
braille
to
see
if
that
would
work
for
him
when
he
figure
out
he
would
have
enough
vision
to
read
well
charlie
give
up
all
thought
of
braille
even
so
say
hal
borthwick
it
be
not
pleasant
for
a
man
who
love
to
read
he
be
a
voracious
reader
in
every
one
of
our
house
there
will
ibe
three
four
five
book
stack
by
his
chair
and
three
four
or
five
more
stack
by
the
bed
he
have
certain
thing
he
want
to
read
he
be
not
a
fiction
reader
so
it
be
either
a
business
book
or
a
biography
or
a
history
or
science
hook
it
be
always
base
on
fact
though
munger
play
golf
travel
and
read
constantly
there
be
time
when
the
glass
eye
becomes
a
real
inconvenience
booth
say
that
when
charlie
go
to
the

that
he

blind
in
one
eye
explain
booth
the
examiner
say
he
would
have
to
have
a
doctor
letter
on

charlie
say
hell

prove
it
to
you
right
here
it
be
a
false
eye
i
will
take
it
out
and
lay
it
on
the
counter
if
you
like
the

still
insist
on
a
doctor
note
until
charlie

rather
modest

they
give
up
the
ghost
and
that
building
be
now
vacant

that
it

have
cost
more
to
clean
the
building
up
and
move
furniture
into
the
vacant
restaurant
than
it

we

it
be

our

recur
if

in

inadequate
management
at
many

the

responds
to
the

mess
as
exxon
would
have
respond

if
it
have
insist
thereafter
on
liberal
use
of
whiskey
by

captain
it
would
be
much
well
if
the
league
follow
the
wise
example
in
another
era
of
the
manufacturer
which
make
a
public
apology
to
congress
because
the
league
have
clearly
mislead
its
government
for
a
long
time
to
the
taxpayer
great
detriment
a
public
apology
be
in
order
not
redouble
effort
to
mislead
far
we
know
that
there
be
a
school
of
thought
that
trade
association
be
to
be
held
to
no
high
standard
that
they
be
suppose
to
act
as
the
league
be
act
in
this
view
each
industry
creates
a
trade
association
not
to
proffer
truth
or
reason
or
normal
human
courtesy
follow
egregious
fault
but
merely
to
furnish
self
serve
nonsense
and
political
contribution
to
counterbalance
in
the
legislative
milieu
the
selfserving
nonsense
and
political
contribution
of
other
industry
trade
association
but
the
evidence
be
now
before
us
that
the
type
of
trade
association
conduct
when
back
as
in
the
league
case
by
vocal
and
affluent
constituent
in
every
congressional
district
have
an
immense
capacity
to
do
harm
to
the
country
therefore
the
league
public
duty
be
to
behave
in
an
entirely
different
way
much
as
major
league
baseball
reform
after
the
black
sox
scandal
moreover
just
as

off
because
of
the
increase
mess
cause
by

short

in
the
past
client
institution
will
later
prove
ill

by
the
present
short

this
mr

beyond

all
munger
realize
that
the

would
have
a
negative
impact
on

that

the

he
realize
on
the

of

as
well
he
prefer
to
play
out
the
salomon

how

advantage
people

by
try

nevertheless
some
of

now
you
can
say
that
be
eccentric
and
you
be
right
buffett
explain
far
at
berkshire
incidentally
we
have
about
three
or
four
percent
plus
own

where
the
balance
be
own
by

where
the

in

we

they

they

all
of
that
and
they

since

a

into

at
berkshire

to
investor
try
to
mimic
buffett
this
seem
to
be
logical
since
berkshire
own
many
of
the

stock
that
wesco
hold
analyst
sometimes
call
wesco
a
miniature
or
tourist
class
version
of
berkshire
hathaway
much
the

but
cheaper
since

tends

to

later
munger
do
not
like
the
comparison
of
wesco
to
berkshire
and
warn
wesco
be
not
an
equally
good
but
small
version
of
berkshire
hathaway
well
because
its
small
size
make
growth
easy
instead
each
dollar
of
book
value
at
wesco
continue
to
provide
much
less
intrinsic
value
than
a
similar
dollar
of
book
value
at
berkshire
hathaway
moreover
the
quality
disparity
in
book
value
intrinsic
merit
have
in

be
widen
in

though
it

never

do
so
say
munger
what
we
have
create
at
berkshire
and
wesco
be
to
some
extent
a
cult
and
you
can
say
it
be
a
nice
cult
and
you
like
the
people
who
join
and
we
do
feel
that
way
but
to
some
extent
we
have
follower
who
be
unusually
interested
in
what
we
do
and
feel
comfortable
about
invest
with
us
i
think
it
be
have
effect
on
the
stock
price
of
wesco
and
berkshire
just
to
keep
everyone
think
straight
munger
departs
from
the
philosophy
of
berkshire
hathaway
and
in
the
annual
report
he
calculates
wesco
intrinsic
value
for
shareholder
at
the
end
of
munger
say
wesco
intrinsic
value
be
per
share
at
that
time
wesco
be
sell
for
about
percent
above
intrinsic
value
munger
have
no
compunction
about
tell
shareholder
when
the
stock
be
overprice
back
in
he
say
an
orangutan
could
figure
out
that
the
stock
be
sell
mile
above
the
value
of
the
company
if
it
be
liquidate
i
keep
tell
people
this
but
they
keep
buying
the
stock
in
june
munger
told
shareholder
that
their
equity
be
worth
per
share
a
decline
from
the
year
earlier
the
change
be
base
on
the
fluctuate
price
of
the
publicly
trade
equity
that
wesco
own
which
in
turn
affect
wesco
unrealized
gain
from
these
holding
at
the
close
of
wesco
be
trading
near
its
week
low
of
disappoint
for
investor
who
during
the
year
saw
the
stock
price
soar
as
high
as
part
of
wesco
decline
could
be
attribute
to
its
freddie
mac
holding
after
two
consecutive
year
of
stock
price
increase
of
great
than
percent
freddie
mac
share
price
be
driven
back
down
by
high
interest
rate
the
stock
fell
percent
over
a
month
period
between
december
and
february
the
price
dip
do
not
disturb
munger
equanimity
i
be
year
of
age
he
say
i
have
be
through
a
number
of
down
period
if
you
live
a
long
time
you
be
go
to
be
out
of
investment
fashion
some
of
the
time
munger
say
it
be
appropriate
to
calculate
wesco
intrinsic
value
for
shareholder
and
not
to
do
it
for
berkshire
shareholder
because
the
company
be
quite
different
wesco
be
so
liquid
and
its
operating
business
so
moderate
in
size
that
it
be
rather
easy
to
make
a
computation
as
to
its
asset
value
you
can
figure
out
what
would
happen
if
you
just
close
the
place
and
mail
check
back
to
all
the
shareholder
partly
because
of
the
reflect
glory
of
berkshire
partly
because
wesco
have
many
of
the
same
investment
holding
that
berkshire
do
and
partly
because
of
munger
unusual
personality
wesco
attracts
its
own
cult
follow
munger
protest
at
the
silliness
of
it
all
but
he
be
willing
to
sit
for
hour
answer
question
pose
to
him
by
shareholder
and
the
medium
the
audience
seem
to
enjoy
the
discourse
stay
until
munger
be
out
of
time
and
must
leave
for
the
board
meeting
that
be
schedule
directly
after
the
annual
meeting
at
the
meeting
when
the
share
price
be
fluctuate
wildly
charlie
explain
to
wesco
shareholder
that
some
corporate
problem
seem
large
at
the
moment
but
in
time
they
will
seem
trivial
that
be
why
long
term
invest
pay
off
wesco
once
move
its
account
from
security
pacific
to
bank
of
america
where
we
have
the
account
get
out
of
balance
and
nobody
at
the
bank
could
get
it
back
in
balance
we
close
our
account
and
let
it
run
out
and
make
some
accounting
adjustment
in
five
year
nobody
will
remember

i
write
on
the

by
the
time
he

have
accumulate
enough
share
of

most
of
his
personal
money
in
berkshire
corporate

it
would
be
a
leap
of
faith
for

what
buffett
intend
to
do
with

he
try
to
run

financial
mistake
buffett

buffett
have
learn
the
basic
of

when

study
under

who
at
the
time
be
chairman
of

buffett
have
use
that
expertise
at

back
when

berkshire
make
its
first
substantial
foray

approximately
million
many
of

very
large
investment

through
national
indemnity
during
this
activity
munger
kept
agitate
to
buy
well
quality
company
one
with
strong
earnings
potential
for
the
long
term
and
one
he
believe
would
be
less
troublesome
to
own
there
be
huge
advantage
for
an
individual
to
get
into
a
position
where
you
make
a
few
great
investment
and
just
sit
back
say
munger
you
be
pay
less
to

you
be
listen

in

warren
toward
coca

a

that
will
have
carry
value
for
generation
observe
ron
olson
that
be
consistent
with
how
charlie
conduct
his
own
life
he
be
not
look
for
a
quick
victory
but
to
long
term
success
in
berkshire
start
acquire
coca
cola
stock
and
within
about
six
month
purchase
percent
of
the

at
an
average

of
a

a
total
investment
of

buffett
an
addict
of
caffeinated
soft
drink
felt
confident
that
coca
cola
be
a
quality
company
with
superior
long
term
prospect
in
fact
buffett
himself
give
up
pepsi
cola
in
favor
of
coke
many
time
charlie
elevates
warren
think
such
as
go
for
a
strong
franchise
they
can
converse
on
any
level
say
buffalo
news
publisher
stan
lipsey
when
you
have
people
that
be
think
and
living
at
that
level
you
not
only
get
the
intellectual
exchange
you
get
idea
that
be
complementary
apparently
munger
have
not
always
agree
with
buffett
when
it
come
to
personal
invest
which
at
time
work
to
his
advantage
when
buffett
sell
berkshire
capital
city
communication
stock
in
to
he
later
regret
the
sale
munger
however
kept
some
personal
holding
of
cap
city
which
perform
exceptionally
well
despite
their
blazing
success
buffett
and
munger
try
numerous
idea
that
do
not
pan
out
before
they
bought
their
washington
post
share
buffett
and
munger
call
on
katharine
graham
and
ask
her
to
participate
in
purchasing
the
neu
yorker
magazine
graham
do
not
even
know
who
these
two
guy
from
west
of
the
potomac
river
be
and
she
do
not
think
twice
before
turn
down
their
proposal
people
use
to
bring
project
in
all
the
time
i
just
thought
about
whether
we
want
to
be
partner
in
the
new
yorker
at
the
time
i
do
not
i
thought
it
need
a
new
editor
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
choose
one
i
sent
them
to
see
fritz
beebe
say
graham
the
new
yorker
be
a
lose
opportunity
but
probably
not
a
huge
loss
failure
and
misfire
be
part
of
the
record
during
this
period
some
major
mistake
have
be
make
during
the
decade
both
in
product
and
personnel
buffett
write
in
berkshire
annual
report
yet
he
add
it
be
comfort
to
be
in
a
business
where
some
mistake
can
be
make
and
yet
quite
satisfactory
overall
performance
can
be
achieve
in
a
sense
this
be
the
opposite
of
our
textile
business
where
even
very
good
management
probably
can
average
only
modest
result
one
of
the
lesson
your
management
have
learn
and
unfortunately
sometimes
relearn
be
the
importance
of
be
in
business
where
tailwind
prevail
rather
than
headwind
throughout
the
s
and
straight
through
to
the
end
of
the
century
buffett
and
munger
show
a
knack
for
get
a
good
deal
when
they
buy
a
company
the
management
usually
stay
with
it
and
the
acquisition
require
very
little
effort
except
for
collect
profit
and
allocate
the
capital
to
its
high
and
best
use
our
chief
contribution
to
the
business
we
acquire
say
munger
be
what
we
do
not
do
what
they
do
not
do
be
interfere
with
effective
manager
especially
those
with
certain
characteristic
there
be
integrity
intelligence
experience
and
dedication
say
charlie
that
be
what
human
enterprise
need
to
run
well
and
we
have
be
very
lucky
in
get
this
marvelous
group
of
associate
to
work
with
all
these
year
it
would
be
hard
to
do
well
i
think
than
we
have
do
write
for
an
insurance
publication
john
nauss
a
charter
property
and
casualty
underwriter
observe
warren
and
charlie
comment
that
they
simply
get
out
of
the
way
and
let
their
manager
focus
on
run
their
business
without
interference
or
concern
about
other
factor
but
they
do
more
they
create
perhaps
the
best
operating
environment
for
business
that
exist
anywhere
this
environment
include
wise
evaluation
without
extensive
meeting
and
document
we
know
the
business
as
well
as
capital
access
focus
compensation
and
freedom
to
do
one
best
these
method
say
nauss
deserve
great
attention
from
the
business
community
both
charlie
and
warren
say
they
set
the
example
for
berkshire
company
by
keep
their
own
overhead
cost
at
a
minimum
berkshire
headquarters
be
simple
and
the
staff
be
small
the
company
overhead
ratio
be
s
th
that
of
many
mutual
fund
i
do
not
know
of
anybody
our
size
who
have
low
overhead
than
we
do
munger
say
and
we
like
it
that
way
once
a
company
start
get
fancy
he
say
it
be
difficult
to
stop
in
fact
warren
once
consider
buying
a
building
on
a
distressed
basis
for
about
a
quarter
of
what
it
would
have
cost
to
duplicate
and
tempt
as
it
be
he
decide
that
it
would
give
everybody
bad
idea
to
have
surroundings
so
opulent
so
we
continue
to
run
our
insurance
operation
from
very
modest
quarter
at
one
time
berkshire
be
subpoenaed
for
its
staff
paper
in
connection
with
one
of
its
acquisition
but
say
munger
there
be
no
paper
there
be
no
staff
but
as
munger
so
often
say
what
right
for
berkshire
be
not
necessarily
right
for
all
company
we
have
decentralize
power
in
our
operating
business
to
a
point
just
short
of
total
abdication
our
model
not
right
for
everybody
but
it
be
suit
us
and
the
kind
of
people
who
have
join
us
but
we
do
not
have
criticism
for
others
such
as
general
electric
who
operate
with
plan
compare
performance
against
plan
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
that
be
just
not
our
style
he
add
berkshire

munger

it
be
a
perfectly
fabulous
human
achievement
to
edit
something
that
be
user
friendly
with
that
much
wisdom
encapsulate
be
a
fabulous
thing
while
munger
can
be
as
smug
about
the
success
of
berkshire
as
its
investor
be
he
ca
not
resist
tell
everyone
why
they
be
there
it
be
wonderful
that
we
all
come
here
each
year
charlie
told
a
group
of
friend
at
his
own
dinner
party
the
weekend
of
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
but
why
do
we
really
do
it
yes
it
be
fun
but
it
be
also
a
way
of
subtly
say
i
be
very
rich
it
be
also
a
way
of
subtly
say
i
be
very
smart
munger
then
go
on
to
say
that
it
be
become
a
problem
to
berkshire
that
many
original
shareholder
be
get
old
and
divide
up
the
share
among
their
heir
it
make
the
shareholder
base
grow
to
unwieldy
proportion
charlie
suggest
that
everyone
bring
their
unmarried
child
and
grandchild
to
the
annual
meeting
and
hold
mixer
dance
so
the
berkshire
heir
could
meet
and
marry
one
another
thus
keep
the
share
within
few
family
just
another
one
of
charlie
semi
bewildering
joke
while
berkshire
hathaway
be
gain
size
and
influence
and
munger
be
grow
wealthier
his
family
be
blissfully
unaware
of
what
be
happen
to
their
life
as
far
as
emilie
munger
be
concerned
her
father
be
chairman
of
blue
chip
stamp
and
blue
chip
stamp
be
something
you
get
at
a
store
and
paste
in
a
book
i
do
not
remember
when
berkshire
start
grow
to
a
point
at
which
he
be
in
a
different
league
say
emilie
i
think
my
parent
be
really
private
they
do
not
want
publicity
my
dad
be
a
creature
of
habit
so
everything
be
exactly
the
same
we
never
have
a
feel
we
be
grow
up
in
some
rich
household
though
charlie
be
become
a
celebrity
in
omaha
in
star
strewn
los
angeles
and
on
the
rest
of
the
west
coast
he
do
not
attract
much
attention
over
time
say
emilie
nothing
change
about
the
way
we
be
perceive
not
until
i
be
in
law
school
in
i
realize
some
group
over
at
the
business
school
recognize
my
name
the
lack
of
interest
the
munger
child
show
in
their
father
career
say
emilie
probably
have
something
to
do
with
come
of
age
in
the
s
and
s
i
go
to
a
fairly
liberal
college
almost
an
antibusiness
atmosphere
there
be
a
lot
of
socialism
evil
corporate
america
our
school
be
more
public
service
or
public
policy
orient
when
wendy
and
molly
go
to
school
it
be
really
different
if
emilie
munger
classmate
have
be
inclined
to
study
berkshire
and
it
be
business
practice
they
no
doubt
would
have
be
surprised
that
the
company
operates
nothing
like
other
corporate
giant
munger
and
buffett
have
remain
steadfast
in
keep
their
own
compensation
low
each
take
in
salary
plus
director
fee
from
various
corporation
not
control
by
berkshire
munger
director
fee
come
to
about
their
enormous
wealth
come
from
their
ownership
share
of
berkshire
though
that
be
more
true
for
buffett
than
it
be
for
munger
buffett
proportional
ownership
be
much
large
but
munger
also
follow
a
slightly
different
financial
path
charlie
family
have
percent
or
more
of
its
net
worth
in
berkshire
share
say
buffett
my
wife
susie
and
i
have
more
than
percent
though
buffett
say
he
almost
never
sell
share
munger
sometimes
do
in
fact
between
and
he
sell
million
worth
of
berkshire
additionally
munger
have
give
away
hundred
of
share
include
a
share
to
robert
cialdini
author
of
the
book
influence
just
because
he
like
him
and
his
work
i
have
give
away
a
fair
amount
of
berkshire
stock
in
the
last
couple
of
year
munger
say
i
give
away
a
lot
because
i
thought
it
be
the
correct
way
to
behave
and
i
have
sell
some
because
i
have
have
business
of
my
own
s
there
be
lesson
to
be
learn
from
his
personal
career
and
from
the
development
of
berkshire
hathaway
and
they
be
learnable
as
long
as
people
do
not
confuse
simplicity
with
ease
say
munger
though
he
do
not
think
everyone
will
learn
them
people
underrate
the
importance
of
a
few
simple
big
idea
and
i
think
to
the
extent
berkshire
hathaway
be
a
didactic
enterprise
teach
the
right
system
of
thought
the
chief
lesson
be
that
a
few
big
idea
really
work
i
think
these
filter
of
ours
have
work
pretty
well
because
they
be
so
simple
say
munger
even
so
munger
say
of
berkshire
i
knew
it
would
do
well
but
not
this
well
munger
child
say
they
continue
to
benefit
from
their
father
example
it
be
a
rich
lesson
to
learn
say
molly
munger
if
you
just
keep
press
on
and
do
not
let
anything

from
critic

especially
for
get
well
deal
on

than
other

would
the
term
of
the

be
particularly
attractive
in
case
such
as
salomon
and
usair
where
the
investment
be
not
acquire
on
the
open
market
in
these
situation
berkshire
be
summon
by
management
as
a
white
knight
either
to
save
the
company
from
a
hostile
takeover
or
to
provide
a
desperately
need
cash
infusion
the
deal
be
negotiate
often
take
the
form
of
prefer
stock
that
have
an
interest
rate
component
and
a
feature
that
allow
conversion
to
common
stock
at
a
specify
price
munger
defend
such
arrangement
say
that
it
be
appropriate
that
berkshire
get
term
not
available
to
others
because
berkshire
brings
more
to
the
party
than
just
our
money
munger
say
buffett
provide
advice
and
expertise
in
addition
to
patient
capital
that
allows

to
pursue
long

out
munger
other

also
benefit
when
the

company
rise
this
acquisition
list
include
only
some
of
berkshire
purchase
during
the
early
s
but
they
demonstrate
a
pattern
berkshire
be
stick
to
the
admittedly
broad
range
of
industry
buffett
and
munger
knew
best
but
with
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
insurance
field
perhaps
even
more
important
during
the
last
decade
of
the
century
munger
and
buffett
be
able
to
pursue
their
prefer
strategy
of
swallow
company
whole
whenever
possible
when
berkshire
own
a
company
entirely
the
two
be
free

painewebber

alice
schroeder

point
out
that
berkshire
have
become
the
buyer
of

for
business
owner
who
want
to
continue
to
operate
their
company
while
at
the

time
free
themselves
from

the

also
include
privately

where
the

investor
want

when
the
owner
swap
their
ownership
for
berkshire
share
with
limited
tax
consequence
then
later
sell
berkshire
stock
when
it
meet
their
need
berkshire
prefers
to
pay
cash
but
when
necessary
will
do
a
stock
swap
many
family
with
a
large

instantly
commit

that
good

idea
go

first
write
schroeder

we
believe
that
berkshire
generally

it

only
once
and
no
one
ever
get
a

price
from

the

around
this

why
berkshire
do
not
write
more

consider
its
size
munger
reply
people
be
always
say
to
berkshire
gee
why
do
not
you
write
a
lot
more
volume
in
relation
to
capital
everyone
else
be
do
it
the
rating
agency
say
that
you
can
write
twice
as
much
in
annual
volume
as
you
have
capital
and
they
look
at
our
billion
in
insurance
capital
and
say
that
be
billion
a
year
what
be
you
do
write
only
billion
but
then
somebody
else
come
in
and
asks
why
do
everybody
get
kill
last
year
but
you
maybe
the
question
be
related
munger
admit
that
berkshire
huge
supercat
or
catastrophic
event
insurance
unit
make
the
company
somewhat
vulnerable
but
he
think
they
have
become
expert
at
evaluate
the
risk
and
deal
with
it
appropriately
a
big
loss
from
a
california
earthquake
might
cause
an
insurance
loss
as
high
as
million
for
the
company
and
that
would
be
irritate
munger
say
the
northridge
california
earthquake
produce
a
significant
loss
though
the
company
do
not
say
how
much
nevertheless
that
year
berkshire
insurance
division
report
earnings
of
million
from
insurance
plus
million
from
investment
if
we
have
a
real
disaster
if
you
have
hurricane
andrew
follow
one
week
later
by
another
one
just
like
it
berkshire
would
have
a
very
unpleasant
year
say
munger
both
munger
and
buffett
have
repeatedly
warn
shareholder
that
as
the
company
grows
in
asset
it
will
have
more
difficulty
maintain
an
earnings
growth
rate
and
thus
share
price
growth
at
the
level
of
the
past
two
decade
size
at
a
certain
point
get
to
be
an
anchor
which
drag
you
down
explain
munger
we
always
knew
that
it
would
you
get
billion
in
marketable
security
show
me
unbelievable
compound
rate
when
people
get
billion
they
do
however
find
place
to
put
their
money
in
august
warren
buffett
have
in
his
pocket
about
billion
from
the
sale
of

he
begin
negotiate
that

to
buy
the
percent
of
the
insurance
company
berkshire
do
not
already
own
there
be
several
thorny
issue
to
be
resolve
include
how
to
fairly
manage
a
stock
trade
when
geico
paid
a
dividend
and
berkshire
do
not
negotiation
continued
for
seven
month
and
the
new
york
investment
banking
firm
morgan
stanley
be
brought
in
to
help
set
it
fair
price
for
geico
use
cash
flow
and
other
yardstick
morgan
stanley
say
geico
value
could
be
as
low
as
or
as
high
as
a

ultimately
morgan
stanley
suggest
as
a
fair
price
buffett
say
he
want
to
talk
to
munger
about
the
deal
later
the
same
day
he
offer
per

in
cash
to
geico
shareholder
it
cost
berkshire
billion
to

the
second

at
that
price
with
geico
berkshire
get
the
full

who
be
believe
by
many
to

the

and
have
an

however
simpson

simpson

somewhat
casually
that
there
be
plenty
of

however
munger
say
buffett
do
not
mean
to
imply
that

merely
that

we

crazy
indirect

munger

buffett

step
forward
and
admit
that
they
would
be
accumulate
a
large
stash
of
the
precious
metal
buffett
reveal
that
the
company
have
purchase
ounce
of
silver
between
july
and
january
over
year
ago
say
the
company
press
release
warren
buffett
ceo
of
berkshire
make
his
first
purchase
of
silver
in
anticipation
of
the
metal
demonetization
by
the
u
s
government
since
that
time
he
have
follow
silver
fundamental
but
no
entity
he
manages
have
own
it
in
recent
year
widely
publish
report
have
show
that
bullion
inventory
have
fall
very
materially
because
of
an
excess
of
user
demand
over
mine
production
and
reclamation
therefore
last
summer
mr
buffett
and
mr
munger
vice
chairman
of
berkshire
conclude
that
equilibrium
between
supply
and
demand
be
only
likely
to
be
establish
by
a
somewhat
high
price
at
the
berkshire
shareholder
meeting
munger
explain
that
the
company
million
purchase
of
about
percent
of
the
world
supply
of
silver
may
have
have
an
impact
on
the
silver
market
and
it
represent
an
uncharacteristic
buffett
investment
but
it
meant
very
little
to
berkshire
bottom
line
this
whole
episode
will
have
about
as
much
impact
on
berkshire
future
as
warren
bridge
play
it
be
close
to
a
non
event
munger
issue
his
usual
warn
that
just
because
berkshire
bought
silver
or
convertible
prefer
share
of
airline
stock
or
do
anything
at
all
do
not
mean
everyone
else
should
do
it
it
would
be
a
huge
mistake
to
assume
that
berkshire
hathaway
be
the
right
model
for
all
america
it
would
be
an
absolute
disaster
if
every
single
corporation
in
america
suddenly
try
to
turn
itself
into
a
clone
of
berkshire
hathaway
they
paid
around
to
per
troy
ounce
for
the
silver
in
the
summer
of
by
february
the
price
be
up
to
per
ounce
its
year
high
but
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
be
trading
at
around
per
ounce
and
the
price
have
be
relatively
flat
since
then
munger
would
not
say
what
berkshire
position
in
silver
be
at
that
time
but
say
that
base
on
the
current
price
it
be
perfectly
obvious
that
their
expectation
of
silver
price
performance
have
not
yet
be
realize
monger
and
b
uffett
can
still
startle
the
investment
world
now
and
then
and
as
he
do
in
the
past
munger
sometimes
go
forward
with
his
own
idea
even
if
buffett
be
not
fully
aboard
such
be
the
case
with
costco
the
issequah
washington
base
warehouse
store
i
admire
this
place
so
much
that
i
violate
my
rule
against
sit
on
outside
board
say
munger
it
be
hard
to
think
of
people
who
have
do
more
in
my
lifetime
to
change
the
world
of
retailing
for
good
for
add
human
happiness
for
the
customer
munger
contends
that
by
sell
quality
merchandise
very
close
to
cost
the
store
built
such
a
loyal
customer
base
that
it
qualifies
as
a
franchise
if
you
get
hooked
on
go
to
costco
with
your
family
you
will
go
for
the
rest
of
your
life
he
say
one
of
the
reason
munger
like
costco
be
because
of
jim
sinegal
the
company
president
whose
office
have
no
wall
separate
him
from
passing
employee
sinegal
chairman
of
costco
study
at
the
foot
of
sol
price
the
san
diego
california
entrepreneur
who
originate
the
warehouse
store
concept
price
first
open
the
california
base
fedmart
store
then
sell
the
chain
to
a
german
company
who
apparently
do
not
understand
the
concept
and
could
not
keep
the
store
go
price
then
take
the
plain
wrap
shopping
concept
a
level
high
with
his
price
club
warehouse
store
price
club
eventually
be
acquire
by
costco
which
now
be
the
second
large
warehouse
store
chain
behind
wal
mart
sam
club
charlie
absolutely
crow
at
the
story
of
costco
paper
towel
a
story
that
to
munger
represent
an
admirable
example
of
business
ethic
costco
produce
its
own
line
of
kirkland
product
which
it
guarantee
to
be
as
good
or
well
than
the
top
sell
product
in
its
field
when
costco
paper
towel
do
not
live
up
to
the
promise
they
be
withdrawn
until
a
suitable
towel
could
be
sell
he
truly
believe
in
our
business
say
sinegal
add
that
the
year
old
munger
have
never
miss
a
board
meeting
he
love
it
buffett
be
ask
why
he
have
not
bought
more
costco
share
consider
that
munger
own
share
and
be
on
the
board
of
director
yeah
you
hit
on
a
good
one
here
buffett
reply
we
should
have
own
more
costco
and
probably
if
charlie
have
be
sit
in
omaha
we
would
have
own
more
costco
charlie
be
constantly
tell
me
about
this
terrific
method
of
distribution
and
after
year
or
so
i
start
catch
on
to
what
he
be
say
and
we
bought
a
little
of
costco
at
berkshire
we
actually
negotiate
to
buy
more
i
make
the
most
common
mistake
that
i
make
we
start
buying
it
and
the
price
go
up
and
instead
of
follow
it
up
and
continue
to
buy
more
if
costco
have
stayed
at
a
share
or
so
where
we
be
buying
it
we
would
have
bought
a
lot
more
but
instead
it
go
to
h
and
who
could
pay
when
they
would
be
pay
it
be
not
quite
that
bad
but
i
have
make
that
mistake
a
lot
of
time
and
it
be
very
irritate
in
february
munger
make
a
related
investment
when
he
and
several
family
member
bought
to
percent
of
san
diego
base
price
enterprise
inc
price

be
a
real

retain
from
the
old
price
club
retail
empire
it
own
shopping
center
some
of
which
be
anchor
by
costco
store
the
munger
group
hold
around
million
of
price
million
prefer
share
buffett
also
make
independent
investment
for
his
own
account
such
be
the
case
in
the
summer
of
when
he
bought
a
percent
stake
in
bell
industry
a
small
california
electronics
business
in
january
a
month
after
it
be
disclose
that
buffett
bought
share
in
the
company
he
quietly
sell
for
a
profit
of
million
a
percent
return
on
investment
buffett
and
munger
have
warn
that
berkshire
hathaway
like
so
many
other
business
could
go
through
a
negative
cycle
they
have
say
this
for
so
long
that
shareholder
and
analyst
alike
stop
believe
them
they
be
however
tell
the
truth
in
berkshire
report
that
its
earnings
slip
percent
from
as
gain
from
investment
fell
by
more
than
half
that
do
not
mean
berkshire
actually
lose
money
net
earnings
be
just
down
billion
or
per
share
in
compare
to
billion
or
per
share
for
the
previous
year
throughout
its
history
berkshire
short
term
earnings
have
be
volatile
partly
because
insurance
result
be
notoriously
bumpy
and
partly
because
munger
and
buffett
be
willing
to
forego
short
term
result
for
longer
term
gain
at
the
end
of
the
century
gen
re
be
be
reorganize
to
well
fit
the
berkshire
philosophy
and
geico
be
be
prim
for
a
growth
spurt
berkshire
share
price
decline
percent
in
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
decade
and
the
price
kept
fall
in
the
early
part
of
but
so
be
it
munger
tell
investor
to
conduct
their
financial
affair
so
that
no
matter
what
crazy
thing
happen
in
the
market
they
can
stay
in
the
game
he
caution
that
if
you
ca
not
afford
for
your
berkshire
hathaway
stock
or
any
stock
for
that
matter
to
drop
percent
you
probably
should
not
own
it
the
share
price
decline
could
tarnish
the
pair
image
with
the
public
but
any
wane
in
his
and
buffett
personal
popularity
might
come
as
a
welcome
relief
both
men
be
constantly
badger
to
make
speech
give
personal
advice
or
contribute
money
to
hundred
of
different
charity
nevertheless
in
berkshire
be
still
a
powerful
company
operating
revenue
give
it
a
rank
of
on
the
fortune
when
measure
by
earnings
exclude
investment
gain
it
ranked
fifty
fourth
but
some
investor
be
worried
that
in
the
last
year
to
start
with
the
number
one
berkshire
would
have
a
substantial
earnings
decline
net
earnings
be
strong
although
at
billion
they
be
less
than
half
net
earnings
per
share
book
value
rise
only
percent
and
relative
to
the
s
p
result
be
down
percent
overall
and
for
the
long
term
munger
be
optimistic
about
the
future
of
berkshire
hathaway
for
very
simple
reason
basically
we
have
a
wonderful
hunch
of
business
we
have
float
that
keep
increase
and
a
pretty
good
record
of
do
well
in
marketable
security
none
of
that
have
go
away
indeed
in
the
first
quarter
berkshire
net
income
rise
by
percent
as
the
company
have
grown
and
take
shape
the
relationship
between
munger
and
buffett
have
change
somewhat
in
the
s
and
s
they
confer
several
time
every
day
we
do
not
talk
as
often
say
buffett
we
talk
about
more
prospective
idea
year
ago
there
be
a
time
when
we
average
well
over
once
a
day
they
be
long
conversation
the
hospital
be
his
main
occupation
now
harvard
school
and
mungerville
those
be
not
thing
for
us
to
talk
about
charlie
be
just
a
fraction
less
involve
in
berkshire
than
i
be
but

additionally
mozer
make

then
switch
the
transaction
onto
salomon

munger
first
heard
of
the
situation
on
thursday
august
from
salomon
president
thomas
strauss
and
its
inside
attorney
donald
feuerstein
from
the
very
first
telephone
call
munger
harbor
suspicion
that
salomon
official
story
be
incomplete
buffett
be
have
dinner
at
lake
tahoe
with
the
executive
of
one
of
berkshire
subsidiary
when
he
talk
to
strauss
and
feuerstein
from
the
sketchy
detail
and
matter
of
fact
tone
the
matter
do
not
strike
buffett
as
an
extreme
crisis
it
be
saturday
before
buffett
call
munger
at
star
island
and
only
then
do
he
realize
how
serious
the
infraction
be
salomon
lawyer
have
read
to
munger
their
talk
point
an
internal
document
salomon
executive
would
use
during
medium
interview
regard
a
news
release
that
be
about
to
be
distribute
the
talk
point
note
that
one
part
of
the
problem
have
be
know
since
late
april
munger
object
to
the
use
of
the
passive
voice
and
demand
to
be
told
who
exactly
knew
though
munger
challenged
the
word
of
the
talk
point
the
attorney
explain
that
management
and
its
lawyer
be
worried
that
different
word
would
threaten
the
firm
funding
its
ability
to
roll
over
the
billion
of
dollar
of
short
term
debt
that
become
due
daily
this
be
dangerous
because
salomon
be
highly
leveraged
with
only
billion
of
equity
in
addition
to
the
short
term
debt
salomon
be
rely
on
billion
in
medium
term
note
bank
debt
and
commercial
paper
in
her
account
of
the
salomon
affair
in
fortune
magazine
carol
loomis
write
so
salomon
play
be
to
tell
its
director
and
regulator
that
management
have
know
of
mozer
misconduct
but
to
avoid
save
this
publicly
munger
do
not
like
it
find
this
behavior
neither
candid
nor
smart
but
not
consider
himself
an
expert
on
funding
he
subside
munger
be
indignant
at
the
attempt
to
brush
over
personal
culpability
but
perhaps
because
charlie
and
warren
thought
highly
of
salomon
chief
executive
officer
john
gutfruend
and
have
a
congenial
relationship
with
him
munger
admits
that
warren
and
i
do
not
see
john
downfall
that
first
even
nevertheless
munger
be
certain
from
the
very
outset
that
salomon
have
step
in
a
pile
of
horse
manure
after
all
treasury
security
a
trillion
business
be
the
foundation
of
the
united
state
financial
system
salomon
be
a
primary
dealer
in
u

of
only
about

the
privileged

from
the
federal
government
and
resell
them
to
customer
individual
in
america
and
abroad
business
and
other
government
invest
in
u
s
treasury
security
because
they
trust
the
u
s
government
and
its
public
finance
system
however
the
system
itself
operates
on
a
delicate
balance
of
trust
and
some
expert
fear
that
the
salomon
breach
of
conduct
would
ruin
the
reputation
of
american
security
market
worldwide
and
raise

it

need
both
of
us
wall
street
veteran
be
surprised
and
puzzle
at
the
salomon

since
buffett
and

often
make
disparage
remark
about
the
quality
of
work
in
the
brokerage

investment
industry
as

that
he

he
be

he

in

ask
if
i
could
be
the
general
counsel
the
resignation
of
gutfreund
strauss
and
the
general
counsel
be
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
regulator
it
would
be
necessary
to
appoint
new
management
someone
regulator
and
the
public
would
believe
be
completely
ethical
and
trustworthy
buffett
be
the
obvious
candidate
but
munger
told
him
he
would
be
crazy
to
take
the
job
a
warn
that
do
not
stick
when
warren
realize
the

he
volunteer
which
they
take
him

he
have
a
good
reputation
nick

enough
of
a

on
brady
backing
off
we
know
it
give
us
credibility
after
buffett
and
he
travel
to
washington
dc
to
testify
before
congress
about
the

munger
decide
to
go
home
and
thereafter
serve
as
a
long
distance
advisor
except
when
he
need
to
be
present
as
a
salomon
board
member
charlie
thought
i
be
do
what
i
could
say
buffett
it
be
sort
of
out
of
our
hand
we
sort
of
behave
and
hop
they
would
not
kill
us
even
after
he
return
to
california
munger
stayed
connect
say
denham
afterward
we
talk
about
issue
and
strategy
charlie
be
a
very
involve
director
he
have
real
idea
about
the
best
way
to
approach
thing
serve
on
the
salomon
board
be
an
intense
experience
but
the
fact
that
munger
be
in
his
late
s
do
not
seem
to
matter
explain
lou
simpson
who
also
be
a
director
health
and
age
do
not
slow
charlie
down
at
all
observe
simpson
he
get
off
the
plane
from
los
angeles
and
come
directly
to
salomon
meeting
and
be
sharp
as
a
tack
the
salomon
meeting
be
an
afternoon
meeting
then
another
meeting
the
next
morning
then
the
next
day
charlie
be
on
his
way
home
a
lot
of
the
time
we
would
all
stay
at
the
millennium
on
the
west
side
we
would
have
a
board
dinner
and
walk
back
recall
simpson
occasionally
nancy
munger
would
come
along
and
she
and
charlie
visit
their
son
barry
a
freelance
photographer
who
live
in
manhattan
tribeca
neighborhood
when
nancy
make
the
trip
the
mungers
stayed
at
the
carlyle
on
the
upper
east
side
there
be
not
a
lot
of
socialize
at
salomon
say
simpson
it
be
pretty
businesslike
there
be
lot
of
problem
and
consideration
we
have
to
deal
with
a
dramatic
time
in
everyone
life
i
be
sure
that
warren
and
charlie
get
a
lot
more
than
they
bargain
for
simpson
serve
on
salomon
board
for
five
year
four
of
them
as
chairman
of
the
audit
committee
where
munger
serve
as
a
committee
member
he
be
a
very
active
question
member
say
simpson
the
audit
committee
at
salomon
be
pro
active
a
probe
group
of
people
we
have
three
hour
meeting
at
least
charlie
to
a
lot
of
people
in
management
be
a
pain
in
the
rear
he
seize
on
tough
issue
and
come
hack
to
them
there
be
a
lot
of
issue
that
be
difficult
accounting
management
derivative
risk
involve
you
want
in
a
group
of
people
someone
who
point
out
that
the
emperor
have
no
clothes
management
will
present
the
positive
side
it
be
harder
to
get
people
who
will
point
out
the
pitfall
risk
and
so
on
i
suspect
people
thought
charlie
be
a
crank
thing
would
be
go
well
then
he
would
say
hut
you
have
get
this
issue
of
off
the
balancesheet
item
and
commission
to
understand
the
operation
of
a
business
be
exhaust
very
intense
i
remember
many
many
flight
between
here
and
los
angeles
five
to
six
hour
flight
he
spent

credit
for

of
customer
who
have
not
authorize
the

thus
allow

allow

they

though
many
at

difficult
ongoing

remain
not

of
which

buffett
point
out
that
people
in
the

have
each

more
in

the

overall
result
be
below
average
that
year
employee
produce
mediocre
return
for

should
expect

this
shortfall
buffett
write
in
the
company
quarterly
report
z
when
buffett
take
the

at

however
munger
become
even
more
tolerant
of
his
use
of
a

the
indefensible
munger
say
that
if
any

he
do
not
intend
to

there
be
rumor
that
a

when
he
step
aside
in

caught
the

off

when

it
would
be
a
very
long

purchase
an

city
it

not

academician
in

rebuild

satisfaction
the
problem
at

prove
more
difficult
and
it

a
closer

a
closer
call
than
i
thought
go
in
say
denham
it
become
clear
to
me
that
this
be
hard
enough
work
away
from

and
it
could
have
a
have
end
not

enhance

after

resolve
it

clear
the

into
the
persona
he
occasionally
display
at
the
berkshire
hathaway
annual
meeting
and
share
every
year
at
the
wesco

gathering
charlie
begin
to
wax
philosophical
about
his
life
his
work
and
his
fascination
with
newspaper
and
the
news
business
the
plaintiff
attorney
thomas
girardi
object
ask
the
judge
and
what
would
the
court
think
about
ask
mr
munger
if
he
could
reply
directly
to
mr
olson
question
this
be
beyond
the
pale
girardi
insist
that
he
would
practice
law
long
enough
to
know
what
be
go
on
this
obviously
be
an
orchestrate
attempt
munger
have
his
chair
turn
toward
the
jury
try
to
he
cute
i
lose

strictly
to
the

at
hand
i
will

enough
of

a
real
smart
guy
i
know

ron
know
it
the
court
know
it
and
i
think
it
be
totally
inappropriate
the
way
he
be
behaving
and
it
be
force
me
as
a
lawyer
to
have
to
jump
up
every
time
that
he
go
on
his
diatribe
he
be
yet
to
answer
one
question
directly
out
of
the
question
that
have
be
ask
so
far
the
judge
seem
perplexed
at
what
to
do
since
it
be
become
clear
that
charlie
way
be
charlie
way
and
he
might
not
have
any
other
method
of
answer
question
finally
the
judge
simply
ask
that
mr
munger
avoid
hearsay
and
the
trial
continued

half
hour
later

that

break
in
the
proceeding

doubt
worried
that
munger
plight
would
make
the
jury
more
sympathetic
to
his
newspaper

guerin
say
he
and
munger
be
in
the

a
combination
of
both
we
be
lucky
enough

on
the

first
floor
where
the

have
gather
suddenly
the
door
burst
open
and
munger
strode
in
and
seat
himself
at
the
head
of
the
table
charlie
come
in
and
i
do
not
think
he
really
look
up
to
see
me
recall
leeka
he
say
well
this
hospital
have
a
lot
of
problem
and
they
be
thus
thus
and
thus
he
go
on
for
to
minute
finally
he
ask
me
a
question
but
do
not
give
me
a
chance
to
answer
a
few
minute
later
munger
stood
up
and
leeka
stood
as
well
extend
his
hand
to
shake
munger
simply
ignore
him
turn
and
strode
out
the
door
through
which
he
would
enter
i
say
to
the
other
board
member
i
do
not
think
he
like
me
the
member
in
unison
reply
no
no
he
love
you
then
why
do
not
he
shake

explain
one
of
the
board

he
be
blind
in
that
eye
despite
that
explanation
leeka
felt
sure
he
be
out
of
the
run
and
remain
doubtful
about
want
the
job
anyway
it
would
seem
that
leeka
and
munger
have
little
in
common
leeka
could
hardly
be
described
as
an
ivy

type
as
an
undergraduate
he
attend
a
school
near
his
home

on
the
smoggy
eastern
edge
of

basin
leeka
then
earn
an

own
a
showquality
harley

and
hold
a
black
belt
in
karate
the
only
apparent
connection
between
the
two
men
be
that
leeka
also
be
born
in
the
midwest
and

soon
afterward

again
who
get
right
to
the
point
he
want
to
hire
leeka
this
would
be
the
deal
the
salary
and
so
forth
the
offer
be
generous
what
be
leeka
answer
i
say
usually
something
of
this
magnitude
i
like
to
discus
with
my
wife
leeka
recall
munger
say
nothing
he
simply
star
at
leeka
after
an
awkward
silence
leeka
relent
in
this
situation
i
do
not
think
i
need
to
good
say
charlie
that
be
why
i
be
hire
you
despite
munger
idiosyncratic
behavior
leeka
knew
right
away
that
he
like
munger
and
felt
that
he
could
learn
a
lot
from
him
health
care
be
such
a
tough
business
say
leeka
you
just
have
to
believe
in
it
i
fell
in
love
with
the
hospital
itself
i
felt
i
belong
here
it
do
not
take
long
for
them
to
agree
that
munger
would
hold
executive
committee
meeting
less
than
once
a
month
after
which
munger
walk
out
and
left
leeka
to
do
his
job

manage
any
more
than
he
have
to

though
he
never
hesitates
to
call
employee

various
enterprise
and
share
idea
as
they
occur
to
him

friend
dick
seaver
i
have
enough
sense
to
know
it
would
be
like
tar
baby
once
you
get
in
you
would
become
stuck
say
munger
but
it
be
charlie
philosophy
that
a
first
rate
man
should
be
willing
to
take
at
least
some
difficult
job
with
a
high
chance
of
failure
and
just
as
he
decries

nancy

his

enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
california
diocese
to
assume
control
of
the

then
know
as
the
los

home
for
invalid
from
early
on
good

have
train

and
intern
study
at
the
university
of
southern
california
usc
soon
after
he
join
the
board
munger
come
to
believe
that
the
facility
be
mismanage
because
the
board
always
back
decision
of
the
medical
staff
and
these
decision
frequently
protect
the
economic
interest
of
certain
doctor
rather
than
that
of
the
patient
or
of
quality
medicine
the
exist
chairman
do
not
agree
with
me
i
propose
a
resolution
reverse
a
ruling
of
the
organize
medical
staff
on
the
ground
that
the
staff
be
endanger
the
health
and
safety
of
our
patient
with
some
doctor
on
the
board
voting
yes
it
pass
to
say
munger
after
the
board
vote
the
chairman
resign
he
be
an
able
man
say
munger
and
understandably
be
reluctant
as
a
layman
to
reverse
what
purport
to
be
medical
decision
because
charlie
have
start
the
trouble
by
push
for
reform
he
felt
obligate
to
accept
the
job
of
chairman
the
problem
that
set
the
whole
episode
off
occur
in
the
cardiovascular
department
which
then
be
rife
with
political
intrigue
turf
protection
and
not
enough
attention
to
medical
issue
before
he
take
his
contrarian
position
on
the
medical
procedure
that
would
be
follow
munger
study
with
the
help
of
a
physician
friend
the
mortality
and
morbidity
rate
for
different
system
of
surgical
care
it
seem
clear
to
him
that
the
medical
staff
have
make
wrong
decision
choice
munger
felt
be
motivate
by
old
guard
physician
against
the
more
progressive
staffer
hospital
be
not
unlike
university
in
the
sense
that
you
have
these
tremendous
struggle
for
ownership
possession
and
control
explain
hal
borthwick
whose
wife
now
serf
on
good
sam
board
basically
good
samaritan
have
kind
of
a
community
practice
for
a
number
of
year
with
a
number
of
people
that
i
be
not
say
they
be
without
ability
but
there
be
no
particular
reason
to
go
to
good
samaritan
other
than
your
doctor
practice
there
charlie
recognize
that
for
the
hospital
to
survive
it
have
to
have
virtue
of
critical
mass
and
of
excellence
as
munger
press
toward
those
goal
say
borthwick
there
be
bad
feeling
and
damage
relationship
the
breakage
be
not
unlike
the
breakage
that
you
get
in
a
takeover
of
a
company
and
you
do
thing
differently
from
the
previous
management
a
lot
of
people
train
in
their
old
way
ca
not
adjust
and
they
have
to
leave
after
a
long
bitter
battle
with
other
board
member
and
some
staff
doctor
munger
and
his
supporter
prevail
ten
year
later
i
hate
have
have
to
go
through
the
heartache
and
tragedy
but
i
love
many
of
the
people
i
now
work
with
say
munger
munger
personally
have
recruit
many
physician
to
the
hospital
staff
which
be
unconventional
for
a
lay
chairperson
of
a
large
nonprofit
hospital
charlie
be
intrigue
by
the
technology
of
medicine
and
get
a
big
kick
out
of
work
with
the
doctor
by
the
time
leeka
take
charge
of
the
medical
center
good
relation
exist
between
the
staff
and
the
board
but
the
business
side
be
still
a
mess
the
hospital
have
such
a
large
backlog
of
uncollected
bill
that
in
the
first
year
of
his
administration
good
sam
take
a
stagger
million
bad
debt
write
off
but
from
then
on
thing
get
well
leeka
have
become
accustom
to
munger
personality
and
they
clearly
be
on
the

team
i
see
people
who
just
do
not

to
see
how
he
can
make
it
work
leeka
say
that
munger
insists
on
run
the
hospital
with
one
purpose
in
mind
serve
the
community
in
the
best
way
possible
there
be
trick
a
hospital
can
do
to
squeeze
extra
revenue
from
low
income
and
medi
cal
billing
but
munger
wo
not

it
be
decide
there
be
no

munger
would
not
file
a
fema
claim
he
wo
not
do
anything
just
for
money
say
leeka
he
will
go
into
a
business
health
care
special
service
even
if
he
know
it
will
lose
money
if
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do

perhaps
the
most
gratify
sign
of
the

turn
around
be
when
it

one
of

in

tactic
nevertheless
good

munger
say
that
there
be
always
a

even
with
the
best
laid

success
be
not

i
have
a

hospital
but
it
be
a
very
tough
hand
to
play
say
hal
borthwick
and
if
you
ask
charlie
why
he
do
it
one
of
the
thing
he
will
say
be
that
he
do
not
want
all
the
hand
that
he
play
in

to
be
easy

the
problem
with
many
of

munger
argues
to
his
unconvinced
offspring
be
that
they
specialize

early
and
never

and
fund
a

so
that

charlie
have
serve
as

he

for
part
of
the
time
be

he
be
so
fond
of
the

that
he
hope
some
day
his
memorial
service
will
be
held
in
the
chapel
there
at
the

munger
have
be
able
to
blend
his
dedication
to
quality
education
and
his
admiration
of
science
and
architecture
he
and
nancy
donate
more
than
million
to
build
the
munger
science
building
and
charlie
himself
be
involve
in
almost
every
aspect
of
the
building
design
before
harvard
school
and
westlake
merge
munger
believe
the
science
laboratory
be
too
limited
after
the
merger
there
be
twice
as
many
student
study
science
in
the
upper
grade
munger
declare
that
it
would
have
be
educational
malpractice
not
to
have
expand
the
science
facility
the
problem
with
most
building
be
that
they
do
not
build
enough
flexibility
into
them
we
try
to
assure
that
the
science
facility
will
work
and
work
well
for
the
well
part
of
a
century
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
become
obsolete
munger
say
at
the
dedication
ceremony
the
state
of
the
art
building
be
nestle
on
a
hillside
overlook
coldwater
canyon
it
include
a
dozen
customize
laboratory
classroom
a
conference
room
a
computer
center
and
a
theater
style
lecture
hall
with
each
of
the
seat
wire
to
accommodate
laptop
computer
some
of
the
feature
of
the
building
might
not
be
obvious
to
a
casual
observer
bench
in
the
biology
chemistry
and
physic
lab
for
example
be
different
to
accommodate
the
different
kind
of
lab
work
while
munger
left
many
of
the
decision
on
the
building
to
the
teacher
he
insist
on
top
of
the
line
ventilation
and
heating
system
and
that
the
building
far
exceed
current
earthquake
standard
charlie
spends
hour
review
the
architectural
plan
for
building
at
the
school
on
one
occasion
munger
ask
an
architect
to
make
a
change
in
the
school
auditorium
to
put
a
slope
in
the
floor
but
the
architect
say
that
it
could
not
be
do
munger
push
until
the
architect
found
a
way
oddly
the
architect
do
not
seem
to
be
offend
by
munger
persistence
no
he
do
not
offend
people
say
otis
booth
who
also
serf
on
the
harvard
westlake
board
he
have
a
great
ability
to
turn
a
phrase
and
make
thing
amuse
although
most
of
munger
time
and
money
have
go
to
support
the
exclusive
private
school
his
child
attend
he
be
sympathetic
to
the
plight
of
public
school
i
be
a
product
of
the
omaha
public
school
and
in
my
day
the
people
who
go
to
private
school
be
those
who
could
not
quite
hack
it
in
public
school
and
that
be
still
the
situation
in
germany
today
the
private
school
be
for
people
who
be
not
up
to
the
public
school
i
prefer
a
system
like
that
however
once
a
big
segment
of
that
system
measurably
fails
then
i
think
we
have
to
do
something
different
you
do
not
just
keep
repeat
what
be
not
work
munger
say
he
would
favor
the
school
voucher
concept
if
the
voucher
be
give
only
to
poor
people
the
well
off
people
do
not
need
them
since
they
already
can
afford
choice
and
be
exercise
it
it
would
not
bother
me
at
all
if
voucher
be
only
for
people
otherwise
destine
for
fail
school
but
i
think
we
have
to
do
something
in
our
most
troubled
school
to
change
our
technique
i
think
it
be
insane
to
keep
go
the
way
we
be
charlie
conservative
even
puritanical
view
emerge
when
he
contemplates
the
state
of
high
education
today
he
be
especially
offend
by
the
victim
mentality
that
he
say
be
foster
in
u
s
college
you
could
argue
that
the
very
bad
of
all
academic
inanity
be
in
the
liberal
art
department
of
the
great
university
you
can
see
the
reason
if
you
ask
the
question
what
one
frame
of
mind
be
likely
to
cause
the
most
damage
to
an
individual
happiness
his
contribution
to
others
and
the
like
what
one
frame
of
mind
will
be
the
bad
the
answer
of
course
would
be
some
sort
of
paranoid
self
pity
i
ca
not
imagine
a
more
destructive
frame
of
mind
yet
whole
university
department
want
everyone
to
feel
like
a
victim
and
you
pay
money
to
send
your
child
to
these
place
and
this
be
what
they
teach
them
say
munger
it
be
amaze
how
these
pocket
of
irrationality
creep
into
eminent
place
then
munger
add
a
little
midwestern
zen
what
he
call
the
iron
prescription
every
time
you
think
some
person
or
some
unfairness
be
ruin
your
life
it
be
you
who
be
ruin
your
life
as
he
do
that
august
morning
at
ca
lake
munger
often
mus
over
way
to
improve
undergraduate
education
his
view
be
largely
derive
from
review
his
own
education
and
from
watch
his
own
eight
child
and
now
his
grandchild
attend
a
variety
of
school
our
education
be
far
too
uni
disciplinary
claimed
munger
many
problem
by
nature
cross
many
academic
discipline
accordingly
use
a
uni
disciplinary
attack
on
such
problem
be
like
play
a
bridge
hand
by
counting
trump
and
ignore
all
else
this
be
bonkers
sort
of
like
the
mad
hatter
tea
party
but
nonetheless
too
much
of
that
think
remains
in
professional
practice
and
even
bad
have
long
be
encourage
in
isolated
department
of
soft
science
which
i
define
as
everything
less
fundamental
than
biology
munger
be
not
impressed
by
the
notion
that
the
scope
of
knowledge
have
become
so
massive
that
few
people
can
become
truly
multidisciplinary
and
still
have
enough
time
in
life
for
a
career
you
do
not
have
to
know
everything
insists
munger
a
few
really
big
idea
carry
most
of
the
freight
certainly
munger
concept
of
the
big
idea
do
not
coincide
with
those
of
many
academic
he
say
for
example
that
mastery
of
both
psychology
and
accounting
should
be
require
of
lawyer
rather
than
taught
as
mere
elective
course
munger
claim
that
most
people
would
be
well
off
if
they
be
train
for
their
profession
the
way
pilot
be
taught
to
fly
they
learn
everything
that
be
useful
in
pilot
and
then
must
retrain
continuously
so
that
they
can
cope
promptly
with
practically
any
eventuality
he
explain
like
any
good
algebraist
say
munger
the
pilot
be
make
to
think
sometimes
in
a
forward
fashion
and
sometimes
in
reverse
and
so
he
learns
when
to
concentrate
mostly
on
what
he
want
to
happen
and
also
when
to
concentrate
mostly
on
avoid
what
he
do
not
want
to
happen
munger
say
his
own
life
be
an
example
of
that
process
when
he
go
to
harvard
law
school
i
have
take
one
silly
course
in
biology
in
high
school
briefly
learn
mostly
by
rote
an
obviously
incomplete
theory
of
evolution
portion
of
the
anatomy
of
the
paramecium
and
frog
plus
a
ridiculous
concept
of
protoplasm
that
have
since
disappear
to
this
day
i
have
never
take
any
course
anywhere
in
chemistry
economics
psychology
or
business
but
i
early
take
elementary
physic
and
math
and
paid
enough
attention
to
somehow
assimilate
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
of
hard
science
which
i
thereafter
push
far
and
far
into
softer
and
softer
subject
use
it
as
my
organize
guide
and
filing
system
in
a
search
for
whatever
multidisciplinary
worldly
wisdom
it
would
be
easy
to
get
thus
his
life
become
a
sort
of
accidental
educational
experiment
continued
munger
what
i
found
in
my
extend
attempt
to
complete
by
informal
mean
my
stunt
education
be
that
plug
along
with
only
ordinary
will
but
with
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
of
science
as
my
guide
my
ability
to
serve
anything
i
love
be
enhance
far
beyond
my
desert
large
gain
come
in
place
that
seem
unlikely
when
i
start
out
sometimes
make
me
like
the
only
one
without
a
blindfold
in
a
high
stake
game
of
pin
the
donkey
for
instance
i
be
productively
lead
into
psychology
where
i
have
no
plan
to
go
create
large
advantage
i
have
try
to
imitate
in
a
poor
way
the
life
of
benjamin
franklin
munger
say
when
he
be
franklin
quit
business
to
focus
more
on
be
a
writer
statesman
philanthropist
inventor
and
scientist
that
be
why
i
have
divert
my
interest
away
from
business
one
of
the
important
lesson
from
munger
life
say
his
daughter
emilie
be
do
not
just
take
for
your
own
family
and
hoard
it
he
give
a
lot
to
institution
especially
educational
institution
he
care
about
it
not
just
give
money
but
time
and
intelligence
to
solve
problem
easy
for
a
daughter
to
say
about
her
father
but
munger
friend
otis
booth
who
also
be
from
a
generation
not
use
to
the
frivolous
expression
of
emotion
see
through
the
crusty
outer
layer
that
shroud
munger
personality
it
be
not
readily
apparent
but
he
have
an
immense
high
level
of
compassion
and
understand
it
be
way
back
inside
of
him
it
be
publicly
manifest
in
his
charitable
work
he
do
not
wear
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
but
he
nonetheless
have
a
large
heart

the
value
that
guide
his
personal
life
guide
his
public
life
you
live
life
simply
you
live
it
in
the
middle
of
the
field
and
you
do
not
cut
corner
ronald
olson
narlie
munger
often
quote
the
late
nobel
laureate
physicist
richard
feynman
who
say
the
first
rule
be
to
not
fool
yourself
and
you
be
the
easy
person
to
fool
munger
can
be
merciless
if
he
believe
he
have
caught
someone
in
an
act
of
silly
self
deception
pity
the
poor
professor
who
get
caught
up
in
a
debate
with
munger
on
the
academic
treatment
of
investment
policy
such
be
the
case
at
the
benjamin
cardozo
school
of
law
in
new
york
city
in
when
due
to
the
death
of
a
close
friend
the
schedule
moderator
be
unable
to
attend
charlie
munger
be
ask
to
step
in
charlie
told
the
audience
the
accident
of
mortality
have
give
you
a
baptist
bumpkin
suddenly
put
in
charge
of
a
bunch
of
catholic
archbishop
who
be
go
to
debate
revision
of
the
catholic
mass
in
latin
but
i
figure
i
could
moderate
such
a
convention
it
be
the
panel
assignment
to
discus
the
research
of
professor
william
bratton
of
the
rutgers
newark
school
of
law
which
dealt
with
the
corporate
decision
to
pay
dividend
to
shareholder
rather
than
reinvest
profit
munger
soon
nail
bratton
with
what
he
consider
a
flaw
assumption
in
the
research
munger
i
take
it
that
you
believe
that
there
be
no
one
size
fit
all
dividend
policy
and
that
you
be
with
the
professor
jill
e
fisch
of
fordham
university
school
of
law
who
say
yesterday
that
there
be
not
any
one
size
fit
all
scheme
for
corporate
governance
bratton
on
that
simple
proposition
i
be
entirely
in
concord
with
professor
fisch
munger
but
you
say
there
be
some
vaguely
establish
view
in
economics
as
to
what
be
an
optimal
dividend
policy
or
an
optimal
investment
bratton
i
think
we
all
know
what
an
optimal
investment
be
munger
no
i
do
not
at
least
not
as
these
people
use
the
term
bratton
i
do
not
know
it
when
i
see
it
but
in
theory
if
i
knew
it
when
i
saw
it
this
conference
would
be
about
me
and
not
about
warren
buffett
i
laughter
from
the
audience
munger
what
be
the
break
point
where
a
business
becomes
suboptimal
in
an
ordinary
corporation
or
when
an
investment
becomes
suboptimal
bratton
when
the
return
on
the
investment
be
low
than
the
cost
of
capital
munger
and
what
be
the
cost
of
capital
bratton
well
that
be
a
nice
one
laughter
and
i
would
munger
well
it
be
only
fair
if
you
be
go
to
use
the
cost
of
capital
to
say
what
it
be
bratton
i
would
be
interested
in
know
we
be
talk
theoretically
munger
no
i
want
to
know
what
the
cost
of
capital
be
in
the
model
bratton
in
the
model
it
will
just
be
state
munger
where
out
of
the
forehead
of
job
or
something
bratton
that
be
correct
i
laughter
munger
well
some
of
us
do
not
find
this
too
satisfactory
i
laughter
bratton
i
say
you
would
be
a
fool
to
use
it
as
a
template
for
real
world
investment
decision
make
laughter
they
be
only
try
t
i
ice
a
particular
perspective
on
human
behavior
to
try
to
explain
thing
munger
but
if
you
explain
thing
in
term
of
unexplainable
subconcepts
what
kind
of
an
explanation
be
that
laughter
bratton
it
be
a
social
science
explanation
you
take
for
what
its
worth
munger
do
you
consider
it
understandable
for
some
petuplc
to
regard
this
as
gibberish
laughter
bratton
perfectly
understandable
although
i
do
my
best
to
teach
it
laughter
munger
why
why
do
you
do
this
laughter
bratton
it
be
in
my
job
description
laughter
munger
because
other
people
be
teach
it
be
what
you
be
tell
me
laughter
the
audience
laughter
point
be
essential
in
this
exchange
l
it
sound
like
a
food
fight
at
a
junior
high
school
cafeteria
the
bantering
be
do
in
a
good
natured
tone
but
the
point
of
the
exchange
be
quite
serious
later
to
make
sure
his
comment
be
not
misunderstood
munger
make
amends
i
do
not
want
my
remark
about
the
cost
of
capital
to
be
interpret
as
meaning
that
i
think
the
great
bulk
of
professor
bratton
paper
be
wrong
i
think
it
be
profoundly
right
when
he
talk
about
agency
cost
in
corporation
and
the
discipline
cause
by
level
of
debt
and
the
discipline
cause
by
dividend
convention
i
think
he
be
profoundly
right
and
to
the
extent
that
those
be
the
conventional
academic
explanation
i
think
it
be
wisdom
he
be
give
it
be
just
the
cost
of
capital
thing
that
always
make
me
go
into
orbit
laughter
although
he
do
not
say
so
then
munger
have
his
own
idea
of
how
the
cost
of
investment
capital
should
be
measure
buffett
have
explain
that
at
berkshire
the
cost
of
capital
be
measure
by
the
company
ability
to
create
more
than
of
value
for
every
of
earnings
retain
if
we
be
keep
bill
that
would
be
worth
more
in
your
hand
than
in
ours
then
we
have
fail
to
exceed
our
cost
of
capital
buffett
say
a
student
once
ask
charlie
munger
if
he
and
buffett
be
fulfil
their
responsibility
to
share
his
wisdom
sure
look
at
berkshire
hathaway
i
call
it
the
ultimate
didactic
exercise
warren
never
go
to
spend
any
money
he
be
go
to
give
it
back
to
society
he
be
just
building
a
platform
so
people
will
listen
to
his
notion
needle
to
say
they
be
very
good
notion
and
the
platform
not
so
have
either
but
you
could
argue
that
warren
and
i
be
academic
in
our
own
way
both
charlie
and
warren
be
at
a
phase
in
their
life
when
they
can
choose
their
activity
concentrate
only
on
those
thing
that
seem
to
have
meaning
and
that
interest
them
munger
have
do
some
public
speak
to
law
class
at
stanford
and
the
university
of
southern
california
and
to
organization
when
ask
by
special
friend
he
like
warren
prefers
to
talk
to
young
people
to
student
who
be
still
learn
about
life
and
who
have
time
to
implement
some
of
the
concept
that
the
two
of
them
consider
important
charlie
speech
be
always
informally
present
but
as
be
sometimes
the
case
with
ben
graham
his
idea
occasionally
go
over
the
head
of
the
listener
his
method
be
to
present
major
theme
such
as
advise
listener
to
identify
the
few
big
idea
that
make
a
difference
and
try
to
live
by
them
although
he
talk
about
what
those
idea
might
be
he
do
not
offer
a
succinct
formula
or
a
simple
list
of
direction
leave
his
listener
with
the
sense
of
insufficient
guideline
but
occasionally
he
will
cut
right
to
the
hone
and
lay
out
a
perfect
nugget
of
personal
or
financial
wisdom
some
of
his
lesson
be
quite
practical
and
apply
to
life
in
general
and
to
financial
matter
in
particular
to
those
whom
much
be
give
much
be
expect
always
live
below
your
financial
mean
so
that
you
will
have
money
to
invest
invest
in
such
a
way
so
as
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
fall
into
a
negative
position
primarily
by
limit
the
amount
of
debt
you
use
if
you
want
to
get
smart
munger
say
the
question
you
have
to
keep
ask
be
why
why
why
and
you
have
to
relate
the
answer
to
a
structure
of
deep
theory
you
have
get
to
know
the
main
theory
and
it
be
mildly
laborious
but
its
also
a
lot
of
fun
from
physicist
munger
have
learn
to
solve
a
problem
by
seek
the
simplest
most
direct
answer
the
easy
way
invariably
be
the
best
way
from
mathematician
munger
learn
to
turn
problem
upside
down
or
to
look
at
them
backward
invert
always
invert
munger
use
this
method
inversion
to
capture
the
attention
of
his
young
son
philip
graduate
class
when
he
give
the
commencement
address
at
harvard
school
in
munger
told
the
student
that
his
prescription
for
life
be
base
on
a
johnny
carson
speech
explain
the
thing
a
person
should
do
to
ensure
a
miserable
life
these
include
ingest
chemical
in
an
effort
to
alter
mood
or
perception
and
allow
oneself
to
indulge
in
envy
and
to
wallow
in
resentment
he
cite
the
example
of
a
youthful
acquaintance
who
become
an
alcoholic
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
fight
off
all
sort
of
demon
all
or
any
of
carson
three
behavior
will
guarantee
an
unhappy
existence
then
munger
add
four
practice
that
he
believe
also
will
help
guarantee
failure
be
unreliable
learn
everything
from
your
own
experience
rather
than
learn
from
others
give
up
try
after
your
first
second
or
third
reverse
of
fortune
and
finally
give
in
to
fuzzy
think
ignore
a
story
they
told
me
when
i
be
very
young
about
a
rustic
who
say
i
wish
i
knew
where
i
be
go
to
die
and
then
i
would
never
go
there
berkshire
hathaway
and
wesco
investor
listen
carefully
to
maxim
about
life
but
they
literally
crowd
the
doorway
to
hear
munger
and
buffett
talk
about
investment
issue
a
frequently
ask
question
be
how
do
you
learn
to
be
a
great
investor
first
of
all
you
have
to
understand
your
own
nature
say
munger
each
person
have
to
play
the
game
give
his
own
marginal
utility
consideration
and
in
a
way
that
take
into
account
his
own
psychology
if
loss
be
go
to
make
you
miserable
and
some
loss
be
inevitable
you
might
be
wise
to
utilize
a
very
conservative
pattern
of
investment
and
save
all
your
life
so
you
have
to
adapt
your
strategy
to
your
own
nature
and
your
own
talent
i
do
not
think
there
be
a
one
size
fit
all
investment
strategy
that
i
can
give
you
then
say
munger
you
have
to
gather
information
i
think
both
warren
and
i
learn
more
from
the
great
business
magazine
than
we
do
anywhere
else
say
charlie
it
be
such
an
easy
shorthand
way
of
get
a
vast
variety
of
business
experience
just
to
riffle
through
issue
after
issue
cover
a
great
variety
of
business
and
if
you
get
into
the
mental
habit
of
relate
what
you
be
reading
to
the
basic
structure
of
the
underlie
idea
be
demonstrate
you
gradually
accumulate
some
wisdom
about
invest
i
do
not
think
you
can
get
to
be
a
really
good
investor
over
a
broad
range
without
do
a
massive
amount
of
reading
i
do
not
think
any
one
book
will
do
it
for
you
each
year
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
munger
recommends
a
wide
range
of
reading
material
these
include
value
line
chart
robert
b
cialdini
book
influence
on
how
people
be
persuade
to
buy
product
and
take
other
action
and
recently
robert
hagstrom
book
the
warren
buffett
portfolio
master
the
power
of
the
focus
investment
strategy
munger
explain
that
a
person
reading
should
not
be
random
you
have
to
have
some
idea
of
why
you
be
look
for
the
information
do
not
read
annual
report
the
way
francis
bacon
say
you
do
sciencewhich
by
the
way
be
not
the
way
you
do
science
where
you
just
collect
endless
data
and
then
only
later
do
you
try
to
make
sense
of
it
you
have
to
start
with
some
idea
about
reality
and
then
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
what
you
be
see
fit
in
with
proven
basic
concept
frequently
you
will
look
at
a
business
have
fabulous
result
and
the
question
be
how
long
can
this
continue
well
there
be
only
one
way
i
know
to
answer
that
and
that
be
to
think
about
why
the
result
be
occur
now
and
then
to
figure
out
the
force
that
could
cause
those
result
to
stop
occur
this
be
the
method
of
think
that
help
munger
and
buffett
spot
a
company
that
have
a
franchise
on
a
certain
product
a
so
call
moat
around
its
business
there
be
several
example
of
company
that
have
such
a
strong
name
brand
that
they
seem
invincible
coca
cola
have
be
such
a
company
though
the
challenge
be
relentless
munger
also
us
the
example
of
wrigley
chew
gum
it
be
such
a
huge
advantage
to
be
by
far
the
best
know
gum
company
in
the
world
just
think
of
how
hard
it
would
be
to
replace
that
image
if
you
know
you
like
wrigley
gum
and
you
see
it
there
for
two
bit
be
you
really
go
to
reach
for
glotz
gum
because
it
be
cent
and
put
something
you
do
not
know
in
your
mouth
it
be
not
worth
it
for
you
to
think
about
buying
an
alternative
gum
so
it
be
easy
to
understand
why
wrigley
gum
have
such
a
huge
advantage
once
you
grasp
the
value
of
a
company
then
you
have
to
decide
how
much
the
company
be
worth
if
you
be
buying
it
outright
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
typical
investor
simply
buying
a
portion
of
the
company
on
the
stock
market
the
trouble
with
the
wrigley
gum
type
investment
be
that
everybody
can
see
that
they
be
wonderful
business
so
you
look
at
it
and
you
think
my
god
the
thing
at
eight
time
book
value
or
something
and
everything
else
be
at
three
time
book
value
so
you
think
i
know
it
be
wonderful
but
be
it
wonderful
enough
to
justify
that
big
a
premium
the
ability
to
answer
such
question
explains
why
some
people
be
successful
investor
and
others
be
not
on
the
other
hand
if
it
be
not
a
little
difficult
everybody
would
be
rich
munger
insist
observe
business
over
time
give
an
investor
great
perspective
on
this
type
of
think
munger
say
he
remembers
when
the
downtown
department
store
in
many
city
seem
invincible
they
offer
enormous
selection
have
large
purchasing
power
and
own
the
high
price
real
estate
in
town
the
corner
where
the
streetcar
line
cross
however
as
time
pass
private
car
become
the
prevalent
mode
of
transportation
the
streetcar
line
be
take
out
customer
move
to
the
suburb
and
shopping
center
become
the
dominant
shopping
venue
some
simple
change
in
the
way
we
live
can
completely
alter
the
long
term
value
of
a
business
munger
be
passionately
oppose
to
certain
economic
theory
and
business
practice
and
enjoys
the
freedom
his
status
and
wealth
give
him
to
express
those
opinion
for
example
he
be
perpetually
miffed
at
investor
and
academic
who
promote
the
harsh
form
of
the
efficient
market
theory
of
invest
if
you
think
psychology
be
badly
taught
in
america
you
should
look
at
corporate
finance
modern
portfolio
theory
it
be
demented
munger
proclaim
the
concept
be
taught
in
mainstream
business
school
and
take
the
position
that
all
information
on
publicly
trade
company
be
spread
rapidly
throughout
the
invest
universe
dispel
any
advantage
one
investor
have
over
another
nobody
can
really
beat
the
market
because
adjustment
to
news
be
work
into
the
price
of
a
security
so
quickly
munger
recall
one
efficient
market
theorist
who
over
the
year
make
a
career
of
explain
how
buffett
success
be
merely
the
result
of
good
luck
as
buffett
performance
held
steady
and
even
improve
it
become
more
difficult
to
explain
buffett
as
a
mere
anomaly
this
theorist
finally
get
all
the
way
up
to
six
sigma
six
standard
deviation
of
luck
but
then
people
start
laugh
at
him
because
six
sigma
of
luck
be
a
lot
so
what
do
he
do
he
change
his
theory
now
he
explains
warren
have
six
or
seven
sigma
of
skill
refute
the
claim
of
financial
writer
michael
lewis
who
also
seem
to
portray
buffett
as
a
greedy
manipulator
whose
success
be
mainly
the
result
of
happenstance
munger
say
he
be
get
the
idea
that
warren
success
for
year
be
because
he
flip
coin
for
year
and
it
have
come
up
head
time
all
i
can
say
be
if
he
believe
that
i
have
get
a
bridge
i
would
like
to
sell
him
there
be
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
berkshire
attain
its
high
level
of
performance
in
a
large
part
because
of
the
commonsense
notion
share
between
munger
and
buffett
for
example
they
ignore
the
popular
financial
indicator
call
beta
which
measure
a
stock
volatility
in
relation
to
the
overall
market
a
company
with
a
beta
that
be
high
than
the
market
average
be
consider
by
many
professional
investor
to
be
a
high
risk
proposition
this
great
emphasis
on
volatility
in
corporate
finance
we
regard
as
nonsense
say
munger
let
me
put
it
this
way
as
long
as
the
odds
be
in
our
favor
and
we
be
not
risk
the
whole
company
on
one
throw
of
the
dice
or
anything
close
to
it
we
do
not
mind
volatility
in
result
what
we
want
be
the
favorable
odds
we
figure
the
volatility
over
time
will
take
care
of
itself
at
berkshire
both
munger
and
buffett
be
indignant
over
the
way
the
regulator
allow
stock
option
to
be
count
on
the
book
so
that
they
do
not
show
up
as
an
expense
to
the
company
they
mention
the
problem
at
nearly
every
annual
meeting
it
be
fundamentally
wrong
not
to
have
rational
honest
accounting
in
big
american
corporation
say
munger
and
it
be
very
important
not
to
let
little
corruption
start
because
they
become
big
corruption
and
then
you
have
vested
interest
that
fight
to
perpetuate
them
accounting
for
stock
option
in
america
be
corrupt
and
it
be
not
a
good
idea
to
have
corrupt
accounting
buffett
and
munger
agree
on
most
thing
but
they
have
a
different
opinion
about
who
should
be
the
decision
maker
when
an
unsolicited
tender
offer
be
make
to
a
corporation
buffett
say
his
heart
be
with
the
shareholder
but
munger
say
there
be
a
social
interest
in
some
case
make
it
okay
to
make
law
to
govern
such
transaction
i
totally
agree
that
for
the
ordinary
little
family
business
that
own
a
theater
the
shareholder
ought
to
decide
whether
the
theater
be
sell
but
once
you
get
into
great
big
social
institution
that
give
certain
circumstance
will
go
together
in
wave
of
acquisition
into
huge
agglomeration
that
bother
me
so
i
think
that
it
be
appropriate
to
have
law
that
prevent
it
say
munger
if
he
be
teach
finance
munger
say
he
would
use
the
history
of
or
so
company
that
do
something
right
or
something
wrong
finance
properly
taught
should
be
taught
from
case
where
the
investment
decision
be
easy
say
munger
and
the
one
that
i
always
cite
be
the
early
history
of
the
national
cash
register
company
it
be
create
by
a
very
intelligent
man
who
bought
all
the
patent
have
the
best
sale
force
and
the
best
production
plant
he
be
a
very
intelligent
man
and
a
fanatic
all
of
whose
passion
be
dedicate
to
the
cash
register
business
and
of
course
the
invention
of
the
cash
register
be
a
godsend
to
retailing
you
might
even
say
that
cash
register
be
the
pharmaceutical
industry
of
a
former
age
if
you
read
an
early
annual
report
when
patterson
be
the
ceo
of
national
cash
register
an
idiot
could
tell
that
here
be
a
talented
fanatic
very
favorably
locate
therefore
the
investment
decision
be
easy
john
henry
patterson
be
an
ohio
retailer
who
do
not
invent
the
cash
register
but
immediately
saw
its
benefit
and
purchase
the
moneylosing
company
in
his
zealousness
patterson
become
the
prototype
for
the
contemporary
business
innovator
he
virtually
invent
the
concept
of
employee
benefit
the
low
cost
company
cafeteria
for
one
sale
force
training
and
motivation
and
be
responsible
for
the
first
house
organ
the
factory
news
during
the
great
dayton
flood
of
patterson
halt
production
and
devote
the
company
to
save
the
city
he
give
food
shelter
supply
electrical
power
and
fresh
water
and
his
company
doctor
and
nurse
tend
the
injured
and
ill
factory
worker
built
boat
for
flood
out
resident
nevertheless
patterson
be
a
bulldog
competitor
and
once
lose
an
antitrust
suit
which
later
be
overturn
by
a
high
court
one
of
patterson
most
noteworthy
achievement
be
hire
t
j
watson
a
piano
salesman
who
work
at
ncr
for
year
after
patterson
fire
watson
he
go
to
work
at
computertabulating
record
company
which
watson
transform
into
ibm
use
many
of
the
business
skill
he
would
learn
at
ncr
patterson
left
a
great
business
when
he
die
but
he
would
spent
so
much
on
social
cause
that
his
estate
have
very
little
money
not
that
it
matter
to
him
patterson
be
fond
of
say
shroud
do
not
have
pocket
though
few
company
last
forever
all
of
them
should
be
built
to
last
a
long
time
say
munger
the
approach
to
corporate
control
should
be
thought
of
as
financial
engineering
just
as
bridge
and
airplane
be
construct
with
a
series
of
back
up
system
and
redundancy
to
meet
extreme
stress
so
too
should
corporation
be
built
to
withstand
the
pressure
from
competition
recession
oil
shock
or
other
calamity
excess
leverage
or
debt
make
the
corporation
especially
vulnerable
to
such
storm
it
be
a
crime
in
america
state
munger
to
build
a
weak
bridge
how
much
nobler
be
it
to
build
a
weak
company
american
be
oversold
on
the
benefit
they
receive
from
money
manager
and
particularly
from
mutual
fund
manager
and
that
bother
munger
enormously
it
be
to
me
just
amaze
what
happen
in
the
mutual
fund
business
he
say
it
just
grows
and
grows
and
grows
and
they
get
these
fee
just
for
maintain
share
in
place
b
fee
or
whatever
they
call
them
i
be
not
charm
with
the
mechanic
of
that
business
address
a
group
of
charitable
foundation
executive
in
santa
monica
california
in
munger
especially
criticize
yale
university
for
invest
its
endowment
in
the
equivalent
of
a
fund
of
mutual
fund
this
be
an
amaze
development
few
would
have
predict
that
long
after
cornfeld
fall
into
disgrace
major
university
would
be
lead
foundation
into
cornfeld
system
bernie
cornfeld
in
the
s
create
the
ill
fat
fund
of
fund
concept
an
eminence
gris
of
no
less
stature
than
john
bogle
founder
of
the
vanguard
fund
have
take
up
munger
cudgel
when
munger
make
his
comment
he
be
speak
to
director
of
nonprofit
organization
and
be
attack
the
practice
of
hire
consultant
to
hire
money
manager
who
in
turn
select
mutual
fund
operate
by
other
money
manager
at
each
step
there
be
a
commission
to
be
paid
which
skim
off
the
money
that
can
be
use
in
the
work
of
the
charity
mr
munger
go
on
to
point
out
say
bogle
the
devastate
impact
of
the
cost
of
all
this
complexity
on
the
return
of
foundation
and
endowment
in
a
stock
market
with
low
return
market
return
percent
total
cost
percent
net
return
percent
and
say
bogle
please
do
not
scoff
at
the
use
of
the
percent
return
on
stock
the
long
term
real
return
on
stock
have
be
percent
so
mr
munger
hypothetical
future
figure
be
far
from
apocalyptic
munger
recommendation
to
manager
of
the
fund
of
not
for
profit
foundation
be
simple
save
yourself
a
lot
of
time
money
and
worry
just
put
your
endowment
into
index
fund
alternately
the
foundation
could
follow
berkshire
lead
and
simply
buy
high
quality
stock
if
they
be
not
highly
overvalue
in
price
and
hold
on
for
the
long
term
it
be
not
even
necessary
to
worry
about
diversification
in
the
united
state
a
person
or
institution
with
almost
all
wealth
invest
long
term
in
just
three
fine
domestic
corporation
be
securely
rich
say
munger
and
why
should
such
an
owner
care
if
at
any
time
most
other
investor
be
fare
somewhat
well
or
bad
and
particularly
so
when
he
rationally
believe
like
berkshire
that
his
long
term
result
will
be
superior
by
reason
of
his
low
cost
require
emphasis
on
long
term
effect
and
concentration
in
his
most
prefer
choice
in
fact
munger
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
investor
could
have
percent
of
their
wealth
in
a
single
company
if
it
be
the
right
company
indeed
i
hope
the
monger
follow
roughly
this
course
and
i
note
that
the
woodruff
foundation
have
so
far
proven
extremely
wise
to
retain
an
approximately
percent
concentration
in
the
founder
coca
cola
stock
it
would
be
interest
to
calculate
just
how
all
american
foundation
would
have
fare
if
they
have
never
sell
a
share
of
founder
stock
very
many
i
think
would
now
be
much
well
off
although
munger
assert
that
the
vast
majority
of
professionally
manage
money
after
take
into
account
the
impact
of
fee
and
transaction
cost
would
be
well
off
in
index
fund
he
end
by
throw
out
an
alternate
point
of
view
do
that
mean
you
should
be
in
an
index
fund
well
that
depends
on
whether
or
not
you
can
invest
money
way
well
than
average
or
you
can
find
someone
who
almost
surely
will
invest
money
way
well
than
average
and
those
be
the
question
that
make
life
interest
if
everyone
put
their
money
in
index
fund
munger
concede
the
price
of
indexed
stock
would
be
force
beyond
intrinsic
value
and
the
process
would
become
meaningless
it
be
this
disenchantment
with
the
management
of
money
in
part
that
lead
to
buffett
and
munger
objection
in
the
mid
s
to
the

in
the

anyone
one
of
the

factor
be
have

neither
mr

munger
sent

letter
to
five

warren
buffett
do
not
regard
the
current
market
price
of
berkshire
stock
as
a
price
that
make
new

in
berkshire
attractive
if
he
be
ask
by
a
friend

family
member
whether
he
advise
a
new
purchase
of
berkshire
share
at
the
current
price
mr
buffett
would
answer
no
to
make
the
investment
trust
less
attractive
berkshire
take
the
unusual
step
of
create
a
b
class
share
which
would
represent
onethirtieth
the
value
of
the
original
share
which
now
would
be
call
a
share
the
structure
of
the
b

and
the
way
in
which
they
be
present
be
unique
the
deal
be
set
up
so
that
broker
could
make
very
little
commission
money
thus
discourage
them
from
push
the
share
onto
their
client
additionally
the
underwriting
syndicate
for
the

include
two
discounter

initial

be
more
readily
available
to
all
investor
critic
claimed
that
buffett
and
munger
create
the
b
share
because
they
could
not
tolerate
lose
control
of
berkshire
shareholder
policy
this
be
a
small
problem
that
mr
buffett
approach
in
a
big
way
say
james
k
mulvey
an
analyst
with
dresdner
security
in
new
york
for
starter
buffett
and
munger
plan
to
offer
b

but
say
they
would
keep
add
to
the
offering
until
the
public
demand
be
met
the
number
of

in

increase
four

nike

go
forward
with
its
trust
but
the
berkshire
trust
never
become
the
phenomenon
that
the
originator
have
hop
it
would
michael
lewis
among
others
have
accuse
munger
and
buffett
of
spout
high
moral
standard
for
the
investment
world
while
not
hold
their
own
investment
to
the
same
requirement
they
particularly
point
to
the
fact
that
berkshire
once
invest
in
the
stock
of
a
company
that
do
not
serve
the
public
good
a
tobacco
seller
we
have
set
ourselves
up
to
some
extent
as
a
moral
censor
of
our
own
activity
munger
agree
but
we
have
never
have
the
attitude
that
when
we
buy
a
little
piece
of
a
company
in
an
insurance
portfolio
that
we
be
a
moral
censor
for
the
world
in
april
berkshire
take
a
sizable
stake
approximately
percent
in
ust
a
lead
maker
of
smokeless
tobacco
the
share
be
trading
at
between
and
per

at
the
time
a
percent
stake
would
have
be
worth
more
than
million
ust
make
skoal
and
copenhagen
and
also
produce
wine
include
chateau
ste
michelle
at
the
same
time
berkshire
sell
its
holding
in
rjr
nabisco
which
be
a
combine
food
and
tobacco
company
to
some
it
be
splitting
hair
but
to
munger
there
be
a
big
difference
in
buying
stock
in
a
corporation
and
own
the
entire
shebang
he
follow
different
rule
for
each
if
we
be
buying
stock
in
major
company
that
be
out
there
buffett
do
not
make
his
judgment
base
on
some
moral
overview
of
their
whole
business
we
do
that
in
judging
and
control
our
own
behavior
munger
say
that
though
it
once
held
tobacco
company
share
berkshire
turn
down
a
chance
to
buy
a
tobacco
company
outright
we
do
not
want
to
be
in
the
business
of
sell
addictive
drug
with
us
be
the
control
owner
munger
say
it
be
not
the
way
we
do
the
game
we
will
own
share
because
if
we
do
not
own
them
somebody
else
will
but
we
will
never
have
berkshire
in
a
control
interest
that
say
munger
admits
that
he
and
buffett
have
make
many
investment
error
if
i
be
ordain
rule
for
run
board
of
director
i
would
require
that
three
hour
be
spent
examine
stupid
blunder
include
quantification
of
effect
consider
opportunity
cost
despite
his
criticism
and
his
insistence
that
there
be
corrupt
practice
afoot
in
the
business
world
munger
feel
that
overall
america
and
its
business
usually
be
honorable
i
would
not
agree
that
thing
be
generally
go
to
hell
say
munger
sure
we
have
get
some
pocket
of
social
pathology
in
our
big
city
and
we
have
get
pocket
of
social
pathology
in
the
high
reach
of
business
but
average
out
i
would
say
it
be
pretty
good
if
you
take
engineering
integrity
in
product
when
be
the
last
time
your
automatic
transmission
go
out
we
have
learn
to
do
a
lot
of
thing
with
enormous
reliability
you
take
a
company
like
boeing
and
all
the
hour
that
the
airplane
stay
in
the
air
and
the
three
back
up
system
behind
every
system
that
navigates
that
airplane
i
would
argue
that
there
be
a
lot
to
admire
in
american
business
and
a
lot
that
be
do
right
and
that
these
oldfashioned
value
average
out
be
win
not
lose
it
be
too
bad
we
have
all
that
social
pathology
hut
we
have
it
in
the
high
reach
of
politics
why
should
not
we
have
it
in
the
high
reach
of
business
a
shareholder
once
ask
biiffett
how
he
spent
his
day
warren
say
he
mostly
read
and
talk
on
the
telephone
that
be
what
i
do
charlie
what
do
you
do
that
question
reminds
me
very
much
of
a
friend
of
mine
in
world
war
ii
in
a
group
that
have
nothing

a

he

what
do
you
do
his

say
not
a
damn
thing
the
general
get
madder
and
madder
and
turn
to
my
friend
and
say
what
do
you
do
my
friend
say
i
help
captain
glotz
that
be
the
best
way
to
describe
what

believe
that
the
secret
of
human
felicity
be
to
aim
low
i
promptly
do
that
say
munger
add
that
he
want
to
be
able
to
say
what
samuel
johnson
say
regard
the
write
of
his
dictionary
i
knew
very
well
what
i
be
try
to
do
and
very
well
how
to
do
it
and
i
have
do
it
very
well
of
course
munger
mean
that
as
a
bit
of
a
joke
and
he
admits
he
overshot
his
mark
somewhat
although
munger
may
never
have
expect
to
be
a
billionaire
and
second
in
command
of
one
of
the
most
unique
and
closely
watch
corporation
in
the
world
he
aim
at
a
life
of
quality
and
strove
diligently
to
bring
that
about
buffett
life
and
his
investment
strategy
seem
to
unfold
effortlessly
before
him
but
munger
course
have
not
be
as
easy
both
personally
and
professionally
he
have
encounter
repeat
obstacle
and
heartache
that
be
what
most
people
experience
in
life
munger
would
say
anyone
who
struggle
to
make
the
box
of
his
life
large
discovers
that
the
box
have
wall
that
must
be
burst
open
it
be
necessary
to
accommodate
a
lot
of
failure
and
because
no
matter
how
able
you
be
you
be
go
to
have
headwind
and
trouble
munger
told
the
employee
at
see
candy
on
the
company
th
anniversary
the
see
who
create
this
business
have
fail
at
least
once
and
have
seriously
fail
but
if
a
person
just
keep
go
on
the
theory
that
life
be
full
of
vicissitude
and
just
do
the
right
think
and
follow
the
right
value
it
should
work
out
well
in
the
end
so
i
would
say
do
not
be
discourage
by
a
few
revers
by
heed
basic
principle
and
be
alert
for
opportunity
munger
matte
the
leap
from
a
respectably
successful
lawyer
to
an
individual
investor
who
be
know
internationally
for
his
expertise
his
wealth
have
provide
the
independence
he
long
for
as
a
young
man
it
be
a
number
of
idea
not
just
one
a
lot
of
idea
in
the
nature
of
thing
really
wonderful
idea
be
virtually
sure
to
win
you
can
be
sure
that
if
you
master
the
wonderful
concept
you
be
go
to
get
opportunity
if
you
look
for
them
but
you
wo
not
get
an
unlimited
number
of
good
idea
so
when
they
come
along
seize
them
munger
have
say
that
accumulate
the
first
from
a
stand
start
with
no
seed
money
be
the
most
difficult
part
of

the

be
the
next
big
hurdle
to
do
that
a

must
consistently
underspend
his

curmudgeonly
exterior
be
unlikely
to
be
ruffle
by
such
comment
as
for
his
gruffness
it
be
very
much
an
act
it
be
self
parody
it
be
a
joke
on
himself
say
molly
munger
you
know
people
who
be
stiff
ponderous
he
be
not
he
do
not

one
that

him
the
munger
child
despite
their
attraction
to
law
as
a
career
be
quite
different
from
one
another
yet
each
seem
to
have
take
some
characteristic
from
charlie
molly

a
vivacious
strike
blonde
whose

emilie

sit
in

in
the

she
have
to

the
fact
that
some
of
his
child
have
adopt
religious
belief
he
do
not
embrace
and
others
spend
their
life
in
activity
that
probably
wo
not
be
highly
financially
productive
munger
swell
with
pride
when
tell
of
charles

s
work
in
science
education
or
his
wife
mandy
election
to
her
local

board
he
think
i
be
an
ultra
liberal
but
part
of
that
be
for
effect
say
molly
who
spends
an
enormous
amount
of
time
on
work
her
father
would
describe
as
left

and
who
as
an
adult
convert
to
catholicism
he
like
to
play
the
curmudgeon
but
i
do
not
think
he
think
i
be
a
crazy
person
munger
have
say
that
he
and
buffett
do
not
want
to
go
down
in
history
as
shrewd
miserable
accumulator
we
do
not
want
to
be
remember
by
friend
and
family
for
nothing
but
piece
of
paper
and
so
charlie
have
decide
it
be
all
right
to
be
whimsical
once
in
a
while
i
be
building
a
boat
declare
munger
in
the
fall
of

day
of
finish
call
it
munger
folly
it
be
not
an
economic
activity
but
it
be
very
creative
nobody
have
built
a
boat
exactly
like
it
the
foot
long

composite
material
similar
to
those
use
in

and
keviar
briefly
it
be
the
large
boat
of
its
kind
in
the
world
until
someone
built
a
catamaran
with
a
mast
just
a
few
inch
high
than
the
channel
cat
foot

the

complete
in

but
not
without
difficulty
king
williams
who
along
with
charlie
design
the
boat
say
the
story
begin
one
afternoon
several

unfortunately
williams
have
spent
too
much
of
his
career
under

and
be
begin
to
suffer
the
bend
when
he

at
my
boat
admire
it
say
williams
they
introduce
themselves
charlie
munger
and
a
friend
i
have
no
idea
who
they
be
the
two
men
ask
all
sort
of
question
and
after
a
while
williams
offer
to
take
them
out
for
a
spin
on
the
boat
after
that
charlie
call
occasionally
and
he
and
williams
go
out
for
lunch
and
talk
mostly
about
two
subject
munger
find
everfascinating
fishing
and
boat
gradually
the
two
become
friend
as
he
have
do
before
senior
financier
charlie
munger
found
an
unlikely
ally
king
williams
iii
a
deep
sea
diver
whose
hobby
be
hang
glide
off
the
santa
barbara
cliff
williams
be
a
big
easy
go
fiftyish
man
with
a
ready
laugh
who
seem
to
have
no
fear
of
anything
physical
munger
do
not
intimidate
him
either
but
williams
have
learn
a
lot
in
the
relationship
charlie
use
to
ask
me
a
question
and
i
would
shoot
back
an
answer
say
williams
a
couple
of
day
later
i
would
think
why
do
i
say
that
that
be
not
what
he
want
to
know
now
i
think
carefully
before
answer
him
i
like
to
say
that
now
i
be
up
to
just
one
day
behind
him
their
conversation
occasionally
take
a
philosophical
turn
charlie
once
ask
me
king
if
you
could
do
anything
in
the
world
what
would
it
be
i
say
i
would
build
the
big
catamaran
i
could
and
sail
off
across
that
ocean
and
you
would
never
see
me
again
munger
then
quiz
him
about
why
he
would
build
a
catamaran
and
they
get
to
talk
about
that
type
of
boat
and
what
make
it
good
and
have
though
williams
be
unprepared
for
what
happen
next
like
the
typical
adventurer
he
be
game
for
it
one
day
he
say
go
find
a
catamaran
unfortunately
the
boat
they
discuss
do
not
exist
and
the
luxury
tax
have
push
many
yacht
builder
out
of
business
make
u
s
builder
difficult
to
find
williams
finally
locate
a
yacht
manufacturer
who
say
he
could
do
the
job
in
green
cove
spring
a
small
town
in
florida
three
month
into
the
project
thing
go
off
track
to
be
sure
williams
and
munger
want
to
do
some
thing
with
the
boat
that
be
outside
the
realm
of
ordinary
experience
problem
at
the
original

be
such
that

down
thing
be
not
go
well
say
williams
charlie
say
well

so
i
fire
the

his
wife
rachel
quickly
packed
up
and
go
to
florida

take
charge
of
the
work
the
unfinished
boat
be
already
so
big
that
move
it
would
be
awkward
but
there
be
no
other
choice
williams
have
to
go
into
the
shipyard
with
the
sheriff

munger
scrawl

i
would

like
that
he
be
very
distrustful
of
emotion
observe
molly
munger
we
heard
a
lot
of
message
about
how
emotion
can
lead
you
to
do
dumb
thing
i
be
try
to
think
of
a
time
he
say
go
with
your
gut
feel
the
vibe
lose
yourself
in
the
moment
that
be
not
where
he
be
yet
molly
say
there
always
be
sign
that
her
father
could
be
frivolous
at
the
same
time
that
dry
of
a
person
would
not
have
that
spring
in
his
step
after
something
be
checked
out
and
you
can
feel
safe
he
get
very
devote
to
people
say
molly
a
good
argument
can
be
make
that
he
be
a
very
emotional
person
that
it
be
an
achievement
that
he
brought
a
large
psyche
under
control
a
unique
mix
of
an
emotional
personality
under
wrap
a
postscript
when
they
be
young
warren
buffett
often
told
inquisitive
shareholder
that
if
anything
happen
to
him
charlie
munger
would
take
the
helm
at
berkshire
hathaway
as
time
pass
and
age
crept
up
munger
deflect
question
of
corporate
succession
in
the
standard
midwestern
way
with
humor
they
ask
george
burn
when
he
be
what
do
your
doctor
say
about
you
smoking
these
big
black
cigar
and
he
say
my
doctor
dead
but
now
that
buffett
be
around
and
munger
be
passing
his
mid
s
that
reply
do
not
work
as
well
in
due
course
this
corporation
will
have
a
change
in
management
say
munger
there
be
not
a
way
to
fix
that
both
men
say
however
that
there
be
a
successor
or
possibly
two
one
for
operation
and
one
for
investment
who
will
be
reveal
at
the
appropriate
time
furthermore
berkshire
hathaway

a
long
tenure
of
effortless
management
in
mind
the
one
place
a
death
will
hurt
be
we
be
not
likely

get
as
good
an
allocator
of
capital
as
warren
in
the
next
ceo
whoever
that
be
but
it
still
will
be
one
hell
of
a
business
ki
munger
say
he
and
buffett
be
not
obsess
about
their
successor
yet
fortunately
warren
plan
to
live
almost
indefinitely
one
shareholder
ask
who

implication
today
i
be
go
to

in

game
remind
us
of
our
old
professor
socratic
solitaire
i
will
ask
and
briefly
answer
five
question
do
broadscale
professional
need
more
multidisciplinary
skill
be
our
education
sufficiently
multidisciplinary
in
elite
broadscale
soft
science
what
be
the
essential
nature
of
practicable
best
form
multidisciplinary
education
in
the
last
fifty
year
how
far
have
elite
academia
progress
toward
attainable
best
form
multidisciplinarity
what
educational
practice
would
make
progress
faster
we
start
with
the
question
do
broadscale
professional
need
more
multidisciplinary
skill
to
answer
the
first
question
we
must
first
decide
whether
more
multidisciplinarity
will
improve
professional
cognition
and
to
decide
what
will
cure
bad
cognition
it
will
help
to
know
what
cause
it
one
of
bernard
shaw
character
explain
professional
defect
as
follow
in
the
last
analysis
every
profession
be
a
conspiracy
against
the
laity
there
be
a
lot
of
truth
in
shaw
diagnosis
as
be
early
demonstrate
when
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
dominant
profession
the
clergy
burn
william
tyndale
at
the
stake
for
translate
the
bible
into
english
but
shaw
plainly
understates
the
problem
in
imply
that
a
conscious
self
interested
malevolence
be
the
main
culprit
more
important
there
be
frequent
terrible
effect
in
professional
from
intertwine
subconscious
mental
tendency
two
of
which
be
exceptionally
prone
to
cause
trouble
incentive
cause
bias
a
natural
cognitive
drift
toward
the
conclusion
that
what
be
good
for
the
professional
be
good
for
the
client
and
the
wider
civilization
and
man
with
a
hammer
tendency
with
the
name
take
from
the
proverb
to
a
man
with
only
a
hammer
every
problem
tends
to
look
pretty
much
like
a
nail
one
partial
cure
for
man
with
a
hammer
tendency
be
obvious
if
a
man
have
a
vast
set
of
skill
over
multiple
discipline
he
by
definition
carry
multiple
tool
and
therefore
will
limit
have
cognitive
effect
from
man
with
a
hammer
tendency
moreover
when
he
be
multidisciplinary
enough
to
absorb
from
practical
psychology
the
idea
that
all
his
life
he
must
fight
have
effect
from
both
the
tendency
i
mention
both
within
himself
and
from
others
he
have
take
a
constructive
step
on
the
road
to
worldly
wisdom
if
a
be
narrow
professional
doctrine
and
b
consists
of
the
big
extra
useful
concept
from
other
discipline
then
clearly
the
professional
possess
a
plus
b
will
usually
be
well
off
than
the
poor
possessor
of
a
alone
how
could
it
be
otherwise
and
thus
the
only
rational
excuse
for
not
acquire
more
b
be
that
it
be
not
practical
to
do
so
give
the
man
need
for
a
and
the
other
urgent
demand
in
his
life
i
will
later
try
to
demonstrate
that
this
excuse
for
unidisciplinarity
at
least
for
our
most
gift
people
be
usually
unsound
my
second
question
be
so
easy
to
answer
that
i
wo
not
give
it
much
time
our
education
be
far
too
unidisciplinary
broadscale
problem
by
definition
cross
many
academic
discipline
accordingly
use
a
unidisciplinary
attack
on
such
problem
be
like
play
a
bridge
hand
by
counting
trump
while
ignore
all
else
this
be
honker
sort
of
like
the
mad
hatter
tea
party
but
nonetheless
too
much
that
be
similar
remains
present
in
professional
practice
and
even
bad
have
long
be
encourage
in
isolated
department
of
soft
science
define
as
everything
less
fundamental
than
biology
even
in
our
youth
some
of
the
best
professor
be
horrify
by
bad
effect
from
balkanization
of
academia
into
insular
turf
protect
enclave
wherein
notion
be
maintain
by
leap
of
faith
plus
exclusion
of
non
believer
alfred
north
whitehead
for
one
long
ago
sound
an
alarm
in
strong
language
when
he
spoke
of
the
fatal
unconnectedness
of
academic
discipline
and
since
then
elite
educational
institution
agree
more
and
more
with
whitehead
have
steadily
fought
unconnectedness
by
bring
in
more
multidisciplinarity
cause
some
awesome
plaudit
to
be
won
in
our
time
by
great
unconnectedness
fighter
at
border
of
academic
discipline
for
instance
harvard
e
o
wilson
and
caltech
linus
pauling
so
modern
academia
now
give
more
multidisciplinarity
than
we
receive
and
be
plainly
right
to
do
so
the
natural
third
question
then
becomes
what
be
now
the
goal
what
be
the
essential
nature
of
best
form
multidisciplinarity
in
elite
education
this
question
too
be
easy
to
answer
all
we
have
to
do
be
examine
our
most
successful
narrowscale
education
identify
essential
element
and
scale
up
those
element
to
reach
the
sensible
solution
to
find
the
best
educational
narrowscale
model
we
have
to
look
not
at
unthreatened
school
of
education
and
the
like
too
much
driven
by
our
two
counterproductive
psychological
tendency
and
other
have
influence
but
instead
where
incentive
for
effective
education
be
strong
and
result
be
most
closely
measure
this
lead
us
to
a
logical
place
the
hugely
successful
education
now
mandatory
for
airline
pilot
yes
i
be
suggest
today
that
mighty
harvard
would
do
well
if
it
thought
more
about
pilot
training
in
pilot
as
in
other
profession
one
great
hazard
be
the
have
effect
from
man
with
a
hammer
tendency
we
do
not
want
a
pilot
ever
to
respond
to
hazard
y
as
if
it
be
hazard
x
just
because
his
mind
contains
only
a
hazard
x
model
and
so
for
that
and
other
reason
we
train
a
pilot
in
a
strict
six
element
system
his
formal
education
be
wide
enough
to
cover
practically
everything
useful
in
pilot
his
knowledge
of
practically
everything
need
by
pilot
be
not
taught
just
well
enough
to
enable
him
to
pas
one
test
or
two
instead
all
his
knowledge
be
raise
to
practice
base
fluency
even
in
handle
two
or
three
intertwine
hazard
at
once
like
any
good
algebraist
he
be
make
to
think
sometimes
in
a
foreword
fashion
and
sometimes
in
reverse
and
so
he
learns
when
to
concentrate
mostly
on
what
he
want
to
happen
and
also
when
to
concentrate
mostly
on
avoid
what
he
do
not
want
to
happen
his
training
time
be
allocate
among
subject
so
as
to
minimize
damage
from
his
later
malfunction
and
so
what
be
most
important
in
his
performance
get
the
most
training
coverage
and
be
raise
to
the
high
fluency
level
check
list
routine
be
always
mandatory
for
him
even
after
original
training
he
be
force
into
a
special
knowledge
maintenance
routine
regular
use
of
the
aircraft
simulator
to
prevent
atrophy
through
long
disuse
of
skill
need
to
cope
with
rare
and
important
problem
the
need
for
this
clearly
correct
six
element
system
with
its
large
demand
in
a
narrowscale
field
where
stake
be
high
be
root
in
the
deep
structure
of
the
human
mind
therefore
we
must
expect
that
the
education
we
need
for
broadscale
problem
solve
will
keep
all
these
element
but
with
awesomely
expand
coverage
for
each
element
how
could
it
be
otherwise
thus
it
follow
as
the
night
the
day
that
in
our
most
elite
broadscale
education
wherein
we
be
try
to
make
silk
purse
out
of
silk
we
must
for
best
result
have
multidisciplinary
coverage
of
immense
amplitude
with
all
need
skill
raise
to
an
ever
maintain
practice
base
fluency
include
considerable
power
of
synthesis
at
boundary
between
discipline
with
the
high
fluency
level
be
achieve
where
they
be
most
need
with
forward
and
reverse
think
technique
be
employ
in
a
manner
remind
one
of
inversion
in
algebra
and
with
check
list
routine
be
a
permanent
part
of
the
knowledge
system
there
can
be
no
other
way
no
easy
way
to
broadscale
worldly
wisdom
thus
the
task
when
first
identify
in
its
immense
breadth
seem
daunt
verge
on
impossible
but
the
task
consider
in
full
context
be
far
from
impossible
when
we
consider
three
factor
first
the
concept
of
all
need
skill
let
us
recognize
that
we
do
not

to
raise
everyone
skill
in
celestial
mechanic
to
that
of
laplace
and
also
ask
everyone
to
achieve
a

level
in

instead

only
in

they

not
so
numerous
nor

on
average
have
more
aptitude
than
the
student
and
we
have
roughly
thirteen
long
year
in
which
to
turn
our
most
promising
twelve
year
old
into

professional
third
think
by
inversion
and
through
use
of
check
list
be
easily
learn
in
broadscale
life
as
in
pilot
moreover
we
can
believe
in
the
attainability
of
broad
multidisciplinary
skill
for
the
same
reason
the
fellow
from
arkansas
give
for
his
belief
in
baptism
i
have
see
it
do
we
all
know
of
individual
modern
ben
franklin
who
have
achieve
a
massive
multidisciplinary
synthesis
with
less
time
in
formal
education
than
be
now
available
to
our
numerous
brilliant
young
and
thus
become
well
performer
in
their
own
discipline
not
bad
despite
diversion
of
learn
time
to
matter
outside
the
normal
coverage
of
their
own
discipline
give
the
time
and
talent
available
and
example
of
successful
master
of
multiple
discipline
what
be
show
by
our
present
failure
to
minimize
have
effect
from
man
with
a
hammer
tendency
be
only
that
you
ca
not
win
big
in
multidisciplinarity
in
soft
science
academia
if
you
be
so
satisfied
with
the
status
quo
or
so
frighten
by
the
difficulty
of
change
that
you
do
not
try
hard
enough
to
win
big
this
brings
us
to
our
fourth
question
judged
with
reference
to
an
optimize
feasible
multidisciplinary
goal
how
much
have
elite
soft
science
education
be
correct
after
we
left
the
answer
be
that
many
thing
have
be
try
as
correction
in
the
direction
of
well
multidisciplinarity
and
after
allow
for
some
counterproductive
result
there
have
be
some
considerable
improvement
net
but
much
desirable
correction
be
still
undone
and
lie
far
ahead
for
instance
soft
science
academia
have
increasingly
found
it
helpful
when
professor
from
different
discipline
collaborate
or
when
a
professor
have
be
credentialed
in
more
than
one
discipline
but
a
different
sort
of
correction
have
usually
work
best
namely
augmentation
of
a
take
what
you
wish
practice
that
encourages
any
discipline
to
simply
assimilate
whatever
it
chooses
from
other
discipline
perhaps
this
work
best
because
it
bypass
academic
squabble
root
in
the
tradition
and
territoriality
that
have
cause
the
unidisciplinary
folly
for
which
correction
be
now
sought
in
any
event
through
increase
use
of
take
what
you
wish
many
soft
science
discipline
reduce
folly
from
man
with
a
hammer
tendency
for
instance
lead
by
our
classmate
roger
fisher
the
law
school
brought
in
negotiation
draw
on
other
discipline
over
three
million
copy
of
roger
wise
and
ethical
negotiation
book
have
now
be
sell
and
his
life
achievement
may
well
be
the
best
ever
from
our
whole
class
the
law
school
also
brought
in
a
lot
of
sound
and
useful
economics
even
some
good

from

the
tragedy

thus
correctly
find
a
wicked
invisible
foot
in
coexistence
with
adam
smith
angelic
invisible

these
day
there
be
even
some
behavioral
economics
wisely
seek
aid
from
psychology
however
an
extremely
permissive
practice
like
take
what
you
wish
be
not
destine
to
have
percent
admirable
result
in
soft
science
indeed
in
some
of
its
bad
outcome
it
help
change
like
assimilation
of
freudianism
in
some
literature
department
importation
into
many
place
of
extremist
political
ideology
of
the
left
or
right
that
have
for
their
possessor
make
regain
of
objectivity
almost
as
unlikely
as
regain
of
virginity
and
importation
into
many
law
and
business
school
of
hard
form
efficient
market
theory
by

to

in

moreover
even
when
it
avoid
such
lunacy
take
what
you
wish
have
some
serious
defect
for
instance
taking
from
more
fundamental
discipline
be
often
do
without
attribution
sometimes
under
new
name
with
little
attention
give
to
rank
in
a
fundamentalness
order
for
absorbed
concept
such
practice
act
like
a
lousy
filing
system
that
must
impair
successful
use
and
synthesis
of
absorbed
knowledge
and
do
not
maximize
in
soft
science
the
equivalent
of
linus
pauling
systematic
mining
of
physic
to
improve
chemistry
there
must
be
a
well
way
this
brings
us
finally
to
our
last
question
in
elite
soft
science
what
practice
would
hasten
our
progress
toward
optimize
multidisciplinarity
here
again
there
be
some
easy
answer
first
many
more
course
should
be
mandatory
not
optional
and
this
in
turn
require
that
the
people
who
decide
what
be
mandatory
must
posse
large
multidisciplinary
knowledge
maintain
in
fluency
this
conclusion
be
as
obvious
in
the
training
of
the
would
he
broadscale
problem
solver
as
it
be
in
the
training
of
the
would
be
pilot
for
instance
both
psychology
mastery
and
accounting
mastery
should
be
require
as
outcome
in
legal
education
yet
in
many
elite
place
even
today
there
be
no
such
requirement
often
such
be
the
narrowness
of
mind
of
the
program
designer
that
they
neither
see
what
be
need
and
miss
nor
be
able
to
fix
deficiency
second
there
should
be
much
more
problem
solve
practice
that
cross
several
discipline
include
practice
that
mimic
the
function
of
the
aircraft
simulator
in
prevent
loss
of
skill
through
disuse
let
me
give
an
example
roughly
remember
of
this
sort
of
teach
by
a
very
wise
but
untypical
harvard
business
school
professor
many
decade
ago
this
professor
give
a
test
involve
two
unworldly
old
lady
who
have
just
inherit
a
new
england
shoe
factory
make
brand
shoe
and
beset
with
serious
business
problem
described
in
great
detail
the
professor
then
give
the
student
ample
time
to
answer
with
write
advice
to
the
old
lady
in
response
to
the
answer
the
professor
next
give
every
student
an
undesirable
grade
except
for
one
student
who
be
grade
at
the
top
by
a
wide
margin
what
be
the
win
answer
it
be
very
short
and
roughly
as
follow
this
business
field
and
this
particular
business
in
its
particular
location
present
crucial
problem
that
be
so
difficult
that
unworldly
old
lady
cannot
wisely
try
to
solve
them
through
hire
help
give
the
difficulty
and
unavoidable
agency
cost
the
old
lady
should
promptly
sell
the
shoe
factory
probably
to
the
competitor
who
would
enjoy
the
great
marginal
utility
advantage
thus
the
win
answer
rely
not
on
what
the
student
have
most
recently
be
taught
in
business
school
but
instead
on
more
fundamental
concept
like
agency
cost
and
marginal
utility
lift
from
undergraduate
psychology
and
economics
ah
my
fellow
member
of
the
harvard
law
class
of
if
only
we
have
be
much
more
often
test
like
that
just
think
of
what
more
we
might
have
accomplish
incidentally
many
elite
private
school
now
wisely
use
such
multidisciplinary
method
in
seventh
grade
science
while
at
the
same
time
many
graduate
school
have
not
yet
see
the
same
light
this
be
one
more
sad
example
of
whitehead
fatal
unconnectedness
in
education
third
most
soft
science
professional
school
should
increase
use
of
the
best
business
periodical
like
the
wall
street
journal
forbes
fortune
etc
such
periodical
be
now
quite
good
and
perform
the
function
of
the
aircraft
simulator
if
use
to
prompt
practice
in
relate
event
to
multidisciplinary
cause
often
intertwine
and
sometimes
the
periodical
even
introduce
new
model
for
cause
instead
of
merely
refresh
old
knowledge
also
it
be
not
just
slightly
sound
to
have
the
student
practice
in
school
what
he
must
practice
life
long
after
formal
education

strong

to

in
our

some
harvard

could

do
point
to
a
wonderful

of
just
such

base
folly
this
of
course
be
the

at

which
be
then
view
by
many
at

soft

this

of

when
he
so
quickly
found
in

o
ring
the
cause
of
our
great
space
shuttle
disaster
and
previous
extension
of
the

into
softer
fare
have
work
well
for
instance
biology
start
year
ago
with
a
descriptive
mess
not
much
related
to
deep
theory
have
gradually
absorbed
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
with
marvelous
result
as
new
generation
have
come
to
use
well
think
method
contain
model
that
answer
the
question
why
and
there
be
no
clear
reason
why
the
ethos
of
hard
science
ca
not
also
help
in
discipline
far
less
fundamental
than
biology
here
as
i
interpret
it
be
this
fundamental
organize
ethos
i
be
talk
about
you
must
both
rank
and
use
discipline
in
order
of
fundamentalness
you
must
like
it
or
not
master
to
test
fluency
and
routinely
use
the
truly
essential
part
of
all
four
constituent
of
the
fundamental
four
discipline
combination
with
particularly
intense
attention
give
to
discipline
more
fundamental
than
your
own
you
may
never
practice
either
crossdisciplinary
absorption
without
attribution
or
departure
from
a
principle
of
economy
that
forbids
explain
in
any
other
way
anything
readily
explainable
from
more
fundamental
material
in
your
own
or
any
other
discipline
but
when
the
step
approach
do
not
produce
much
new
and
useful
insight
you
should
hypothesize
and
test
to
establishment
new
principle
ordinarily
by
use
method
similar
to
those
that
create
successful
old
principle
but
you
may
not
use
any
new
principle
inconsistent
with
an
old
one
unless
you
can
now
prove
that
the
old
principle
be
not
true
you
will
note
that
compare
with
much
current
practice
in
softscience
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
of
hard
science
be
more
severe
this
reminds
one
of
pilot
training
and
this
outcome
be
not
a
coincidence
reality
be
talk
to
anyone
who
will
listen
like
pilot
training
the
ethos
of
hard
science
do
not
say
take
what
you
wish
but
learn
it
all
to
fluency
like
it
or
not
and
rational
organization
of
multidisciplinary
knowledge
be
force
by
make
mandatory
full
attribution
for
cross
disciplinary
taking
and
mandatory
preference
for
the
most
fundamental
explanation
this
simple
idea
may
appear
too
obvious
to
be
useful
but
there
be
an
old
two
part
rule
that
often
work
wonder
in
business
science
and
elsewhere
take
a
simple
basic
idea
and
take
it
very
seriously
and
as
some
evidence
for
the
value
of
take
very
seriously
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
i
offer
the
example
of
my
own
life
i
come
to
harvard
law
school
very
poorly
educate
with
desultory
work
habit
and
no
college
degree
i
be
admit
over
the
objection
of
warren
abner
seavey
through
intervention
of
family
friend
roscoe
pound
i
have
take
one
silly
course
in
biology
in
high
school
briefly
learn
mostly
by
rote
an
obviously
incomplete
theory
of
evolution
portion
of
the
anatomy
of
the
paramecium
and
frog
plus
a
ridiculous
concept
of
protoplasm
that
have
since
disappear
to
this
day
i
have
never
take
any
course
anywhere
in
chemistry
economics
psychology
or
business
but
i
early
take
elementary
physic
and
math
and
paid
enough
attention
to
somehow
assimilate
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
of
hard
science
which
i
thereafter
push
far
and
far
into
softer
and
softer
fare
as
my
organize
guide
and
filing
system
in
a
search
for
whatever
multidisciplinary
worldly
wisdom
it
would
be
easy
to
get
thus
my
life
become
a
sort
of
accidental
educational
experiment
with
respect
to
feasibility
and
utility
of
a
very
gross
academic
extension
of
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
by
a
man
who
also
learn
well
what
his
own
discipline
have
to
teach
what
i
found
in
my
extend
attempt
to
complete
by
informal
mean
my
stunt
education
be
that
plug
along
with
only
ordinary
will
but
with
the
fundamental
organize
ethos
as
my
guide
my
ability
to
serve
everything
i
love
be
enhance
far
beyond
my
dessert
large
gain
come
in
place
that
seem
unlikely
as
i
start
out
sometimes
make
me
like
the
only
one
without
a
blindfold
in
a
high
stake
game
of
pin
the
donkey
for
instance
i
be
productively
lead
into
psychology
where
i
have
no
plan
to
go
create
large
advantage
that
deserve
a
story
on
another
day
today
i
have
no
more
story
i
have
finish
my
talk
by
answer
my
own
question
as
best
i
could
in
a
brief
time
what
be
most
interest
to
me
in
my
answer
be
that
while
everything
i
have
say
be
non
original
and
have
long
be
obvious
to
the
point
of
banality
to
many
sound
and
well
educate
mind
all
the
evil
i
decry
remain
grossly
overpresent
in
the
best
of
our
soft
science
educational
domain
wherein
virtually
every
professor
have
a
too
unidisciplinary
habit
of
mind
even
while
a
well
model
exists
just
across
the
aisle
in
his
own
university
to
me
this
ridiculous
outcome
implies
that
the
soft
science
department
tolerate
perverse
incentive
wrong
incentive
be
a
major
cause
because
as
dr
johnson
so
wisely
observe
truth
be
hard
to
assimilate
in
any
mind
when
oppose
by
interest
and
if
institutional
incentive
cause
the
problem
then
a
remedy
be
feasible
because
incentive
can
be
change
i
have
try
to
demonstrate
today
and
indeed
by
the
example
of
my
life
that
it
be
neither
inevitable
nor
advantageous
for
soft
science
educational
domain
to
tolerate
as
much
unidisciplinary
wrongheadedness
as
they
now
do
if
i
could
somewhat
fix
my
many
gross
deficiency
so
can
they
there
be
clearly
a
well
way
quite
feasible
to
trod
and
if
this
be
so
there
be
an
ethos
also
from
dr
johnson
that
be
applicable
please
remem
her
the
word
dr
johnson
use
to
describe
maintenance
of
academic
ignorance
that
be
removable
through
diligence
to
dr
johnson
such
conduct
be
treachery
and
if
duty
will
not
move
improvement
advantage
be
also
available
there
will
be
immense
worldly
reward
for
law
school
and
other
academic
domain
as
for
charlie
munger
in
a
more
multidisciplinary
approach
to
many
problem
common
or
uncommon
and
more
fun
as
well
as
more
accomplishment
the
happier
mental
realm
i
recommend
be
one
from
which
no
one
willingly
return
a
return
would
be
like
cut
off
one
hand
practical
thought
about
practical
thought
in
a
long
career
i
have
assimilate
various
ultrasimple
general
notion
that
i
find
helpful
in
solve
problem
five
of
these
helpful
notion
i
will
now
describe
after
that
i
will
present
to
you
a
problem
of
extreme
scale
indeed
the
problem
will
involve
turn
start
up
capital
of
million
into
trillion
a
sum
large
enough
to
represent
a
practical
achievement
then
i
will
try
to
solve
the
problem
assist
by
my
helpful
general
notion
follow
that
i
will
suggest
that
there
be
important
educational
implication
in
my
demonstration
i
will
so
finish
because
my
objective
be
educational
my
game
today
be
a
search
for
well
method
of
thought
my
first
helpful
notion
be
that
it
be
usually
best
to
simplify
problem
by
decide
big
no
brainer
question
first
the
second
helpful
notion
mimic
galileo
conclusion
that
scientific
reality
be
often
reveal
only
by
math
as
if
math
be
the
language
of
god
galileo
attitude
also
work
well
in
messy
practical
life
without
numerical
fluency
in
the
part
of
life
most
of
us
inhabit
you
be
like
a
onelegged
man
in
an
as
kick
contest
the
third
helpful
notion
be
that
it
be
not
enough
to
think
problem
through
forward
you
must
also
think
in
reverse
much
like
the
rustic
who
want
to
know
where
he
be
go
to
die
so
that
he
would
never
go
there
indeed
many
problem
ca
not
be
solve
forward
and
that
be
why
the
great
algebraist
carl
jacobi
so
often
say
invert
always
invert
and
why
pythagoras
thought
in
reverse
to
prove
that
the
square
root
of
two
be
an
irrational
number
the
fourth
helpful
notion
be
that
the
best
and
most
practical
wisdom
be
elementary
academic
wisdom
but
there
be
one
extremely
important
qualification
you
must
think
in
a
multidisciplinary
manner
you
must
routinely
use
all
the
easy
to
learn
concept
from
the
freshman
course
in
every
basic
subject
where
elementary
idea
will
serve
your
problem
solve
must
not
be
limited
as
academia
and
many
business
bureaucracy
be
limited
by
extreme
balkanization
into
discipline
and
subdisciplines
with
strong
taboo
against
any
venture
outside
assign
territory
instead
you
must
do
your
multidisciplinary
think
in
accord
with
ben
franklin
prescription
in
poor
richard
if
you
want
it
do
go
if
not
send
if
in
your
think
you
rely
entirely
on
others
often
through
purchase
of
professional
advice
whenever
outside
a
small
territory
of
your
own
you
will
suffer
much
calamity
and
it
be
not
just
difficulty
in
complex
coordination
that
will
do
you
in
you
will
also
suffer
from
the
reality
evoke
by
the
shavian
character
who
say
in
the
last
analysis
every
profession
be
a
conspiracy
against
the
laity
indeed
a
shavian
character
for
once
understated
the
horror
of
something
shaw
do
not
like
it
be
not
usually
the
conscious
malfeasance
of
your
narrow
professional
adviser
that
do
you
in
instead
your
trouble
cone
from
his
subconscious
bias
his
cognition
will
often
he
impaired
for
your
purpose
by
financial
incentive
different
from
yours
and
he
will
also
suffer
from
the
psychological
defect
caught
by
the
proverb
to
a
man
with
a
hammer
every
problem
look
like
a
nail
the
fifth
helpful
notion
be
that
really
big
effect
lollapalooza
effect
will
often
come
only
from
large
combination
of
factor
for
instance
tuberculosis
be
tame
at
least
for
a
long
time
only
by
routine
combine
use
in
each
case
of
three
different
drug
and
other
lollapalooza
effect
like
the
flight
of
an
airplane
follow
a
similar
pattern
it
be
now
time
to
present
nay
practical
problem
and
here
be
the
problem
it
be
in
atlanta
you
be
brought
along
with
twenty
others
like
you
before
a
rich
and
eccentric
atlanta
citizen
name
glotz
both
you
and
glotz
share
two
characteristic
first
you
routinely
use
in
problem
solve
the
five
helpful
notion
and
second
you
know
all
the
elementary
idea
in
all
the
basic
college
course
as
taught
in
however
all
discoverer
and
all
example
demonstrate
these
elementary
idea
come
from
date
transpose
back
before
neither
you
nor
glotz
know
anything
about
anything
that
have
happen
after
glotz
offer
to
invest
million
yet
take
only
half
the
equity
for
a
glotz
charitable
foundation
in
a
new
corporation
organize
to
go
into
the
non
alcoholic
beverage
business
and
remain
in
that
business
only
forever
glotz
want
to
use
a
name
that
have
somehow
charm
him
coca
cola
the
other
half
of
the
new
corporation
equity
will
go
to
the
man
who
most
plausibly
demonstrates
that
his
business
plan
will
cause
glotz
foundation
to
he
worth
a
trillion
dollar
year
later
in
the
money
of
that
later
time
despite
pay
out
a
large
part
of
its
earnings
each
year
as
a
dividend
this
will
make
the
whole
new
corporation
worth
trillion
even
after
pay
out
many
billion
of
dollar
in
dividend
you
have
fifteen
minute
to
make
your
pitch
what
do
you
say
to
glotz
and
here
be
my
solution
my
pitch
to
glotz
use
only
the
helpful
notion
and
what
every
bright
college
sophomore
should
know
well
glotz
the
big
no
brainer
decision
that
to
simplify
our
problem
should
be
make
first
be
as
follow
first
we
be
never
go
to
create
something
worth
trillion
by
sell
some
generic
beverage
therefore
we
must
make
your
name
coca
cola
into
a
strong
legally
protect
trademark
second
we
can
get
to
trillion
only
by
start
in
atlanta
then
succeed
in
the
rest
of
the
united
state
then
rapidly
succeed
with
our
new
beverage
all
over
the
world
this
will
require
develop
a
product
have
universal
appeal
because
it
harness
powerful
elemental
force
and
the
right
place
to
find
such
powerful
elemental
force
be
in
the
subject
matter
of
elementary
academic
course
we
will
next
use
numerical
fluency
to
ascertain
what
our
target
implies
we
can
guess
reasonably
that
by
there
will
be
about
eight
billion
beverage
consumer
in
the
world
on
average
each
of
these
consumer
will
be
much
more
prosperous
in
real
term
than
the
average
consumer
of
each
consumer
be
compose
mostly
of
water
and
must
ingest
about
ounce
of
water
per
day
this
be
eight
eight
ounce
serving
thus
if
our
new
beverage
and
other
imitative
beverage
in
our
new
market
can
flavor
and
otherwise
improve
only
percent
of
ingest
water
worldwide
and
we
can
occupy
half
of
the
new
world
market
we
can
sell
trillion
eight
ounce
serving
in
and
if
we
can
then
net
four
cent
per
serve
we
will
earn
billion
this
will
be
enough
if
our
business
be
still
grow
at
a
good
rate
to
make
it
easily
worth
two
trillion
dollar
a
big
question
of
course
be
whether
four
cent
per
serve
be
a
reasonable
profit
target
for
and
the
answer
be
yes
if
we
can
create
a
beverage
with
strong
universal
appeal
one
hundred
fifty
year
be
a
long
time
the
dollar
like
the
roman
drachma
will
almost
surely
suffer
monetary
depreciation
concurrently
real
purchasing
power
of
the
average
beverage
consumer
in
the
world
will
go
way
up
his
proclivity
to
inexpensively
improve
his
experience
while
ingest
water
will
go
up
considerably
faster
meanwhile
as
technology
improves
the
cost
of
our
simple
product
in
unit
of
constant
purchasing
power
will
go
clown
all
four
factor
will
work
together
in
favor
of
our
four
cent
per
serve
profit
target
worldwide
beverage
purchasing
power
in
dollar
will
probably
multiply
by
a
factor
of
at
least
forty
over
year
think
in
reverse
this
make
our
profit
per
serve
target
under
condition
a
mere
one
fortieth
of
four
cent
or
one
tenth
of
a
cent
per
serve
this
be
an
easy
to
exceed
target
as
we
start
out
if
our
new
product
have
universal
appeal
that
decide
we
must
next
solve
the
problem
of
invention
to
create
universal
appeal
there
be
two
intertwine
challenge
of
large
scale
first
over
year
we
must
cause
a
new
beverage
market
to
assimilate
about
one
fourth
of
the
world
water
ingestion
second
we
must
so
operate
that
half
the
new
market
be
ours
while
all
our
competitor
combine
be
left
to
share
the
remain
half
these
result
be
lollapalooza
result
accordingly
we
must
attack
our
problem
by
cause
every
favorable
factor
we
can
think
of
to
work
for
us
plainly
only
a
powerful
combination
of
many
factor
be
likely
to
cause
the
lollapalooza
consequence
we
desire
fortunately
the
solution
to
these
intertwine
problem
turn
out
to
be
fairly
easy
if
one
have
stayed
awake
in
all
the
freshman
course
let
us
start
by
explore
the
consequence
of
our
simplify
no
brainer
decision
that
we
must
rely
on
a
strong
trademark
this
conclusion
automatically
lead
to
an
understand
of
the
essence
of
our
business
in
proper
elementary
academic
term
we
can
see
from
the
introductory
course
in
psychology
that
in
essence
we
be
go
into
the
business
of
create
and
maintain
condition
reflex
the
cocacola
trade
name
and
trade
dress
will
act
as
the
stimulus
and
the
purchase
and
ingestion
of
our
beverage
will
be
the
desire
response
and
how
do
one
create
and
maintain
condition
reflex
well
the
psychology
text
give
two
answer
by
operant
conditioning
and
by
classical
conditioning
often
call
pavlovian
conditioning
to
honor
the
great
russian
scientist
and
since
we
want
a
lollapalooza
result
we
must
use
both
conditioning
technique
and
all
we
can
invent
to
enhance
effect
from
each
technique
the
operant

part
of
our
problem
be
easy
to
solve
we
need
only
maximize

of
our

ingestion
and
minimize
possibility
that
desire

by

there

we
will
naturally

in
all
the
category
to
start
out
it
be
easy
to
decide
to
design
our

there
be
much
less
opportunity

moreover
with

and
the
reverse
be
not
true
it
be
also
easy
to
decide
to
include
both
sugar
and

after
all
tea
coffee
and
lemonade
be
already
widely
consume
and
it
be
also
clear
that
we
must
be
fanatic
about
determine
through
trial
and
error
flavor
and
other
characteristic
that
will
maximize
human
pleasure
while
take
in
the
sugar

we
will
provide
and
to
counteract
possibility
that

us
will
be
extinguish
by

employ
compete

there
be
also
an
obvious
answer
we
will
make
it
a
permanent
obsession
in
our
company
that
our
beverage
as
fast
as
practicable
will
at
all
time
be
available
everywhere
throughout
the
world
after
all
a
compete

if
it
be
never
try
ca
not
act
as
a
reward
create
a
conflict
habit
every
spouse
know
that
we
must
next
consider
the
pavlovian
conditioning
we
must
also
use
in
pavlovian
conditioning
powerful
effect
come
from
mere
association
the
neural
system
of
pavlov
dog
cause
it
to
salivate
at
the
bell
it
ca
not
cat
and
the
brain
of
man
yearns
for
the
type
of
beverage
held
by
the
pretty
woman
he
ca
not
have
and
so
glotz
we
must
use
every
sort
of
decent
honorable
pavlovian
conditioning
we
can
think
of
for
as
long
as
we
be
in
business
our
beverage
and
its
promotion
must
be
associate
in
consumer
mind
with
all
other
thing
consumer
like
or
admire
such
extensive
pavlovian
conditioning
will
cost
a
lot
of
money
particularly
for
advertising
we
will
spend
big
money
as
far
ahead
as
we
can
imagine
but
the
money
will
be
effectively
spent
as
we
expand
fast
in
our
new
beverage
market
our
competitor
will
face
gross
disadvantage
of
scale
in
buying
advertising
to
create
the
pavlovian
conditioning
they
need
and
this
outcome
along
with
other
volume
creates
power
effect
should
help
us
gain
and
hold
at
least
percent
of
the
new
market
everywhere
indeed
provide
buyer
be
scatter
our
high
volume
will
give
us
very
extreme
cost
advantage
in
distribution
moreover
pavlovian
effect
from
mere
association
will
help
us
choose
the
flavor
texture
and
color
of
our
new
beverage
consider
pavlovian
effect
we
will
have
wisely
chosen
the
exotic
and
expensivesounding
name
coca
cola
instead
of
a
pedestrian
name
like
glotz
sugar
caffeinated
water
for
similar
pavlovian
reason
it
will
be
wise
to
have
our
beverage
look
pretty
much
like
wine
instead
of
sugar
water
and
so
we
will
artificially
color
our
beverage
if
it
come
out
clear
and
we
will
carbonate
our
water
make
our
product
seem
like
champagne
or
some
other
expensive
beverage
while
also
make
its
flavor
well
and
imitation
harder
to
arrange
for
compete
product
and
because
we
be
go
to
attach
so
many
expensive
psychological
effect
to
our
flavor
that
flavor
should
he
different
from
any
other
standard
flavor
so
that
we
maximize
difficulty
for
competitor
and
give
no
accidental
same
flavor
benefit
to
any
exist
product
what
else
from
the
psychology
textbook
can
help
our
new
business
well
there
be
that
powerful
monkey
see
monkey
do
aspect
of
human
nature
that
psychologist
often
call
social
proof
social
proof
imitative
consumption
trigger
by
mere
sight
of
consumption
will
not
only
help
induce
trial
of
our
beverage
it
will
also
bolster
perceive
reward
from
consumption
we
will
always
take
this
powerful
social
proof
factor
into
account
as
we
design
advertising
and
sale
promotion
and
as
we
forego
present
profit
to
enhance
present
and
future
consumption
more
than
with
most
other
product
increase
sell
power
will
come
from
each
increase
in
sale
we
can
now
see
glotz
that
by
combine
much
pavlovian
conditioning
powerful
social
proof
effect
and
a
wonderful
taste
energy
give
stimulate
and
desirably
cold
beverage
that
cause
much
operant
conditioning
we
be
go
to
get
sale
that
speed
up
for
a
long
time
by
reason
of
the
huge
mixture
of
factor
we
have
chosen
therefore
we
be
go
to
start
something
like
an
autocatalytic
reaction
in
chemistry
precisely
the
sort
of
multi
factor
trigger
lollapalooza
effect
we
need
the
logistics
and
the
distribution
strategy
of
our
business
will
be
simple
there
be
only
two
practical
way
to
sell
our
beverage
as
a
syrup
to
fountain
and
restaurant
and
as
a
complete
carbonatedwater
product
in
container
want
lollapalooza
result
we
will
naturally
do
it
both
way
and
want
huge
pavlovian
and
social
proof
effect
we
will
always
spend
on
advertising
and
sale
promotion
per
serve
over
percent
of
the
fountain
price
for
syrup
need
to
make
the
serve
a
few
syrup
make
plant
can
serve
the
world
however
to
avoid
needle
shipping
of
mere
space
and
water
we
will
need
many
bottle
plant
scatter
over
the
world
we
will
maximize
profit
if
like
early
general
electric
with
light
bulb
we
always
set
the
first
sale
price
either
for
fountain
syrup
or
for
any
container
of
our
complete
product
the
best
way
to
arrange
this
desirable
profit
maximize
control
be
to
make
any
independent
bottler
we
need
a
subcontractor
not
a
vendee
of
syrup
and
certainly
not
a
vendee
of
syrup
under
a
perpetual
franchise
specify
a
syrup
price
frozen
forever
at
its
start
level
be
unable
to
get
a
patent
or
copyright
on
our
super
important
flavor
we
will
work
obsessively
to
keep
our
formula
secret
we
will
make
a
big
hoopla
over
our
secrecy
which
will
enhance
pavlovian
effect
eventually
food
chemical
engineering
will
advance
so
that
our
flavor
can
be
copy
with
near
exactitude
but
by
that
time
we
will
be
so
far
ahead
with
such
strong
trademark
and
complete
always
available
worldwide
distribution
that
good
flavor
copying
wo
not
bar
us
from
our
objective
moreover
the
advance
in
food
chemistry
that
help
competitor
will
almost
surely
be
accompany
by
technological
advance
that
will
help
us
include
refrigeration
well
transportation
and
for
dieter
ability
to
insert
a
sugar
taste
without
insert
sugar
calorie
also
there
will
be
related
beverage
opportunity
we
will
seize
this
brings
us
to
a
final
reality
check
for
our
business
plan
we
will
once
more
think
in
reverse
like
jacobi
what
must
we
avoid
because
we
do
not
want
it
four
answer
seem
clear
first
we
must
avoid
the
protective
cloy
stop
consumption
effect
of
aftertaste
that
be
a
standard
part
of
physiology
developed
through
darwinian
evolution
to
enhance
the
replication
of
man
gene
by
force
a
generally
helpful
moderation
on
the
gene
carrier
to
serve
our
end
on
hot
day
a
consumer
must
be
able
to
drink
container
after
container
of
our
product
with
almost
no
impediment
from
aftertaste
we
will
find
a
wonderful
no
aftertaste
flavor
by
trial
and
error
and
will
thereby
solve
this
problem
second
we
must
avoid
ever
lose
even
half
of
our
powerful
trademarked
name
it
will
cost
us
mightily
for
instance
if
our
sloppiness
should
ever
allow
sale
of
any
other
kind
of
cola
for
instance
a
peppy
cola
if
there
be
ever
a
peppy
cola
we
will
be
the
proprietor
of
the
brand
third
with
so
much
success
come
we
must
avoid
bad
effect
from
envy
give
a
prominent
place
in
the
ten
commandment
because
envy
be
so
much
a
part
of
human
nature
the
best
way
to
avoid
envy
recognize
by
aristotle
be
to
plainly
deserve
the
success
we
get
we
will
be
fanatic
about
product
quality
quality
of
product
presentation
and
reasonableness
of
price
consider
the
harmless
pleasure
we
will
provide
fourth
after
our
trademarked
flavor
dominates
our
new
market
we
must
avoid
make
any
huge
and
sudden
change
in
our
flavor
even
if
a
new
flavor
performs
well
in
blind
taste
test
change
to
that
new
flavor
would
be
a
foolish
thing
to
do
this
follow
because
under
such
condition
our
old
flavor
will
be
so
entrench
in
consumer
preference
by
psychological
effect
that
a
big
flavor
change
would
do
us
little
good
and
it
would
do
immense
harm
by
trigger
in
consumer
the
standard
deprival
super
reaction
syndrome
that
make
take
aways
so
hard
to
get
in
any
type
of
negotiation
and
help
make
most
gambler
so
irrational
moreover
such
a
large
flavor
change
would
allow
a
competitor
by
copying
our
old
flavor
to
take
advantage
of
both
the
hostile
consumer
super
reaction
to
deprival
and
the
huge
love
of
our
original
flavor
create
by
our
previous
work
well
that
be
my
solution
to
my
own
problem
of
turn
million
into
trillion
even
after
pay
out
billion
of
dollar
in
dividend
i
think
it
would
have
won
with
glotz
in
and
should
convince
you
more
than
you
expect
at
the
outset
after
all
the
correct
strategy
be
clear
after
be
related
to
elementary
academic
idea
brought
into
play
by
the
helpful
notion
how
consistent
be
my
solution
with
the
history
of
the
real
coca
cola
company
well
as
late
as
twelve
year
after
the
fictional
glotz
be
to
start
vigorously
with
million
the
real
coca
cola
company
have
a
net
worth
under
thousand
and
earnings
of
about
zero
and
thereafter
the
real
coca
cola
company
do
lose
half
its
trademark
and
do
grant
perpetual
bottle
franchise
at
fix
syrup
price
and
some
of
the
bottler
be
not
very
effective
and
could
not
easily
be
change
and
the
real
coca
cola
company
with
this
system
do
lose
much
pricing
control
that
would
have
improve
result
have
it
be
retain
yet
even
so
the
real
coca
cola
company
follow
so
much
of
the
plan
give
to
glotz
that
it
be
now
worth
about
billion
and
will
have
to
increase
its
value
at
only
percent
per
year
until
to
reach
a
value
of
trillion
and
it
can
hit
an
annual
physical
volume
target
of
trillion
serving
if
serving
grow
until
at
only
percent
per
year
a
result
consistent
with
much
past
experience
and
leave
plenty
of
plain
water
ingestion
for
coca
cola
to
replace
after
so
i
would
guess
that
the
fictional
glotz
start
earlier
and
strong
and
avoid
the
bad
error
would
have
easily
hit
his
trillion
target
and
he
would
have
do
it
well
before
this
brings
me
at
last
to
the
main
purpose
of
my
talk
large
educational
implication
exist
if
my
answer
to
glotz
problem
be
roughly
right
and
you
make
one
more
assumption
i
believe
true
that
most
ph
d
educator
even
psychology
professor
and
business
school
dean
would
not
have
give
the
same
simple
answer
i
do
and
if
i
be
right
in
these
two
way
this
would
indicate
that
our
civilization
now
keep
in
place
a
great
many
educator
who
ca
not
satisfactorily
explain
coca
cola
even
in
retrospect
and
even
after
watch
it
closely
all
their
life
this
be
not
a
satisfactory
state
of
affair
moreover
and
this
result
be
even
more
extreme
the
brilliant
and
effective
executive
who
surround
by
business
school
and
law
school
graduate
have
run
the
coca
cola
company
with
glorious
success
in
recent
year
also
do
not
understand
elementary
psychology
well
enough
to
predict
and
avoid
the
new
coke
fiasco
which
dangerously
threaten
their
company
that
people
so
talented
surround
by
professional
adviser
from
the
best
university
should
thus
demonstrate
a
huge
gap
in
their
education
be
also
not
a
satisfactory
state
of
affair
such
extreme
ignorance
in
both
the
high
reach
of
academia
and
the
high
reach
of
business
be
a
lollapalooza
effect
of
a
negative
sort
demonstrate
grave
defect
in
academia
because
the
bad
effect
be
a
lollapalooza
we
should
expect
to
find
intertwine
multiple
academic
cause
i
suspect
at
least
two
such
cause
first
academic
psychology
while
it
be
admirable
and
useful
as
a
list
of
ingenious
and
important
experiment
lack
intradisciplinary
synthesis
in
particular
not
enough
attention
be
give
to
lollapalooza
effect
come
from
combination
of
psychological
tendency
this
creates
a
situation
remind
one
of
a
rustic
teacher
who
try
to
simplify
school
work
by
round
pi
to
an
even
three
and
it
violates
einstein
injunction
that
everything
should
be
make
as
simple
as
possible
but
no
more
simple
in
general
psychology
be
laid
out
and
misunderstood
as
electromag
netism
would
now
be
misunderstood
if
physic
have
produce
many
brilliant
experimenter
like
michael
faraday
and
no
grand
synthesizer
like
james
clerk
maxwell
and
second
there
be
a
truly
horrible
lack
of
synthesis
blending
psychology
and
other
academic
subject
but
only
an
interdisciplinary
approach
will
correctly
deal
with
reality
in
academia
as
with
the
coca
cola
company
in
short
academic
psychology
department
be
immensely
more
important
and
useful
than
other
academic
department
think
and
at
the
same
time
the
psychology
department
be
immensely
bad
than
most
of
their
inhabitant
think
it
be
of
course
normal
for
self
appraisal
to
be
more
positive
than
external
appraisal
indeed
a
problem
of
this
sort
may
have
give
you
your
speaker
today
but
the
size
of
this
psychology
department
gap
be
preposterously
large
in
fact
the
gap
be
so
enormous
that
one
very
eminent
university
chicago
simply
abolish
its
psychology
department
perhaps
with
an
undisclosed
hope
of
later
create
a
well
version
in
such
a
state
of
affair
many
year
ago
and
with
much
that
be
plainly
wrong
already
present
the
new
coke
fiasco
occur
wherein
coke
executive
come
to
the
brink
of
destroy
the
most
valuable
trademark
in
the
world
the
academically
correct
reaction
to
this
immense
and
well
publicize
fiasco
would
have
be
the
sort
of
reaction
boeing
would
display
if
three
of
its
new
airplane
crashed
in
a
single
week
after
all
product
integrity
be
involve
in
each
case
and
the
plain
educational
failure
be
immense
but
almost
no
such
responsible
boeing
like
reaction
have
come
from
academia
instead
academia
by
and
large
continue
in
its
balkanize
way
to
tolerate
psychology
professor
who
mi
teach
psychology
nonpsychology
professor
who
fail
to
consider
psychological
effect
obviously
crucial
in
their
subject
matter
and
professional
school
that
carefully
preserve
psychological
ignorance
come
in
with
each
enter
class
and
be
proud
of
their
inadequacy
even
though
this
regrettable
blindness
and
lassitude
be
now
the
normal
academic
result
be
there
exception
provide
hope
that
disgraceful
shortcoming
of
the
educational
establishment
will
eventually
be
correct
here
my
answer
be
a
very
optimistic
yes
for
instance
consider
the
recent
behavior
of
the
economics
department
of
the
university
of
chicago
over
the
last
decade
this
department
have
enjoy
a
near
monopoly
of
the
nobel
prize
in
economics
largely
by
get
good
prediction
out
of
free
market
model
postulate
man
rationality
and
what
be
the
reaction
of
this
department
after
win
so
steadily
with
its
rational
man
approach
well
it
have
just
invite
into
a
precious
slot
amid
its
company
of
great
a
wise
and
witty
cornell
economist
richard
thaler
and
it
have
do
this
because
thaler
poke
fun
at
much
that
be
holy
at
the
university
of
chicago
indeed
thaler
believe
with
me
that
people
be
often
massively
irrational
in
way
predict
by
psychology
that
must
be
take
into
account
in
microeconomics
in
so
behaving
the
university
of
chicago
be
imitate
darwin
who
spent
much
of
his
long
life
think
in
reverse
as
he
try
to
disprove
his
own
hardest
won
and
best
love
idea
and
so
long
as
there
be
part
of
academia
that
keep
alive
its
best
value
by
think
in
reverse
like
darwin
we
can
confidently
expect
that
silly
educational
practice
will
eventually
be
replace
by
well
one
exactly
as
carl
jacobi
might
have
predict
this
will
happen
because
the
darwinian
approach
with
its
habitual
objectivity
take
on
as
a
sort
of
hair
shirt
be
a
mighty
approach
indeed
no
less
a
figure
than
einstein
say
that
one
of
the
four
cause
of
his
achievement
be
self
criticism
rapking
right
up
there
alongside
curiosity
concentration
and
perseverance
and
to
far
appreciate
the
power
of
self
criticism
consider
where
lie
the
grave
of
that
very
ungifted
undergraduate
charles
darwin
it
be
in
westminister
abbey
right
next
to
the
headstone
of
isaac
newton
perhaps
the
most
gift
student
who
ever
live
honor
on
that
headstone
in
five
latin
word
constitute
the
most
eloquent
praise
in
all
graveyard
print
hic
iacet
quod
iuortale
fuet
here
lie
the
remains
of
what
be
mortal
a
civilization
that
so
place
a
dead
darwin
will
eventually
develop
and
integrate
psychology
in
a
proper
and
practical
fashion
that
greatly
increase
skill
of
all
sort
but
all
of
us
who
have
dollop
of
power
and
see
the
light
should
help
the
process
along
there
be
a
lot
at
stake
if
in
many
high
place
a
universal
product
as
successful
as
coca
cola
be
not
properly
understood
and
explain
it
ca
not
bode
well
for
our
competency
in
deal
with
much
else
that
be
important
of
course
those
of
you
with
percent
of
net
worth
in
coca
cola
stock
occur
because
you
try
to
so
invest
percent
after
think
like
i
do
in
make
my
pitch
to
glotz
can
ignore
my
message
about
psychology
as
too
elementary
for
useful
transmission
to
you
but
i
be
not
so
sure
that
this
reaction
be
wise
for
the
