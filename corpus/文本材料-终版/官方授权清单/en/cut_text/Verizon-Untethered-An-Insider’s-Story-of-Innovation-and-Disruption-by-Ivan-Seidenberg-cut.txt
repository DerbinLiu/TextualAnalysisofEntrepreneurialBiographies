preface
when
i
retire
in
as
chairman
and
ceo
of
verizon
communication
it
be
with
a
great
sense
of
appreciation
and
indebtedness
to
the
company
and
all
of
the
people
i
work
with
and
met
along
the
way
my
year
career
in
telecommunication
start
in
the
bell
system
and
include
year
spent
as
a
senior
executive
of
verizon
and
its
baby
bell
predecessor
be
an
extraordinary
journey
many
of
my
friend
my
wife
and
my
colleague
urge
me
to
consider
write
a
book
or
memoir
of
my
career
initially
i
could
never
find
the
right
balance
to
capture
the
big
picture
the
view
of
my
career
and
that
of
our
leadership
team
as
others
might
have
see
it
as
well
as
pay
proper
respect
to
the
company
itself
besides
i
knew
i
could
never
have
remember
enough
to
do
justice
to
all
of
the
people
involve
over
the
year
meanwhile
i
read
every
ceo
biography
i
could
find
but
never
found
the
right
approach
for
me
my
colleague
continued
to
encourage
me
to
think
about
it
when
i
be
ceo
of
verizon
i
serve
on
the
board
of
other
organization
and
continue
to
do
so
in
retirement
i
learn
during
one
such
board
meeting
that
the
company
have
start
a
project
to
record
and
tell
its
history
the
agency
it
retain
to
help
it
capture
its
heritage
and
put
it
to
work
be
the
history
factory
i
immediately
contact
the
history
factory
to
find
out
more
about
the
company
and
its
work
it
be
a
terrific
match
and
after
a
few
conversation
we
be
develop
a
plan
for
tell
the
verizon
story
the
idea
be
for
the
history
factory
to
conduct
oral
history
interview
with
to
senior
executive
include
verizon
director
to
capture
their
experience
through
the
year
with
that
information
we
would
build
a
baseline
framework
that
would
tell
verizon
s
history
through
a
professional
storyteller
without
my
thumb
on
the
scale
my
role
would
be
limited
to
monitoring
and
provide
direction
for
accuracy
and
for
those
part
of
our
history
on
which
i
have
a
unique
perspective
independent
of
this
process
i
have
be
fortunate
to
have
have
a
year
relationship
with
global
business
consultant
and
icon
ram
charan
he
have
be
a
mentor
teacher
critic
and
friend
we
also
discuss
the
idea
of
a
book
or
perhaps
something
less
ambitious
such
as
a
few
article
touch
on
particular
area
of
strategy
governance
succession
and
the
culture
of
organization
ram
and
i
met
or
spoke
for
almost
three
year
about
twice
a
month
to
see
if
there
be
anything
of
value
to
be
learn
from
my
experience
at
verizon
and
before
then
we
get
lucky
i
told
ram
about
the
history
factory
and
its
approach
and
the
idea
of
collaborate
with
a
professional
storyteller
ram
conclude
that
that
combination
and
the
original
research
from
specific
interview
with
to
executive
and
board
member
would
be
a
novel
approach
to
convey
the
verizon
story
to
a
broader
audience
after
a
few
more
month
of
thought
and
some
conversation
with
key
people
i
conclude
that
we
be
create
something
that
would
pas
my
internal
test
create
a
history
of
the
journey
capture
the
view
of
many
different
people
provide
a
platform
for
my
commentary
and
perspective
when
need
honor
the
people
who
built
the
company
and
offer
some
lesson
that
might
be
of
use
to
others
we
be
get
there
one
last
preparatory
step
be
to
contact
my
successor
at
verizon
and
close
friend
lowell
mcadam
and
sound
him
out
on
the
project
he
be
terrific
have
be
a
very
key
part
of
my
journey
he
be
quick
to
encourage
me
to
consider
the
approach
and
indicate
he
would
enthusiastically
support
the
effort
and
even
participate
in
the
interview
process
so
here
we
be
now
we
have
a
finish
product
from
preeminent
professional
help
us
tell
this
remarkable
journey
of
so
many
people
who
have
a
hand
in
building
verizon
i
be
delighted
and
proud
to
serve
as
the
village
guide
and
archivist
in
help
to
make
this
all
work
and
finally
after
all
of
the
interview
we
settle
on
a
title
that
reflect
dozen
of
conversation
in
strategy
meeting
and
board
presentation
in
which
we
be
try
to
untether
verizon
from
its
past
but
naturally
build
on
the
foundation
of
that
very
history
untethered
remarkably
capture
in
one
word
our
life
s
work
to
remake
verizon
and
place
it
in
the
middle
of
this
new
world
with
so
much
excitement
and
potential
for
our
customer
employee
and
shareowner
ivan
g
seidenberg
i
could
not
have
succeed
in
my
career
without
the
unceasing
support
of
my
wife
and
child
phyllis
and
i
want
one
more
opportunity
to
thank
the
verizon
family
during
my
career
there
be
literally
thousand
of
employee
who
offer
encouragement
and
support
their
hard
work
and
commitment
to
our
business
will
always
be
a
great
source
of
pride
and
appreciation

will
donate

from
the

of
this

to
the

for
the

or
so
i
thought
at
first
then
i
get
to
know
the
team
lead
ultimately
by
ivan

and
his
successor

who
transform
and
continue
to
transform

the

time
and
again
the
unconventional
route
to
success

by
the

left
me
nod
my
head
in
appreciation
and
sometimes
in
wonder
i
have
reference

verizon
team
in
several
article
on
leadership
and
corporate
succession
over
the
year
even
so
i

of
my
work

around

over
decade
i
have
be

those

observation
of

its
leadership
team
especially
frank
dialogue
with
leader
behind
close
door
the
verizon
leadership
team
stand
apart
from
most
leadership
team
today
in
their
willingness
repeatedly
to
put
the
enterprise
before
the
individual
at
first
blush
this
might
look
like
a
hopelessly
old
fashion
notion
in
the
age
of
the
selfie
yet
i
would
argue
this
be
a
trait
that
future
leader
and
board
of
director
across
industry
would
do
well
to
understand
and
embrace

once
but
twice
in
the
service
of
company
shareholder
and
employee
subordinate
himself

put
off
take
sole
leadership
of
the
company
to
advance
the
enterprise
s
odds
of
success
and
many
others
in
this
story
exhibit
the
same
trait
to
help
build
this
industry
lead
enterprise
they
understood
that
the
risk
of
not
act
and
thereby
destroy
value
during
a
period
of
accelerate
technological
change
and
industry
consolidation
a
situation
face
by
leadership
team
around
the
world
today
be
much
great
than
the
risk
of
step
in
as
no
or
co
ceo
in
my
year
of
experience
it
be
a
rare
leadership
team
that
will
subordinate
itself
for
the
benefit
of
the
industry
customer
and
the
company

principle
that
the

what

me
a
lot
about
how
to
conduct
myself
say
seidenberg
how
to
accept
criticism
how
to
give
criticism
i
wasn
t
really
good
at
that
you
know
because
when
you
grow
up
in
the
bronx
you
argue
and
sometimes
you
just
fight
an
extend

him
from
the

back
in

a
lifelong
appreciation
for
the

also
wasn

willing
to
admit
that

with
all
of
its
unique
characteristic
be
an
excuse

of

in
the

make
an
impression
wherever
he
go
the
two
of

drove
around

torn
south

at
length
before
find
an
all
night
diner
seidenberg
learn
later
that
the
crew
have
give
him
particularly
detailed
request
as
a
way
of
test
the
newbie
before
he
could
start
reading
down
the

list
ollie
reach
over
with
a

as
big
as

twelve
coffee
with

the

as
far
as
ollie
be
concerned
request
customize
carving
for
each

order
would
waste

they
have
work
to
do
the

berate
seidenberg
nonstop
for
botching
their
dinner
order
be
this
what
they
be
teach
in
the
army
these
day
he
shrug
in
fact
his
sergeant
major
have
demonstrate
the
importance
of
be
willing
to
take
one
for
the
team
when
one
worker
ask
seidenberg
what
happen
he
say
ham
and
cheese
be
all
they
have
the
next
morning
his
foreman
take
him
aside
seidenberg
be
expect
another
dress
down
instead
the

say
you
do
good
last
night
seidenberg
ask
what
he
meant
you
didn
t
turn
in
ollie
seidenberg
return
to
the
bronx
garage
where
his

company
career
have
start
year
later
as

near
to
say
goodbye
to
those
who

still
there
he
be
present
with
a
plaque
reading
bronx
boy
do
good
which
remains
one
of
his
most
cherished
gift
i
never
accepted
this
idea
that
new
york
be
too
complicate
too
noisy
too
rude
too
many
union
too
many
regulator
too
much
government
i
just
never
accepted
that
that
be
a
logical
result
of
if
you
live
in
new
york
you
have
to
accept
a
lesser
standard
seidenberg
say
fred
salerno
also
pull
strike
duty
as

even
in
the

neighborhood
even
with
drug
deal
go
down
in
plain
sight
and
evidence
of
abject
poverty
around
every
corner
people
respect
the
phone
company
personnel
for
the
service
they
offer
and
neither
he
nor
seidenberg
begrudge
anyone
for
exercise
their
right
to
join
a
union
on
the
contrary
organize
labor
be
as
new
york
as
a
bagel
or
a
slice
the
labor
dispute
be
very
indigenous
to
new
york
but
not
just
totally
related
to
the
telephone
company
salerno
say
new
york
be
a
city
of
immigrant
and
the
labor
union
be
need
and
my
father
certainly
and
i
certainly
benefit
by
union
and
if
labor
issue
be
a
new
york
problem
then
salerno
just
like
seidenberg
be
convince
they
could
find
a
new
york
solution
work
separately
the
two
come
to
the
same
conclusion
while
they
held
the
union
member
in
high
regard
they
felt
that
the
union

be

with

dawn
on
him
that

have
die
down
seidenberg

look
at
him
and
shook
his
head
next
time
look
at
the
organization
chart
mci
seidenberg
s
next
assignment
have
him
work
closely
with

yet
again
this

his
work
stem
from
an
fcc
ruling
from

year
after
the

the
wrinkle

that
its

of

to
carry
the

call
the
proposal
won
over
the
fcc
in
part
because
mci
assert
that
its
microwave
only
system
could
undercut

in

result
in
saving
to
its

customer
the
technology
in

s
more
ironic
twist
have
be
developed
by

seidenberg
s
job
be
to

back
into
the

company
grid
if
anything
these
negotiation
make
the
carterfone
certification
wrangle
seem
like
gentlemanly
discussion
even
his
fellow
at
t
staffer
would
joke
about
his
loyalty
they
use
to

ok
he

in
the

shut
up

whose

you
on

m
on
the

while
i
couldn

compete
with
the
big
guy
on
their

i
developed
my
own
space
he
described
himself
as
work
behind
the

pull
the
string
and
learn
how
to
solve

build

from
his
vantage

both
mci
and
at
t
be
take
extreme
position
that
weren

tenable
and
really
weren

in
their
long

interest
or
those
of

they
need
to
find

the
issue

we

seidenberg
would
argue
with
anyone
who
would
listen
the
issue
be
at
t
be
not
go

be
the
only
place
that
you
can
go
get

from
and
you
re
go
to
have
to
accommodate
other
people
his
advice
to
fcc
staff
don
t
accept
mci
s
approach
but
don
t
accept
ours
either
let
s
carve
out
the
middle
the
solution
he
and
others
developed
work
as
well
as
anyone
might
have
expect
give
the
contentious
relationship
among
the
party
but
even
this
be
not
enough
eventually
the
myriad
litigation
brought
by
mci
would
set
the
stage
for
the
private
antitrust
lawsuit
and
the
billion
decision
against
at

in
that
weigh
on
charlie

s
decision
to
propose
that
at
t
divest
itself
of

during
this

salerno

met
for
the

when

special
down
here
name
ivan
seidenberg
salerno
kept
hearing
as
he
make
his
round
so
now
i
m
say
to
myself
it
s
probably
a
good
idea
to
meet
this
guy
the
two
get
together
and
clearly
have
a
similar
view
of
the
phone
company
s
strength
and
challenge
though
they
didn
t
have
any
immediate
project
on
which
to
work
together
it
be
the
begin
of
a
lifelong
special
work
relationship
crucial
connection
with
this
grow
amount
of
regulatory
and
connection
fee
experience
to
his
name
it
be
no
surprise
that
a
few
year
later
seidenberg
be
chosen
to
support
the
divestiture
committee
on
interconnection
charge
that
lead
to
his
face
to
face
meeting
with
at
t
ceo
brown
in
everyone
on
the
committee
carry
out
their
exist
job
and
then
prepared
for
monthly
meeting
around
the
country
with
the
bell
operating
company
president
and
a
group
of
senior
executive
from
at
t

headquarters
it
be
no
surprise
the
interconnection
committee
meeting
process
be
tense
they
be
rewrite
decade
of
history
before
divestiture
seidenberg
say
all
the
revenue
come
in
and
then
we
split
them
up
between
the
long
distance
at
t
and
the
local
company
it
be
call
a
division
of
revenue
process
and
it
be
base
on
formula
and
thing
like
that
but
it
be
wholly
control
by
at
t
after
divestiture
all
of
that
have
to
be
recast
as
tariff
ok
so
we
have
to
write
the
tariff
my
job
be
to
write
the
tariff
so
that
at
t
mci
sprint
and
the
others
knew
what
they
would
pay
to
interconnect
to
get
their
call
complete
into
the
local
operating
company
it
be
exhilarate
work
and
the
highlight
of
the

problem
be
though
that
we

to
because
of

which
say
the

it
s
because

that
the

recently

no
we

no
we

in
long

and
yes
we
can

but
no
we
can
t
process
it
at

not
right
now
those
market
be
where
the
growth
be
there
s
also
a
lot
more
your

could
do
now
if
we
be
able
to
unleash
the

capability
of
the

right
now
you
have
call
wait
abbreviate

forward
but
your

could
be
much
more

the
role
that
staley
and

thought
would

operating
company
leadership
experience
by
move
him
to
the
boston

operating
officer
of
new

the
no

of
the

that
position
would
ve
put
seidenberg
on
the
traditional
operating
company
ladder
to
more
senior
level
management
in
the
future
he
also
would
ve
be
follow
in
the
footstep
of
fred
salerno
who
become
the
first
new
york
telephone
officer
to
move
into
a
senior
leadership
position
at
new
england
telephone
in
in
an
effort
to
break
down
some
of
the
cultural
barrier
separate
the
two
operating
company
rise
through
the

promote

vacate

seidenberg
told
staley
that
he
consider
the
offer
a
great
honor
but
he
have
a
counterproposal
nynex
have
several
officer
with
more
operating
experience
who
be
well
qualify
for
the
new
england
post
rather
than
send
him
on
the
same
path
seidenberg
offer
why
not
put
him
in
charge
of
find
a
way
to
put
a
new
wing
on
the
building
seidenberg
want
to
oversee
the
unregulated
business
he
told
staley
that
he
understood
that
take
this
path
might
limit
his
chance
for
promotion
to
the
top
echelon
of
the
company
but
he
be
willing
to
take
that
risk
staley
didn
t
respond
immediately
a
few
month
later
staley
told
seidenberg
that
he
have
a
new
job
for
him
seidenberg
ask
if
a
relocation
to
new
england
be
pending
but
that
wasn
t
the
plan
staley
explain
that
he
be
now
in
charge
of
all
the
unregulated
business
just
as
he
have
request
in
addition
to
the
title
of
senior
vice
president
which
he
be
give
in
july
seidenberg
say
i
have
an
indescribable
title
that
include
mobile
international
software
company
and
a
real
estate
business
seidenberg
s
business
card
should
have
read
be
careful
what
you
ask
for
as
he
recall
i
knew
nothing
about
any
of
this
and
the
combination
of
all
these
activity
be
that
they
be
lose
a
lot
of
money
lesson
that
would
serve
him
well
in
year
to
come
include
the
in
and
out
of
merger
and
acquisition
manage
a
profit
and
loss
p
l
for

business
line
create
value
for
and
deal
with
shareholder
and
negotiate
commercial
deal
across
discipline
accord
to
seidenberg
we
bought
a
few
thing
expand
a
bit
more
in
asia
but
sell
more
than
we
bought
and
generally
improve
the
overall
bottom
line
even
though
we
be
still
not
profitable
the
key
lesson
for
me
be
that
broad
scale
diversification
be
hard
seidenberg
say
it
be
best
to
manage
what
you
know
but
there
clearly
be
a
value
in
integrate
new
skill
into
your
business
we
also
try
to
build
out
our
mobile
business
but
have
only
limited
success
during
this
period
just
listen
to
them
after
a
few

in

the

even

the

he
have

anton
campanella
bell
atlantic
president
offer
strigl
the
chance
to
run
the
small
wireless

he
wasn
t
sure
strigl
would
want
to
make
the
change
but
strigl
jumped
at
the
chance
strigl
start
with
new
york
telephone
in
buffalo
new
york
in
after
a
stint
in
the
army
in
light
of
the
fact
that
his
father
have
twice
declare
bankruptcy
strigl
be
attract
to
the
phone
company
s
job
security
and
service
ethic
but
be
frustrate
with
the
bureaucracy
and
bureaucratic
think
later
he
move
to
new
york
city
for
a
position
with
parent
at
t
and
then
move
into
sale
with
at
t
in
morristown
new

he
left
the
parent
company
for
a
sizable
promotion
general
manager
of
sale
and
marketing
for
wisconsin
telephone
drive
test
wireless
to
test
the
quality
of
their
rapidly
expand
wireless
network
bell
atlantic
mobile
cto
dick
lynch
and
his
team
incrementally
developed
what
become
know
as
drive
test
we
have
a
couple
of
guy
who
be
pretty
good
at
computer
control
test
and
we
actually
take
a
vehicle
a
station
wagon
and
we
put
into
it
a
computer
and
we
put
in
a
bunch
of
phone
lynch
say
they
start
test
their
own
wireless
network
in
the
philadelphia
area
and
quickly
determine
that
they
be
not
alone
it
wasn
t
too
long
after
that
before
i
realize
that
we
have
competition
here
this
isn
t
the
bell
system
anymore
there
s
somebody
out
there
with
this
compete
with
us
in
fact
the
independent
competitor
metro
phone
base
in
philadelphia
be
building
out
its
system
faster
than
bell
atlantic
mobile
be
so
lynch
decide
his
team
would
measure
the
quality
of
their
rival
s
service
as
well
as
their
own
what
we
end
up
do
be
create
a
very
objective
methodical
process
and
equipment
set
for
go
out
and
continually
measure
not
only
our
improvement
from
month
to
month
but
our
competitor
s
improvement
from
month
to
month
and
our
comparison
between
ourselves
and
our
competitor
at
any
give
geographic
point
i
think
that
s
one
of
the
key
point
because
once
we
begin
do
that
it
really
didn
t
take
more
than
a
year
year
and
a
half
before
our
network
in
every
geography
we
serve
be
well
than
our
competitor
that
early
effort
at
network
test
help
identify
the
quality
of
the
wireless
network
as
a
key
competitive
differentiator
for
bell
atlantic
mobile
within
a
few
year
the
station
wagon
would
be
use
as
part
of
the
wireless
business
public
relation
effort
and
appear
in
numerous
article
and
local
tv
segment
in
the
early
s
that
be
just
a
hint
of
the
concept
s
potential
in
the
follow
decade
the
idea
of
test
the
quality
of
the
network
would
evolve
into
the
single
most
memorable
ad
campaign
in
the
history
of
wireless
one
that
customer
would
hear
loud
and
clear
as
divestiture
loom
strigl
like
cullen
babbio
seidenberg
and
many
next
generation

leader
be
caught
in
the
talent
tug
of
war
that
precede
the
january
breakup
of
the

at
t
want
him
back
but
he
stayed
in
the
midwest
and
become
a
manager
for
regional
bell
ameritech
then
in

howard

on

quickly
realize

would
several
year
later
that
the

more
on

his

seidenberg
report
directly
to

he
thought
he
should
offer
to
step
aside
as
well
so
ferguson
could
put
a
team
of
his
own
choose
in
place
when
seidenberg
met
with

the

not
office
politics
he
kick
me
out

and
say
he
would
decide
when
it
be
time
for
me
to
leave
seidenberg
say
it
be
the
first
of
many
time
that
ferguson
would
impart
his
no
nonsense
midwestern
form
of
leadership
after
one
particularly
contentious
meeting
of
his
leadership
team
ferguson
turn
to
seidenberg
as
they
be
walk
back
to
their
office
and
ask
why
do
people
here
keep
attack
each
other
rather
than
the
problem
that
be
just
one
of
several
bit
of
leadership
wisdom
that
ferguson
share
with
seidenberg
he
understood
that
the
role
of
the
leader
be
to
create
a
vision
for
the
future
seidenberg
say
and
to
act
on
it
every
day
we
have
to
get
well
ferguson
use
to
say
ethical
and
principled
ferguson
built
a
strong
foundation
on
which
seidenberg
would
build
his
own
approach
to
leadership
he
conveyed
a
sense
of
know
when
to
listen
and
when
to
speak
when
to
encourage
and
when
to
deliver
a
sterner
message
he
give
me
great
confidence
seidenberg
say
i
quote
him
endlessly
after
more
than
a
year
of
damage
control
and
get
a
well
understand
of
the
challenge
he
be
face
ferguson
decide
it
be
time
to
shake
thing
up
he
call
salerno
and
seidenberg
into
his
office
in
and
shock
them
both
by
say
he
want
the
two
of
them
to
switch
job
salerno
would
take
over
the
nonregulated
business
and
seidenberg
would
be
put
in
charge
of
the
phone
company
they
would
both
be
vice
chairman
and
by
implication
contender
to
succeed
ferguson
and
both
men
continued
to
work
closely
together
we
never
ever
fix
the
core
the
relatively
strong
economy
of
the

enable
the

as
a
group
to

but
this
economic
boom
masked
a
deeper
disturb
trend
in
telecommunication
the
baby
bell
be
slowly
lose
market
share
and
so
be
at

and
none
of
them
have
yet
developed
a
strategy
for
fix
their
core

it
always
bother
me
that
we
never
have
an
answer
for
loss
of
market
share
during
this
period
seidenberg
say
our
answer
be
well
we
ll
get
into
real

go
international
we
ll
do
this
maybe
wireless

give
us
a
little
bit
we
never

the

of
reduce
the
steady
loss

their

around

for
the
next
three

garage
he
have
not
risen
through
the

any
one
leadership

a

ferguson
be

some
rookie
mistake
on

ahead
about

someday
we

so
they

additional
carrier
in

now
to
their
credit
bell

and
nynex
together
saw
that
as
maybe
not
a
threat
maybe
an
opportunity
they

why
don
t
we
try
to
get

in

outside

ultimately
what

always
understood
the

among

seidenberg
say
they
make
us
buy
spectrum
whenever
it
be
available
most
of
the
time
when
larry
say
you
need
some

that

and
there
be
always
a
lively

at

about
when
we
would
have
enough

the

continue

qualcomm

for
even
if
that
meant

more
time
the

carry
by
analog
system
versus
the
threefold
advantage
provide
by
tdma
it
wasn
t
an
easy
decision
say
bell
atlantic
cto
dick
lynch
who
make
multiple
trip
to
qualcomm
to
gauge
their
progress
in
get
cdma
to
market
and
to
harangue
qualcomm
founder
irwin
jacob
to
move
even
faster
lynch
told
denny
strigl
that
he
be
willing
to
wait
for
the
high
quality
cdma
service
strigl
didn
t
overrule
him
but
he
do
point
out
that
southwestern
bell
which
be
operating
a
cellular
service
in
washington
d
c
be
already
put
in
tdma
and
so
i
then
have
an
additional
piece
of
pressure
on
me
which
be
that
the
competition
be
put
out
digital
before
we
be
lynch
say
southwestern
bell
be
join
in
the
tdma
camp
by
at
t
s
cellular
one
wireless
behemoth
and
the
cellular
battle
line
be
drawn
these
two
gain
a
first
mover
advantage
with
the
launch
of
tdma
as
customer
flock
to
the
first
digital
service
offer
but
the
technology
s
limitation
quickly
caught
up
with
them
say
gte
director
sandy
moose
who
serve
on
a
gte
board
subcommittee
that
study
the
issue
and
come
down
clearly
on
the
side
of
wait
for
cdma
the
urge
to
merge
even
while
the
detail
of
the
bell
atlantic
nynex
cellular
partnership
be
still
be
work
out
in
seidenberg
give
bell
atlantic
s
smith
a
call
in
talk
about
combine
the
two
company
seidenberg
ask
do
you
want
to
start
over
again
he
be
still
convince
that
smith
be
in
no
rush
to
make
a
deal
think
that
bell
atlantic
s
relative
strength
in
wireless
and
its
core
phone
business
would
continue
to
grow
as
time
pass
in
fact
smith
have
put
pursue
a
deal
with
nynex
on
hold
during
this
period
assume
it
would
be
there
for
the
offering
when
he
return
to
the
subject
he
make
the
round
of
other
baby
bell
ceo
to
discus
possible
option
but
nothing
come
of
it
seidenberg
propose
that
they
work
through
a
list
of
secondary
issue
that
need
to
be
decide
in
advance
of
any
potential
combination
of
the
two
baby
bell
they
would
leave
the
potential
deal
breaker
such
as
who
would
be
ceo
where
the
company
would
be
headquarter
and
the
new
company
name
for
later
we
start
to
chip
away
at
thing
we
could
decide
on
so
we
have
this
body
of
issue
we
have
of
them
do
and
they
be
do
seidenberg
s
overarch
concern
be
that
despite

by
both
company
in
the
early
s
neither
bell

about

at

in

in

that
enable
the

to
build

with
others
as
in
the
case
of
bell

nynex
mobile
and
airtouch
and
buy
wireless

outside

the

in

for

in

work
so
well
in

why
not
in
the
heritage
wireline
business
as
well
i
be
convince
that
at
t
bell
atlantic
and
nynex
be
too
constrain
by
the
regulatory
process
seidenberg
say
they
be
try
to
solve
everything
inside
of
the
regulatory
process
and
that
be
a
real
issue
to
me
even
though
i
be
consider
to
be
the
expert
on
that
i
kept
break
the
frame
on
the
regulatory
process
strigl
with
his
experience
in
wireless
lead
him
to
push
back
on
any
suggestion
that
their
activity
be
regulate
far
stiffen
seidenberg
s
anti
regulatory
resolve
seidenberg
even
encourage
tauke
who
dealt
more
closely
than
anyone
with
regulator
to
help
the
company
break
free
of
the
regulatory
mindset
tauke
say
his
perspective
be
be
that
this
be
a
company
that
be
not
focus
on
define
its
own
future
and
he
want
a
culture
where
the
company
be
define
itself
be
create
its
own
future
and
he
want
leader
who
would
think
that
way
bell
atlantic
nynex
merger
all
of
the
baby
bell
have
be
on
cost
cut
path
for
much
of
the
s
in
order
to
improve
their
operating
performance
the
new
wave
of
competition
that
the
act
be
require
them
to
subsidize
in
effect
also
drove
a
new
round
of
budget
cut
in
large
part
due
to
the
act
and
the
unbundling
of
network
and
the
competitor
come
in
and
the
sell
your
network
at
below
cost
i
mean
there
be
no
choice
but
to
cut
expense
tauke
say
one
way
to
slash
cost
in
preparation
for
the
implementation
of
the
act
be
to
pursue
economy
of
scale
in
the
form
of
a
merger
that
brought
smith
and
seidenberg
back
to
the
negotiate
table
smith
say
nynex
become
an
imperative
there
wasn
t
anything
in
europe
that
would
help
us
get
the
scale
and
scope
in
the
world
s
great

in
the
united

on

the

broke
the
story
that
bell
atlantic
nynex
merger
negotiation
have
be
go
on
for
month
that
might
lead
to
the
creation
of
the
second
big
phone
firm
after
at
t
the
article
float
the
logical
leadership
progression
of
smith
initially
serve
as
ceo
of
the
combine
company
seidenberg
would
take
the
helm
a
few
year
later
smith
be
at
the
forefront
of
push
the
industry
s
technology
envelope
but
his
ambitious
reach
for
telecommunication
industry
leadership
have
so
far
exceed
his
grasp
he
have
be
search
for
the
next
big
thing
since
the
collapse
of
the
deal
with
tci
the
journal
article
note
he
s
frustrate
and
there
be
a
perception
that
he
s
not
go
to
go
quietly
into
the
night
when
he
retires
an
unnamed
rival
bell
executive
told
the
journal
still
the
article
quote
an
unnamed
official
as
say
that
the
two
company
be
a
long
long
way
off
from
signing
legal
document
the
merger
talk
stall
in
early
over
numerous
issue
include
leadership
role
but
price
be
also
a
significant
barrier
to
progress
escape
from
new
york
seidenberg
wasn
t
shy
about
point
out
to
ray
smith
that
bell
atlantic
face
its
share
of
hurdle
on
its
path
to
success
at
the
same
time
he
be
honest
with
himself
his
leadership
team
and
his
board
of
director
about
the
no
issue
face
nynex
its
concentration
in
new
york
i
look
at
nynex
which
be
percent
new
york
state
new
england
be
another
percent
and
there
be
another
percent
like
yellow
page
and
stuff
seidenberg
s
conclusion
this
company
can
t
make
it
there
be
no
major
company
on
the
planet
that
have
percent
of
its
earnings
tie
up
in
new
york
state
so
whether
you
look
at
at
t
ibm
american
express
manufacturer
hanover
later
acquire
by
jpmorgan
chase
citigroup
any
of
these
company
they
all
start
in
new
york
and
they
figure
out
a
way
to
be
important
in
new
york
but
new
york
have
to
become
a
small
percentage
of
the
total
i
start
out
with
the
idea
that
the
merger
with
bell
atlantic
immediately
cut
the
percentage
of
the
company
s
earnings
in
new
york
by
half
i
start
from
the
perception
that
if
all
i
do
in
my
career
be
to
do
the
bell
atlantic
merger
and
then
i
be
thrown
off
the
ship
i
will
have
do
step
one
of
what
i
need
to
do
doreen
toben
bell

vice
president

be
a

that
make
a
covert
trip
to
new
york
city
to
review
nynex
s
financials
they
didn
t
like
what
they
found
we
felt
that
they
have
underinvested
their
maintenance
number
be
much
bad
than
bell
atlantic
s
she
say
their
regulatory
be
not
good
from
oversight
and
we
really
saw
a
financial
issue
that
sort
of
feedback
make
it
easy
for
smith
to
decide
he
didn
t
need
to
pay
a
premium
over
nynex
s
share
price
to
seal
a
deal
and
dictate
term
as
the
victor
the
financial
team
s
result
support
something
closer
to
a
merger
of
equal
outcome
which
may
have
lead
smith
to
think
there
be
no
need
to
rush
to
the
altar
meanwhile
nynex

which
appear
to
come
from

or
their
wall
street
banker
about
the

talk
that
typically
make
nynex
appear
as
the
junior
player
in
any
potential
business
combination
the
leak
also
appear
to
bad
mouth
nynex
s
financials
to
drive
down
its

in
the
event
of

even

make
it
clear
to

that
they
be
not

with
all
of

to
every
question
from
institutional
investor
or
security
analyst
about
the
term
of

seidenberg
would
only
respond
with
a
terse
we
do
not
comment
on
rumor
and
speculation
he
would
complain

get
in
the
way
of
the
right

he
always
put
the

seidenberg
always
take
a
long

view
of
what
be
need
to
transform
nynex
into
a
telecommunication
company
with
a

he
be
willing
temporarily
to
step
aside
as
ceo
and
cede
that
role
to
the
senior
smith
seidenberg
in
turn
would
be
the
company
s
sole
chief
operating
officer
he
want
two
thing
in
return
first
he
want
a
date
in
write
by
which
smith
would
retire
and
he
would
step
in
as

seidenberg
demand
that
his
dismissal
require
a
supermajority
vote
of
the
director
of
the
new
company
whose
board
would
include
equal
representation
from
nynex
and
bell
atlantic
smith
initially
balk
at
these
condition
which
seidenberg
acknowledge
be
not
typical
merger
protocol
seidenberg
press
his
case
you
re
in
charge
i
work
for
you
but
there
s
get
to
be
a
certain
date
at
which
transition
occurs
he
say
to
smith
who
point
out
that
under
corporate
law
there
be
no
guarantee
that
the
board
would
feel
obligate
to
honor
that
agreement
that
s
absolutely
right
seidenberg
say
but
the
reason
for
the
supermajority
vote
be
if
the
board
change
its
mind
i
want
to
know
that
it
be
the
entire
board
and
the
nynex
director
who
agree
to
make
a
change
if
they
do
ray
i
m
ok
smith
answer
that
could
happen
ivan
which
seidenberg
take
as
a
not
so
veil
threat
that
smith
and
his
team
would
consider
the
possibility
of
promote
this
option
seidenberg
respond
ray
i
m
ok
with
that
as
long
as
you
can
t
fire
me
without
a
full
and
fair
discussion
with
the
board
i
m
fine
some
industry
insider
speculate
that
one
reason
smith
and
his
team
weren
t
willing
to
pay
a
premium
to
nynex
s
share
price
for
control
be
that
they
be
assume
that
over
time
seidenberg
would
leave
and
they
would
assume
control
anyway
without
have
to
pay
for
the
privilege
choose
which
executive
would
stay
and
who
wouldn
t
survive
the
transition
be
the
hardest
part
of
the
merger
seidenberg
say
he
knew
that
smith
would
insist
on
babbio
and
cullen
maintain
senior
role
in
the
combine
company
he
make
the
same
demand
for
salerno
the
next
level
involve
some
tough
decision
the
company
brought
in
a
consultant
to
make
the
process
as
fair
and
effective
as
possible
for
each
management
position
where
there
be
an
overlap
they
look
at
the
candidate
from
bell
atlantic
and
the
candidate
from
nynex
and
weigh
whether
it
make
sense
to
recruit
from
the
outside
or
adopt
a
best
practice
from
elsewhere
i
lose
several
guy
that
have
be
iconic
leader
in
their
own
right
in
our
company
that
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
and
it
bother
me
to
this
day
seidenberg
say
others
have
to
agree
to
demotion
to
stay
on
but
seidenberg
could
point
to
his
own
situation
and
encourage
them
that
it
be
worth
the
change
in
status

offer
for
european
telecommunication
giant

just
as
seidenberg
thought
they
have
a
deal
ackerman
told
him
he
want
to
think
about
it
overnight
the
next
morning
he
call
seidenberg
and
told
him
that
after
talk
with
a
few
of
his
board
member
the
deal
be
dead
in

seidenberg
be
itch
to
do
a

of
significant
size
in
europe
beyond
the
relatively
small
investment
bell
atlantic
have
in
italian
czech
slovak
and
greek
telecommunication
company
among
others
many
of
these
be
good
financial
investment
but
weren
t
big
enough
to
be
transformative
for
the
entire
company
he
knew
he
didn
t
yet
have
the
heft
he
need
at
home
to
make
a
game
change
deal
with
a
foreign
entity
my
view
at
the
time
be
to
be
strong
globally
we
have
to
be
strong
in
america
and
that
meant
another

chuck

his

of
the

caught
the
attention
of
every
baby
bell

and
now
it
sound
as
if
lee
be
ready
to
make
a

gte
free
of
most
of
the
regulatory
constraint
that
have
dog
the
baby
bell
since
their
inception
have
in
many
way
be
more
aggressive
in
building
out
its
capability
particularly
in
its
focus
on
the
broadband

seriously
consider

mid

but
decide
it
wasn
t
a
good
fit
we
get
very
close
but
there
be
a
big
debate
on
the
board
about
how
far
we
want
to
go
into

moose

today
skeptic
inside

out
would
later
question
the

of
the

lose

yet
the

boom
mania
that
seize
the
market
and
technology
sector
in
particular
in
the
latter
s
make
it
seem
almost
as
if
any
price
be
worth
pay
for
a
vital
piece
of
the
internet
lee
and
his
team
seriously
upped
the
deal
make
ante
in
october
when
they
make
a
billion
all
cash
bid
for
long
distance
provider
mci
communication
corp
that
put
them
in
a
bidding
war
with
worldcom
inc
which
a
few
week
earlier
have
bid
billion
for
mci
but
in
the
form
of
an
all
stock
offer
they
be
both
compete
with
an
earlier
offer
from
british
telecommunication
plc
which
want
to
buy
the
percent
of
mci
it
didn
t
already
own
for
billion
lee
could
have
bid
for
mci
a
year
earlier
and
ahead
of
british
telecom
but
back
away
from
the
deal
base
on
mci
s
ask
price
at
the
time
you
re
hang
out
there
alone
mci
end
up
be
merge
into
worldcom
it
be
a
blow
to
lee
and
his
team
although
some
gte
director
be
happy
that
the
company
wasn
t
go
to
have
to
go
deeply
into
debt
to
fund
the
offer
but
it
also
position
them
to
consider
future
combination
the
fail
bid
for
mci
lead
the
gte
board
to
reappraise
how
the
company
be
position
for
the
future
say
moose
there
be
a
clear
mismatch
between
company
and
customer
base
the
realization
hit
us
by
the
late
s
that
while
gte
be
probably
right
about
the
direction
the
telecommunication
business
be
head
we
end
up
have
the
idea
and
the
product
and
some
of
the
capability
that
be
consistent
with
a
different
customer
base
than
the
one
we
have
moose
say
go
it
alone
no
longer
look
like
the
best
option
gte
s
strength
be
consistent
with
more
of
a
business
corporate
customer
base
and
more
of
a
customer
base
that
be
urban
centric
as
oppose
to
suburban
because
it
be
easy
initially
to
build
out
these
fiber
network
and
everything
in
city
moose
say
then
we
realize
that
our
customer
base
be
both
too
small
and
not
the
right
customer
base
more
suburban
rural
for
where
we
saw
the
industry
head
and
where
we
have
already
invest
in
some
fiber
and
data
capability
that
lead
us
to
bell
atlantic
which
have
a
more
urban
business
customer
base
bell
atlantic
and
bellsouth
would
have
create
an
enormous
contiguous
wireline
footprint
their
wireless
business
be
not
quite
as
compatible
the
chessboard
strategy
rely
on
create
many
option
to
pursue
a
victory
so
we
naturally
turn
our
attention
to
gte
which
have
much
less
compatibility
in
fix
wireline
but
have
a
terrific
wireless
business
seidenberg
say
chuck
lee
and
ray
smith
have
both
grown
up
in
pittsburgh
each
have
also
work
in
the
local
steel
industry
early
in
their
career
and
risen
through
the
financial
rank
of
various
company
to
serve
as
cfo
before

in
the

s
office
they
have
gotten
to
know
and
respect
each

over
the
year
and
would
see
each
other
at
telecommunication
industry
conference
and
other
event
so
it
make
sense
that
when
bell
atlantic
want
to
sound
out
lee
s
interest
in
make
a

smith

i
know
you

but
you
re
hang
out
there
alone
by
the
end
of
the

lee

that
he

with

he
have
discuss

over

impressive
record
of
transform
gte

clearly
understood
that

consolidation
be
inevitable
he
also
have
a
very
practical
view
that
there
be
many
way
to

broader
global
rally
in

share
and
the
dot
com

vodafone

the
verdict
on
their
offer
babbio
shock
gerace
with
a
phrase
gerace
would
clearly
recall
year
later
no

what
the

babbio
say
this

isn
t
go

here
ivan

not
go

up
babbio
add
ivan
want
a
national
footprint
for
wireless
babbio
take
the
call
from
seidenberg
he
hung
up
well
our
work
be
do
for
tonight
he
say
they
go
with
vodafone
it
s
unclear
when
they
re
go
to
announce
it
or
what
this
really
mean
for
us
but
good
work
in
mid
january
vodafone
announce
that
it
have
won
the
bidding
war
for
airtouch
and
that
bell
atlantic
have
decline
to
counter
its
offer
seidenberg
call
vodafone
chairman
chris
gent
to
congratulate
him
on
his
success
and
assure
him
there
be
no
hurt
feeling
chris
you
won
this
thing
but
you
still
have
a
u
s
problem
seidenberg
say
gent
respond
i
think
i
agree
with
that
airtouch
carry
a
hefty
price
tag
but
it
be
still
far
from
a
nationwide
wireless
network
seidenberg
say
when
you
get
settle
let
s
chat
and
let
s
see
if
we
can
figure
this
out
percent
solution
for
wireless
roughly
six
month
later
the
two
be
talk
again
about
combine
their
u
s
wireless
operation
ideally
bell
atlantic
would
have
bought
the
business
outright
but
that
would
have
trigger
onerous
tax
issue
in
the
state
for
vodafone
and
raise
leadership
question
so
the
talk
narrow
to
focus
on
a
joint
venture
bell
atlantic
negotiate
that
it
would
have
a
control
interest
in
the
partnership
eventually
set
at
percent
and
be
the
operating
partner
denny
strigl
and
his
team
would
be
in
charge
though
vodafone
have
the
right
to
put
in
its
choice
for
cfo
in
the
partnership
i
thought
percent
of
the
loaf
be
well
than
zero
and
that
enable
us
to
consolidate
all
of
the
other
thing
that
we
have
go
on
seidenberg
say
chuck
lee
live
up
to
his
reputation
for
be
an
innovative
risk
taker
when
seidenberg
briefed
him
on
the
vodafone
wireless
deal
i
always
give
chuck
credit
for
this
how
much
risk
he
be
willing
to
take
he
let
us
cut
the
deal
with
chris
gent
in
the
middle
of
the
merger
approval
seidenberg
say
so
after
talk
to
chuck
and
really
take
him
through
the
compatibility
of
airtouch
s
asset
vodafone
s
asset
bell
atlantic
s
asset
gte
s
asset
primeco
s
asset
and
say
look
what
kind
of
a
national
footprint
that
creates
he
be
really
excite
lee
say
it
would
not
have
be
possible
to
make
the
overlap
deal
work
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
bond
of
trust
that
he
and
seidenberg
have
forge
along
with
their
common
vision
this
be
pretty
gutsy
here
we
be
do
post
merger
deal
but
do
it
before
the
merger
so
we
just
work
together
very
well
ivan
and
i
lee
say
neither
of
us
ever
broke
our
word
not
once
and
that
s
why
these
thing
could
happen
that
s
why
the
integration
work
pay
the
merger
tax
the
board
of
bell
atlantic
and
gte
also
step
up
to
the
challenge
it
be
a
more
complex
set
of
transaction
than
it
initially
appear
to
be
seidenberg
say
we
have
to
negotiate
these
crazy
condition
that
if
the
gte
merger
fails
but
we
still
go
through
with
the
other
deal
how
do
we
do
that
what
do
we
owe
them
how
much
do
we
have
to
pay
them
and
how
much
of
a
penalty
do
we
take
another
condition
regulator
set
for
the
bell
atlantic
gte
merger
be
that
gte
have
to
set
up
bbn
and
the
rest
of
its
internet
backbone
business
rechristened
genuity
as
a
stand
alone
business
of
which
verizon
could
not
own
more
than
percent
genuity
s
initial
public
offering
occur
in
june
to
the
credit
of
the
board
they
be
willing
to
deal
with
the
complexity
because
the
payoff
of
these
transaction
be
so
large
seidenberg
say
we
would
say
to
the
board
don
t
worry
we
ll
get
this
do
we
re
get
this
do
and
i
always
felt
that
there
be
a
price
that
you
could
pay
to
get
it
do
and
it
turn
out
this
be
a
term
that
i
use
in
all
of
these
meeting
there
s
a
merger
tax
that
go
into
all
of
these
thing
it
include
financial
cost
but
also
matter
of
policy
and
if
you
figure
out
what
it
be
you
pay
the
tax
negotiate
merger
condition
and
you
move
forward
the
challenge
of
the
merger
tax
and
condition
act
to
pull
the
team
from
the
multiple
entity
together
to
act
as
one
as
the
approval
process
continued
into
early
the
collective
effort
of
all
the
people
to
solve
the
puzzle
become
more
important
than
all
of
the
secondary
political
fight
that
go
on
seidenberg
say
because
people
could
now
see
that
if
this
deal
get
do
this
company
be
a
very
different
company
they
could

in

executive
vice

for

mary
beth
bardin
who
report
directly
to
the
co
ceo
decide
that
it
be
time
to
draw
a
clear
line
on
accuracy
regard
the
creation
of
verizon
the
fact
that
she
report
directly
to
the
co
ceo
and
not
through
legal
or
marketing
department
as
be
the
case
at
other
company
in
the
sector
underscored
the
importance
seidenberg
and
lee
attach
to
communication
as
they
position
verizon
for
the
future
her
approach
also
align
with
the
continued
push
for
operational
excellence
at
every
level
that
would
become
a
hallmark
of
verizon
bardin
give
a
presentation
to
the
verizon
board
on
the
subject
she
knew
it
resonate
when
she
heard
back
from
senior
communicator
who
work
with
many
of
the
board
member
at
their
company
yes
we
want
relationship
with
reporter
but
we
re
not
their
friend
bardin
say
we
have
a
dual
responsibility
we
help
them
do
their
job
but
we
also
have
to
be
fanatical
about
the
fact
she
note
that
some
misstatement
because
they
weren
t
challenged
have
become
conventional
wisdom
and
get
repeat
by
other
publication
so
we
say
we
be
go
to
have
a
zero
tolerance
policy
for
error
and
we
don
t
even
care
if
they
re
small
error
we
be
go
to
demand
accuracy
that
s
go
to
be
the
mantra
verizon
promise
seidenberg
met
with
verizon
s
senior
communicator
as
they
be
prepare
to
introduce
the
new
company
to
the
public
and
their
fellow
employee
he
point
out
that
between
the
two
parent
company
and
their
subsidiary
we
must
have
have
about
vision
statement
and
value
statement
at
the
time
seidenberg
thought
if
i
go
out
and
make
a
speech
what
be
i
go
to
say
his
concern
dovetail
with
effort
already
underway
in
bardin
s
department
and
lead
to
the
creation
of
the
verizon
promise
after
polling
employee
across
the
new
company
the
communication
staff
found
that
when
ask
to
pick
out
the
single
most
important
value
customer
commitment
service
overwhelmingly
come
out
on
top
for
both
bell
atlantic
and
gte
employee
the
company
define
service
as
the
first
among
equal
when
it
come
to
value
the
centerpiece
of
our
measurement
compensation
and
reward
system
the
other
value
identify
in
be
integrity
respect
imagination
and
passion
seidenberg
say
that
although
every
value
be
important
senior
leader
tend
to
emphasize
some
value
at
certain
time
when
they
spoke
and
stress
other
value
on
different
occasion
strigl
and
his
wireless
team
would
develop
a
similar
value
statement
later
in
the
decade
combine
the
wireless
and
wireline
business
lead
to
another
iteration
of
the
value
statement
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
as
a
group
talk
about
what
integrity
meant
for
instance
what
it
meant
to
show
respect
not
just
to
fellow
employee
but
to
supplier
and
regulator
as
well
seidenberg
say
these
value
be
a
fundamental
dynamic
of
our
culture
these
can
t
be
compromise
and
we
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
building
context
and
action
that
support
our
value

reflect
the

long

commitment

and
each
other
as
lee

seidenberg
told
employee
for
that
reason
a
detailed
account
of
verizon
s
response
to
form
the
cornerstone
of
chapter
five

of
that
day

the

compel
company
employee
to

together
around
a

this

to
promote

with
an
emphasis
on

seidenberg
say
i
grow
up
in
the
bronx
our
school
schoolyard
and
neighborhood
be
all
of
mixed
ethnicity
and
race
clearly
in
the
s
and
s
our
country
be
in
the
early
stage
of
understand
the
deep
racial
and
ethnic
barrier
to
inclusion
in
the
army
i
saw
firsthand
the
deep
division
of
discrimination
in
vietnam
where
i
serve
it
be
very
clear
that
black
american
carry
a
disproportionate
burden
of
combat
these
fact
always
stuck
with
me
and
as
i
progress
in
my
career
i
want
to
do
my
part
in
make
this
matter
of
race
and
inclusion
well
for
all
look
back
verizon
have
make
some
great
progress
though
there
be
always
more
to
be
do
i
always
admire
bruce
for
his
courage
and
dignity
how
he
handle
himself
and
the
standard
he
set
for
all
of
us
in
our
company
lead
from
the
middle
verizon
prepared
to
compete
in
an
ever
more
diverse
and
dynamic
marketplace
seidenberg
realize
that
he
would
need
to
rely
on
his
board
of
director
even
more
intimately
as
a
sound
board
and
strategic
asset
as
verizon
pursue
its
chessboard
strategy
industry
consolidation
be
far
from
over
at
the
same
time
competition
especially
from
cable
company
be
continue
to
mount
fortunately
the
new
board
would
bring
together
a
collection
of
experienced
individual
with
a
range
of
expertise
that
be
well
suit
to
support
and
when
necessary
challenge
the
verizon
leadership
team
the
verizon
board
be
form
with
seven
independent
director
each
from
bell
atlantic
and
gte
as
well
as
seidenberg
and
lee
adopt
a
suggestion
from
bell
atlantic
board
member
richard
carrion
seidenberg
ask
each
of
the
independent
bell
atlantic
board
member
to
identity
which
seven
director
they
would
choose
to
serve
on
the
new
board
they
be
not
allow
to
choose
themselves
seidenberg
be
surprised
to
find
that
there
be
agreement
among
the
board
member
as
to
who
should
serve
on
the
new
board
gte
have
nine
outside
director
so
few
independent
director
be
cut
but
the
cut
be

of
the
table
and
the
gte
director
to
the
other
the
two
side
come
together
with
little
if
any
friction
and

of
the

the

in
introduce
neubauer
to
the
former
gte

as
much
as
seidenberg
and
salerno
have
be
effective
in
work
with
the
bell
atlantic
board
as
they
pursue
their
chessboard
strategy
during
the
s

take
to
heart
lee
s
advice
for
engage
their
combine

go
forward
lead
from
the
middle
chuck
come
up
with
the
concept
at
the
board
meeting
which
i
thought
be
great
he
say
there
be
two
way
to
think
about
a
board
meeting
you
run
it
from
the
middle
of
the
room
or
you
run
it
from
the
head
of
the
room
seidenberg
say
lee
recall
tell
seidenberg
we
use
to
run
our
board
meeting
from
the
middle
of
the
room
i
notice
you
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
room
but
you
run
the
meeting
from
the
head
of
the
room
the
presenter
go
to
the
screen
and
make
presentation
seidenberg
reply
chuck
usually
when
we
want
to
teach
and
explain
a
complicate
subject
we
go
to
the
head
of
the
room
and
when
we
want
to
have
a
conversation
i
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
room
lee
s
suggestion
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
room
more
often
seidenberg
concede
that
the
simple
strategy
paid
dividend
in
the
form
of
board
engagement
our
team
acclimate
to
this
right
away
even
though
at
first
it
be
unnatural
for
us
to
give
presentation
from
our
seat
as
oppose
to
go
up
there
chuck
be
right
we
have
deeper
and
livelier
conversation
member
of
the
round
table
seidenberg
take
another
of
lee
s
and
gte
s
practice
meeting
with
board
member
socially
before
schedule
meeting
and
over
time
make
it
his
own
again
to
the
benefit
of
company
leadership
and
board
engagement
moose
say
one
of
the
key
difference
between
the
gte
board
and
the
verizon
board
in
term
of
social
dynamic
be
we
probably
spent
more
time
with
each
other
because
the
gte
footprint
be
a
nationwide
footprint
we
have
people
from
different
part
of
the
country
come
in
from
out
of
town
as
a
result
we
would
have
a
dinner
the
even
before
the
board
meeting
and
then
we
d
have
lunch
after
the
board
meeting
we
also
have
an
annual
strategic
planning
retreat
meeting
for
two
to
three
day
seidenberg
say
that
the
bell
atlantic
board
reflect
the
company
s
more
compact
regional
footprint
take
a
one
and
do
approach
to
board
meeting
our
director
hat
dinner
because
they
flew
in
late
at
night
and
they
left
after
the
meeting
they
didn
t
have
time
for
dinner
he
reflect
on
his
own
experience
serve
on
several
corporate
board
on
all
the
board
i
serve
on
dinner
be
always
a
big
investment
of
time
he
say
it
usually
be
a
big
production
with
a
lot
of
people
i
be
ok
with
that
but
i
really
want
to
talk
to
the
other
director
i
want
to
know
what
they
be
think
i
want
to
talk
to
the
ceo
lee
press
seidenberg
to
adopt
the
dinner
model
seidenberg
acquiesce
shape
the
process
to
fit
his
evolve
view
of
board
leadership
and
participation
somewhere
along
the
line
we
developed
the
idea
of
have
a
round
table
only
have
the
board
member
there
and
make
it
mandatory
seidenberg
say
we
would
pick
a
good
restaurant
get
a
private
room
with
a
round
table
have
to
be
a
round
table
if
there
be
no
round
table
we
didn
t
go
he
say
an
owner
of
one
of
manhattan
s
trendiest
restaurant
assure
seidenberg
that
his
food
would
taste
just
as
good
on
a
rectangular
table
i
say
nope
get
a
round
table
we
ll
come
if
not
we
re
not
come
he
get
a
round
table
seidenberg
say
a
round
table
involve
everyone
equally
in
the
dinner
conversation
and
left
no
place
to
hide
there
be
conversation
go
all
over
the
place
one
of
the
thing
i
learn
be
we
make
everyone
participate
everybody
have
to
say
something
what
do
you
think
about
this
what
do
you
think
about
that
seidenberg
say
he
would
send
advance
reading
material
to
the
director
he
turn
the
dinner
into
forum
for
a
wide
range
discussion
of
trend
affect
the
country
and
the
company
as
well
as
ask
his
board
member
for
input
on
the
most
important
issue
face
their
company
and
industry
what
we
become
be
a
mini
presidential
cabinet
so
we
would
solve
the
world
s
problem
for
an
hour
seidenberg
say
they
also
engage
in
some
private
wager
over
everything
from
sport
to
election
seidenberg
would
then
share
his
thought
on
the
follow
day
s
board
meeting
and
what
he
hop
to
accomplish
he
didn
t
think
he
be
put
his
thumb
on
the
board
s
scale
to
try
to
influence
their
decision
make
i
learn
that
when
you
be
chairman
and
ceo
you
have
two
distinct
role
and
you
must
help
the
board
he
say
seidenberg
also
suggest
question
the
board
might
frame
for
the
management
team
when
they
present
for
instance
and
he
told
his
direct
report
that
he
would
be
discuss
their
presentation
with
the
board
ahead
of
time
we
built
great
rapport
by
the
time
the
board
assemble
for
its
official
meeting
member
be
highly
engage
and
willing
and
able
to
delve
into
key
topic
at
considerable
depth
more
importantly
they
be
prepared
to
commit
billion
in
capital
expenditure
as
need
to
long
term
project
such
as
the
continued
buildout
of
verizon
s
wireless
and
fios
network
that
they
understood
be
key
to
maintain
the
company
s
competitive
edge
we
built
great
rapport
he
say
our
director
be
inform
about
what
we
do
when
seidenberg
felt
that
director
be
go
off
on
a
tangent
he
would
rein
them
in
by
suggest
the
answer
to
their
question
be
the
subject
of
an
essay
but
he
would
direct
one
of
the
company
officer
to
follow
up
and
be
sure
that
an
answer
be
distribute
to
all
board
member
once
or
twice
a
year
seidenberg
ask
the
corporate
secretary
be
there
any
question
that
have
be
ask
in
the
last
three
or
four
meeting
that
haven
t
be
answer
the
answer
be
always
no
all
star
governance
some
corporate
leader
have
try
over
the
year
to
pack
their
board
with
friend
or
yes
men
and
woman
they
can
rely
on
to
support
their
agenda
even
recently
as
the
function
of
corporate
board
have
become
more
robust
in
the
wake
of
serial
corporate
scandal
some
board
remain
open
to
criticism
that
they
too
often
be
independent
in

he

really
us
the

as
well

i
ve
see
any

s
one
of

he

there
s

to

gain
from
draw
all
these
people
in
and
i
always
have
the
sense
he
knew
where
he
want

go

he
want
to
get
it
validate

around

there
be

in

one

lead
the

they

to
concentrate
the

the
theory
be
that
if
they
could
please
the
notoriously
tough
state
regulator
there
other
state
would
fall
in

once

the
verizon
team
get
to

i
don
t

be
already
on
the
phone
with
supplier
and
coworkers
across
the
country
and
in
canada
where
key
equipment
supplier
nortel
be
base
they
weren
t
sure
exactly
what
they
need
in
the
first
day
or
so
of
the
crisis
but
they
be
sure
they
be
go
to
need
it
fast
and
a
lot
of
it
their
job
be
make
all
the
harder
by
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
have
ground
all
air
traffic
as
of
the
time
of
the
attack
anything
verizon
need
in
low
manhattan
be
go
to
have
to
be
ship
in
by
truck
and
that
would
require
special
team
on
call
at
the
tunnel
because
the
government
have
shut
down
all
traffic
connect
manhattan
with
the
outside
world
we
have
guy
at
the
canadian
border
get
these
truck
through
we
have
shipment
come
from
georgia
and
texas
we
have
guy
at
the
other
side
of
the
lincoln
tunnel
because
the
tunnel
be
close
clearing
the
truck
through
babbio
say
the
company
even
receive
special
permission
while
all
commercial
and
private
flight
be
still
ground
in
the
state
to
fly
computer
expert
into
teterboro
airport
in
new
jersey
and
then
drive
them
into
the
city
there
be
nothing
in
the
west
street
sub
basement
verizon
could
use
to
make
the
monday
deadline
there
be
some
equipment
in
upper
floor
of
west
street
that
be
salvageable
but
it
be
tie
into
a
damage
network
and
of
course
there
be
no
power
in
the
building
so
verizon
order
and
instal
emergency
engine
and
put
them
on
platform
run
along
a
side
street
to
power
the
building
for
a
month
on
their
own
engineer
initially
have
try
to
snake
cable
from
west
s
upper
floor
back
into
manhole
to
connect
with
the
underground
vault
babbio
grow
frustrate
as
the
effort
be
get
nowhere
just
throw
the
damn
cable
out
the
window
he
say
in
exasperation
voila
babbio
and
his
team
realize
that
they
would
not
only
have
to
think
outside
of
the
box
they
have
to
think
outside
of
the
building
they
realize
fairly
quickly
that
they
be
go
to
have
to
replicate
the
inner
working
of
the
building
on
the
outside
to
create
a
new
telecommunication
network
for
low
manhattan
in
five
day
they
essentially
turn
the
operation
at
west
street
inside
out
not
to
mention
their
standard
budgeting
and
permit
process
verizon
ran
cable
up
the
outside
of
west
street
to
access
equipment
on
upper
floor
that
be
still
in
work
order
babbio
concede
that
the
process
be
be
engineer
on
the
fly
so
one
guy
say
to
me
how
many
cable
should
we
put
through
this
window
i
say
when

move
over
to
that
window
babbio
recall
that
s
what
we
re
do
just
move
over
a
window
the
team
make
some
quick
back
of
the
envelope
calculation
to
get
the
process
move
they
be
go
to
rebuild
or
reroute
more
than
million
voice
and
data
circuit
in
five
day
that
meant
they
be
building
a
telecommunication
network
as
big
as
the
one
that
serve
cincinnati
above
ground
with
much
of
it
snake
past
ground
zero

babbio
say

week
and
through
the
weekend
union
non
union
that
be
a
distinction
without
a
difference
in
the
push
to
get
the
big
board
up
and
run
and
in
the
week
that
follow
we
say
to
the
union
anybody
that
doesn
t
want
to
do

seidenberg
say
we
give
them
all
zoot
protective
suit
we
protect
them
the
best
we
could
we
say
we
don
t
know
what
s
go
to
happen
here
but
we
ve
get
to
be
in
this
together
he
add
they
be
great
i
use
to
go
down
there
the
guy
would
see
me
they
would

tool
on
larry
cohen
who
be
executive
vice
president
of
the
communication
worker
of
america
union
at
the
time
of
the
attack
agree
that
the
organize
labor
force
and
company
leadership
work
together
very
closely
in
the
day
week
and
month
follow
the
terrorist
act
i
remember
several
meeting
with
top
management
in
the
day
follow
the
attack
cohen
say
there
be
a
total
spirit
of
cooperation
seidenberg
agree
all
of
our
employee
be
spectacular
he
add
there
be
so
many
brother
sister
friend
and
family
member
of
our
employee
in
the
police
and
fire
department
not
to
mention
the
world
trade
center
itself
that
this
be
a
very
personal
situation
for
our
company
despite
the
danger
of
work
in
and
around
the
highly
unstable
area
go
above
and
beyond
be
the
new
normal
for
worker
in
low
manhattan
and
across
the
verizon
network
among
the
must
have
equipment
that
need
to
be
salvage
from
west
street
be
a
group
of
computer
server
that
contain
the
software
use
to
transmit
stock
quote
from
bank
and
trading
firm
around
the
world
to
the
floor
of
the
nyse
the
problem
be
that
the
server
be
house
in
a
space
more
than
flight
above
the
lobby
and
verizon
do
not
have
generator
large
enough
onsite
to
power
the
elevator
bank
so
employee
suit
up
in
hazmat
outfit
with
respirator
and
walk
up
the
stair
and
back
down
carry
the
server
as
it
turn
out
the
software
on
the
server
be
so
old
that
the
programmer
who
design
it
have
retire
they
jumped
at
the
chance
to
get
back
in
uniform
and
serve
the
effort
to
get
the
stock
exchange
up
and
run
we
saw
the
true
meaning
of
partnership
the
nyse
while
the
immediate
priority
in
term
of
restore
service
be
hardly
the
only
verizon

different
wireless
operating
system
we
knew
that
we
could
build
a
great
business
but
it
meant
that
we
would
have
to
manage
the
business
at
a
level
very
close
to
the
ground
to
drive
a
coherent
and

approach
across

stratton
say
the
exchange
between
our
people
and
our
customer
be
where
the
business
happen
and
i
know
that
s
true
in
every
business
but
it
s
not
necessarily
recognize
in
the
management
philosophy
of
every
company
he
add
strigl
believe
that
every
manager
have
to
be
involve
and
hand
on
in
run
the
business
that
meant

visit
many
lead
by
cto
dick
lynch
and
call

visit
and

store
he
want
the
company
to
be
local
in
its
focus
and
close
to
the
market
he
also
believe
it
be
necessary
as
a
teach
tool
to
support
employee
mcadam
do
the
same
thing
seidenberg
say
i
observe
denny
dozen
of
time
as
he
sat
and
discuss
the
reason
for
subpar
result
with
an
employee
and
watch
him
help
employee
focus
on
the
right
issue
lift
both
their
spirit
and
performance
not
that
strigl
didn
t
have
limit
grant
he
have
little
patience
for
people
who
be
glib
or
consistently
underperformed
but
he
and
lowell
clearly
improve
the
overall
effectiveness
of
the
organization
with
their
approach
seidenberg
say
the
wireless
team
improve
not
only
its
own
result
its
approach
drove
improvement
on
the
wireline
side
of
the
business
as
well
what
be
most
interest
to
me
be
that
in
our
culture
the
financial
regulatory
engineering
and
legal
function
be
all
well
oil
and
superb
seidenberg
say
denny
and
lowell
elevate
the
operating
marketing
and
sale
function
to
new
and
high
level
of
performance
and
this
be
exactly
what
analyst
and
pundit
say
the
former
bell
company
could
never
do
verizon
be
easily
the
best
operating
entity
of
any
of
the
former
at
t
company
he
add
the
idea
that
wireless
be
a
separate
business
be
helpful
to
the
transformation
of
the
company
seidenberg
realize
at
time
it
be
a
balance
act
my
role
be
to
nurture
develop
and
support
this
approach
and
not
allow
the
traditional
bureaucracy
to
slow
progress
seidenberg
say
as
strong
and
independent
as
denny
be
he
also
knew
the
whole
company
have
to
succeed
together
when
verizon
be
form
seidenberg
have
strigl
report
directly
to
him
rather
than
through
vice
chairman
larry
babbio
so
that
wireless
wouldn
t
be
the
third
item
on
larry
s
agenda
at
the
same
time
he
take
pain
to
point
out
to
strigl
that
wireless
independence
be
very
much
a
conscious
decision
on
the
part
of
the
leadership
team
at
verizon
communication
seidenberg
require
that
wireless
actively
be
a
part
of
the
large
company
he
be
happy
that
strigl
understood
that
it
be
important
over
the
long
term
to
build
an
integrate
team
strigl
support
seidenberg
s
repeat
belief
it
s
good
to
be
part
of
something
big
to
help
attract
and
retain
a
highly
motivate
workforce

which
appreciate
in

with
the

of
the

division
in
its
formative
year

the

also
align
the
interest
of
the

with
those
of
the

and
encourage
great

accountability
in
addition
it
lead
to
a
great
employee
focus
on
customer
service
and
the
success
of
the
company
the
company
take
the
position
that
as
a

employee
interest
typically
go
beyond
traditional

rule
employee
have
the
legal
right
to
choose
if
they
want
to
be
represent
by
a
union
reed
say
our
thought
process
be
that
from
a
management
perspective
we
should
run
this
business
so
there
s
never
a
question
of
whether
or
not
employee
would
be
well
off
with
the
union
he
add
the
reason
why
wireless
have
not
be
organize
be
the
fact
that
employee
haven
t
see
a
compelling
reason
to
want
to
join
a
union
of
the
wireless
employee
at
the
time
the

seidenberg
would
sit
in
on
many
wireless
operational
review
around
the

he
do
so
to
demonstrate
support
for

and
to
bring
back
the

practice
to
the
rest
of
the

even
though
the
legacy
business
remain
a
successful
traditional
business
in
most
aspect
it
do
not
yet
face
the
intense
competitive
environment
that
exist
in
wireless
seidenberg
also
help
reassure
the
rise
star
of
wireless
that
they
be
on
the
right
track
and
that
the
review
be
design
to
bring
out
their
best
shake
it
off
he
advise
walden
after
one
review
you
know
how
you
re
go
to
fix
it
just
go
fix
it
seidenberg
credit
strigl
for
his
management
insight
in
building
the
wireless
team
even
if
he
do
come
on
strong
denny
knew
how
to
identify
the
trait
in
leader
that
would
spur
them
to
high
performance
and
help
lead
their
team
that
s
why
he
push
them
seidenberg
say
we
be
fortunate
that
we
have
denny
on
our
side
seidenberg
also
recall
that
the
momentum
be
generate
by
the
wireless
leadership
team
be
attract
attention
far
beyond
the
company
s
network
of
store
i
use
to
make
presentation
at
wall
street
analyst
meeting
and
people
would
take
me
aside
and
say
what
be
you
feed
these
wireless
guy
i
use
to
say
i
m
not
feed
them
anything
i
m
learn
from
them
every
day
not
every
lesson
in
wireless
management
have
a
happy
end
in
the
early
month
of
building
the
business
strigl
fire
a
regional
president
in
the
middle
of
a
quarterly
operational
review
as
mcadam
recall
denny
ask
him
what
about
this
number
and
he
say
you
know
i
really
have
no
idea
you
probably
have
a
well
sense
of
this
number
than
i
do
so
the
answer
be
well
then
i
guess
we
don
t
need
you
for
every
one
manager
who
wash
out
there
be
hundred
who
learn
from
the
operating
review
and
significantly
improve
their
performance
and
the
service
they
provide
to

from
one
review
to
the
next
verizon

by
example
they
demonstrate
day
in

out
that
everyone
have
a
hand
in
improve
the

no

small
nor

it
someone

problem
denny
be
an
excellent
teacher
seidenberg
say
but
lowell
be
also
extraordinary
lowell
be
one
of
the
best
process
orient
engineer
i

get
to
the
root
of

and
fix

focus
one
of
the
bedrock
rule
of

be
in
the
store
and
call

to
constantly

and
improve
upon
the

experience
mcadam
estimate
that
he
be
in
the
field
percent
of
the
time
as
coo
strigl
spent
almost
as
much
time
visit
facility
as
well
the
two
of
them
would
even
give
seidenberg
a
list
of
store
to
visit
unannounced
when
he
be
attend
an
event
or
a
meeting
in
city
across
the
country
it
wasn
t
long
before
store
manager
and
their
regional
boss
understood
that
their
performance
be
be
constantly
monitor
and
that
they
need
to
constantly
improve
their
game
or
they
be
go
one
friday
strigl
decide
to
visit

in
and
around
natick
massachusetts
he
be
annoyed
that
he
couldn
t
see
the
sign
for
the
natick
store
and
then
be
far
annoyed
when
he
pull
up
and
there
be
banner
in
portuguese
in
front
of
the
store
there
be
a
sizable
spanish
speak
population
in
the
area
but
few
if
any
portuguese
speaker
the
store
manager
couldn
t
explain
why
he
have
the
sign
up
he
told
strigl
that
they
d
be
sent
by
corporate
strigl
call
corporate
marketing
and
be
told
that
the
manager
be
not
suppose
to
use
them
if
he
didn
t
need
them
his
anger
mount
at
the
non
response
strigl
call
the
regional
president
he
happen
to
be
work
out
of
maine
that
friday
afternoon
a
two
hour
drive
away
strigl
told
him
to
come
to
the
store
and
that
he
would
be
wait
for
him
meanwhile
strigl
tour
the
rest
of
the
store
and
spot
dirty
window
and
a
dirty
restroom
when
the
regional
president
arrive
strigl
make
it
clear
that
this
ultimately
wasn
t
the
store
manager
s
problem
he
hadn
t
be
properly
train
or
supervise
strigl
ask
the
president
when
be
the
last
time
he
have
visit
the
store
four
or
five
month
ago
the
president
say
not
a
good
answer
they
both
knew
the
message
spread
quickly
through
the
verizon
wireless
store
network
in
the
northeast
and
then
across
the
country
that
strigl
held
regional
president
responsible
for
every
store
period
clean
window
bright
light
store
appearance
be
an
obsession
with
the
wireless
leadership
team
when
district
manager
heard
that
strigl
mcadam
or
another
senior
leader
be
in

they
let
their
store
manager
know
that
their
window
have
well
be
clean
it
be
like
an
all
point
bulletin
go
out
across
the
regional
system
walden
say
once
inside
a
store
mcadam
would
unscrew
any
burn
out
lightbulb
he
found
sign
it
with
a
felt
tipped
pen
and
mail
it
to
the
regional

he
then
sent
them
a
new
bulb
people
hat
to
get
a
lightbulb
sign
by
me
mcadam
say
but
the
metaphor
stuck
with
them
clean
window
and
bright
store
quickly
become
verizon
wireless
signature
look
i
haven
t
found
a
lightbulb

four
out
of
five
day
a

i
use
to
have
rule
for
my
team
if
you
be
run
the
store
if
you
be
a
district
manager
you
need

of
your

once
a

not
a

we
should
do
a
million
the
first
year
the
only
way
we
can
get
enough
momentum
and
seriousness
around
this
be
to
put
that
stake
in
the
ground
and
do
a
million
line
he
add
cost
be
only
one
of
several
key
issue
around
the
use
of
fiber
that
need
to
be
resolve
there
s
a
lot
of
other
work
that
need
to
be
do
because
you
just
can
t
build
a
fiber
network
you
must
have
something
to
put
over
it
and
the
only
way
we
re
go
to
make
this
work
be
that
we
have
to
actually
provide
just
not
voice
and
data
we
need
to
provide
tv
as
well
babbio
say
but
to
get
into
the
tv
business
you
just
can
t
say
ok
i
have
a
network
now
i
have
to
have
the
right
to
all
the
different
channel
for
all
the
different
product
and
everything
else
gang
of
six
in
the
early
day
of
consider
take
fiber
to
the
home
verizon
sbc
and
bellsouth
sbc
and
bellsouth
have
yet
to
merge
work
together
to
try
to
formulate
common
standard
among
supplier
of
optical
fiber
and
related
equipment
who
would
be
need
to
support
the
fiber
to
the
home
effort
two
official
from
each
company
met
as
what
lacouture
one
of
the
verizon
representative
dubbed
the
gang
of
six
they
make
some
headway
but
the
other
two
company
enthusiasm
for
take
fiber
all
the
way
to
the
home
cool
apparently
for
cost
and
other
reason
that
left
verizon
as
the
industry
pioneer
in
beating
a
new
path
to
the
customer
door
so
the
fiber
team
create
a
business
case
to
prove
that
fios
would
be
a
viable
investment
their
first
stop
be
verizon
s
senior
wireline
leadership
it
be
not
an
easy
sell
jim
cullen
the
head
of
the
business
until
he
retire
in
mid
and
doreen
toben
cfo
of
the
wireline
business
at
the
time
initially
be
among
the
skeptic
when
it
come
to
whether
fios
would
ever
produce
an
appropriate
return
on
investment
as
toben
recall
the
engineer
there
be
no
doubt
in
their
mind
now
they
didn
t
pay
a
whole
lot
of
attention
this
be
an
understatement
to
the
cost
that
fios
be
a
well
product
and
it
be
i
mean
there
s
no
question
the
problem
from
the
point
of
view
of
cullen
toben
john
killian
and
others
be
that
at
t
be
know
to
be
advocate
a
plan
to
take
fiber
to
the
neighborhood
not
all
the
way
into
the
customer
s
house
at
a
cost
estimate
at
roughly
billion
to
billion
that
be
still
a
hefty
price
tag
but
only
a
fraction
of
what
babbio
s
team
be
propose
to
spend
sbc
which
would
buy
at
t
in
and
take
the
at
t
name
be
also
take
fiber
to
the
neighborhood
during
this
period
be
the
high
quality
fios
approach
worth
the
difference
in
price
might
it
be
a
well
investment
to
take
at
least
a
portion
of
the
money
they
would
spend
on
fios
and
buy
back
their
company
s
stock
instead
as
babbio
recall
there
be
a
lot
of
people
in
finance
who
thought
that
we
be
crazy
seidenberg
side
with
the
engineer
over
the
financial
planner
he
be
convince
from
his
early
year
work
on
the
copper
wire
network
that
copper
wire
be
not
the
future
no
matter
how
much
at
t
plan
to
tweak
the
classic
twist
pair
i
work
on
the
outside
plant
i
fix
copper
line
and
i
knew
that
wouldn
t
work
seidenberg
say
at
t
come
out
with
the
full
pair
bond
and
we
say
eventually
it
s
go
to
run
out
of
gas
and
both
larry
and
i
from
our
bell
lab
day
knew
that
fiber
be
not
an
untested
technology
it
would
work
and
work
well
the
issue
be
the
cost
to
install
and
the
operation
challenge
to
rebuild
the
entire
outside
plant
so
to
us
this
be
a
decision
of
conviction
and
a
bet
on
the
future
interestingly
the
naysayer
be
all
focus
on
the
financial
case
no
one
ever
challenged
the
technology
vision
the
fios
team
won
over
the
financial
skeptic
though
it
take
detailed
analysis
major
interaction
with
supplier
and
month
upon
month
of
meeting
with
every
stakeholder
one
of
the
key
argument
concerned
long
term
operating
cost
they
persuade
the
operating
leadership
that
over
several
year
the
low
project
maintenance
cost
would
make
the
number
work
in
fios
favor
despite
the
hair
raise
initial
investment
the
key
be
scale
it
across
a
large
number
of
customer
there
be
no
question
this
be
a
gut
wrench
decision
for
the
company
seidenberg
say
look
back
this
be
a
clear
example
of
balance
the
short
term
versus
the
long
term
interest
of
the
company
involve
the
board
babbio
begin
the
process
of
educate
and
persuade
the
verizon
board
about
fios
it
would
be
a
multi
year
effort
sideline
for
month
by
the
company
s
all
hand
on
deck
response
to
the

operating

in

both

the

for
the

active
engagement
in
the

ahead
the

team
ask
the

to
make
certain
assumption
about
the

we
present
the
case
to
the

look
we
re
here
in
do
anybody
think
year
from
now
we

still
go
to

babbio
say
and
most
people
would
say
probably
not
that
be
ok
year
and
everybody
would
say
no
no
no
ten
how
about
five
it
be
a
question
of
when
verizon
and
the
industry
would
upgrade
much
of
the
wireline
plant
to
fiber
not
if
babbio
argue
we
re
not
talk
about
spending
extra
money
we
re
talk
about
advance
money
he
say
as
he

the

during

a
few
year
after

moose
estimate
that
the
cost
of

be
about
billion
more
than
the

cost
of
maintain
the
wireline

over
four
to
five
year
a
large
number
to
be
sure
and
in
excess
of
merely
advance
future
expenditure
to
use
babbio
s
term
but
director
understood
that
such
figure
fell
within
the
range
of
multibillion
dollar
annual
expenditure
they
be
accustom
to
consider
fiber
unbound
verizon
be
motivate
to
take
fiber
all
the
way
to
the
customer
s
home
to
build
the
best
in
class
wireline
network
just
as
it
have
create
the
best
wireless
network
in
verizon
wireless
but
there
be
another
reason
to
make
fiber
the
last
mile
connection
between
verizon
and
its
broadband
customer
unlike
the
requirement
to
share
its
copper
access
line
with
telecommunication
rival
new
rule
of
the
road

verizon
would
have
its

all
to

bill
barr
in

as

push
back
on
what
they
consider
heavy
hand
fcc
and
state
level
regulation
of
their

for

they
focus
on
the
use
of

as
a
key
differentiator
run
fiber
to
consumer
home
foster
competition
for
the
last
mile
of
access
one
of
the
fcc
s
major
concern
since
the
passage
of
the
telecommunication
act
it
didn
t
stifle
it
in
the
fcc
essentially
agree
say
that
company
would
not
have
to
allow
competitor
access
to
mass
market
fiber
to
the
premise
loop
that
give
the
fios
team
a
green
light
know
that
once
they
set
the
fiber
table
their
rival
would
not
be
able
to
swoop
in
and
enjoy
a
free
lunch
with
their
customer
the
cable
company
be
go
to
completely
obliterate
the
telephone
company
if
we
let
them
by
upgrade
their
coax
cable
to
carry
video
seidenberg
say
the
only
way
to
do
this
would
be
to
put
as
much
fiber
as
we
could
and
return
to
the
regulatory
people
and
say
can
you
get
the
regulator
to
regulate
fiber
differently
than
copper
and
they
do
fiber
be
all
about
create
a
new
wing
to
the
company
seidenberg
say
use
the
phrasing
he
have
apply
to
run
the
unregulated
business
at
nynex
while
still
a
young
executive
then
as
now
he
say
the
value
of
the
strategy
wasn
t
immediately
clear
especially
to
wall
street
and
investor
that
be
a
way
for
me
seidenberg
say
to
put
in
motion
the
strategy
that
would
in
effect
make
the
telephone
company
a
valuable
asset
over
time
for
instance
in
and
while
weigh

director
tom
o
brien
former
chairman

ceo
of

group
appreciate
the
diligence
displayed
by
the
fios
team
they
brought
us
along
so
to
speak
they
never
just
come

say
hey
we
have
a
nice
new
program
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
o
brien

this
would
occur
over
many
meeting
that
be
sort
of
in
preparation
that
this
be
something
that
they
really
think
they
may
want
to
do
he
add
there
be
a
lot
of
discussion
about
whether
it
be
go
to
work
and
who
s
go
to
buy
it
and
why
do
you
think
we
can
offer
this
and
outcompete
cable
company
and
other
people
i
think
they
felt
very
strongly
that
their
technology
be
superior
and
their
customer
service
be
superior
o
brien
and
other
director
be
concerned
that
customer
might
not
appreciate
or
be
willing
to
pay
for
the
value
fios
be
go
to
deliver
in
term
of
quality
and
quantity
or
speed
of
video
and
internet
service
not
only
be
at
t
s
solution
cheaper
to
install
than
fios
so
be
exist
cable
service
what
if
these
competitor
launch
a
price
war
in
the
midst
of
verizon
s
fios
rollout
that
would
likely
reduce
demand
for
fios
and
make
it
harder
for
the
venture
to
ever
earn
a
return
on
the
capital
deployed
to
build
the
fiber
system
the
fios
team
readily
admit
that
there
be
a
risk
involve
in
make
such
a
major
investment
in
fios
but
as
with
every
major
decision
seidenberg
and
his
team
propose
over
the
year
there
be
a
significant
risk
in
do
nothing
as
technology
consumer
taste
and
the
competitive
landscape
continued
to
evolve
the
board
understood
that
the
threat
the
company
face
especially
from
cable
tv
be
too
great
to
ignore
babbio
say
two
key
argument
swayed
the
board
number
one
it
be
a
lot
more
reliable
number
two
we
d
get
into
the
tv
business
and
everybody
know
that
the
only
way
that
we
be
go
to
keep
the
landline
and
internet
be
to
keep
the
cable
company
out
of
the
house
and
you
only
keep
the
cable
company
out
of
the
house
if
you
can
offer
tv
service
if
cable
be
in
there
with
you
their
incremental
cost
of
provide
phone
and
broadband
be
so
small
that
they
could
knock
you
out
of
the
house
immediately
on
the
other
hand
our
incremental
cost
of
provide
tv
be
a
little
high
but
if
we
don
t
do
it
cable
s
in
the
house
so
that
be
the
entire
focus
of
the
strategy
get
cable
out
of
the
house
and
when
we
do
the
business
case
we
say
if
we
could
keep
cable
out
of
the
house
if
we
could
get
penetration
of
one
third

seidenberg
told
the

unlike

the
reaction
could
not
have
be
bad
seidenberg
say
investor
thought
this
be
a
poor
decision
because
we
could
never
really
compete
with

they
prefer
we
use

capital
to

no

that

not

well
ahead
of
prediction
the
verizon
board
have
reason
to
be
cautiously
optimistic
as
it
view
the
initial
positive
consumer
response
to

early
on
the
indication

there
that
it
really
would
work

joe

we
look
at
household
conversion
we
look
at

we
look
at
revenue
per
household
they
all
look
pretty
good
there
be
some
major
problem
the
company
have
significantly
underestimated
the
cost

time
involve
in

the

in
customer
home
include
connect
all
of
their

babbio
have
initially
estimate
that
it
would
take
about
two
hour
for
each
fios
install
instead
the
first
few
hundred

closer
to
two
day
each
babbio
go
back
before
the
board
to
plead
for
patience
you
have
to
give
us
at
least
a
little
room
you
can
t
count
the
first
people
you
should
count
the
first
people
as
the
rollout
continued
installation
improve
in
some
area
although
installation
cost
continued
to
burden
the
rollout
across
the
country
such
snag
would
be
one
of
the
reason
verizon
would
buttress
the
fios
leadership
team
in
after
two
year
of

in
try

speed
up
the
adoption
of

installation
process
for

in
an
effort
to
control

verizon
often
use

the

its

of
concern
jim
gerace
instal

in
his
home
but
intentionally
didn
t
tell
the
installers
he
be
a
verizon
executive
since
he
want
to
see
the
level
of
service
that
be
be
provide
in
his
area
so
i
go
out
when
they
get
there
and
i
say
hey
let
me
know
where
you
re
go

put
this
because
then
i

mark

my

i

gerace

the

oh
no
no
don
t
worry
if
we
break
it
we
fix
it

enough
he

verizon
a
few
thousand
dollar
extra
to
repair
the
damage
and
redo
the
work
seidenberg
didn
t
excuse
shoddy
work
but
he
say
it
be
hard
to
overstate
the
challenge
face
the
fios
team
verizon
wireless
successfully
overcame
myriad
obstacle
in
building
a
cellular
business
that
be
second
to
none
but
they
have
the
advantage
of
essentially
start
from

when
it
come
to
building
the

they
love
the

the

horror
story
caught
the
medium
s
eye
and
investor
attention
the
use
of
subcontractor
to
install
the

in
part
of
the
country
often
exacerbate
the

in

verizon
s

plunge
by
more

percent
in

recover
somewhat

never
venture
far
from
the
fairly
flat
trading
range
that
it
have
occupy
for
much
of
the
decade
to
date
it
be
a
tough
slog
as
we
go
through
it
say
john
killian
former
cfo
of
the
wireline
business
most
of
the

thought
it
be
a
dumb
idea
and
that
we
should
not
be
put
that
much
capital
in
it
seidenberg
kept
the
leadership
team
and
the
board
focus
on
the
long
view
we
explain
to
the
board
that
while
our
stock
price
be
down
we
be
amazingly
still
in
line
with
the
rest
of
the
industry
even
though
our
peer
would
challenge
our
approach
and
indicate
that
building
fiber
to
the
home
be
a
bad
financial
idea
this
will
pay
off
seidenberg
say
we
be
willing
to
live
with
the
consequence
of
the
impact
of
fios
on
the
stock
price
and
our
compensation
be
low
because
of
the
fios
rollout
our
compensation
be
align
with
our
belief
he
say
management
never
ask
the
board
for
a
change
in
compensation
structure
because
of
the
impact
of
the
fios
rollout
one
of
the
factor
that
make
the
tremendous
capital
expenditure
require
to
launch
fios
palatable
from
the
board
s
point
of
view
be
that
a
lot
of
the

moose
say
so
unlike
the

you
could
stop

if
you
be
concerned
with
the
result
she

you

have

to

about
on

side
of
the

but
at
the

time
he
be
convince
that
the

the

i
want
to
talk

you
about

eventually
we

who
be
very
iconic
today
and
how
be
we
go
to
do
this
seidenberg
ask
if
we
do
not
take
specific
action
the
wireline
and
wireless
business
group
will
just
perpetuate
their
own

and
not
necessarily
think
about
the

as
a
whole
their
initial
talk
be
about
the
position
reed
wasn
t
be
offer
the
job
but
seidenberg
make
it
clear
in
time
that
he
would
like
reed
to
consider
the
post
reed
understood
that
it
be
a
promotion
but
he
excel
at
the
operational
level
of
building
the
wireless
team
and
he
wasn
t
certain
he
want
to
leave
with
small
child
in
school
in
new
jersey
and
have
already
relocate
his
family
eight
time
in
his
career
he
also
wasn

sure
he
want
to
move
into

reed
talk
with

and
mcadam
his

boss
strigl
make
it
clear
that
he
would
hate
to
lose
reed
on
the
other
hand
this
be
one
of
those
career
moment
the
chairman
want
you
to
do
this
he
agree
to
take
the
job
seidenberg
wasn

just
interested
in
use

to

promote

up
through
the

want
to
physically
bring

together

have
be
on
the
job
in

for
about
a
month
seidenberg
drop
into
his

you
know
your
issue
about
not
want
to
work
here
in
new
york
i
m
go
to
give
you
the
opportunity
to
fix
this
he
say
half
in
jest
i
think
it
s
time
we
start
think
about
how
we
have
an
operating
location
where
wireless
and
wireline
be
put
together
keep
the
business
separate
for
the
first
few
year
be
the
right
incubation
period
for
wireless
to
develop
its
own
culture
seidenberg
say
but
if
we
want
to
get
the
total
value
out
of
this
company
he
add
we
need
to
at
least
get
people
in
the
same
proximity
because
let
s
face
it
nobody
from
wireless
come
over
here
unless
they
re
summon
and
nobody
go
over
there
unless
they
re
invite
it
ain
t
go
to
happen
on
its
own
he
say
during
the
verizon
leadership
team
and
board
also
decide
to
keep
the
corporate
headquarters
in
manhattan
but
move
it
to
west
street
that
move
announce
in
january
be
an
important
symbol
of
verizon
s
commitment
to
the
city
but
that
didn
t
mean
operation
couldn
t
be
consolidated
elsewhere
back
to
basking
ridge
aware
that
he
need

it

somebody
s
go

out
and
we
have
a

debate
about

seidenberg

inclination
be
to
pursue

we
wouldn

get
the

we
d
get
enough
of
a
long
distance
company
to
do
what
we
need
to
do
seidenberg
say
and
then
once
we
consolidated
with
one
of
the
long
distance
company
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
time
before
the
rest
of
the

consolidated
as
well
he
and
the
verizon

believe
that
at

with
its

dependent
on
the
exist
regulatory
framework
remain
stuck
in
telecom
s

not
its

i
be
always

seidenberg

verizon

be
on
such
a
strong
growth
trajectory
that
it
didn
t
make
sense
to
force
a

on
them
on

of
every
other
challenge
with
which
they
be

make
it
clear
that
it

not
that
interested
in

unless
it
be
for
a
very
high

deep

turn
its
attention
to
the

leader
as

it
be
hardly
the
first

verizon
put
these
industry
player
under
the
microscope
in
support
of

come
in

and

hey
do
you
ever
think
about

at
this

do
you
ever
look
at
that
do
you
ever
look
at
this
diercksen
say
seidenberg
consider
diercksen
and
his
team
an
indispensable
part
of
the
strategic

in
that
they

and
dig
into

company
report
of
these
potential

diercksen
say
we
always
look
at
company
at
one
point
through
the
and
period
we
probably
look
at
company
and
when
i
say
look
at
them
we
do
deep
dive
a
bridge
too
far
with
sprint
out
of
the
run
verizon
s
leadership
team
agree
they
have
to
seriously
look
at
buying
at
t
despite
their
concern
about
the
corporate
culture
and
outlook
seidenberg
knew
that
at
t
chairman
and
ceo
david
dorman
have
be
talk
with
ed
whitacre
his
counterpart
at
sbc
about
combine
force
but
sbc
have
yet
to
close
on
its
acquisition
of
bellsouth
and
couldn
t
expect
regulatory
approval
for
another
purchase
so
there
remain
a
window
of
time
for
verizon
to
sweep
in
and
woo
at
t
as
well
seidenberg
met
with
dorman
whom
he
have
know
for
year
and
discuss
a
merger
of
their
company
dave
the
problem
that
you
guy
have
be
that
you
re
try
to
solve
your
problem
by
get
regulation
impose
on
us
like
share
our
network
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
you
ve
never
decide
you
should
spend
any
money
and
build
a
network
a
local
network
or
buy
a
local
company
seidenberg
say
now
your
predecessor
bought
the
cable
guy
your
predecessor
have
wireless
and
then
they
spun
them
all
out
which
to
us
be
not
the
right
approach
he
continued
but
now
you
re
here
and
you
re
still
try
to
get
the
fcc
to
regulate
our
price
because
you
don
t
think
they
re
fair
that
s
a
bad
way
to
think
seidenberg
say
you
be
go
to
fail
seidenberg
also
make
it
clear
that
if
at
t
merge
with
verizon
it
would
have
to
adapt
the
verizon
way
of
do
business
i
m
just
say
you
have
to
change
your
attitude
because
if
you
come
in
with
a
company
like
ours
we
re
go
to
change
the
model
seidenberg
told
dorman
we
re
not
go
to
discount
every
day
we
re
not
go
to
give
away
our
service
we
re
go
to
build
a
valuable
network
seidenberg
realize
that
create
a
high
hurdle
to
do
a
deal
for
dorman
he
be
struggle
with
that
i
also
think
he
thought
ed
would
pay
more
seidenberg
also
be
surprised
that
dorman
be
very
interested
in
be
a
part
of
any
new
company
and
thought
he
would
take
the
lead
in
public
policy
and
related
merger
integration
if
the
two
company
merge
we
want
to
end
the
at
t
style
public
policy
framework
and
transform
verizon
away
from
traditional
regulation
seidenberg
say
but
from
a
financial
standpoint
buying
at
t
be
doable
expensive
but
doable

at

at

for

that
if

because
qwest
come
in
with

they
would
pocket

on
ivan
do
you
know
what
you
re
do
a
few
ask
him
seidenberg
recall
his
response
be
we
could
lose
it
would
be
embarrass
but
we
thought
that
once
a
shareholder
vote
be
take
investor
would
run
to
the
safety
of
the
verizon
bid
even
though
it
be
low
than
the
offer
by
qwest
i
thought
this
be
the
right
move
for
the
company
but
i
also
realize
that
it
could
cost
me
my
job
if
we
lose
on

qwest
make
its

we
would
expand

beyond
the
northeast
and
a
few
select
former
gte
market
but
we
be
confident
that
over

a
new
approach
to

deployment
would
develop
later
on
g
surface
as
the
platform
for
this
initiative
we
can
win
against

the

the

local

say

what
we

that
with

there
be
no
national
company
they

execute

we

he

to
ivan

they
just
kind

blew

up

no
we

go

go
in

we
re
go
to
have
a
regional
approach
here
and
virginia
and
i
be
ask
to
lead
that
they
be
in
uncharted

the
challenge
be
we
have
no

we

be
ask
to
run
a
start
up

within

so
i
think
there
be
a
few
challenge
advance
in
fiber
technology
begin
to
solve
some
of
the
installation
challenge
that
be
drive
up

after
work
closely
with
key
fiber
optic
glass
fiber
supplier
corn
the
verizon
team
be
able
to
begin
to
employ
a

to
speed
installation
and
improve
the
performance
of
fios
by
late
especially
in
apartment
building
one
of
the
key
limitation
of
the
first
generation
of
fiber
optic
glass
be
that
it
could
only
bend
slightly
before
start
to
bleed
light
wave
carry
information
that
often
require
installers
to
run
fiber
from
basement
up
to
attic
to
cross
a
customer
s
living
room
for
instance
or
to
drill
straight
through
multiple
wall
with
the
new
generation
of
glass
from
corn
coat
with
nanostructures
that
act
as
microscopic
guardrail
fiber
optic
cable
could
snake
around
multiple
corner
in
a

without
lose
any
signal
strength
ruesterholz
say
that
as
she
and
mudge
be
step
into
the
leadership
role
at

the

union

non

get
increasingly
excite

suddenly
the

weren
t
the
only
one
with

i

the

that
be
so
excite
about
that
job
for
me
be
it
be
such
a
game
changer
for
the

even
the

ruesterholz
say
they
felt
they
could
win
you
give
them
fiber
you
give
them
the
tool
you
really
change
the
mindset
now
do
everybody
come
along
of
course
not
she
say
but
there
be
a
whole
new

of

that
say
wow
we
can
win
against

the
enemy
be

we
re
not
now
on
our

i

that
be

very
very

for
the

of
the

larry
cohen

cohen

throughout
the

applaud

encourage

to
grant

for

unequivocally
he
add

to
ruesterholz
it

very
excite
the
competition
among
the

on
how

they

a
really
fun
competitive
growth
opportunity
the
new
fios
leadership
inject
a
sale
and
marketing
culture
into
the
wireline
business
that
too
often
in
earlier
year
have
receive
less
emphasis
than
it
have
on
the
wireless
side
of
the
business
ruesterholz
and
mudge
back
nine
regional
president
include
maura
breen
in
new
york
and
ellen
corcoran
in
new
england
who
drew
upon
sale
and
marketing
background
to
drive
success
in
their
region
their
excitement
in
building
a
team
and
bring
a
sale
and
marketing
and
entrepreneurial
spirit
to
an
operation
group
of
people
be
pretty
infectious
mudge
say
they
be
woman
with
strong
sale
and
marketing
background
who
help
people
that
come
through
a
regulate
operation
that
really
didn
t
think
too
much
about
how
we
compete
and
what
sale
and
marketing
work
be
need
we
be
kind
of
bury
in
the
factory
for
so
many
year
just
create
widget
and
that
be
it
yet
the
leadership
at
least
for
a
few
year
still
have
to
maintain
a
foothold
in
the
old
copper
world
and
the
new
fios
landscape
it
be
a
constant
juggling
act
accord
to
mudge
we
be
still
in
the
mode
of
protect
the
old
network
and
the
old
business
while
grow
the
new
one
at
the
time
because
fios
be
so
new
and
small
the
majority
of
the
business
be
all
still
the
core
and
copper
folk
so
yeah
there
be
some
resistance
to
the
new
technology
but
that
be
a
round
error
it
be
more
we
have
to
say
that
everyone
be
still
do
critical
and
important
work
but
that
be
a
very
tough
balance
because
we
didn
t
want
to
downplay
fios
and
fiber
but
we
couldn
t
overplay
it
for
people
to
think
they
would
be
left
behind
so
it
actually
have
to
play
out
and
then
over
time
people
saw
so
long
as
we
be
successful
there
would
be
a
future
for
our
business
and
great
job

the

that
would
indeed

at
an
apple

and
apple
source
lead
them
to
the
conclusion
that
apple
be
ready
a
next
generation
cellphone
that
clearly
be
intend
to
leapfrog
the
competition
two

later
apple
reach
out
to
verizon
wireless
and
request

and
several
member

and
met
with
seidenberg
and
the

have
gotten
to
know
each
other
through
appear
on
telecommunication
industry
panel
and
be
friendly
though
there
be
no
business
relationship
between
the
company
he
come
in
and
he
start
ask
us
all
these
question
about
how
we
sort
of
do
product
development
and
everything
else
seidenberg
recall
he
clearly
felt
exist
cellphone
feature
be
unduly
limit
he
just
get
off
on
us
about
voicemail
seidenberg
say
i
just
remember
the
incident
and
his
issue
be
you
know
when
you
make
a
call
you
can
only
answer
your
voicemail
in
the
order
in
which
the
voicemail
come
into
your
phone
you
can
t
skip
and
go
back
to
that
one
or
this
one
seidenberg
say
he
be
sort
of
let
us
know
that
he
have
design
something
that
be
very
different
these
be
interest
point
but
sideshow
compare
to
the
main
issue
that
be
on
everyone
s
mind
be
job
go
to
launch
a
version
of
his
new
product
that
would
be
compatible
with
verizon
wireless
cdma
base
network
apple
clearly
view
itself
as
an
international
technology
powerhouse
its
itunes
music
product
flew
off
the
shelf
from
beijing
to
buenos
aire
and
despite
verizon
wireless
tremendous
success
in
the
state
with
its
cdma
standard
the
international
gold
standard
for
cellular
product
remain
global
system
for
mobile
communication
or
gsm
the
verizon
team
be
certain
as
a
result
that
apple
would
launch
a
gsm
smartphone
as
they
would
come
to
be
call
would
job
be
willing
to
sell
a
version
of
the
iphone
with
a
cdma
chipset
as
well
nah
i
don
t
think
so
be
how
seidenberg
recall
job
response
seidenberg
say
we
kind
of
get
the
feel
when
he
left
the
room
that
we
be
not
go
to
be
select
to
do
that
and
he
be
go
to
pick
the
gsm
that
meant
they
be
go
to
release
the
iphone
through
verizon
rival
at
t
which
they
do
exclusively
for
at
t
customer
in
june
the
decision
be
of
a
piece
with
job
design
mastery
and
therefore
not
really
a
surprise
even
if
it
be
a
crush
disappointment
say
verizon
wireless
cmo
john
stratton
job
have
no
intention
of
building
multiple
skus
shelf
keep
unit
or
iteration
his
great
discipline
be
that
he
ll
do
more
with
less
than
anybody
on
the
planet
and
he
have
no
desire
to
fracture
or
fragment
his
manufacturing
his
design
his
development
his
delivery
the
engineering
so
gsm
be
the
worldwide
standard
it
be
the
obvious
choice
strigl
have
anticipate
as
much
as
well
his
ready
response
be
we
ll
school
him
seidenberg
recall
verizon
wireless
be
not
about
to
sit
around
wait
for
apple
to
change
its
mind
it
be
go
to
find
other
supplier
and
take
them
on
month
of
strategizing
follow
as
the
verizon
team
consider
product
offering
and
partner
who
could
help
them
offset
the
impact
of
at
t
s
exclusive
right
to
the

the
verizon
team
realize
that
disney

iger
be
right
it
be
hard
to
overstate
the
impact
of
apple
s
iphone
verizon
realize
it
have
to
up
its
game
and
fast
as
stratton

as
if
from
another
planet
five
minute
after
i
have
an
iphone
in
my
hand
it
be
very
clear
to
me
we
couldn
t
do
this
we
didn
t
have
the
competency
inside
the
business
to
produce
the
device
that
apple
have
just
put
on
the
table
we
recognize
that
the
world

google
walk
how
to
respond
to
the
iphone

speed
up

there
s
go

level
of
overlap
and
competition
but
we
re
primarily
a
network

seidenberg
freely
admit
that
the
technical
conversation
among
the
three

get
over
his
head
but
that
wasn

look
for
in
the
first
place
you

bit
closer
together

a
few
new
device
that
can
compete
with

a
way
to
reduce
the
tension
on
the
political
side

they
have
what
they

what
they

tension
get
the
process
go
you

to
keep
the
line
open
seidenberg

think
overall
people

you
guy
build
a
relationship
with
us
and
we
do
so
with
motorola
we
could
create
something
that
would
really
rival
the

and
at
that
point
android
wasn
t
do
anything
and
eric
today
if
you
interview
him
he
would
say
that
be
the
seminal
moment
for
android
really
become
a
rival
to
the
iphone
s
io
and
we
really
turn
that
into
something
work
with
team
from
google
and
handset
maker
motorola
the
verizon
team
developed
a
smartphone
alternative
to
the
iphone
call
the

it
be
a
crash
development
effort
that
collapse
a
typical

cycle
down
to
a
year
in
order
to
get
the
new

to

as
soon
as
possible
so
call
tiger
team
work
in
parallel
on
vary
aspect
of
the

and

to
speed

the

launch
in
the

meet
traditional
heavy

demand
for

an

it
have
that

outperform
those
offer
by
the

the

be
an
overnight
success
it
buoyed
spirit
and
sale
at
verizon
wireless
but
at
the
same
time
it
have
be
a
difficult
two
and
a
half
year
period
to
get
through
with

at
t
have
the
undeniably
hottest

on
the

the
only
issue
that
make
the
wait
for
the

at

tolerable
be
the
dismal
performance
of

it

in
this

nothing
drew

the

of
the

their

just
wasn

it
really
blew

so
we
held
our

we
be

grow
pretty
nicely
during

they
didn
t
carry
the

as
the

true
to
the

do
seidenberg
general
counsel
barr
and

in

take
issue
with
that
approach
barr
point
out
that
if
the

figure
out
as
it
be

to
do
that

not
the

to

up

barr
understood
the

point
of
view
that
they
didn
t
want
to
encourage
regulation
of

but
he
argue
that
to
give
the
company
as
much
leeway
as
possible
in
the
future
they
should
position
themselves
as
able

on

if

be
at
the
same
time
a
wireless
business
attorney
realize
that

be
planning
on
bidding
just
enough
for
the
c
block
spectrum
to
trigger
the
open

regulation
verizon
could
come
in
with
slightly
high
bid
and
secure
the
nationwide
block
of
spectrum
the
attorney
make
the
argument
that
while
nobody
want
additional
regulation
of
wireless
the
c
band
be
verizon
s
for
the
take
if
it
could
stomach
a
modicum
of
additional
regulation
spectrum
be
the
lifeblood
of
our
business
verizon
be
already
the
industry
leader
in

of
the
quality
of
its
national

at
the
time
of
the

in
the
expect

in

however
have
the

constantly
on

for
way

their

customer
clearly
expect

transmit
more

verizon
be

that
g
service
would
begin
roll
out
in
the
mhz
auction
offer
what
in
effect
be
a
one
stop
shopping
solution
to
verizon
s
need
for
great
breadth
and
depth
for
the

the

offer
a
once
in

opportunity
to
provide
a
long

foundation
for

as
a

mcadam
say
shortly
after
the

be
complete
seidenberg
add
that
it
be
nothing
short
of
a
transformative
opportunity
for
our
business
different
portion
of
the

have
different
characteristic

thus
be
suitable
for

dick

and
his

at

and

identify
the

meet
the

of

wireless
system
coast

spectrum
be
the
lifeblood
of
the

mcadam
say
so
when
something
like
come
along
we
look
at
it
very
very
closely
we
saw
a
unique
set
of
benefit
here
it
have
be
call
beachfront
property
but
i
think
the
benefit
be
of
the
best
propagation
the
best
overall
coverage
result
the
best
penetration
of
building
the
best

which
would
lead
to
the
best
capital
efficiency
and
be
all
in
our
mind
as
we
enter
this
auction
and
verizon

commitment
to
an

mcadam

i
go
back

look
it
s
go
to
cost
you
an
arm
and
a
leg
to
get
the
a
and
the
b
block
google
meanwhile
have
commit
that
it
would
bid
the
minimum
on
the
c
block
but
indicate
that
it
wasn
t
interested
in
bidding
high
that
left
the
field
open
for
verizon
mcadam
call
the
c

spectrum
by
far
the
high
value
create
spectrum
we
ve
ever
bought
in
the

because
at
t
wouldn
t
touch
it
nobody
else
would
touch
it
he
add
we
look
and
say
the
market
be
go
this
way
anyway
we
re
not
go
to
give
away
one
thing
and
we
re
go
to
steal
this

and
we
do
verizon

decide
to
go
big
verizon
bid
billion
for
the
c
band
of

in
it
be
a

financial

that
be
trigger
in
september
by
the
bankruptcy
of
lehman
brother
the
interest
thing
about
alltel
from
my
perspective
be
it
be
an
all
cash
deal
seidenberg
add
sprint
ceo
daniel
hesse
call
up
seidenberg
when

how
could
you

of
everything
else
you
ve
do
hesse
want
to
know
seidenberg
s
reply
alltel
wasn
t
even
really
a
stretch
in
term
of
verizon
s
financial
strength
the
ability
to
do
the
deal
be
a
tribute
to

s
rock
solid
finance
and
the
fact
that
it
be
a
cash
generate
machine
the
thing
that
s
most
powerful
to
me
about
alltel
say
seidenberg
be
that
we
spent
billion
and
we
have
it
paid
for
in
three
year
or
so
out
of
cash
flow
it
just
tell
you
the
amaze
power
of
the
business
when

about
the

ability
to
withstand
a
potential
severe
slowdown
trigger
by
the
global
financial
crisis
seidenberg
point
out
that
more
than
percent
of
its
wireless
customer
sign
two
year
contract
they
be
not
pay
their

month

the

could
operate
for
about

without
any
outside

not
many
company
could
say
that
as
they
watch

market
melt
down
in
the
final
month
of

early

verizon

it
increasingly
be
the

the

own
board
and
make
every
board
meeting
an
event
but
at
this
particular
meeting
in
march
some
of
the
director
be
in
a
temporary
state
of
shock
seidenberg
the
master
of
the
chessboard
strategy
who
have
position
verizon
at
the
forefront
of
the
telecommunication
industry
be
put
his
own
piece
in
play
although
just
seidenberg
told
his
director
you
need
to
start
think
about
my
successor
after
those
word
have
a
moment
to
register
some
director
blurt
out
be
you
leave
no
i
m
not
leave
he
reassure
them
what
he
be
do
he
say
be
prepare
the
organization
and
its
senior
team
for
a
multi
year
transition
to
the
next
generation
of
verizon
leadership
he
didn
t
want
to
risk
all
that
he
and
the
current
leadership
team
have
built
be
torn
apart
by
a
poorly
thought
out
and
poorly
execute
transition
we
re
not
have
any
discontinuity
seidenberg
like
many
corporate
executive
and
observer
at
the
time
have
be
alarmed
by
the
number
of
bumpy
succession
or
outright
succession
crisis
at
major
american
corporation
in
recent
year
ibm
and
hewlett
packard
for
instance
have
see
their
business
disrupt
and
their
reputation
tarnished
at
least
temporarily
by
either
poor
succession
planning
or
implementation
he
and
verizon
head
of
hr
marc
reed
who
be
at
the
board
meeting
that
day
be
determine
that
verizon
be
go
to
put
a
process
in
place
that
would
be
a
model
for
the
company
for
year
to
come
what
s
more
seidenberg
realize
that
successful
transition
involve
more
than
just
pick
a
new
ceo
so
this
be
not
just
about
a
new
ceo
seidenberg
say
to
the
board
this
be
about
a
full
transition
to
make
sure
that
when
we
pick
a
new
ceo
and
we
populate
some
of
the
proxy
position
we
will
have
continuity
he
have
watch
in
alarm
at
other
company
where
all
the
board
do
be
pick
a
ceo
then
all
of
a
sudden
you
change
everybody
and
you
have
discontinuity
seidenberg
say
we
re
not
have
any
discontinuity
plan
since
reed
have
move
from
the
head
of
hr
in
wireless
to
the
head
of
hr
for
all
of
verizon
in
early
he
and
seidenberg
have
be
talk
about
make
succession
planning
a
much
more
robust
process
talent
development
and
succession
planning
should
be
a
core
system
of
this
business
just
like
billing
reed
say
seidenberg
met
with
reed
one
day
and
he
say
you
know
there
s
no
magic
to
this
but
i
m
year
old
well
before
i
should
be
do
so
we
ve
get
seven
year
how
be
we
go
to
do
this
the
two
of
them
developed
what
they
term
their
plan
make
the
system
more
open
and
more
inclusive
while
ceo
succession
planning
would
capture
much
of
management
s
and
the
board
s
attention
for
the
next
several
year
less
visible
but
just
as
important
change
be
evolve
across
the
company
in
term
of
hire
and
promote
the
next
generation
of
verizon
leader
when
reed
take
over
hr
for
all
of
verizon
in
he
and
seidenberg
expand
upon
and
formalize
practice
that
seidenberg
have
be
encourage
for
year
as
a
corporate
leader
as
have
bruce
gordon
who
retire
in
it
be
always
my
mantra
that
i
would
make
opportunity
available
to
more
people
than
anybody
else
and
i
think
over
the
year
what
drove
me
be
to
try
to
find
time
and
place
to
make
the
system
more
open
and
more
inclusive
for
outsider
with
new
talent
and
for
diversity
seidenberg
say
every
year
i
have
a
meeting
with
all
of
our
top
people
seidenberg
say
and
in
addition
to
all
of
their
objective
and
everything
else
the
one
question
i
would
say
to
them
be
how
do
you
think
your
organization
be
do
on
give
people
more
of
an
opportunity
to
do
this
he
recall
almost
all
of
our
executive
thought
that
be
more
inclusive
be
the
right
thing
to
do
but
sometimes
the
pressure
of
the
business
result
in
people
fall
back
on
what
they
always
do
some
executive
would
say
we
do
not
have
the
requisite
talent
base
or
that
they
felt
long
stand
employee
should
be
reward
all
of
these
point
be
valid
but
in
an
organization
that
be
experience
the
explosive
growth
that
we
be
we
have
to
do
well
and
demonstrate
we
be
go
to
be
a
more
open
and
inclusive
company
we
may
have
make
some
mistake
along
the
way
but
the
great
good
be
serve
by
our
diligence
on
this
matter
and
most
important
to
me
be
that
the
succession
candidate
all
step
up
to
this
challenge
the
emphasis
on
minority
hire
continue
to
this
day
as
reed
explain
we
have
a
couple
of
year
to
create
the
job
that
we
thought
would
be
the
future
job
then
we
have
three
year
to
get
people
position
into
those
job
because
someone
would
have
to
retire
to
create
opening
for
young
candidate
once
we
have
the
field
narrow
in
term
of
what
would
be
the
key
job
then
we
have
two
year
of
work
with
the
board
and
operationalizing
it
so
people
could
be
see
as
the
leader
we
want
them
to
be
see
as
he
say
and
so
by
the
time
you
get
to
this
magical
moment
which
we
say
should
not
be
a
magical
moment
this
should
just
work
like
anything
else
seidenberg
told
the
board
there
be
seven
to
candidate
here
that
could
be
the
ceo
and
oh
by
the
way
here
s
another
dozen
people
that
will
populate
the
proxy
position
that
would
open
up
as
candidate
shuttle
between
new
position
seidenberg
also
inform
the
board
that
he
reed
and
the
hr
subcommittee
of
the
board
would
track
a
list
of
external
potential
ceo
at
the
same
time
they
be
groom
internal
candidate
of
course
since
there
be
many
season
veteran
on
the
board
they
immediately
challenged
whether
there
be
really
ceo
candidate
and
another
ready
to
fill
proxy
position
it
be
a
fun
discussion
because
some
director
want
me
to
rate
them
right
away
instead
we
agree
to
let
the
process
work
seidenberg
say
implement
correctly
the
succession
plan
would
have
a
positive
impact
from
those
who
be
move
on
to
those
who
be
advance
in
their
career
but
not
yet
season
enough
to
be
consider
ceo
material
not
only
do
we
have
great
leader
that
have
left
a
legacy
move
on
and
still
be
very
supportive
of
the
company
reed
say
but
as
we
be
raise
the
handful
of
candidate
that
be
eventually
go
to
compete
and
succeed
for
ivan
s
job
we
then
also
built
the
new
operating
team
so
as
lowell
come
up
he
have
a
team
that
be
in
place
ready
to
do
their
job
i
m
ready
director
bob
lane
applaud
the
systematic
approach
seidenberg
and
reed
be
take
to
succession
like
seidenberg
lane
the
chairman
and
ceo
of
deere
co
have
see
too
many
case
of
rush
or
poorly
thought
out
succession
plan
go
awry
for
succession
to
work
the
incumbent
have
to
be
ready
the
candidate
have
to
be
ready
and
the
board
have
to
be
ready
lane
share
with
the
board
if
you
try
to
move
the
process
before
one
of
the
three
be
ready
there
will
be
nervous
energy
in
the
system
and
you
ll
get
the
wrong
result
seidenberg
declare
to
the
board
that
he
be
get
the
process
start
i
m
first
i
m
ready
seidenberg
told
the
board
that
he
and
reed
would
discus
the
succession
process
with
the
human
resource
committee
of
the
board
at
every
meeting
but
only
with
the
full
board
twice
a
year
so
the
issue
wouldn
t
become
a
distraction
seidenberg
also
refuse
to
tip
his
hand
and
suggest
who
the
front
runner
be
often
to
the
frustration
of
certain
board
member
aramark
chairman
and
ceo
joe
neubauer
chairman
of
the
hr
committee
at
verizon
say
that
it
be
a
very
long
process
again
very
explicit
deliberation
both
by
the
human
resource
committee
and
the
full
board
board
member
consistently
prod
the
ceo
for
more
information
he
be
a
very
cagey
player
in
this
and
i
admire
him
enormously
neubauer
say
he
never
want
to
set
a
specific
time
frame
and
he
always
say
that
if
thing
work
out
it
would
be
before
many
board
member
expect
a
decision
i
will
surprise
you
on
the
short
side
rather
than
the
long
side
seidenberg
told
the
board
ivan
be
always
close
to
the
vest
on
his
feeling
about
these
guy
add
director
tom
o
brien
he
have
a
unique
way
about
him
i
admire
him
greatly
by
the
way
just
for
his
business
acumen
and
as
an
individual
o
brien
add
he
always
felt
that
you
could
say
wonderful
thing
about
a
person
and
one
negative
and
that
s
the
only
thing
people
remember
the
board
would
be
able
to
evaluate
the
candidate
some
of
whom
they
have
already
met
at
board
meeting
as
they
present
to
the
board
more
often
during
the
selection
process
neubauer
say
we
talk
about
let
them
demonstrate
their
expertise
let
them
demonstrate
how
they
present
to
the
board
how
they
handle
question
from
the
board
i
m
always
amuse
when
senior
executive
accuse
me
sometimes
of
give
them
ongoing
performance
review
and
i
have
to
remind
them
that
every
time
you
present
something
to
somebody
else
there
s
a
performance
review
go
on
it
s
not
explicit
it
s
not
open
but
that
s
what
s
go
on
that
s
how
you
form
opinion
over
a
period
of
time
director
john
snow
former
chairman
and
ceo
of
csx
corp
and
former
u
s
treasury
secretary
be
also
a
member
of
the
human
resource
committee
so
people
be
get
shuffle
around
move
around
look
at
observe
test
and
report
on
to
the
human
resource
committee
ivan
would
ask
us
what
do
you
think
you
see
be
they
change
be
they
perform
the
way
you
would
think
they
should
want
commercial
leader
what
be
seidenberg
and
reed
work
with
the
board
look
for
in
the
next
ceo
commercial
leader
say
reed
people
who
could
look
at
our
business
understand
our
technology
and
our
operational
process
and
then
figure
out
how
they
could
pinpoint
external
change
and
then
transform
our
business
model
to
monetize
the
asset
and
investment
we
have
make
in
the
company
up
to
that
time
they
also
evaluate
potential
candidate
accord
to
their
track
record
in
four
key
area
run
large
team
p
l
accountability
corporate
staff
assignment
and
global
experience
to
avoid
the
trap
experienced
by
other
company
in
which
board
member
start
to
favor
candidate
base
on
their
exposure
to
them
at
meeting
or
other
event
seidenberg
and
reed
intentionally
have
candidate
sit
by
different
board
member
from
meeting
to
meeting
and
at
dinner
where
executive
mingle
with
the
director
at
one
event
verizon
wireless
coo
lowell
mcadam
thought
that
his
chance
to
reach
the
top
might
have
fade
he
have
be
seat
next
to
seidenberg
s
wife
phyllis
not
a
high
power
board
member
then
it
occur
to
him
that
his
ceo
s
wife
might
have
developed
some
fairly
astute
observation
about
what
trait
to
look
for
in
a
future
leader
as
much
as
seidenberg
and
reed
be
genuine
in
their
willingness
to
consider
external
candidate
over
time
it
become
apparent
that
they
be
favor
a
homegrown
future
ceo
for
one
many
of
the
initial
external
candidate
they
identify
at
mid
decade
have
demonstrate
poor
leadership
in
their
career
or
be
snap
up
by
other
fortune
company
in
search
of
fresh
leadership
as
the
verizon
search
process
near
its
climax
more
broadly
seidenberg
in
particular
felt
that
the
next
ceo
should
have
deep
vertical
knowledge
of
the
range
of
verizon
business
and
at
the
same
time
be
immerse
in
the
verizon
corporate
culture
seidenberg
say
simply
i
always
thought
we
have
a
deep
bench
and
i
always
thought
it
be
part
of
my
job
to
give
the
board
choice
for
succession
start
with
qualify
internal
candidate
seidenberg
recall
his
discussion
with
bill
ferguson
when
he
be

knew
our

sometimes
it
might
be
necessary
to
pick
someone

after
more
than
major
merger

she
add
he
take
the
current
management
and
position
them
so
that
we
could
bring
up
the
new
high
potential
because
the
current
management
be
basically
the
same
age
as
ivan
they
have
grown
up
together
whether
they
have
the
capacity
or
not
to
be
the
ceo
wasn
t
even
a
relevant
question
because
they
didn
t
have
the
runway
so
he
manage
those
people
to
where
he
could
position
them
where
they
be
still
contributor
and
then
retire
at
an
appropriate
time
and
space
between
the
different
retirement
and
move
in
the
up
and
come
people
and
let
the
board
see
all
the
candidate
and
begin
to
make
choice
about
ok
this
be
clearly
not
go
to
work
these
people
clearly
have
an
opportunity
but
i
will
tell
you
i
still
believe
he
knew
where
he
be
go
and
he
just
let
us
get
comfortable
with
it
over
maybe
three
year
i
mean
it
be
nice
to
have
choice
most
of
the
time
on

you
don
t
have

replace

as

of
the

unit
one
of
the
great
challenge
that
seidenberg
and
reed
often
discuss
be
the
fact
that
verizon
s
next
generation
of
leader
be
replace
some
renowned
figure
in
the
business
who
replaces
larry

fred

we
have
to
teach
our
people
that
change
be
constant
and
never
defend
or
attack
the
past
but
constantly
add
new
value
to
your
position
and
the
business
seidenberg
say
this
be
one
of
the
great
lesson
learn
by
serve
on
outside
board
seidenberg
learn
from
his
experience
and
through
serve
on
other
board
that
the
ceo
be
in
charge
of
all
the
bad
news
and
also
in
charge
of
figure
out
the
future
this
make
me
sensitive
to
executive
who
could
handle
bad
news
by
focus
on
what
to
do
next
and
those
who
have
optimism
and
passion
for
the
future
he
say
lightning
bolt
learn
while
seidenberg
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
mapping
out
career
track
for
rise
executive
across
the
company
during
the
succession
process
he
also
continued
in
his
role
as
mentor
in
chief
he
counsel
leader
during
meeting
and
presentation
and
help
them
to
learn
by
do
rather
than
dictate
how
they
should
approach
or
resolve
challenge
cmo
stratton
say
that
such
lesson
learn
be
often
revelation
that
he
and
others
value
even
if
they
didn
t
always
appreciate
how
focus
seidenberg
be
on
the
learn
process
at
the
time
i
ll
describe
something
that
i
m
embarrass
to
say
happen
to
me
more
than
once
now
ivan
s
the
chairman
of
the
board
ivan
be
fly
at
a
much
high
altitude
than
i
and
once
in
a
while
we
d
come
in
in
a
vlc
verizon
leadership
council
meeting
or
whatever
we
d
go
down
into
the
detail
of
a
particular
thing
that
be
happen
in
the
market
and
would
be
describe
the
nuance
of
the
initiative
and
where
we
be
hop
to
go
and
here
s
the
strategic
aspect
of
it
and
here
s
what
we
re
go
to
do
and
how
i
d
be
to
minute
into
the
deal
and
ivan
would
ask
a
question
and
i
would
hear
the
question
i
d
think
to
myself
uh
oh
he
s
not
get
it
maybe
i
m
not
explain
this
the
right
way
or
i
ve
get
to
cut
him
some
slack
i
m
do
this
you
know
he
s
not
really
so
anyway
i
d
try
to
answer
the
question
politely
and
everything
else
and
think
to
myself
ok
i
ve
get
to
figure
out
how
to
make
sure
that
he
s
with
me
on
this
thing
but
we
re
pretty
good
and
he
would
always
say
look
it
sound
like
you
ve
get
it
keep
go
do
your
deal
so
i
go
back
to
work
i
forget
all
about
that
exchange
and
maybe
day
day
later
i
d
be
work
on
this
thing
and
as
be
always
the
case
it
s
fluid
the
thing
move
around
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
have
this
insight
maybe
i
should
do
this
and
i
m
tell
you
this
happen
way
more
than
once
i
stop
in
my
track
and
go
that
s
the
question
he
ask
me
four
month
ago
i
have
to
say
i
can
still
feel
what
that
felt
like
you
know
that
moment
that
lightning
bolt
that
blast
a
hole
in
your
desk
it
be
to
me
an
unbelievable
thing
that
he
could
have
such
clarity
and
could
be
so
many
move
ahead
of
where
i
be
even
though
i
m
not
a
dope
and
i
m
in
this
full
time
drive
it
hard
i
m
in
the
deep
end
of
the
pool
and
that
to
me
be
an
amaze
gift
whatever
the
thing
be
that
i
be
work
on
that
be
so
essential
i
think
what
be
interest
about
ivan
be
he
played
the
long
game
in
everything
he
do
and
i
suspect
that
in
many
case
he
thought
that
the
development
of
me
as
a
leader
and
as
a
businessperson
be
more
important
than
the
thing
i
be
work
on
so
maybe
he
could
help
me
cut
four
month
off
of
my
insight
but
earn
the
insight
be
more
valuable
in
the
long
run
and
that
s
pretty
extraordinary
put
vodafone
on
hold
for
year
seidenberg
and
his
leadership
team
as
well
as
the
board
have
be
discuss
various
strategy
they
could
pursue
to
buy
out
vodafone
s
percent
stake
in
verizon
wireless
not
own
percent
of
the
wireless
business
kept
verizon
from
garner
some
important
economy
of
scale
and
operating
efficiency
verizon
s
business
unit
be
get
too
big
and
interconnect
for
the
joint
venture
structure
to
remain
viable
indefinitely
in
preparation
for
the
need
to
borrow
to
fund
the
purchase
of
the
vodafone
stake
verizon
have
be
consistently
reduce
verizon
wireless
debt
load
for
year
to
well
below
industry
average
that
have
the
add
benefit
of
make
verizon
even
strong
financially
than
it
might
typically
have
be
as
the
company
enter
the
financial
crisis
vodafone
not
surprisingly
have
be
advocate
that
highly
profitable
verizon
wireless
pay
vodafone
an
annual
dividend
with
the
cash
it
be
generate
instead
of
consistently
pay
down
debt
but
as
the
operating
partner
with
a
percent
stake
verizon
do
not
yet
have
to
compromise
on
dividend
to
please
its
minority
partner
it
use
to
drive
them
crazy
because
they
would
say
you
ve
get
to
give
us
a
dividend
seidenberg
recall
and
i
would
say
no
the
way
you
re
go
to
get
a
dividend
be
you
re
go
to
sell
your
share
back
to
verizon
it
be
a
predictable
conversation
do
openly
and
in
good
cheer
but
nevertheless
a
serious
thorn
in
my
side
he
add
verizon
s
board
be
split
on
the
issue
of
how
seidenberg
should
approach
vittorio
colao
vodafone
s
ceo
of
europe
the
entrepreneur
among
the
group
include
richard
carrion
would
say
impatiently
just
make
him
an
offer
buy
him
others
include
sandy
moose
would
balk
at
the
figure
be
bandy
about
as
the
price
for
buying
out
vodafone
director
joe
neubauer
grumble
that
every
time
they
look
at
the
issue
again
the
price
have
go
up
another
billion
base
on
the
success
of
the
business
seidenberg
and
colao
held
a
number
of
meeting
at
which
they
discuss
the
issue
include
during
long
walk
in
hyde
park
in
london
and
battery
park
in
low
manhattan
seidenberg
even
met
with
vodafone
s
board
of
director
at
colao
s
invitation
they
ask
him
what
he
would
do
in
their
shoe
in
a
nice
way
i
say
i
d
sell
to
verizon
and
reinvest
the
proceeds
in
european
market
where
vodafone
s
market
share
have
slip
due
in
part
to
under
investment
he
say
seidenberg
left
the
meeting
with
the
distinct
impression
that
be
not
the
message
vodafone
want
to
hear
by
seidenberg
conclude
that
as
much
as
he
want
to
make
a
buyout
of
vodafone
the
capstone
of
his
career
as
verizon
ceo
it
wasn
t
go
to
happen
on
his
watch
the
deal
be
a
victim
of
his
own
success
he
realize
that
vodafone
be
very
sensitive
to
not
be
perceive
as
another
notch
on
my
belt
which
be
what
one
of
the
vodafone
director
jokingly
say
at
their
meeting
seidenberg
say
he
met
with
mcadam
and
the
board
and
told
them
that
mcadam
first
as
coo
and
then
ceo
of
verizon
wireless
have
developed
a
relationship
with
colao
at
the
operational
level
he
should
be
the
point
man
go
forward
in
advocate
for
a
resolution
of
the
partial
ownership
of
vodafone
seidenberg
also
thought
it
be
important
to
reassure
verizon
shareholder
that
the
company
would
not
do
an
irresponsible
deal
and
wildly
overpay
for
vodafone
s
share
narrow
the
field
seidenberg
broach
the
idea
of
strigl
s
retirement
with
his
coo
in
he
push
back
initially
but
a
few
week
later
strigl
come
into
seidenberg
s
office
and
announce
that
he
have
decide
to
retire
because
it
be
time
to
move
on
after
year
of
service
his
retirement
be
announce
that
september
effective
at
year
end
seidenberg
described
strigl
at
the
time
as
truly
one
of
the
legendary
figure
of
our
industry
he
built
verizon
wireless
into
one
of
the
most
amaze
growth
company
in
this
or
any
industry
his
work
ethic
and
high
standard
inspire
generation
of
verizon
leader
and
help
create
a
culture
of
performance
that
be
his
last
legacy
to
our
company
after
strigl
s
retirement
there
be
no
no
at
verizon
seidenberg
and
the
board
weren
t
tip
their
hand
on
the
succession
race
nor
be
they
prepared
to
make
a
decision
at
that
point
to
many
the
field
appear
to
have
narrow
to
a
two
person
race
however
base
on
the
fact
that
verizon
sec
filing
disclose
that
the
board
have
grant
three
year
retention
bonus
to
lowell
mcadam
and
john
killian
in
december
such
bonus
be
intend
to
provide
financial
inducement
to
stay
with
a
company
and
not
accept
offer
to
take
a
senior
position
at
another
corporation
neither
seidenberg
nor
the
board
make
any
commitment
about
the
candidate
stand
at
the
time
even
though
they
have
be
grant
the

always
the

the

both
in

be
as
cfo

they
each
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
with
the
board
at
this
point
and
would
if
anything
step
up
their
exposure
as
progress
but
they
be
hardly
cookie
cutter
candidate
killian
be
a
natural
presenter
before
the
board
smart
succinct
every
hair
in
place
and
dress
as
conservatively
as
a

model
he
look
and
act
the
part
of
a
senior
financial
officer

at
the
top
of
his
game
mcadam
have
be
born
in
upstate
new

and
serve
in

but
formative
year
spent
in

give
him
a
taste
for
loafer
oddly
color
shirt
and
loud
tie
buy
one
blue
suit
seidenberg
plead
with
him
as
they
discuss
his
board
interaction
when
they
listen
to
you
all
they
can
do
be
look
at
your
tie
train
as
an
engineer
mcadam
s
idea
of
a
great
day
at
work
be
break
down
process
and
make
them
more
efficient
not
attend
a
board
meeting
when
strigl
retire
institutional
investor
in
particular
who
have
be
follow
the
company
closely
saw
both
killian
and
mcadam
as
the
two
most
senior
executive
everyone
knew
they
be
great
executive
and
both
highly
qualify
there
be
no
drama
seidenberg
say
because
investor
knew
we
have
a
plan
and
a
deep
bench
and
john
and
lowell
be
both
commit
to
the
other
s
success
he
add
i
knew
i
be
fast
approach
the
end
of
my
run
and
once
the
shareholder
give
their
implicit
and
explicit
support
for
both
john
and
lowell
i
be
on
the
home
stretch
with
the
board
coach
mcadam
say
that
seidenberg
work
closely
with
him
and
killian
during
this
period
to
expose
them
to
issue
a
ceo
face
he
take
me
to
meeting
with
john
chamber
of
cisco
and
i
get
to
watch
how
ivan
handle
john
and
he
d
occasionally
throw
me
a
question
and
then
if
i
didn
t
handle
it
right
ivan
would
sort
of
come
back
in
as
he
do
without
be
confrontational
or
anything
but
he
d
come
on
and
he
d
either
ask
you
an
obvious
question
or
he
d
make
a
statement
and
you
could
see
he
be
just
sort
of
teach
you
in
the
process
mcadam
say
in
addition
to
take
mcadam
along
on
meeting
with
key
vendor
seidenberg
do
involve
me
as
we
get
closer
in
a
couple
of
the
board
recruitment
mcadam
say
when
he
be
look
for
somebody
on
the
board
and
then
he
start
opening
up
about
how
you
manage
a
particular
board
member
a
little
bit
more
mcadam
say
he
be
feed
me
during
the
process
i
get
the
sense
that
the
only
real
two
candidate
even
though
there
be
more
on
the
list
be
john
killian
and
me
mcadam
say
and
he
do
similar
thing
with
john
i
think
in
addition
to
work
closely
with
the
top
two
candidate
seidenberg
who
turn
in
december
also
found
himself
need
to
let
his
board
know
that
the
clock
be
tick
on
the
succession
process
at
one
meeting
they
be
have
a
hard
time
get
focus
on
it
and
they
thought
eh
if
we
think
john
or
lowell
need
more
time
we
can
talk
him
into
stay
another
year
or
so
seidenberg
recall
he
have
to
make
the
process
real
for
them
and
underscore
that
this
be
much
more
than
an
hr
committee
exercise
even
though
the
board
have
yet
to
select
his
successor
seidenberg
told
the
board
in
reference
to
stay
an
extra
year
you
re
not
go
to
talk
me
into
do
that
he
add
let
me
offer
you
a
thought
in
six
month
i
will
no
longer
fly
on
company
business
i
m
do
no
more
overnight
trip
to
california
no
more
overnight
trip
to
hong
kong
no
more
two
day
trip
to
asia
i
m
not
do
it
i
remember
one
director
fran
keeth
say
he
s
serious
then
they
get
serious
seidenberg
be
increasingly
comfortable
with
his
two
insider
front
runner
during
and
for
a
portion
of
i
have
the
chance
to
discus
both
lowell
s
and
john
s
view
of
the
future
of
the
business
many
time
they
be
both
so
far
ahead
of
where
i
be
at
that
point
in
my
career
it
just
reinforce
the
idea
about
my
own
timing
he
add
it
s
a
great
lesson
for
board
and
ceo
there
be
a
natural
rhythm
to
industry
evolution
company
evolution
and
ceo
tenure
bob
lane
be
exactly
right
all
three
have
to
be
align
for
the
process
to
produce
a
good
outcome

jump
off
the

of
the

here
life
s
be
pretty
good

mcadam
recall
later
i
have
to
admit
secretly
i
be
think
i
wouldn
t
get
it
and
i
d
just
go
do
something
else
it
wasn
t
something
that
i
felt
i
really
need
i
think
my
philosophy
be
if
you
want
this
job
too
badly
you
won
t
do
it
well
while
it
wasn
t
widely
know
mcadam
have
turn
down
a
promotion
several
year
earlier
with
the
understand
that
it
might
have
permanently
derail
his
chance
to
become
ceo
of
verizon
just
as
the

he
be
take
himself
out
of
contention
for
the
top
job
at
verizon
mcadam
s
stance
be
so
be
it
and
he
assume
that
the
best
he
could
hope
for
be
to
top
out
as
the
head
of
the

met
with
each
verizon
director
so
they
could
get
to
know
him
well
one
of
the
thing
that
i
say
be
i
want
to
make
sure
that
none
of
you
have
any
reservation
because
if
you
think
you
ve

well
option
you

by
the
time
the
decision
be
make
many
on
the

have
be
lean
toward
mcadam
we
all
agree
that
the
future
of
the
business
be
really
wireless
so
ivan
s
successor
be
go
to
come
out
of
the
wireless
business
we
need
that
experience
expertise
she
say
by
the
time
lowell
step
into
the
role
the
director
be
very
comfortable
with
him
they
knew
him
they
have
see
him
in
action
and
be
well
aware
of
his
accomplishment
moose
say

in
many
respect
be
like

be
very
straightforward
very
honest
she
add
he
s
a
man
who
know
what
he
doesn
t
know
i
like
to
work
with
people
who
know
what
they
don
t
know
and
they
re
not
try
to

you
they
re
willing
to
ask

that
he
want
to
not

to
go
ahead
and
name

new
ceo
new
era
verizon
watcher
be
expect
a
september
announcement
that
mcadam
would
be
name
ceo
in
october
one
year
after
his
elevation
to
coo
seidenberg
told
the
board
he
want
to
move
up
the
announcement
to
july
and
make
the
promotion
effective
august
that
would
give
the
new
ceo
more
positive
momentum
for
continue
to
drive
change
at
the
company
if
his
promotion
be
ahead
of
schedule
seidenberg
have
an
ulterior
motive
as
well
the
early
promotion
would
make
mcadam
the
sole
senior
verizon
officer
the
union
would
have
to
deal
with
when
they
renegotiate
their
contract
which
be
up
in
early
august
i
have
be
through
enough
contract
seidenberg
say
here
be
the
issue
i
wasn
t
go
to
be
there
so
why
would
i
negotiate
a
contract
that
i
wasn
t
go
to
be
accountable
for
so
to
me
i
think
that
s
play
team
ball
seidenberg
remain
verizon
chairman
through
year
end
and
then
mcadam
as
expect
assume
that
title
as
well
seidenberg
and
reed
have
work
for
year
to
craft
a
succession
process
at
verizon
that
would
be
second
to
none
in
prepare
the
corporation
for
its
next
growth
phase
as
mcadam
told
fortune
magazine
while
still
coo
ivan
get
all
the
tool
and
put
them
into
the
toolbox
now
it
s
up
to
us
to
take
those
tool
and
apply
them
to
take
the
company
to
the
next
level
seidenberg
say
at
the
end
of
the
process
when
the
board
select
lowell
not
only
do
they
select
a
great
executive
but
a
passionate
and

person
who
care
deeply
about
the

ask
seidenberg
what
s
be
the
key
thing
behind
his
and
verizon
s
success
i
never
thought
of
the
network
as
a
commodity
seidenberg
told
him
i
thought
the
network
be
go
to
be
our
competitive
weapon
and
we
need
to
differentiate
ourselves
with
a
network
look
back
what
be
the
three
thing
you
re
proudest
of
carrion
ask
the
company
be
a
lot
strong
now
than
it
be
seidenberg
reply
we
re
independent
we
control
our
own
destiny
and
i
m
very
proud
of
how
our
people
step
up
during
that
will
always
be
a
source
of
pride
to
me
carrion
echoed
many
verizon
insider
and
those
who
have
follow
the
company
closely
when
he
say
recently
people
don
t
understand
what
be
built
here
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
what
the
landscape
look
like
year
ago
and
what
it
be
today
and
how
he
maneuver
to
create
clearly
a
premier
telecom
company
not
only
in
the
u
s
but
in
the
world
and
how
he
very
deliberately
put
those
piece
together
with
one
or
two
mistake
along
the
way
without
a
doubt
but
he
put
together
a
hell
of
a
company
which
be
what
we
have
today
he
add
with
people
knit
together
the
different
organization
you
come
up
with
a
verizon
culture
that
be
very
clear
today
it
s
a
great
great
american
company
it
be
put
together
in
a
short
period
of
time

somebody
who
knew

be
do
seidenberg
could

back
on
his

the
leadership
team

the

that
he
couldn

define
with
any
accuracy
in
my
consult

have
highlight
ivan

s
leadership

both
agree
that

be
far
from
a

for

after
all
he
do
not
have
much

nor
have
he
risen
through
the
financial
rank
of
the

be
the
two
most
direct

conclude
correctly
as
it
turn
out
that
seidenberg
s
clear
curiosity

outweigh
the
negative
include
the
fact
that
not
all
of
the
nynex

have
support
his
choice
i
continued
to
consult
with
seidenberg
for
another
year
we
be
constantly
adapt
the
idea
of
what
the

the

the
broad
trend
toward

it
become

to
both
of
us
that
the
next

be
face
a
range
of
challenge

in

exceed
those
face
by

the

his
dominant
skill
and
his
capacity
to
learn
in
the
broad
meaning
of
the
term
couple
with
his
natural
curiosity
and
his
willingness
to
adapt
to
the
demand
of
the
future
on
top
of
outstanding

make
him
the

choice
of
the

that
this

that

spur
another

and
use
the

lynch
say
the
only
difference
be
seemingly
minor
and
at
that
point
i

the
wisdom

highly
beneficial

he
realize

first
as
cmo
and
then
as
coo
for
month
at
a
time
she
seem
to
be
in
constant
motion
meeting
with

from
the

up

explode
on

everyone
expect
that
growth
to
accelerate
far
as
more
lte

drove
great

the
answer
be
obvious
to

have
their

stream
and
get
rid
of
the

pretty

i

run
around
the

try

develop
this

hopefully
people
be
go
to
want
to
buy

but
verizon

question
the

of
the

colao

in

walden

be
more
than
vindicate
lo
and
behold
walden
say
here
we
be
now
where
people
just
can
t
get
enough
data
consumption
we
get
a
tremendous
amount
of
support
from
the
supplier
because
they
be
anxious
to
get
lte
out
there
and
profit
from
equipment
sale
lynch
say
i
get
a
tremendous
amount
of
shall
we
say
cold
shoulder
of
discomfort
from
a
lot
of
carrier
around
the
world
because
they
have
yet
to
finish
deploy
g
and
or
they
want
to
have
g
last
a
lot
longer
before
they
begin
an
investment
cycle
in
g
nevertheless
lynch
and
his
team
kept
their
focus
squarely
on
provide
the
best
network
experience
for
the
customer
as
verizon
s
key
competitive
advantage
i
believe
that
in
order
to
stay
ahead
of
the
competition
in
the
u
s
in
order
to
maintain
the
best
quality
of
service
possible
for
the
customer
which
be
how
you
compete
and
succeed
early
lte
be
the
right
thing
to
do
he
say
innovation
center
verizon
cto
lynch
want
to
kick
start
the
collaboration
among
verizon
and
its
supplier
and
developer
that
be
necessary
to
make
the
transition
to
g
a
success
gurnani
move
from
president
of
the
western
area
to
head
of
wireless
new
product
in
and
join
lynch
to
help
develop
and
launch
lte
as
an
initial
step
he
create
a
g
venture
forum
that
brought
together
equipment
manufacturer
and
chipset
ecosystem
application
service
more
be
need
say
lynch
at
this
point
in
time
all
we
have
be
verizon
announce
they
re
go
to
deploy
lte
and
lucent
and
ericsson
and
nokia
and
the
industry
association
gsma
announce
that
they
re
go
to
support
it
we
don
t
really
have
yet
the
ecosystem
that
support
the
application
and
the
revenue
opportunity
on
the
lte
network
so
how
do
you
get
one
what
i
thought
we
could
do
be
take
one
of
the
technology
hub
of
the
country
and
develop
a
facility
where
potential
application
developer
and
potential
technology
company
and
large
customer
could
go
and
see
the
benefit
of
lte
and
get
some
help
with
develop
their
application
for
use
on
lte
and
so
i
thought
that
we
need
a
place
where
you
could
innovate
as
necessary
we
knew
that
the
customer
would
appreciate
lte
if
they
knew
what
could
be
do
with
it
we
knew
that
there
would
need
to
be
an
ecosystem
of
developer
around
lte
in
order
to
assist
the
customer
or
position
the
customer
to
utilize
the
benefit
of
lte
wow
factor
lynch
and
his
team
decide
to
locate
the

there
be

they
want
the

to
make
an
impression
let
s
create
a
marketing
focus
innovation
center
and
build
that
innovation

in
such
a
way
that
when

drive
up
to
it
they

when
you
walk

you
say
wow
this

then
in
each
of
the

you
see
a
demo
or
a
development
underway
where
the
customer
or
the
developer
can
say
wow
lte
can
do
that
he
add
so
at
different
level
what
i
try
to
do
be
to
create

verizon

i
look
at
this

and
it
s
unbelievable
stratton

the
first
thing
that
come

be
where
s
the

there
be
i
think
of
the

meaning
automate

we
have
a
problem
in
that
moment
stratton
say
i
go
ok
i
know
what
i
m
go
to
be
do
for
the
next
three
year
the
business
have
grown
via
acquisition
first
at
mci
and
then
as
part
of
verizon
not
enough
time
and
effort
have
be
direct
at
rationalize
fundamental
engineering
and
business
process
the
enterprise
legacy
business
be
in
secular
decline
with
revenue
drop
by
a
very
high
single
to
low
double
digit
level
and
it
s
a
very
very
big
business
that
s
come
down
that
s
where
all
the
profit
be
too
stratton
say
so
you
re
run
to
replace
those
revenue
with
new
business
like
cloud
like
cyber
security
like
ip
communication
and
all
the
rest
stratton
have
his
team
get
to
work
their
first
goal
be
to
get
their
arm
around
the
process
and
start
to
streamline
if
i
don
t
streamline
process
i
also
can
t
fix
my
labor
model
i
can
t
take
cost
out
of
the
business
it
be
really
really
a
challenge
for
the
next
couple
of
year
as
the
leader
of
that
business
it
be
the
least
sexy
thing
that
i
can
say
without
hesitation
that
i
ve
do
in
my
entire
life
but
it
be
important
for
me
personally
i
ve
learn
more
in
those
two
year
that
i
maybe
do
in
any
other
phase
of
my
career
on
level
the
complexity
of
the
product
set
and
the
solution
be
beyond
anything
he
have
experienced
in
the
wireless
side
of
the
company
stratton
say
he
also
have
a
great
opportunity
to
interact
with
multinational
company
leader
around
the
world
and
understand
their
business
problem
there
be
some
dark
moment
in
the
process
of
learn
about
run
a
business
that
s
in
decline
and
how
to
regenerate
it
and
build
a
leadership
team
but
they
manage
to
turn
the
business
around
all
i
have
know
in
my
entire
career
in
verizon
and
verizon
wireless
be
top
level
growth
and
success
and
so
just
from
the
personal
side
that
be
tough
those
be
tough
period
as
the

drew
upon

in

learn
an
important

go
forward

do
not
fit
all
they
learn
that
just
as
they
have

off

much

mcadam

the
follow

verizon
add

verizon
paid

in

it
be
verizon
s
first
major
enterprise
acquisition
since
its
billion
purchase
of
mci
in
the

act

there
be
little
difference
between
the
establish

and
the
cloud
compute
upstart
in
retrospect
mcadam
say
that
be
a
mistake
terremark
become
the
shiny
new
penny
and
we
brutally
ruin
that
company
to
be
honest
we
change
all
their
compensation
procedure
change
all
their
system
all
their
capital
have
to
go
into
the
big
melt
pot
of
verizon
s
capital
budget
and
it
get
lose
and
so
we
underinvested
in
it
and
we
didn
t
respect
the
culture
that
they
have
in
that
company
a
cloud
company
versus
the
big
bureaucracy
and
literally
i
think
it
be
out
of
of
their
top
people
left
within
month
it
be
a
lesson
mcadam
wouldn
t
forget
buying
out
vodafone
with
seidenberg
step
down
as
chairman
of
verizon
at
year
end
mcadam
start
as
verizon
s
sole
leader
the
company
be
firmly
launch
on
a
new
era
yet
at
the
top
of
mcadam
s
to
do
list
for
be
unfinished
business
what
to
do
about
vodafone
s
percent
interest
in
verizon
wireless
coincidentally
that
be
also
the
most
important
issue
that
vodafone
ceo
vittorio
colao
need
to
resolve
the
two
telecommunication
executive
have
know
each
other
for
more
than
year
they
have
grown
up
together
in
the
business
and
be
of
the
same
generation
with
mcadam
colao
no
longer
felt
like
or
be
perceive
as
the
junior
partner
in
talk
with
his
verizon
counterpart
as
he
have
with
seidenberg
each
executive
successful
in
his
own
right
reason
that
it
be
time
to
move
beyond
their
joint
venture
that
while
highly
successful
be
keep
both
corporate
parent
from
invest
most
effectively
for
the
future
they
have
some
basic
question
to
answer
should
they
consider
merge
the
two
company
do
verizon
want
to
buy
vodafone
or
conversely
sell
to
vodafone
assume
the
price
be
right
the
status
quo
be
increasingly
leave
mcadam
and
his
team
hamstrung
if
you
start
to
look
at
thing
like
mobile
video
and
the
internet
of
thing
mcadam
say
vodafone
block
everything
we
want
to
do
that
be
across
business
unit
i
knew
we
have
to
get
vodafone
out
of
the
picture
or
we
be
just
go
to
be
so
bureaucratic
and
so
slow
we
d
never
be
able
to
get
there
he
add
if
you
look
at
mobile
video
all
of
our
content
relationship
be
with
fios
but
we
knew
the
future
be
go
to
be
more
mobile
centric
where
we
have
a
lot
more
customer
million
customer
versus
million
customer
so
we
be
not
get
the
scale
advantage
every
time
we
try
to
do
something
with
video
on
mobile
we
would
find
out
that
the
contract
that
we
have
didn
t
give
us
the
right
to
do
that
so
you
either
have
to
try
to
figure
out
a
way
to
measure
everything
and
reward
everything
cross
boundary
or
you
just
get
rid
of
the
boundary
and
i
decide
to
take
the
easy
way
and
get
rid
of
the
cross
boundary
among
the
option
under
consideration
mcadam
and
his
board
found
it
difficult
to
imagine
sell
out
to
vodafone
verizon
be
the
control
operating
partner
of
their
joint
venture
at
the
same
time
verizon
be
aware
of
how
vodafone
operate
its
global
business
frankly
mcadam
say
it
didn
t
look
like
a
good
fit
they
don
t
do
the
thing
that
we
do
they
don
t
invest
in
network
the
way
we
do
they
outsource
more
thing
than
we
do
they
outsource
a
lot
of
their
customer
service
we
don
t
do
that
he
say
there
be
just
some
cultural
some
fundamental
difference
in
how
you
run
the
business
the
issue
go
beyond
invest
and
outsource
i
think
if
we
have
sell
to
them
i
think
most
of
the
senior
team
would
ve
left
at
verizon
he
add
i
think
it
would
ve
be
a
very
different
business
and
ivan
have
sort
of
instill
in
all
of
us
you
re
always
a
buyer
you
re
never
a
seller
of
anything
in
core
like
that
and
i
think
the
board
have
that
same
philosophy
many
operating
and
cultural
issue
weigh
against
verizon
buying
vodafone
as
do
the
fact
that
relative
to
the
united
state
europe
do
not
have
nearly
as
bright
economic
prospect
as
verizon
s
home
market
as
much
as
verizon
push
back
against
federal
regulation
in
the
state
when
it
thought
it
be
be
treat
unfairly
european
regulator
have
a
tradition
of
be
even
more
likely
to
wade
into
business
issue
at
the
same
time
uncertainty
in
europe
make
the
vodafone
board
less
anxious
to
part
with
its
u
s
investment
they
be
schizophrenic
about
it
mcadam
say
every
time
they
d
have
a
bad
quarter
in
the
rest
of
europe
their
board
would
say
how
can
you
get
out
of
the
u
s
marathon
talk
for
more
than
a
year
from
the
spring
of
through
the
summer
of
most
of
the
negotiation
between
verizon
and
vodafone
be
carry
out
in
the
form
of
personal
meeting
between
mcadam
and
colao
everywhere
from
italy
s
lake
district
to
a
sport
event
in
new
york
city
the
two
executive
discuss
various
option
before
they
finally
reach
a
deal
at
some
point
the
press
learn
of
their
interest
in
change
the
term
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
telecommunication
giant
they
be
track
when
colao
be
come
to
the
state
and
when
mcadam
be
visit
europe
at
one
point
colao
be
in
new
york
and
the
two
decide
that
rather
than
arrange
furtive
meeting
they
would
get
together
in
public
mcadam
and
colao
go
to
a
hockey
game
and
watch
the
new
york
ranger
in
madison
square
garden
and
the
rabid
fan
and
the
press
take
no
notice
separation
agreement
mcadam
next
visit
colao
at
his
home
in
london
we
have
a
dinner
at
my
house
a
very
nice
dinner
it
be
really
very
personal
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
say
listen
relationship
go
the
way
they
go
and
that
s
it
mcadam
not
physically
expressive
by
nature
give
his
counterpart
a
hug
you
have
a
wonderful
family
he
told
colao
it
sound
like
this
be
the
end
of
one
phase
a
new
phase
have
to
start
colao
recall
that
s
when
the
two
company
start
negotiation
in
earnest
over
what
price
it
would
take
to
get
vodafone
to
agree
to
sell
its
interest
in
the
wireless
joint
venture
back
to
verizon
their
final
meeting
of
the
negotiation
phase
be
on
side
by
side
stationary
bike
in
the
exercise
room
of
a
san
francisco
hotel
colao
have
arrive
from
new
zealand
have
just
complete
the
pacific
ocean
leg
of
an
around
the
world
trip
visit
supplier
and
customer
mcadam
say
we
be
both
early
riser
and
we
be
both
in
the
gym
rid
our
bike
in
the
morning
then
we
go
and
have
breakfast
and
that
be
sort
of
the
final
breakthrough
meeting
when
we
just
say
yeah
ok
at
that
point
it
be
down
mostly
to
price
you
really
want
me
in
the
trunk
while
the
two
company
be
wrestling
with
the
issue
surround
their
joint
venture
and
the
best
path
forward
for
both
party
colao
invite
mcadam
to
address
the
vodafone
board
a
few
time
so
they
could
hear
his
point
of
view
firsthand
i
go
to
his
full
board
a
couple
of
time
and
talk
about
where
we
be
go
the
analogy
that
vittorio
use
be
that
he
be
sit
in
the
front
seat
of
the
car
but
be
not
allow
to
touch
anything
and
he
want
to
have
more
control
mcadam
recall
vittorio
in
order
to
do
what
i
need
to
do
in
the
market
go
forward
i
need
you
in
the
backseat
mcadam
have
state
colao
have
respond
no
i
think
you
really
want
me
in
the
trunk
well
the
trunk
wouldn
t
be
bad
either
mcadam
say
they
re
very
good
negotiator
they
just
kept
push
and
push
and
push
it
but
we
have
decide
as
a
board
that
we
be
in
the
range
at
roughly
billion
say
mcadam
colao
and
his
board
meanwhile
want
to
use
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
its
percent
interest
in
verizon
wireless
to
fund
far
investment
in
europe
the
verizon
board
be
anxious
to
conclude
the
deal
before
some
of
its
veteran
member
who
have
discuss
the
issue
for
year
first
with
seidenberg
and
then
mcadam
be
likely
to
step
down
from
the
board
sandy
moose
described
the
vodafone
buyout
as
one
of
the
more
difficult
decision
that
the
verizon
board
have
have
over
the
year
it
be
a
decision
virtually
year
in
the
make
to
buy
out
the
rest
of
vodafone
so
it
have
be
discuss
any
number
of
time
with
the
board
she
say
it
be
good
to
have
a
board
that
be
pretty
well
inform
they
want
to
get
the
deal
do
before
her
schedule
retirement
as
well
as
that
of
longtime
board
member
joe
neubauer
and
hugh
price
we
felt
we
need
to
make
this
decision
while
the
company
still
have
the
people
with
the
history
and
the
experience
on
the
board
moose
say
ask
relatively
new
director
to
make
such
a
significant
decision
without
have
all
that
context
would
have
be
more
difficult
so
fortunately
the
star
be
align
and
we
be
able
to
do
that
before
the
three
of
us
retire
moose
add
the
verizon
board
also
prepared
for
the
impact
of
the
increase
debt
load
by
create
a
finance
committee
to
monitor
the
financial
performance
of
the
company
in
the
context
of
its
additional
payment
obligation
and
other
factor
i
wish
i
could
contaminate
more
of
vodafone
with
the
verizon
culture
look
back
vodafone
ceo
colao
say
sell
the
minority
stake
to
verizon
when
he
do
be
clearly
the
right
thing
to
do
but
he
do
miss
the
impact
verizon
have
on
vodafone
even
if
it
be
in
the
form
of
an
arm
length
joint
venture
in
hindsight
i
wish
i
could
contaminate
more
of
vodafone
with
the
verizon
culture
which
be
as
i
say
a
culture
of
ruthless
implementation
avoid
wastage
when
it
s
not
necessary
and
good
result
if
i
have
one
regret
it
s
simply
i
wish
i
could
use
more
of
their
way
of
work
to
influence
and
shape
vodafone
s
way
of
work
colao
say
but
in
term
of
the
decision
in
term
of
everything
else
it
be
a
pretty
good
decision
not
to
split
early
on
when
ivan
be
with
my
predecessor
push
for
that
and
it
be
a
great
decision
to
hang
on
until
the
last
moment
because
we
get
the
great
value
out
of
it
and
verizon
wireless
actually
get
their
own
adulthood
and
independence
in
the
right
moment
for
them
as
well
there
be
a
lot
of
detail
involve
mcadam
and
verizon
general
counsel
milch
make
multiple
trip
to
europe
to
iron
out
how
best
to
separate
verizon
s
and
vodafone
s
interest
we
be
do
some
system
development
together
we
have
roam
agreement
we
be
buying
handset
together
we
have
sort
of
integrate
some
of
the
supply
chain
so
figure
out
how
we
be
go
to
undo
all
of
that
it
wasn
t
just
a
price
discussion
it
be
an
operational
untangle
almost
mcadam
say
tax
and
regulatory
issue
also
consume
week
of
negotiate
time
a
unique
asset
on
september
verizon
announce
that
it
have
agree
to
buy
vodafone
s
percent
stake
in
verizon
wireless
for
a
stagger
billion
payable
in
cash
and
verizon
stock
that
value
all
of
verizon
wireless
at
roughly
billion
at
the
time
that
be
more
than
the
market
capitalization
of
google
inc
as
part
of
the
transaction
verizon
agree
to
sell
back
to
vodafone
its
percent
stake
in
vodafone
s
italian
unit
for
billion
the
billion
price
tag
trail
the
billion
vodafone
itself
paid
for
mannesmann
ag
in
at
the
peak
of
the
dot
com
boom
but
otherwise
put
verizon
uncomfortably
near
the
top
of
a
list
of
the
world
s
big
spender
which
be
not
company
verizon
be
use
to
keep
it
be
a
lot
of
money
mcadam
allow
but
worth
it
where
could
you
go
out
and
buy
a
business
that
have
no
integration
risk
that
have
a
great
path
in
front
of
it
for
additional
growth
which
have
percent
margin
he
say
at
the
time
of
the
announcement
this
be
really
a
unique
asset
to
help
fund
the
cash
portion
of
the
mega
deal
verizon
engineer
a
billion
mega
bond
offering
the
large
ever
the
verizon
deal
be
more
than
twice
the
size
of
the
next
large

offering
a

the

couldn
t
wait
to
shift
verizon
into
an
even
high
gear
he
and
his

saw

how

the
inherent
strength
of

a
robust

superiority
and
position
them
for
a

in
which

would
not
only
operate
the
best

but
also
compete
for

of

consumer
of

run
on

and
others
global

in

way
mcadam
and
his
team
be
go
back
to
the
future
like
ivan
seidenberg
and
his
team
a
generation
earlier
mcadam
s
senior
team
be
move
the
company
toward
the
shift
center
of
the
competitive
chessboard
their
goal
be
to
maximize
their
value
create
potential
and
dodge
the
threat
of
commoditization
they
realize
they
need
to
reposition
verizon
for
a
digital
future
driven
increasingly
by
mobile
first
digital
medium
and
video
centric
technology
this
be
where
millennial
and
even
young
customer
worldwide
live
verizon
also
need
to
be
open
to
embrace
new
and
evolve
business
model
to
stay
in
step
with
change
consumer
habit
in
some
way
the
leadership
team
be
operating
from
a
position
of
strength
compare
to
the
first
generation
of
verizon
leader
whereas
their
predecessor
face
a
decline
market
share
in
their
core
business
and
geographic
constraint
mcadam
s
team
be
building
upon
best
in
class
business
that
give
them
great
flexibility
in
consider
future
move
the
only
thing
they
couldn
t
afford
to
do
be
stand
still
but
mcadam
and
his
team
understood
that
assemble
and
building
business
to
meet
customer
need
be
only
part
of
the
process
they
also
have
a
cultural
challenge
it
s
one
thing
to
have
the
building
block
mcadam
note
it
s
also
important
to
demonstrate
flexibility
and
creativity
in
how
you
run
your
company
to
meet
the
change
need
of
the
market
while
maintain
a
culture
of
operational
excellence
you
ve
get
to
be
curious
and
hungry
and
willing
to
do
thing
differently
mcadam
say
we
re
go
to
have
to
disrupt
ourselves
give
verizon
s
dominance
in
its
core
business
generate
change
from
within
would
be
no
easy
task
most
of
its
employee
have
grown
use
to
be
the
market
leader
so
mcadam
would
have
to
shake
the
organization
out
of
its
complacency
when
you
re
perform
well
it
take
somebody
with
a
vision
and
a
willingness
to
take
a
few
body
shot
along
the
way
to
lead
an
organization
to
the
next
level
of
performance
mcadam
say
but
the
pace
of
the
competitive
marketplace
be
make
the
challenge
increasingly
urgent
the
flywheel
of
change
be
rotate
at
least
a
hundred
time
faster
than
it
be
when
ivan
take
over
mcadam
say
we
compete
against
more
people
we
have
to
be
well
on
more
level
as
the
organization
get
more
complicate
to
illustrate
mcadam
say
think
in
term
of
a
classic
x
and
y
axis
diagram
in
seidenberg
s
era
the
company
need
to
fill
in
the
white
space
on
its
coverage
map
by
expand
its
wireless
business
nationwide
building
its

business
and
add

for

in
other
word
grow
horizontally
along
the
x
axis
on
the
diagram
seidenberg
and
mcadam
have
often
talk
about
the
need
to
capture
some
of
the
profit
generate
by
business
rid
on
the
network
along
the
vertical
y
axis
with
vodafone
out
of
the
way
it
be
up
to
mcadam
and
his
team
to
tackle
that
challenge
verizon
immediately
begin
to
move
up
the
y
axis
by
move
into
the
broadband
medium
and
content
marketplace
and
take
an
early
lead
in
the
development
of
the
next
generation
of

capability
g
hundred
of

with
more
than
million
customer
about
one
third
of
the
u
s
population
verizon
couldn
t
expect
the
kind
of
wireless
sale
growth
in
the
year
ahead
that
it
have
experienced
in
decade
past
mcadam
threw
down
the
growth
gauntlet
for
his
team
if
you
have
somebody
that
really
knew
the
internet
and
knew
how
to
get
a
large
number
of
customer
to
view
the
information
that
you
get
off
your
network
you
could
use
that
along
with
location
and
a
few
other
thing
to
really
do
target
advertising
he
say
you
can
create
a
multibillion
dollar
business
in
the
next
three
to
five
year
and
those
be
the
kind
of
business
we
need
to
move
the
needle
in
a
company
with
more
than
billion
in
revenue
for
year
date
back
to
seidenberg
s
term
as
ceo
verizon
have
eyed
the
billion
of
customer
and
billion
of
dollar
in
revenue
they
generate
belonging
to
social
medium
and
other
internet
company
use
its
network
yet
these
company
hadn
t
invest
a
dime
directly
in
building
a
public
network
verizon
lead
the
industry
with
the
introduction
of
g
lte
technology
but
while
verizon
continued
to
invest
in
its
network
superiority
it
be
the
social
medium
and
content
giant
the
amazon
google
and
facebooks
of
the
world
that
be
profit
from
the

those
network
make
possible
mcadam
and
his
team
be
determine
to
find
opportunity
to
monetize
the
company
s
million
of
customer
relationship
and
investment
in
world
class
technology
i
use
the
term
that
you
stand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
people
that
come
before
you
all
the
time
mcadam
say
we
knew
we
want
to
do
more
software
that
rode
on
the

ivan
always
say
and
i
think
he
be
right
that
just
be
the
connectivity
company
and
let
everybody
else
do
the
software
that
ride
on
that
they
get
all
of
the
profitability
from
the
software
we
basically
get
cost
of
capital
for
the
big
investment
that
we
put
in
now
on
his
watch
mcadam
say
we
re
finally
at
the
point
where
we
re
put
the
software
on
the
network
to
get
the
well
value
aol
s
ad
tech
allure
the
verizon
team
believe
that
the
most
logical
way
to
tap
into
the
revenue
generate
by
today
s
mobile
first
young
generation
of
social
medium
consumer
be
via
what
be
know
as

technology
or
ad
tech
for
short
while
ad
tech
come
in
a
variety
of
flavor
in
general
it
refers
to
technology
that
enables
advertiser
to
identify
and
target
customer
as
they
search
the
internet
for
airfare
to
mexico
for
example
or
shop
online
for
a

we
ve
get
all
these
asset
and
all
of
these
asset
drive
a
lot
of
great
information
roy
chestnutt
say
but
we
don
t
have
the
advertising
technology
infrastructure
in
their
search
for
an
entry
point
to
the

tech
space
mcadam
s
team
kept
come
back
to
aol
they
ve
get
the
ad
tech
infrastructure
they
know
how
to
use
the

we
think
their
system
with
our
system
would
create
we
talk
about
one
plus
one
have
to
equal
at

six
to
make

pay
off
mcadam
say
mcadam
met
aol
chairman
and
ceo
tim
armstrong
at
the
allen
company
medium
industry
conference
in
i
sat
down
with
tim
for
the
first
time
and
we
have
a
half
hour
meeting
schedule
that
go
for
minute
and
we
kind
of
kept
go
because
i
kept
hearing
the
vision
from
tim
about
what
he
could
do
if
he
have
more
access
to
mobile
data
and
some
of
the
content
relationship
that
we
have
so
we
start
in
negotiate
a
commercial
agreement
the
more
they
talk
about
some
form
of
commercial
deal
the
more
they
thought
it
might
be
well
to
combine
the
two
enterprise
if
tim
be
inside
the
house
you
d
be
able
to
give
him
access
to
more
thing
mcadam
say
that
s
when
it
move
more
and
fairly
rapidly
into
a
purchase
versus
a
commercial
deal
a
major
engine
for
us
in
the
year
follow
the
dot
com
collapse
in
the
early
s
aol
s
survive
business
have
be
reorganize
and
revive
as
a
much
slimmer
more

by
its
management
in
tim
armstrong
join
aol

where
he
have
serve

not
that
we
go

the

do
that
what
s
the

back

g
even
as
verizon
continued
to
enhance
and
strengthen
its
g
wireless
network
it
be
already
look
ahead
to
the
next
generation
of
wireless
infrastructure
that
could
open
new
market
opportunity
and
support
the
hyper
connect
world
that

rapidly
emerge
its

team
be
lead
the

on
the
path
to
fifth
generation
or
g
technology
whether
the
industry
be
ready
or
not
in
fact
verizon
have
begin
to
lay
a
pathway
for
develop
g
while
seidenberg
be
still
ceo
we
didn
t
even
know
what
it
be
go
to
look
like
at
first
seidenberg
recall
in
mcadam
s
view
g
wireless
differs
from
precede
generation
of
technology
in
three
fundamental
way
which
combine
to
make
it
a
breakthrough
technology
with
enormous
growth
potential
the
first
be
sheer
speed
which
will
be
exponentially
faster
than
current
technology
instead
of
megabit
of
throughput
he
say
you
ll
be
somewhere
between
and
gigabit
of
throughput
which
open
the
door
to
mobile
transmission
of
d
image
virtual
reality
hologram
and
other
immersive
experience
second
be
what
engineer
call
latency
or
the
response
time
on
the
network
by
the
time
you
blink
your
eye
say
mcadam
the
network
will
be
able
to
transmit
a
signal
and
get
a
response
from
across
the
country
or
around
the
world
that
open
up
game
that
open
up
control
of
anything
that
s
mechanical
even
if
it
s
go
down
the
road
at
mile
an
hour
he
say
the
third
advantage
be
battery
life
which
on
a
g
network
could
be
as
much
as
year
for
some
device
the
advantage
for
the
internet
of
thing
will
be
enormous
mcadam
predicts
you
ll
be
able
to
put
chip
in
the
paint
strip
in
a
parking
garage
so
that
the
cloud
will
tell
you
where
to
go
to
park
he
say
basically
anything
that
have
a
chip
in
it
will
be
able
to
be
control
by
the
network
which
today
you
can
t
do
all
of
this
enables
the
ability
to
make
many
connection
almost
simultaneously
the
research
firm
gartner
estimate
that
billion
internet
connect
thing
be
in
use
worldwide
in
and
will
reach
billion
by
mobile
data
traffic
be
expect
to
balloon
at
an
even
faster
pace
as
the
iot

everything
from

smart

and

that
tremendous
innovative
potential
be
what
make
g
figure
so
importantly
in
verizon
s
plan
for
its
future
in
marni
walden
s
word
verizon
doesn
t
intend
to
take
a
backseat
to
anyone
when
it
come
to
introduce
product
that
run
on
the
g
network
when
we
go
out
with
g
you
don
t
let
apple
have
the
great
innovation
on
top
of
that
don
t
let
facebook
have
the
great
innovation
verizon
will
because
we
have
the
sandbox
first
walden
announce
in
october
that
she
would
be
leave
verizon
in
february
to
pursue
other
opportunity
future
proof
the
verizon
culture
when
mcadam
become
ceo
he
thought
that
technology
customer
service
and
other
operational
issue
would
be
no
on
my
hit
parade
instead
he
found
that
his
job
boil
down
to
one
word
culture
it
s
how
hungry
be
you
how
innovative
be
you
how
do
you
take
care
of
people
how
be
you
view
as
a
great
place
to
work
to
me
all
that
come
down
to
culture
you
can
go
buy
technology
but
if
you
don
t
have
the
culture
to
turn
it
into
a
competitive
advantage
that
s
the
miss
link
so
culture
be
the
big
thing
for
me
culture
isn
t
something
that
a
ceo
present
via
powerpoint
to
the
staff
culture
be
how
you
get
thing
do
so
operation
be
your
culture
mcadam
say
verizon
start
from
a
culture
of
operational
excellence
that
mcadam
and
his
team
brought
forward
from
the
early
decade
of
the

the
credo
evolve
from
that

as
well

be
as
relevant
as

to
the

have
be

to

the
profit
available
to

rid
on
its

as
much
as
mcadam
admires
the
creative
culture
of
the
medium
company
brought
into
verizon
and
would
like
to
see
some
of
that
creativity
travel
over
to
the

the
reverse

happen
as
well
i

care

i

mcadam

in

the

the

he

i
remember
people

why

anybody
need

then
why
would
you
need

you

why
would
you
need

over

now
it
s
why
would
you
need
megabit

i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if

from

they

go

well
we
need

not
gig
the

while
mcadam

about

they

guaranteed
in
contemplate
