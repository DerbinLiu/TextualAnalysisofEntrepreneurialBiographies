for
a
wholesale
business
nashville
mile
to
the
south
or
louisville
mile
to
the
north
would
have
be
much
well
few
than
people
live
in
scottsville
in

few
month
later
black
friday
kick
off
the
great
depression
it
would
be
much
bad
than
the
downturn
of
a
decade
earlier
but
luther
be
much
well
prepared
his
year
on
the
road
in
and
out
of
the
little
department

found
in
nearly
every

taught
him
volume
he
have
see
the
business
as
a
wholesaler
and
a
retailer
from
the
perspective
of
owner
and
customer
in
good
time
and
bad
he
knew
their
merchandise
their
cash
flow
their
strength
and
weakness
he
be
by
this
time
part
psychologist
part
philosopher
and
all
businessman
when
the
depression
hit
cal

in
eighth
grade
which
meant
he
have
complete
four
more
year
of
school
than
his
father
he
be
especially
good
with
number
and
luther
begin
take
him
on
the
road
cal
be
a
quick
study
he
picked
up
on
what
make
customer
eye
light
up
and
what
left
them
cold
no
one
in
those
little
town
have
much
money
they
want
value
and
knew
how
to
spot
it
luther
saw
that
many
of
these
store
weren
t
go
to
make
it
they
have
mortgage
utility
vendor
and
other
creditor
to
pay
but
their
customer
lack
cash
so
they
simply
couldn
t
move
their
merchandise
at
anything
close
to
what
they
have
in
it
what
have
happen
to
him
and
his
two
little
store
in
the
early
twenty
be
happen
all
over
the
rural
south
in
the
thirty
he
also
knew
that
where
there
be
failure
there
be
opportunity
he
have
open
that
first
store
with
merchandise
from
a
fail
retailer
here
be
the
chance
to
do
that
with
store
after
store
someone
would
be
buying
the
merchandise
at
bargain
basement
price
on
the
courthouse
step
if
nowhere
else
it
might
as
well
be
luther
in
photo
from
that
era
with
his
suit
and
tie
slim
build
and
glass
luther
look
like
a
young
harry
truman
but
behind
the
glass
there
be
a
fatherless
farm
boy
who
start
with
nothing
face
the
early
day
of
the
bad
depression
in
the
country
s
history
if
there
be
ever
a
test
of
a
man
s
mettle
and
a
nation
s
promise
this
be
it
but
it
be
clear
that
he
have
already
come
a
great
distance
from
his
day
of
walk
behind
a
mule
in
that
tennessee
dirt
as
the
depression
deepen
luther
begin
buying
the
inventory
of
fail
store
often
compete
with
other
bidder
to
do
so
he
and
cal
would
show
up
early
on
auction
day
and
cal
learn
quickly
from
luther
how
to
size
up
merchandise
and
assign
value
it
help
that
cal
be
a
whiz
with
number
he
d
walk
around
with
a
pad
and
pencil
listing
item
and
do
the
figure
i
count
sixty
two
pair
of
shoe
cal
might
say
and
it
look
like
an
average
price
of
a
dollar
twenty
five
he
d
go
through
as
much
as
he
could
this
way
sack
of
sugar
baby
dress
roll
of
wallpaper
whatever
they
have
write
his
approximation
on
a
note
pad
he
might
determine
that
the
entire
stock
be
worth
and
luther
would
try
to
buy
it
for
or
so
my
father
be
no
longer
here
to
ask
but
i
wonder
now
whether
my
practical
grandfather
take
cash
with
him
to
those
sale
since
that
seem
most
logical
he
be
after
all
a
stranger
at
many
of
them
when
theirs
be
the
win
bid
luther
would
liquidate
the
stock
quickly
hold
a
go
out
of
business
sale
sometimes
hire
someone
to
handle
it
sometimes
stay
on
to
do
it
himself
with
cal
at
his
side
anything
that
didn
t
sell
he
could
pack
up
and
take
to
his
own
store
in
scottsville
or
sell
to
another
retailer
now
and
then
he
would
scout
around
for
another
merchant
or
middleman
and
sell
the
whole
lot
at
a
small
markup
and
on
a
couple
of
rare
occasion
where
he
thought
with
the
right
manager
he
could
turn
a
store
around
he
simply
bought
it
outright
sometimes
he
need
short
term
bank
loan
to
make
the
purchase
and
the
bank
be
more
than
happy
to
work
with
him
his
track
record
spoke
for
itself
he
use
the
stock
as
collateral
and
they
knew
they
d
have
their
money
back
in
sixty
or
ninety
day
he
be
bankable
in
a
way
that
farmer
whose
crop
might
not
come
in
be
not
at
other
time
he
would
take
on
a
short
term
partner
they
would
buy
a
store
together
with
a
handshake
as
the
only
contract
they
would
divide
the
good
as
evenly
as
possible
and
flip
a
coin
to
see
who
get
what
those
sale
help
make
a
businessman
of
young
cal
as
he
and
his
dad
go
from
store
to
store
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
he
become
more
like
a
partner
than
simply
a
helpful
son
even
though
he
be
still
in
high
school
in
fact
my
dad
do
very
well
at
scottsville
high
even
find
time
to
become
a
terrific

after

freshman
year
he
take
what
his
parent
thought
be
a
summer
job
at
neely
harwell
then
as

he
broke
it
to
them
that
he
wasn
t

own
in
dupontonia
a
dupont
company
town
on
the
cumberland
river
north

since
he
be
a
good
fellow
and
his
price
be
right
he
felt
he
deserve
people
s
business
the
local
didn
t
see
it
that
way
and
it
go
under
luther
who
be
not
averse
to
let
cal
learn
some
of
his
lesson
the
hard
way
simply
watch
from
the
sideline
then
the
two
of
them
go
back
to
the
business
of
buying
and
liquidate
the
inventory
of
troubled
store
my
dad
be
date
laura
katherine
goad
who
be
a
year
behind
him
in
high
school
she
come
from
a
family
of
lawyer
and
politician
on
one
side
and
businesspeople
on
the
other
in
a
social
sense
the
goad
be
above
the
station
of
the
turner
no
matter
how
far
they
have
come
from
that
tennessee
farm
the
goad
would
produce
judge
and
politician
while
the
kemps
her
mother
s
side
own
a
store
but
cal
good
look
dapper
and
fill
with
self
confidence
thought
he
could
accomplish
pretty
much
anything
include
win
laura
he
still
carry
some
of
the
earthiness
that
go
with
the
family
s
rural
background
and
that
wasn
t
always
an
endear
trait
once
when
he
and
laura
broke
up
for
a
short
time
my
dad
get
a
date
with
her
rival
lattie
miller
graf
the
doctor
s
daughter
the
two
of
them
drove
by
laura
s
house
in
his
new
convertible
with
the
top
down
and
the
radio
blaring
fortunately
my
mother
later
decide
to
take
him
back
but
i
m
convince
that
if
her
father
hadn
t
die
when
he
do
in
an
automobile
accident
at
the
age
of
forty
two
when
my
mother
be
eighteen
she
would
never
have
married
him
the
turner
be
uneducated
farm
people
who
have
move
into
town
and
my
guess
be
that
luther
turner
s
young
son
cal
would
not
have
be
good
enough
for
frank
goad
s
only
daughter
as
it
be
her
joyfulness
and
free
spirit
and
his
charm
and
confidence
make
for
a
great
match
one
of
their
favorite
pastime
be
to
drive
out
to
the
bridge
on
gallatin
road
south
of
town
park
the
car
turn
up
the
radio
and
dance
high
above
the
creek
below
they
married
on
october
daddy
be
as
proud
of
their
first
child
laura
josephine
born
december
as
of
anything
he
d
ever
do
and
one
day
he
take
her
into
the
store
and
set
her
lovingly
atop
a
display
pile
of
fabric
as
the
customer
gather
around
she
wet
herself
soak
both
her
diaper
and
the
cloth
the
depression
hadn
t
lift
but
the
newlywed
enter
a
world
in
which
the
economic
landscape
have
at
least
stabilize
unemployment
have
drop
from
nearly
percent
in
to
percent
in
it
be
possible
to
see
who
have
outlast
the
storm
those
retailer
who
remain
need
good
and
it
be
my
dad
who
have
the
idea
of
go
into
wholesale
at
twenty
four
he
have
learn
his
father
s
lesson
well
and
have
save
equivalent
to
nearly
today
he
knew
he
need
more
so
he
ask
luther
for
as
well
the
building
that
have
be
offer
for
sale
in
scottsville
would
be
a
great
location
the
price
be
right
and
luther
say
yes
with
that
they
be
in
the
wholesale
business
j
l
turner
and
son
begin
sell
to
independent
retailer
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
cal
order
and
brought
in
stock
and
hit
the
road
with
his
sample
on
sell
trip
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
he
have
sell
worth
of
good
and
they
be
off
and
run
the
found
of
j
l
turner
and

by
less
than
sixty

and
the

war
ii
president
roosevelt
sign
into
law
the
first
peacetime
draft
in
u
s
history
a
year
later
but
my
birth
in
january
make
my
dad
the
father
of
two
and
as
such
he
would
never
be
subject
to
the
draft
instead
he
and
my
grandfather
do
what
they
could
to
thrive
during
the
austere
wartime
economy
they
concentrate
on
what
my
father
always
figure
he
do
best
find
great
bargain
and
sell
them
to
retailer
supplement
the
money
they
make
wholesale
with
income
from
their
remain
retail
outlet
and
a
few
side
project
include
a
tomato
cannery
in
scottsville
i
still
remember
the
allen
s
pride
label
on
those
can
and
the
sickly
pungent
smell
of
the
place
in
the
boom
follow
the
war
manufacturer
freed
up
from
wartime
production
begin
flood
the
market
with
all
sort
of
commodity
drive
price
down
my
father
found
more
and
more
deal
he
just
couldn
t
resist
passing
them
along
to
his
retail
customer
at
one
point
he
found
a
bargain
on
a
huge
volume
of
lady
panty
which
he
ship
to
the
warehouse
he
take
sample
to
his
customer
and
found
they
weren
t
buying
since
they
still
have
plenty
of
the
last
batch
of
panty
he
d
sell
them
but
these
be
even
cheaper
he
say
low
your
price
and
you
ll
sell
more
of
them
he
be
tout
a
new
business
approach
but
his
customer
a
conservative
lot
weren
t
buying
his
argument
or
his
panty
it
begin
happen
more
and
more
my
dad
who
couldn
t
pas
up
a
bargain
would
end
up
with
way
too
much
of
something
the
storeowners
who
be
ideally
a
pipeline
to
customer
be
instead
a
bottleneck
if
he
couldn
t
move
that
lot
of
panty
through
those
other
retail
store
my
dad
figure
it
be
time
for
him
and
his
father
to
open
more
store
of
their
own
so
they
could
complement
his
aggressive
buying
with
some
smart
sell
he
put
it
another
way
year
later
say
we
realize
you
have
to
go
directly
to
the
consumer
we
decide
we
have
to
have
more
outlet
to
get
rid
of
our
mistake
the
initial
idea
he
say
be
sell
the
good
stuff
to
the
rich
folk
but
we
be
late
get
into
retailing
and
mr
karl
stark
be
already
do
that
in
scottsville
so
we
have
to
sell
the
cheap
stuff
to
the
poor
folk
it
be
just
the
business
we
have
to
get
into
it
be
also
the
business
they
knew
best
they
be
acquaint
with
retailer
and
would
be
retailer
throughout
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
they
found
willing
partner
they
knew
they
couldn
t
run
these
junior
department
store
themselves
local
businessmen
would
manage
the
store
the
turner
would
provide
wholesale
merchandise
they
would
lease
the
building
jointly
with
the
local
manager
and
split
the
profit
as
fifty
fifty
partner
if
either
party
want
out
he
would
declare
the
value
of
the
store
and
the
other
could
buy
or
sell
at
that
price
my
dad
be
convince
that
any
genuine
partnership
need
two
person
completely
and
equally
commit
to
success
it
also
need
a
mutually
agreeable
exit
strategy
from
the
begin
the
first
store
open
with
such
a
partnership
be
in
albany
kentucky
albany
dry
good
then
they
add
a
store
in
horse
cave
and
in
russell
spring
one
at
a
time
they
add
others
and
within
a
few
year
they
have
a
dozen
one
of
those
new
store
be
allen
dry
good
on
the
square
in
scottsville
the
building
have
become
available
when
karl
stark
finally
get
out
of
the
business
like
our
short
live
cannery
business
it
be
name
for
allen
county
which
have
scottsville
as
its
county
seat
this
one
be
solely
own
rather
than
the
kind
of
partnership
dad
and
luther
normally
negotiate
from
the
begin
my
dad
ran
the
business
and
luther
serve
as
love
mentor
and
worrier
in
fact
cal
s
hunger
for
growth
for
more
and
more
store
worried
luther
a
great
deal
cal

a
young
man
s
ambition
luther
in
his
mid
fifty
have
an
old
man
s
caution
at
one
point
luther
bought
a
farm
and
put
it
in
josiephine
s
name
so
that
if
the
company
go
under
all
of
them
could
return
to
the
land
and
start
over
cal
do
heed
luther
s
concern
he
told
me
he
often
woke
up
in
a
cold
sweat
wonder
whether
they
be
overextend
but
luther
listen
to
cal
as
well
they
would
ride
together
to
nashville
to
visit
sam
flemming
the
credit
manager
at
third
national
bank
and
luther
would
always
provide
the
need
second
signature
for
a
loan
that
would
let
them
launch
another
store
that
business
grow
one
store
at
a
time
be
the
backdrop
to
my
childhood
the
fact
that
it
be

her
banana

month
there

of
them
and
sometime
after

really
warm
we
begin
hearing
muffle
explosion
in

part
of
the
adventure
at

a
must
stop
house
for
everyone
three
or
four
hundred
people
would
come
by
mama
would
make
homemade
chili
and
tamale
to
entice
the
entire
family
to
come
and
eat
and
then
help
pas
out
candy
to
the
seemingly
endless
line
of
trick
or
treater
where
my
mother
s
family
be
all
about
community
and
civic
involvement
my
father
s
stuck
to
business
he
be
go
much
of
the
time
and
so
mama
be
the
big
influence
on
laura
jo
me
and
our
two
young
sibling
betty
katherine
elizabeth
and
steve
james
stephen
during
my
formative
year
my
dad
be
too
busy
to
have
much
rapport
with
me
the
only
time
we
really
spent
together
when
i
be
little
be
when
i
d
visit
store
with
him
i
be
five
the
first
time
and
i
remember
how
excite
i
be
when
he
say
i
want
cal
jr
to
go
with
me
to
visit
store
today
i
thought
i
have
arrive
that
emotion
be
quickly
replace
by
fear
once
we
get
on
the
road
however
because
his
drive
scar
the
heck
out
of
me
it
be
a
thrill
just
to
get
to
each
store
in
one
piece
once
we
be
there
he
d
start
talk
shop
with
manager
and
employee
and
i
d
get
bore
in
a
hurry
there
isn
t
much
interest
about
a
retail
store
to
a
preschooler
we
didn
t
have
most
of
the
normal
father
son
venue
for
a
relationship
it
be
simply
a
consequence
of
the
way
he
have
grown
up
his
father
be
functionally
illiterate
and
need
him
as
a
functionary
in
the
business
enterprise
so
business
be
their
connection
just
as
it
become
ours
i
heard
a
lot
of
business
talk
as
a
kid
we
d
be
in
the
living
room
wait
for
grandma
to
finish
cooking
sunday
dinner
and
i
d
listen
as
my
father
and
my
grandfather
talk
about
retailing
look
back
i
realize
that
the
two
of
them
have
a
great
deal
of
affection
for
each
other
but
you
have
to
hear
it
through
the
constant
chatter
about
shipment
and
bargain
and
overhead
i
remember
a
discussion
of
one
of
their
more
memorable
promotion
for
a
time
they
sell
a
shoe
line
specially
make
for
the
company
call
turson
a
contraction
of
turner
and
son
my
dad
want
to
promote
it
at
the
county
fair
in
scottsville
one
year
so
he
have
one
of
the
shoe
frozen
in
a
big
block
of
ice
which
be
set
out
in
the
sun
he
announce
a
prize
for
the
person
who
could
guess
the
time
at
which
the
ice
would
be
melt
enough
for
the
shoe
to
drop
to
the
ground
it
be
just
the
kind
of
homey
small
town
touch
he
knew
would
work
and
he
certainly
get
his
money
s
worth
when
it
come
to
that
crowd
my
grandmother
be
the
hardest
work
lady
i
ever
met
to
her
a
meal
be
two
or
three
meat
a
half
dozen
vegetable
cornbread
biscuit
and
at
least
two
dessert
and
she
could
do
all
that
with
very
little
advance
notice
she
can
fruit
and
vegetable
from
her
garden
kept
a
spotless
house
and
quilt
knit
and
crochet
i
still
remember
her
kneel
beside
her
bed
and
say
her
prayer
at
night
she
would
be
deeply
engross
speak
in
an
emotional
mumble
that
be
very
move
to
me
i
remember
talk
to
her
once
about
the
fact
that
since
daddy
didn
t
go
to
church
i
didn
t
really
know
where
he
stood
with
god
the
baptist
in
her
come
out
as
she
say
i
ll
have
you
know
your
dad
have
be
save
he
s
all
right
there
be
never
anything
fancy
about
her
i
don
t
think
she
have
as
much
education
as
my
grandfather
many
child
left
school
in
those
day
in
favor
of
farm
work
but
her
level
of
sophistication
didn
t
matter
i
deeply
respect
her
contribution
to
the
family
i
respect
my
grandfather
s
too
but
despite
his
native
intelligence
his
lack
of
education
show
every
time
he
spoke
i
can
t
recall
a
grammatical
error
he
didn
t
make
he
have
an
organize
mind
and
invariably
make
the
point
he
want
to
make
but
his
poor
grammar
embarrass
me
when
i
be
young
my
mother
be
an
advocate
of
correct
grammar
and
her
example
help
smooth
my
dad
s
rough
edge
when
it
come
to
express
himself
but
she
be
able
just
to
accept
her
father
in
law
the
way
he
be
i
love
him
i
respect
him
i
knew
he
be
my
dad
s
mentor
and
advisor
but
i
have
a
problem
with
the
way
he
butcher
the
language
that
would
lessen
for
me
through
the
year
and
my
memory
of
his
keen
insight
into
people
and
business
have
long
since
outweigh
my
childish
sensitivity
to
that
minor
flaw

lesson
of
adolescence

more
than
twenty
five
year
as
luther
get
old
he
begin
slide
toward
dementia
i
first
realize
something
wasn
t
right
as
he
and
i
drove
the
back
road
toward
the
farm
in
his
pontiac
he
would
begin
mumble
and
the
few
word
i
could
make
out
let
me
know
he
be
talk
with
an
imaginary
someone
about
business
i
would
say
something
to
him
and
eventually
he
would
come
around
but
it
be
very
disconcert
and
it
certainly
didn
t
help
his
drive
which
become
more
and
more
erratic
he
begin
to
prefer
the
middle
of
the
road
which
frighten
the
rest
of
the
family
as
much
as
it
frighten
me
in
fact
it
scar
pretty
much
everyone
in
town
meanwhile
it
add
greatly
to
the
burden
my
father
bore
he
be
already
consume
entirely
with
the
company
s
business
and
he
now
have
the
add
emotional
strain
of
grieve
the
loss
of
the
father
who
have
be
his
partner
the
fact
that
luther
be
still
alive
in
no
way
ease
his
load
cal
be
now
in
every
way
sole
proprietor
as
my

on
even
more
responsibility

name
as

spoke
i
be
the
one
who
spent
the
most
time
with
him
mama
ask
me
to
bring
up
the
subject
of
his
drive
i
never
do
work
up
the
nerve
to
do
it
and
he
finally
stop
before
anyone
be
hurt
still
it
be
quite
a
bit
of
responsibility
to
give
an
eleven
year
old
but
it
s
reflective
of
the
way
my
parent
view
their
old
son
the
age
of
eleven
be
also
a
turn
point
for
me
in
a
spiritual
sense
part
of
be
a
good
boy
in
a
small
town
be
go
to
church
regularly
and
i
remember
when
attend
out
of
obedience
and
expectation
turn
into
a
more
adult
form
of
spirituality
my
faith
become
very
real
after
one
sunday
even
youth
fellowship
meeting
i
be
wait
for
my
parent
to
pick
me
up
sit
on
the
porch
of
my
uncle
s
house
across
the
street
from
the
church
in
the
lovely
summer
twilight
suddenly
the
word
to
the
old
rugged
cross
come
over
me
with
real
impact
the
message
at
that
moment
be
not
so
much
that
jesus
have
die
for
the
whole
world
but
that
he
have
die
specifically
for
cal
turner
jr
i
have
never
felt
anything
like
it
i
felt
the
touch
of
christ
and
knew
i
be
go
to
be
different
from
that
moment
on
i
have
no
idea
what
that
meant
but
i
knew
i
d
be
change
it
be
not
about
be
religious
it
be
about
that
relationship
to
this
day
religion
that
take
the
form
of
exclusivity
judgmentalism
and
church
bureaucracy
be
a
turnoff
to
me
jesus
christ
have
always
be
and
will
continue
to
be
a
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
old
rugged
cross
played
such
a
profound
role
in
my
spiritual
awaken
point
to
the
importance
of
music
in
my
life
my
mother
s
side
of
the
family
provide
the
musical
background
although
it
s
a
wonder
i
learn
to
love
music
so
much
give
my
early
lesson
my
first
teacher
be
my
aunt
ruth
who
live
next
door
she
be
pretty
and
petite
with
brown
hair
and
blue
eye
and
although
she
claimed
shyness
she
be
very
outspoken
she
be
very
good
at
love
from
a
distance
she
would
voice
approval
of
me
to
others
but
i
never
heard
or
felt
it
she
would
lie
in
her
gown
on
the
couch
smoking
cigarette
during
my
piano
lesson
call
out
the
correct
note
when
i
played
the
wrong
one
then
she
would
walk
across
the
room
and
hover
over
me
anytime
i
hit
a
wrong
note
she
would
hit
my
finger
with
a
pencil
the
fear
be
self
fulfil
that
pencil
s
go
to
come
down
any
second
i
would
think
and
the
tension
would
as
often
as
not
send
my
finger
in
an
errant
direction
and
bring
the
pencil
down
on
it
i
learn
soon
enough
to
avoid
her
i
would
go
out
the
front
door
at
lesson
time
circle
around
to
the
shed
in
back
of
the
house
and
hide
when
the
time
for
the
lesson
have
pass
i
d
go
back
in
the
house
how
be
your
lesson
son
my
mother
would
ask
it
be
good
i
d
say
that
work
until
the
time
for
a
recital
get
close
and
both
aunt
ruth
and
i
knew
i
wasn
t
ready
my
mother
finally
realize
aunt
ruth
and
i
have
a
problem
and
she
let
me
quit
take
lesson
later
another
neighbor
france
read
a
character
in
her
own
right
taught
me
she
be
a
beautiful
woman
who
dress
to
the
nine
every
day
she
would
come
down
her
stair
wear
a
big
diamond
ring
and
when
she
sat
next
to
me
i
could
smell
the
listerine
on
her
breath
she
seem
troubled
but
i
would
do
anything
for
her
a
well
train
musician
she
have
attend
the
exclusive
ward
belmont
school
in
nashville
and
her
beauty
be
accompany
by
a
kind
supportive
approach
pretty
much
the
opposite
of
aunt
ruth
s
i
practice
hard
and
learn
a
great
deal
from
her
i
think
the
contrast
in
style
between
aunt
ruth
and
mr
read
be
an
influence
on
my
management
style
i
perform
so
much
well
with
mr
read
whose
elegance
and
dignify
approach
affirm
me
than
with
aunt
ruth
who
neither
affirm
me
nor
seem
to
enjoy
her
role
as
piano
teacher
my
mother
knew
well
than
to
give
me
lesson
even
though
she
played
beautifully
a
parent
can
t
usually
teach
a
child
to
play
piano
and
my
mother
didn
t
fancy
herself
a
teacher
anyway
her
mother
have
be
a
natural
at
the
piano
play
by
ear
from
the
time
she
be
a
little
girl
in
fact
she
would
come
into
her
father
s
store
in
hartsville
tennessee
and
demonstrate
the
baldwin
piano
he
have
in
stock
her
play
help
sell
quite
a
few
of
them
i
be
thirteen
the
first
time
i
played
the
organ
for
sunday
morning
worship
in
a
church
with
no
air
conditioning
just
a
ceiling
fan
i
be
play
holy
holy
holy
hymn
no
in
the
methodist
hymnal
and
the
hymnal
page
start
move
because
of
the
fan
so
i
begin
blowing
on
it
to
counteract
the
effect
i
be
play
along
blowing
on
the
music
when
i
look
up
at
the
mirror
above
the
music
rack
and
saw
lawrence
bishop
my
dad
s
renegade
lumberman
friend
in
the
back
of
the
church
laugh
himself
silly
i
realize
what
i
must
have
look
like
but
it
be
the
only
way
to
keep
the
music
in
place
it
be
a
pretty
inauspicious
begin
but
it
help
launch
a
lifelong
love
of
music
and
the
art
my
father
s
long
business
related
absence
meant
my
mother
remain
our
chief
disciplinarian
as
i
approach
my
teenage
year
grow
up
in
a
house
full
of
boy
taught
her
the
need
for
discipline
and
she
set
the
family
routine
rotate
monthly
chore
and
privilege
between
laura
jo
betty
and
me
steve
be
still
too
young
in
a
way
design
to
help
minimize
conflict
whoever
wash
dish
get
first
choice
when
it
come
to
matter
like
who
sat
in
the
front
seat
of
the
car
or
who
get
the
first
turn
at
something
whoever
dry
dish
get
second
choice
and
whoever
swept
the
floor
get
third
those
chore
rotate
every
month
it
work
like
a
charm
there
be
never
anything
to
argue
about
until
one
day
my
dad
come
home
from
work
and
make
an
announcement
that
set
up
one
of
the
few
real
clash
between
my
parent
cal
jr
he
say
be
not
go
to
be
do
any
more
woman
s
work
in
that
instant
i
be
absolve
of
my
domestic
chore
that
of
course
do
not
go
over
well
with
my
mother
or
my
sister
they
be
angry
and
the
atmosphere
be
chilly
for
quite
a
while
i
would
have
be
much
happier
to
continue
do
the
chore
just
to
keep
thing
go
smoothly
and
actually
i
think
part
of
the
reason
mama
didn
t
like
it
be
that
i
be
probably
her
best
worker
in
my
humble
opinion
but
from
then
on
i
work
in
the
warehouse
or
in
the
store
rather
than
at
home
gradually
very
gradually
the
storm
pass
mama
be
good
at
keep
us
in
line
because
when
she
say
something
she
meant
it
she
have
big
expressive
eye
and
could
accomplish
a
lot
with
just
a
look
she
didn
t
need
to
say
a
word
to
convey
that
we
need
to
shape
up
she
could
also
be
marvelously
subtle
if
i
scowl
in
concentration
as
i
listen
to
someone
look
as
though
i
be
annoyed
when
she
knew
that
wasn
t
the
case
she
would
say
cal
jr
you
re
out
of
touch
with
your
face
again
if
we
misbehave
too
much
she
d
get
out
the
hairbrush
and
put
the
back
of
it
to
our
backside
or
get
a
switch
leaf
on
the
end
and
switch
the
back
of
our
leg
if
it
get
serious
she
d
say
your
father
will
deal
with
this
when
he
get
home
we
d
spend
the
day
dread
his
arrival
and
then
he
d
dread
have
to
discipline
us
he
hat
it
as
much
as
we
do
although
that
didn
t
stop
him
from
reach
for
his
belt
my
mother
knew
i
be
a
sensitive
child
i
want
to
please
everybody
and
be
perhaps
too
concerned
with
what
other
people
thought
i
be
very
serious
born
old
she
would
say
and
i
so
want
everything
to
be
all
right
for
other
folk
that
i
d
sometimes
want
to
protect
them
from
themselves
when
my
teenage
sister
want
to
borrow
a
quarter
from
me
i
d
say
no
because
i
knew
she
be
go
to
buy
cigarette
and
i
didn
t
think
she
should
i
be
prim
and
proper
to
the
point
where
mama
warn
me
about
be
too
prissy
she
want
me
to
be
more
natural
around
people
something
that
come
very
easily
for
her
she
always
have
a
terrific
sense
of
humor
perhaps
even
well
than
my
dad
s
and
she
thought
of
life
and
people
as
worth
laugh
about
she
carry
that
humor
all
through
her
life
and
she
want
me
to
be
able
to
laugh
at
myself
she
be
never
hesitant
about
offering
guidance
or
correction
she
thought
might
help
me
improve
or
understand
human
nature
well
cal
jr
she
say
i
m
go
to
tell
you
what
hurt
because
i
love
you
your
friend
will
only
talk
about
you
behind
your
back
and
the
truth
will
be
hard
to
come
by
i
have
a
different
kind
of
commitment
to
you
than
your
friend
do
she
knew
as
my
father
do
that
some
people
would
talk
about
us
because
we
be
well
off
than
many
people
in
town
i
learn
from
her
that
it
go
with
the
territory
and
wasn
t
worth
get
upset
about
dad
s
comment
be
people
will
forgive
you
for
anything
before
they
ll
forgive
you
for
be
successful
my
parent
love
us
enough
to
try
to
imbue
us
with
value
they
felt
would
serve
us
far
well
than
restrictive
control
they
believe
in
us
and
we
developed
belief
in
ourselves
and
that
be
the
most
productive
growth
influence
we
could
have
have
one
part
of
my
youth
that
help
build
self
confidence
be
summer
camp
although
the
experience
have

memorably
rocky
start

i
wound
up
love
the
place
and
when
i
go
back
the
follow
year
mr
jimmy
ask
me
to
talk
to
the
other
boy
who
be
homesick
while
i
be
at
camp
my
mother
sent
regular
letter
which
be
always
newsy
and
fun
i
felt
wonderful
about
opening
them
until
i
receive
one
that
start
out
innocently
enough
talk
about
a
business
trip
she
be
take
with
my
father
then
she
say
trip
always
cause
her
to
think
about
the
possibility
that
she
might
not
come
back
and
when
she
and
dad
travel
together
she
worried
even
more
she
wonder
what
would
happen
if
they
be
involve
in
a
bad
accident
and
do
not
return
to
their
child
after
lay
that
particularly
morbid
thought
on
me
mama
remind
me
that
i
be
the
old
boy
and
therefore
have
a
special
responsibility
in
the
event
of
their
death
especially
when
it
come
to
the
baby
of
the
family
my
brother
steve
who
be
then
about
five
more
than
anything
she
say
she
want
him
to
be
rear
in
a
way
that
would
give
him
the
best
chance
at
a
happy
and
fulfil
life
but
instead
of
a
whole
laundry
list
of
do
and
don
t
mama
mention
only
one
thing
please
do
all
within
your
power
to
see
that
your
brother
understands
the
principle
of
fair
play
she
write
now
what
on
earth
be
a
twelve
year
old
kid
suppose
to
do
with
that
piece
of
advice
that
letter
and
her
request
would
haunt
me
to
some
extent
all
my
life
they
lead
me
to
try
to
formulate
some
basic
life
principle
a
quest
that
have
interested
me
ever
since
i
think
she
want
the
concept
of
fair
play
to
have
broad
application
and
i
come
to
see
the
principle
behind
it
as
believe
in
the
dignity
of
all
work
have
a
sense
of
humor
and
develop
a
personal
mission
they
be
all
component
of
moral
integrity
and
if
there
s
one
precept
i
carry
from
what
my
parent
and
my
faith
taught
me
it
be
that
if
you
have
a
commitment
to
moral
integrity
you
don
t
need
a
bunch
of
picky
rule
they
aren
t
necessary
in
fact
they
become
just
so
much
unnecessary
baggage
i
think
that
s
part
of
the
core
of
what
jesus
say
and
all
of
this
fit
beautifully
into
my
understand
of
christianity
my
mother
wasn
t
worried
so
much
about
the
precept
themselves
as
she
be
about
someone
bring
them
to
life
for
my
brother
she
want
me
to
be
the
kind
of
person
who
exemplify
them
it
be
the
begin
of
a
lifelong
desire
to
try
to
do
just
that
much
of
that
side
of
my
personality
come
from
my
mother
who
oversaw
a
lot
of
my
moral
development
she
be
there
with
more
practical
advice
as
well
include
some
i
thought
would
fall
more
naturally
to
my
father
son
she
say
once
let
me
teach
you
how
to
fight
there
be
three
rule
rule
number
one
be
don
t
ever
get
into
a
fight
you
re
smart
enough
to
talk
your
way
out
of
any
situation
that
s
lead
in
that
direction
so
there
s
no
reason
to
get
into
a
fight
in
the
first
place
number
two
if
you
do
get
into
a
fight
don
t
lose
when
you
decide
to
hit
someone
hit
him
hard
if
that
doesn
t
work
pick
up
a
stick
and
hit
him
and
if
that
doesn
t
work
pick
up
a
rock
don
t
lose
and
rule
number
three
remember
don
t
ever
get
into
a
fight
then
there
be
the
time
we
take
a
rare
family
vacation
i
be
eleven
or
twelve
and
we
have
go
to
daytona
beach
and
my
mother
ask
me
to
take
a
walk
with
her
i
couldn
t
understand
why
she
be
so
nervous
and
tentative
but
as
we
walk
along
the
beach
she
begin
talk
about
laura
jo
explain
to
me
that
she
be
have
her
first
menstrual
cycle
she
stumble
through
a
talk
about
how
this
happens
when
a
girl
becomes
a
woman
and
how
it
s
a
thirty
day
cycle
related
to
how
woman
have
baby
i
don
t
know
if
i
caught
everything
she
be
say
but
i
do
remember
how
concerned
i
be
about
the
extraordinary
difficulty
she
be
have
with
the
conversation
i
remember
try
to
help
it
along
as
much
as
i
could
my
dad
wasn
t
much
on
moral
or
spiritual
instruction
and
after
work
six
day
a
week
he
be
much
more
attract
to
the
golf
course
than
to
church
what
i
get
from
my
dad
be
a
sense
of
camaraderie
and
companionship
although
golf
didn
t
really
help
foster
that
i
try
be
a
caddy
but
it
be
work
hot
work
at
that
and
i
didn
t
take
to
the
game
to
this
day
i
m
not
very
good
at
it
temperamentally
my
father
and
i
be
very
similar
but
there
be
many
day
to
day
difference
in
our
talent
and
interest
some
thing
he
do
well
i
didn
t
and
vice
versa
he
be
a
great
basketball
player
i
wasn
t
worth
much
out
on
the
court
if
somebody
else
want
the
ball
that
much
more
than
i
do
i
thought
he
ought
to
have
it
the
competition
of
sport
be
never
a
big
thing
with
me
when
it
become
obvious
my
heart
wasn
t
in
basketball
my
dad
say
son
give
it
up
and
that
s
what
i
do
i
become
the
team
statistician
and
begin
work
in
the
warehouse
after
school
saturday
i
d
work
at
our
local
retail
store
allen
dry
good
my
knowledge
of
some
sport
in
fact
be
pretty
limited
the
first
time
i
saw
a
football
in
our
neighbor
s
yard
i
thought
somebody
have
run
over
tandy
pettigo
s
basketball
fortunately
scottsville
high
didn
t
have
a
football
team
so
my
ignorance
didn
t
hurt
my
dad
want
me
to
do
well
than
he
do
in
other
area
he
want
me
to
get
well
grade
to
be
well
than
he
at
music
which
wasn
t
difficult
since
even
his
whistle
be
tuneless
and
to
become
a
public
speaker
he
urge
me
to
take
every
speech
course
i
could
all
of
that
be
about
polish
and
presentation
i
think
my
dad
affected
my
external
development
while
mama
have
the
major
influence
on
my
internal
growth
i
m
guess
that
s
true
for
most
men
you
tend
to
mimic
your
dad
as
a
man
but
your
inner
be
probably
come
more
from
your
early
nurture
by
your
mom
in
my
case
my
time
at
camp
dunroamin
which
have
come
about
because
of
my
mother
remain
a
big
part
of
the
mature
process
i
go
back
year
after
year
until
when
i
be
sixteen
i
become
a
counselor
some
of
my
early
leadership
skill
and
my
knowledge
of
people
what
they
be
like
and
how
to
get
along
with
them
come
from
that
lovely
place

business
the
key
turner
dynamic
business
be
the
backdrop
for
pretty
much
every
family
activity
sometimes
even
prayer
i
remember
mama
ask
my
sister
and
me
to
pray
for
snow
because
my
dad
be
overstock
on
four
buckle
overshoe
which
of
course
he
have
overbought
then
one
christmas
season
she
ask
us
to
pray
for
the
snow
to
melt
so
customer
could
get
to
our
store
if
they
couldn
t
shop
he
wouldn
t
be
able
to
pay
the
bank
at
the
end
of
the
year
we
learn
at
an
early
age
that
retailer
desperately
need
god
s
cooperation
when
it
come
to
the
weather
we
also
learn
the
importance
of
december
when
christmas
shopping
could
make
all
the
difference
between
stay
in
business
another
year
and
go
under
in
retailing
my
grandfather
use
to
say
you
lose
money
for
eleven
month
just
hop
to
make
it
all
back
in
december
then
in
january
you
begin
the
struggle
all
over
again
we
also
prayed
for
my
dad
mama
make
sure
we
ask
god
to
help
him
not
to
work
too
hard
for
all
the
lightheartedness
in
her
personality
she
like
many
of
our
friend
worried
sometimes
that
work
might
get
the
best
of
him
she
have
lose
her
own
father
when
she
be
eighteen
so
her
worry
tug
at
a
very
deep
loss
later
his
doctor
would
worry
about
my
dad
too
but
none
of
that
affected
him
work
be
his
life
it
fed
his
spirit
the
hub
of
that
work
be
the
two
story
brick
warehouse
on
east
main
street
my
dad
would
ship
merchandise
to
the
store
during
the
week
from
inventory
reflect
his
seemingly
whimsical
buying
escapade
and
he
d
call
them
on
saturday
night
to
see
how
they
be
do
those
call
be
part
of
his
routine
until
the
s
he
call
every
store
manager
in
the
chain
from
an
upstairs
bedroom
the
local
operator
miss
molly
pace
stayed
one
call
ahead
of
him
tell
the
next
store
manager
on
the
list
that
mr
turner
would
be
with
him
in
fifteen
minute
every
manager
have
to
stay
on
saturday
night
until
he
call
it
be
that
important
it
be
a
big
deal
to
miss
molly
too
the
highlight
of
her
week
as
far
as
i
could
tell
i
do
believe
she
live
for
the
moment
when
my
dad
would
brag
about
her
for
her
help
in
connect
him
to
all
those
store
manager
how
much
have
we
sell
my
dad
ask
those
manager
how
much
be

bank
deposit
retailing
the
cal
turner
way
involve
clean
friendly
high
perform
store
and
saturday
night
be
when
he
get
the
chance
to
see
that
performance
on
paper
it
be
personal
and
it
be
all
consume
he
be
always
stretch
perilously
thin
on
cash
and
he
have
to
know
precisely
how
much
money
would
be
flow
into
farmer
national
bank
in
scottsville
from
all
those
store
before
the
check
he
d
write
mostly
to
vendor
from
whom
he
d
bought
merchandise

present
for
payment
wednesday
he
be
in
short
play
the
float

be
very
good
at
it
and
when
he
knew
he
couldn
t
cover
his
check
he
would
get
in
the
car
with
luther
and
drive
to
nashville
to
borrow
some
more
money
from
sam

in
have
become

dad
to
buy
into
farmer
national
bank
and

board
and
while
they
sometimes
fought
like
cat
and
dog
turner
and
goad
often
look
at
thing
differently
it
be
a
great
bit
of
synergy
for
my
dad
who
be
on
the
board
of
an
institution
integral
to
his
retail
business
and
for
sam

have
a
great
connection
to
the
retailer
in
the
small
town
serve
by
the

because
he
be
a
small
town

himself
his
love
of
his
customer
be
definitely
part
of

approach
to
business
as

respect
them
he
knew
their
family
come
from
the
same
stock
as
he
they
struggle
they
get
by
with
little
we
ve
always
identify
the
folk
in
small
town
as
those
who
could
recognize
the
real
value
of
merchandise
he
say
only
two
or
three
of
the
store
bore
the
turner
name
back
then
turner
s
department
store
in
horse
cave
kentucky
be
one
but
they
be
all
part
of
j
l
turner
and
son
and
he
kept
a
close
eye
on
all
of
them
i
d
visit
store
with
him
occasionally
and
as

incredibly
high
standard
he
want
a
store
to
be
clean
and
well
displayed
he
didn
t
want
to
see
anything
in
the
stockroom
it
might
as
well
have
be
bury
every
bit
of
merchandise
should
be
available
to
the
customer
he
have
opinion
on
the
right
way
to
do
almost
everything
and
he
never
just
told
people
he
always
show
them
his
training
style
be
energetic
hand
on
on
the
other
hand
he
thought
the
hard
work
of
keep
store
shouldn
t
harm
the
atmosphere
for
shopper
he
have
a
great
personality
with
customer
he
wasn
t
much
with
joke
or
small
talk
but
he
greet
everyone
who
walk
through
the
door
and
he
like
the
door
to
be
wide
open
he
like
people
and
sincerely
want
them
to
feel
welcome
he
be
happy
to
answer
question
or
help
them
find
something
like
his
father
he
be
a
real
southern
gentleman
he
tipped
his
hat
to
the
lady
and
always
held
door
open
for
them
like
my
grandfather
my
dad
always
dress
like
a
businessman
although
he
be
more
colorful
whether
he
be
in
his
warehouse
office
or
on
the
road
visit
store
he
wore
a
coat
and
tie
especially
early
on
my
mother
might
get
a
rise
from
her
garden
and
pin
it
to
his
lapel
as
he
left
the
house
in
the
morning
he
be
a
no
nonsense
bos
someone
who
expect
everyone
around
him
to
work
as
hard
as
he
do
in
the
warehouse
when
it
come
time
to
get
down
to
business
he
d
take
off
his
jacket
loosen
his
tie
undo
the
top
button
of
his
shirt
and
roll
up
his
sleeve
he
thought
of
employee
as
family
and
be
generally
pleasant
and
enjoyable
to
be
around
he
and
luther

and

the
jacksonian
hotel
in
scottsville
to
thank
them
for
their
partnership
and
the
success
they
share
one
year
when
my
brother
steve
be
just
five
or
so
my
dad
give
him
a
box
of
cigar
to
pas
out
to
those
attend
steve
come
back
after
a
while
with
a
pile
of
bill
in
the
box
he
d
be
sell
them
rather
than
give
them
away
my
dad
say
we
have
the
making
of
a
great
little
merchant
here
it
be
family
it
be
fun
and
it
be
work
but
my
dad
be
always
restless
always
think
these
be
junior
department
store
miniature
version
of
the
big
store
in
nashville
and
louisville
he
study
what
the
merchant
there
be
do
and
thought
about
way
to
get
even
big
meanwhile
i
study
my
parent
like
most
kid
i
learn
far
more
from
them
when
they
didn
t
know
they
be
teach
fortunately
the
big
lesson
from
both
be
positive
i
remember
my
mother
say
son
for
a
good
boy
you
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble
that
little
statement
provide
a
beautifully
healthy
separation
of
the
person
and
the
teenage
crime
it
say
i
be
good
even
though
my
action
sometimes
weren
t
she
help
me
see
the
gap
between
who
i
be
and
what
i
do
and
remind
me
there
be
an
ideal
to
reach
for
for
the
rest
of
my
life
her
approach
position
me
to
retain
a
sense
of
humor
in
the
face
of
my
own
shortcoming
and
to
try
for
a
healthy
ego
management
so
i
could
well
grasp
the
lesson
i
need
to
learn
then
there
be
the
unstinting
support
and
admiration
i
receive
from
my
father
my
first
job
be
sweep
the
floor
in
the
warehouse
after
school
i
be
thirteen
or
so
and
make
cent
an
hour
my
dad
make
a
point
of
come
into
an
aisle
i
d
just
swept
he
d
bring
associate
and
say
look
at
this
have
you
ever
see
a
floor
that
be
swept
as
well
as
this
he
d
speak
as
if
he
didn
t
know
i
be
within
earshot
as
i
swept
the
next
aisle
and
it
work
the
more
he
brag
the
harder
i
swept
that
kind
of
approval
be
so
important
since
a
parent
s
support
can
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
learn
later
of
the
parallel
between
the
son
of
the
founder
of
another
chain
of
store
and
me
he
be
well
look
and
more
intelligent
he
be
a
lawyer
and
a
cpa
but
he
never
really
get
the
blessing
the
way
i
do
his
father
would
get
all
over
him
if
he
come
home
with
one
b
on
a
report
card
that
otherwise
have
all
a
s
when
i
come
home
with
the
same
report
card
my
dad
would
say
son
that
s
wonderful
i
never
thought
a
turner
could
make
grade
this
good
it
be
a
great
feel
dollar
general
become
many
time
more
successful
than
that
chain
something
i
attribute
largely
to
the
influence
of
the
found
father
of
each
business
and
how
they
rear
their
son
so
much
of
success
and
failure
lie
in
what
we
take
from
our
primary
relationship
it
be
fun
be
part
of
the
company
that
young
and
i
remember
the
kick
troy
connor
who
drove
for
wehby
trucking
out
of
nashville
get
out
of
me
he
call
me
little
tunna
as
we
unloaded
case
and
he
count
each
one
it
be
incredible
to
him
that
at
twelve
or
thirteen
i
be
work
there
it
be
fun
and
excite
sometimes
because
it
be
such
a
seat
of
the
pant
operation
there
be
no
rhyme
or
reason
when
it
come
to
the
main
warehouse
and
there
still
wasn
t
a
load
dock
truck
just
back
up
to
the
front
porch
after
we
d
stack
and
count
the
box
on
the
porch
we
d
take
them
in
and
store
them
wherever
we
could
find
space
which
be
always
at
a
premium
ideally
we
d
unload
them
onto
low
table
or
shelf
but
usually
there
be
so
much
merchandise
come
in
that
a
lot
of
it
would
simply
be
pile
in
the
aisle
there
just
wasn
t
time
to
get
it
out
and
displayed
in
some
sort
of
organize
way
find
anything
be
a
nightmare
store
manager
come
in
once
a
week
to
see
what
the
bos
have
bought
lately
and
to
pick
out
what
they
thought
they
need
they
d
load
everything
into
a
big
cart
and
take
it
by
marie
foster
s
desk
another
worker
would
call
off
the
item
and
marie
would
type
an
invoice
and
give
it
to
the
manager
as
he
left
we
d
cram
their
car
full
of
as
much
merchandise
as
we
could
and
the
manager
have
invariably
take
the
backseat
out
so
they
d
hold
even
more
we
d
take
everything
out
of
the
box
shoe
shirt
blouse
and
pack
it
loose
in
the
trunk
until
we
could
barely
get
the
lid
down
then
we
d
pack
more
into
the
rear
where
the
backseat
have
be
until
it
be
jammed
against
the
roof
if
the
manager
have
driven
by
himself
we
d
fill
the
passenger
seat
too
if
there
be
no
mirror
on
the
outside
we
d
leave
a
hole
right
down
the
middle
so
he
could
see
out
the
back
in
the
rearview
it
have
to
be
a
mess
when
they
arrive
at
the
store
but
our
system
allow
us
to
get
the
most
good
possible
into
a
very
small
space
empty

but
a
fair
negotiator
he
knew
the
perceive
value
of
a
product
and
what
his
customer
need
and
want
when
he
saw
a
good
buy
he
jumped
right
into
it
he

from
a
great
position
because
they
knew
he
paid
his

if

a
percent
discount
for

then
if
they
didn
t
he
might
negotiate

sixty
day
or
ninety
rather

normally
believe
in
buying
high
style
clothing
that
be
subject
to
volatile
trend
and
might
have
to
be
close
out
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
would
rather
buy
item
he
could
pack
away
and
bring
out
the
next
season
if
those
seller
want
to
get
rid
of
something
they

sort
of
contest
and
i
get
up
onstage
they
make
fun
of
my
accent
but
i
have
fun
and
the
even
be
a
great
one
we
also
saw
gwen
verdon
in
damn
yankee
which
be
very
impressive
as
well
we
d
often
go
to
show
and
we
ate
out
regularly
i
remember
the
new
york
waiter
reaction
when
mama
order
ketchup
to
go
with
her
scramble
egg
at
breakfast
something
they
d
never
heard
of
once
one
of
my
dad
s
vendor
get
mama
a
spot
on
one
of
her
favorite
game
show
top
dollar
which
air
from
a
studio
in
new
york
all
of
scottsville
knew
she
be
go
to
be
on
tv
and
everybody
tune
in
mama
have
watch
the
show
every
day
and
be
really
good
at
it
sure
enough
she
won
two
or
three
round
but
i
remember
that
her
flat
southern
accent
for
some
reason
sound
awful
on
network
television
then
she
be
ask
to
identify
a
certain
kind
of
sausage
the
answer
be
knockwurst
and
she
didn
t
get
it
i
can
still
hear
her
say
that
s
not
fair
we
don
t
have
that
in
scottsville
everybody
roar
and
that
be
the
round
she
lose
as
the
show
go
off
the
air
they
brought
out
a
knockwurst
necklace
and
place
it
around
her
neck
which
really
embarrass
me
although
she
be
a
good
sport
and
enjoy
herself
not
long
after
my
first
new
york
trip
in
we
move
into
a
big
colonial
style
home
at
west
cherry
street
it
have
thick
brick
wall
and
stood
on
six
acre
right
across
from
the
jail
something
we
use
to
joke
about
my
dad
paid
for
it
and
then
have
to
scramble
for
the
cash
to
landscape
and
remodel
it
my
mother
brought
in
an
interior
design
firm
but
my
dad
say
they
could
only
redo
the
two
downstairs
room
in
the
front
of
the
house
the
living
room
and
the
den
because
that
be
all
we
could
afford
the
remodel
process
be
especially
memorable
because
when
they
tore
out
one
of
the
floor
they
found
a
big
tree
stump
beneath
it
apparently
the
builder
have
cut
the
tree
low
enough
that
they
could
build
over
it
and
never
bother
to
take
out
the
stump
the
landscape
designer
a
woman
whose
purple
hose
i
still
remember
as
they
make
her
leg
look
like
big
eggplant
take
one
look
at
the
large
unimproved
expanse
of
ground
on
which
the
house
sat
and
waylaid
my
dad
as
he
blew
by
on
his
way
out
the
door
she
say
congratulation
mr
turner
you
have
built
a
mansion
on
the
city
dump
but
i
can
fix
it
i
d
never
see
anyone
so
handily
stop
him
in
his
track
she
do
indeed
fix
it
and
when
the
improvement
have
be
make
we
have
a
huge
open
house
for
the
community
we
brought
in
luella
lambert
and
her
hammond
organ
so
she
could
provide
music
my
parent
invite
the
town
s
teetotaler
for
the
first
two
hour
and
those
who
imbibed
for
the
next
two
spike
the
punch
in
between
even
in
a
small
town
know
who
fit
into
which
category
can
be
tricky
and
my
parent
laugh
at
how
many
member
of
the
early
crowd
stayed
into
the
second
portion
of
the
even
and
how
much
they
seem
to
enjoy
themselves

every
day
be
dollar
day
i
be
fifteen
when
my
dad
take
the
step
that
change
everything
it
involve
the
kind
of
creative
leap
that
come
along
all
too
rarely
and
it
ultimately
left
a
huge
mark
on
american
business
we
have
thirty
six
store
in
small
kentucky
and
tennessee
town
gross
about
million
annually
and
my
dad
be
always
look
for
way
to
grow
he
be
a
keen
observer
of
both
his
customer
and
the
competition
and
he
become
intrigue
by
the
dollar
day
sale
put
on
by
the
big
department
store
in
nashville
and
louisville
once
a
month
they
would
take
out
huge
full
color
newspaper
ad
and
sell
merchandise
with
as
the
single
price
point
my
dad
knew
what
those
ad
cost
and
he
understood
that
if
they
be
spending
that
kind
of
money
they
be
sell
a
lot
of
good
customer
obviously
love
that
price
point
somehow
it
make
real
value
seem
even
more
obvious
why
couldn
t
we
simplify
all
of
our
operation
he
thought
by
opening
a
store
with
only
one
price
a
dollar
every
day
would
be
dollar
day
in
that
flash
of
insight
he
saw
any
number
of
benefit
customer
could
keep
track
of
what
they
be
spending
more
easily
and
checkout
would
be
simplify
my
dad
be
convince
he
have
something
he
walk
into
work
the
next
day
and
ask
his
management
team
to
join
him
in
his
office
he
told
them
he
want
to
sell
everything
in
every
store
for
in
some
case
it
would
be
multiple
like
three
plate
or
two
pair
of
sock
for
but
nothing
would
cost
more
what
do
you
think
he
say
cal
they
told
him
it
ll
never
work
you
can
t
buy
enough
merchandise
to
sell
that
cheap
they
be
especially
concerned
about
apparel
since
so
much
of
it
sell
for
more
than
but
cal
turner
sr
be
the
classic
entrepreneur
he
follow
his
gut
and
his
gut
told
him
this
would
work
he
trust
his
knowledge
of
customer
more
than
he
trust
the
opinion
of
even
those
closest
to
him
he
decide
to
do
it
he
would
start
with
a
store
that
have
fail
it
be
in
springfield
kentucky
and
it
have
operate
at
a
loss
as
a
junior
department
store
it
would
provide
a
great
test
of
whether
this
new
concept
would
work
that
left
choose
a
name
the
word
dollar
be
a
must
that
be
the
whole
point
with
a
nod
to
the
term
general
store
he
add
the
word
general
he
be
an
opportunity
buyer
he
look
for
bargain
and
the
word
general
would
let
customer
know
they
might
find
just
about
anything
inside
he
often
say
back
in
the
country
the
general
store
be
where
everything
and
anything
be
sell
the
dollar
general
sign
he
decide
would
be
black
and
yellow
a
combination
he
knew
really
stood
out
i
want
the
color
to
leap
right
off
the
store
sign
he
say
the
opening
be
set
for
wednesday
june
turner
s
department
store
on
main
street
in
springfield
would
become
the
first
dollar
general
store
the
layout
be
clean
and
simple
with
big
bold
red
sign
seemingly
everywhere
its
slogan
be
every
day
be
dollar
day
on
the
big
day
people
crowd
around
the
front
of
the
building
by
the
hundred
the
manager
knew
he
wouldn
t
be
able
to
let
them
all
in
at
once
so
when
he
open
he
let
customer
in
until
the
place
be
good
and
crowd
and
then
shut
the
door
behind
them
as
they
come
out
he
let
new
people
in
he
and
my
father
have
a
hit
on
their
hand
and
my
dad
have
a
concept
he
could
take
to
other
store
in
the
chain
where
the
scenario
of
huge
crowd
at
grand
opening
would
be
repeat
over
and
over
the
second
store
be
in
memphis
dad
bought
the
goodwin
crockery
company
a
wholesaler
with
an
office
and
a
big
warehouse
on
union
street
it
wasn
t
exactly
a
prime
retail
market
there
be
use
car
lot
here
and
there
and
not
much
else
dad
load
the
building
with
merchandise
and
open
for
business
sell
nothing
for
more
than
that
store
have
sale
of
million
in
the
first
ten
month
a
million
one
hundred
and
thirteen
thousand
dollar
my
dad
say
to
me
isn
t
that
amaze
dad
knew
he
have
something
he
open
and
convert
other
store
eager
to
reproduce
that
early
success
and
always
look
for
the
next
opportunity
my
dad
knew
he
be
change
the
customer
entire
way
of
think
this
be
a
different
way
to
present
value
avoid
common
price
point
like
cent
which
would
now
be
two
for
in
his
store
they
wouldn
t
be
look
at
a
host
of
individual
price
anymore
they
d
be
think
look
what
i
can
get
for
a
dollar
i
can
get
ten
of
these
fork
or
four
of
these
saucer
and
since
i
can
mix
and
match
i
can
get
five
fork
and
two
saucer
for
a
dollar
he
be
change
the
approach
of
his
buyer
as
well
he
have
always
work
with
a
few
people
who
could
deal
with
vendor
and
haggle
over
the
price
for
everything
but
the
clothing
he
so
love
deal
with
but
my
dad
didn
t
believe
in
have
a
lot
of
buyer
for
a
long
time
he
have
be
the
buyer
and
gradually
he
d
be
training
people
to
do
what
he
do
still
it
be
a
long
slow
process
for
him
to
get
to
the
point
where
he
d
trust
them
to
implement
the
decision
make
he
d
hone
through
the
year
classically
it
have
be
i
ll
negotiate
the
best
price
i
can
then
add
my
thirty
percent
markup
and
that
will
be
the
retail
price
now
they
d
have
to
think
in
term
of
one
price
point
and
then
common
sense
multiple
like
two
for
something
that
become
clear
after
he
d
price
shoe
at
apiece
to
conform
with
his
slogan
nothing
over
a
dollar
some
people
would
buy
just
one
he
wound
up
with
mismatch
shoe
so
he
go
to
per
pair
of
shoe
and
other
multiple
of
weren
t
far
behind
the
important
thing
be
that
each
bill
in
a
customer
s
pocket
represent
a
unique
and
easily
understood
price
point
he
or
she
would
know
what
each
would
buy
each
price
point
would
have
to
mark
a
clear
step
up
in
value
as
a
buyer
bought
for
the
upcoming
christmas
season
he
d
be
think
what
be
the
best
stock
stuffer
we
can
offer
a
customer
for
a
dollar
what
kind
of
gift
or
toy
can
we
price
at
five
dollar
then
what
be
go
to
be
the
one
big
toy
for
that
child
that
we
can
offer
at
ten
dollar
you
d
have
crisp
differentiate
level
of
value
in
your
store
and
your
customer
could
understand
the
system
and
keep
up
with
what
she
be
spending
my
dad
knew
it
would
require
real
discipline
with
the
dollar
strategy
the
discipline
be
force
on
you
he
say
with
virtually
every
item
less
than
ten
dollar
and
with
the
pricing
at
one
dollar
break
there
be
not
much
room
to
stretch
price
point
retailing
take
nerve
and
we
ve
have
the
nerve
we
have
to
be
well
merchant
to
operate
in
this
niche
we
have
to
cream
the
line
we
carry
to
have
the
great
possible
offering
in
a
small
store
we
have
to
make
every
item
count
we
have
to
recognize
that
if
we
make
a
mistake
we
ve
get
to
get
it
out
of
there
quickly
i
m
not
one
for
false
pride
dad
knew
there
be
time
they
d
have
to
sell
below
cost
to
give
the
best
deal
possible
to
the
customer
while
stick
with
that
price
if
he
be
buying
for
example
cold
pack
canners
big
cover
pot
use
in
home
can
he
might
pay
a
dozen
he
knew
they
d
make
great
item
that
would
help
bring
in
customer
so
that
s
where
he
d
price
them
on
the
other
hand
he
might
be
buying
cheap
ceramic
from
japan
at
a
dozen
he
d
price
those
at
too
he
want
the
store
employee
think
they
be
make
a
profit
on
everything
they
sell
to
keep
them
smile
through
both
sale
and
he
d
handle
the
markup
at
the
wholesale
level
he
d
bill
both
item
to
the
store
at
a
dozen
and
they
d
sell
them
for
a
piece
or
a
dozen
a
markup
of
per
dozen
meanwhile
the
warehouse
be
get
from
the
store
for
item
for
which
it
paid
a
total
of
the
ceramic
cover
the
loss
they
would
have
show
on
the
canners
that
way
they
wouldn
t
show
a
loss
of
on
every
dozen
cold
pack
canners
for
good
measure
it
would
mystify
his
competitor
who
knew
dad
be
sell
those
canners
for
less
than
they
be
buying
them
wholesale
and
wonder
how
he
could
possibly
be
get
such
a
good
price
sometimes
he
knew
he
d
have
to
go
to
the
vendor
and
say
i
can
t
pay
you
that
much
i
ve
get
to
sell
this
at
a
dollar
can
you
work
with
me
he
would
actually
become
an
agent
for
the
customer
it
would
take
discipline
and
stubbornness
quality
cal
sr
have
in
abundance
one
early
episode
epitomize
the
popularity
of
the

and
the
effectiveness
of
good
pricing
my

s
pant

sell
for
a
dollar
mr
comer
wasn
t
able
to
do
it
quite
that
cheaply
but
he
come
close
enough
that
daddy
bought
a
lot
of
them
at

less
than

quality
there
be
nothing
else
mr

when

in

i
ask
him
i
don
t
know
great
i
thought
this
be
go
to
take
forever
and
when
it
s
all
say
and
do
i
will
only
have
make
a
thirty
nine
cent
sale
well
we
have
to

i

how

be
she
he
point
to
my

she
s
about
her
size
now
we
re
get
somewhere
i
thought
aunt
ethel
be
our
best
clerk
and
at
the
moment
she
be
wait
on
a
customer
she
have
a
big
armful
of
merchandise
she
be
about
to
ring
up
ethel
i
yell
in
a
voice
that
boom
across
the
crowd
store
what
size
panty
do
you
wear
well
she
make
a
noise
like
a
gobble
turkey
threw
the
merchandise
in
the
air
and
go
run
red
face
to
the
stockroom
i
walk
over
and
finish
her
sale
then
go
back
to
the
farmer
see
that
ethel
wasn
t
go
to
cooperate
we
just
held
the
panty
up
to
look
at
them
and
he
try
to
imagine
whether
or
not
they
d
fit
as
we
talk
i
realize
that
he
didn
t
want
to
be
in
that
discussion
any
more
than
i
do
he
be
there
because
his
wife
have
ask
him
to
come
he
be
make
a
sacrifice
for
the
old
lady
and
he
need
me
to
help
so
he
could
get
out
of
there
i
understood
in
that
moment
that
we
be
connect
then
i
realize
that
the
sacrifice
wasn
t
just
his
time
or
any
embarrassment
he
felt
he
have
to
do
this
right
because
cent
be
a
meaningful
amount
of
money
to
him
every
penny
that
come
in
and
go
out
meant
something
it
occur
to
me
what
vastly
different
life
we
lead
the
turner
be
so
much
well
off
than
this
poor
old
farmer
who
be
like
many
of
our
customer
surely
struggle
just
to
get
by
if
there
be
anybody
in
that
community
who
need
help
it
be
he
and
those
like
him
for
the
first
time
i
be
look
right
through
the
dirt
and
the
tobacco
juice
and
the
smell
and
connect
with
this
customer
the
mr
fix
it
part
of
my
personality
have
connect
with
the
need
this
man
have
for
value
in
everything
he
bought
he
remind
me
a
little
of
my
grandfather
who
start
out
as
a
poor
dirt
farmer
and
who
still
embarrass
me
somewhat
with
his
unpolished
english
but
where
luther
have
harness
his
willingness
to
work
toward
a
dream
and
have
gotten
off
the
farm
this
man
never
would
i
usually
felt
like
a
misfit
around
our
customer
they
seem
crude
and
unsophisticated
like
this
old
codger
and
it
wasn
t
until
later
that
i
realize
the
problem
be
simply
my
youthful
judgmental
arrogance
what
i
do
realize
in
that
moment
be
that
he
be
poor
and
that
since
my
life
be
so
different
i
must
be
rich
i
wonder
if
the
old
lady
knew
how
much
he
love
her
heck
i
wonder
if
he
knew
how
much
he
love
her
how
sweet
his
willingness
to
sacrifice
really
be
and
i
doubt
he
ever
have
a
clue
as
to
the
impact
he
have
on
me
meanwhile

most
effective
color
combination
in
term
of

my
teen

with
an
african
american
fellow
name
john

lot
of
real
grunt
work
i
remember
get
cocky
one
day
as
we
be
unload
truck
at
one
point
i
decide
to
take
the
liberty
of
jumping
into
the
cab
of
one
of
those
rig
and
backing
it
up
to
the
load
dock
after
all
i
be
sixteen
and
have
my
driver
s
license
and
somebody
have
to
do
it
i
be
the
bos

no

an
intrigue
process
figure
out
how
to
turn
right
to
make
the
trailer
go
left
and
all
the
rest
amazingly
enough
i
pull
it
off
backing
one
up
to
the
dock
successfully
so
then
j
l
decide
he
d
do
it
he
get
in
and
start
backing
it
up
and
the
big
square
back
end
of
that
thing
take
off
a
corner
of
the
awning
that
effectively
end
our
drive
career
even
though
in
a
way
it
have
not
be
my
fault
there
will
be
no
more
of
that
cal
jr
be
my
dad
s
only
comment
jay
and
i
be
buddy

get
a
kick
out
of
each
other

the
first
employee
my
grandfather
ever

a
small
african
american
population
and
i
be
never

of
scottsville
need
as
much
of
everybody

white
as
it
could
get
just
as
the
town
have
a
generally
congenial
atmosphere
dollar
general
for
all
its
early
growth
felt
like
a
small
company
i
remember
a
party
for
store
manager
when
i
be
sixteen
it
be
the
night
the
first
turner
grandchild
my
old
sister
s
first
child
be
born
the
birth
come
early
and
my
mother
as
hostess
of
the
store
party
couldn
t
make
it
to
louisiana
she
be
fit
to
be
tie
that
she
be
home
miss
an
event
this
momentous
but
she
go
ahead
and
host
the
dinner
party
every
year
someone
would
ask
her
to
sing
and
she
never
would
until
that
year
it
may
have
be
that
she
be
feel
the
blue
that
night
because
she
honor
the
request
please
laura
sing
the
st
louis
blue
someone
say
luella
lambert
be
at
the
piano
and
though
they
hadn
t
practice
mama
get
up
and
sang
i
remember
be
embarrass
at
how
much
emotion
she
put
into
it
you
could
see
that
song
write
all
over
her
face
as
the
dollar
general
concept
take
off
in
the
late
s
my
grandfather
spent
less
time
with
the
business
and
more
and
more
on
his
farm
he
recognize
that
he
be
lose
mental
function
and
knew
it
would
only
get
bad
he
give
my
dad
power
of
attorney
and
begin
gift
his
company
stock
to
family
member
planning
his
estate
so
that
we
wouldn
t
be
face
with
heavy
tax
when
he
die
i
still
remember
the
vacant
stare
in
his
eye
just
before
he
be
sent
to
the
seventh
day
adventist
hospital
in
madison
tennessee
for
shock
treatment
i
have
the
great
respect
and
love
for
papa
and
watch
him
endure
this
terrible
procedure
be
gut
wrench
i
remain
sensitive
when
it
come
to
thing
like
that
and
i
sought
solace
in
the
methodism
that
channel
the
spiritual
awaken
i
d
felt
at
eleven
the
time
i
spent
in
and
around
church
be
at
least
equal
to
the
time
i
spent
in
extracurricular
activity
at
school
i
be
part
of
almost
everything
that
go
on
and
a
prominent
part
of
much
of
it
i
be
church
organist
and
a
regular
at
sunday
school
and
methodist
youth
fellowship
meeting
church
be
a
natural
venue
for
me
i
could
feel
an
inner
thirst
be
at
least
partially
quenched
there
it
also
felt
good
to
get
the
approval
of
the
little
old
lady
who
be
prone
to
say
thing
like
cal
jr
i
m
pray
that
you
re
go
to
be
a
preacher
i
could
gauge
their
sincerity
by
the
fact
that
they
sometimes
have
tear
roll
down
their
cheek
church
also
fed
my
intellectual
development
as
i
thought
through
the
doctrinal
difference
of
the
various
denomination
some
thought
other
denomination
be
go
to
hell
who
be
right
be
a
question
i
have
to
think
through
then
there
be
the
hypothetical
scenario
that
go
like
this
suppose
you
be
save
but
die
before
you
be
actually
baptize
some
because
of
their
literal
interpretation
of
peter
s
confess
christ
and
be
baptize
as
the
full
prescription
say
you
would
go
to
hell
of
course
there
be
other
place
in
the
new
testament
that
say
if
you
believe
in
jesus
you
re
save
but
this
one
go
a
step
far
if
nothing
else
reason
and
argue
with
friend
youth
be
a
great
time
for
that
help
me
realize
i
m
a
pretty
good
methodist
i
knew
that
john
wesley
speak
of
doctrine
have
say
let
all
these
small
point
stand
aside
let
them
never
come
into
sight
if
your
heart
be
as
my
heart
if
you
love
god
and
all
mankind
i
ask
no
more
give
me
your
hand
that
sat
well
with
me
it
s
not
the
denomination
it
s
not
the
belief
it
s
the
relationship
there
be
something
much
big
that
tug
at
me
underneath
that
argument
i
realize
that
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
one
small
event
i
d
have
be
a
baptist
instead
of
a
methodist
the
turner
be
all
baptist
and
so
be
the
goad
but
my
mother
and
her
brother
frank
who
be
a
year
old
and
whom
she
idolize
go
to
a
methodist
revival
as
teenager
she
often
do
what
he
do
so
when
he
walk
down
the
aisle
and
join
the
church
she
follow
him
and
the
two
baptist
who
walk
into
the
revival
come
home
methodist
my
spiritual
outlook
figure
prominently
in
my
early
thought
about
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
life
be
surround
from
birth
by
the
family
business
didn
t
mean
i
knew
it
would
become
my
career
in
fact
i
felt
call
to
ministry
base
on
my
experience
of
jesus
christ
on
that
sunday
even
when
i
be
eleven
and
on
a
far
conversion
experience
at
a
billy
graham
crusade
in
nashville
a
couple
of
year
later
john
wesley
described
my
experience
best
when
he
say
in
discuss
his
aldersgate
conversion
that
his
heart
felt
strangely
warm
that
warmth
that
experience
of
the
presence
of
god
have
always
have
a
claim
on
me
and
have
always
motivate
me
i
knew
my
life
would
be
a
response
to
that
claim
although
i
wasn
t
sure
at
that
point
which
direction
it
would
take
i
thought
for
a
time
about
be
a
doctor
and
when
i
brought
it
up
my
dad
knew
just
what
to
do
he
talk
to
our
family
physician
dr
owen
l
davis
who
arrange
for
me
to
take
off
from
school
to
witness
an
operation
he
d
be
operating
on
a
man
s
stomach
he
told
me
i
thought
he
and
daddy
be
do
me
a
favor
help
me
get
a
jump
start
on
my
dream
i
didn
t
realize
until
year
later
that
it
be
a
conspiracy
to
do
just
the
opposite
i
met
him
at
allen
county
memorial
hospital
scrubbed
up
with
him
get
in
a
gown
and
accompany
him
to
the
operating
room
it
wasn
t
long
before
i
discover
he
hadn
t
be
altogether
truthful
as
i
stood
there
look
over
his
shoulder
dr
davis
remove
a
man
s
very
enlarge
testicle
i
can
still
remember
a
nurse
carry
it
around
the
operating
room
to
the
amusement
of
everyone
but
me
look
for
the
container
that
would
carry
it
to
vanderbilt
university
hospital
for
test
i
go
back
to
school
the
next
day
and
the
secretary
stop
me
what
be
the
operation
you
saw
cal
i
don
t
want
to
talk
about
it
i
say
i
graduate
from
scottsville
high
school
in
as
valedictorian
which
simply
meant
i
make
well
grade
than
the
twenty
six
others
in
the
class
i
have
be
visualize
college
as
an
opportunity
to
take
a
much
need
break
from
scottsville
and
my
family
as
much
as
i
love
them
both
i
want
to
step
out
of
the
shadow
they
cast
on
me
and
discover
who
i
be
one
day
as
i
look
through
a
stack
of
college
brochure
picture
life
on
a
campus
thousand
of
mile
from
home
my
dad
walk
over
and
picked
one
up
son
he
say
i
admire
a
man
who
make
up
his
own
mind
and
i
want
you
to
go
to
school
anywhere
you
want
but
i
ll
pay
your
way
to
vanderbilt
well
i
thought
it
might
be
good
to
get
their
catalog
i
enrol
at
vanderbilt
the
next
fall
eventually
aim
for
a
ba
in
business
administration
with
a
minor
in
philosophy
and
political
theory
i
chose
the
minor
in
consultation
with
the
divinity
school
so
that
if
i
change
my
mind
i
would
be
reasonably
qualify
to
pursue
training
there
the
call
to
ministry
remain
strong
yet
it
be
not
something
i
welcome
in
fact
it
scar
the
heck
out
of
me
still
there
be
no
set
it
aside
completely
my
dad
have
know
how
to
persuade
me
out
of
medicine
but
he
didn
t
know
how
to
dissuade
me
from
the
ministry
it
take
a
preacher
to
do
that
methodist
church
swap
out
preacher
every
four
year
or
so
and
scottsville
methodist
have
just
do
that
i
be
a
sophomore
at
vanderbilt
when
i
have
my
first
encounter
with
brother
woodson
on
a
trip
home
i
understand
you
re
consider
the
ministry
he
say
yes
sir
i
be
well
here
s
my
advice
don
t
do
it
i
be
shock
i
m
serious
he
say
find
anything
else
you
can
do
and
do
that
because
only
if
there
s
nothing
else
you
can
do
be
you
truly
call
to
be
a
preacher
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
there
be
far
too
many
preacher
who
be
never
call
in
the
first
place
as
the
shock
wore
off
i
found
that
i
be
actually
relieve
there
be
a
lot
about
be
a
preacher
i
didn
t
want
the
little
old
lady
swoon
over
me
people
pretend
to
listen
every
sunday
and
all
the
politics
and
bureaucracy
that
go
with
run
a
church
but
that
meant
i
have
to
dig
deeper
into
myself
what
do
god
want
for
me
i
thought
there
be
a
parallel
question
what
be
life
s
great
challenge
then
it
come
to
me
oh
heck
i
thought
i
ve
get
to
go
into
the
family
business
i
recoil
at
first
because
it
meant
i
would
not
get
to
become
my
own
person
but
then
i
picture
my
dad
hold
on
to
the
company
forever
and
run
it
into
the
ground
because
it
seem
there
be
no
one
he
d
trust
it
with
besides
me
i
be
cal
jr
i
would
have
to
be
the
bos
s
son
learn
the
business
and
eventually
take
over
in
the
wake
of
that
discussion
with
brother
woodson
i
knew
deep
down
where
i
be
really
head
i
come
to
realize
that
maybe
i
could
have
much
more
effect
on
the
life
of
our
customer
day
in
and
day
out
in
our
store
than
i
ever
could
as
a
preacher
conduct
three
service
a
week
maybe
i
thought
i
have
a
great
call
here
maybe
i
have
found
something
that
be
for
me
big
and
more
fitting
in
fact
i
finally
realize
that
life
s
great
challenge
would
be
to
accept
the
subservience
of
ego
necessary
to
go
into
business
as
the
bos
s
son
rather
than
be
my
own
man
i
thought
back
to
that
ambeer
stain
farmer
buying
the
cent
panty
and
to
the
hundred
of
people
like
him
who
come
in
and
out
of
our
store
i
realize
pretty
quickly
that
they
be
a
lot
smarter
than
i
in
many
way
they
knew
thing
about
life
and
work
that
i
didn
t
they
be
worldly
wise
customer
who
didn
t
quite
trust
a
cocky
young
whippersnapper
sale
boy
they
be
especially
smart
about
determine
real
value
as
oppose
to
perceive
value
they
couldn
t
be
fool
by
display
or
packaging
you
couldn
t
tempt
them
with
sale
item
they
didn
t
need
they
walk
by
everything
except
what
they
have
come
in
for
and
if
you
didn
t
have
it
they
would
simply
walk
back
out
they
prompt
me
to
look
at
the
everyday
dynamic
of
the
business
differently
i
have
always
heard
my
dad
and
grandfather
agree
that
low
end
retailing
be
the
struggle
gutsy
end
of
the
business
you
have
to
work
the
dickens
out
of
your
people
and
you
can
t
pay
them
much
in
order
to
keep
your
overhead
low
and
survive
because
as
i
heard
my
father
say
so
many
time
all
i
expect
my
competition
to
do
to
me
be
everything
he
can
do
why
couldn
t
a
company
like
ours
recruit
people
who
could
be
motivate
to
have
an
impact
on
those
who
like
that
farmer
really
need
a
well
life
i
thought
wait
a
minute
what
if
we
could
recruit
from
our
customer
base
i
believe
god
paint
with
a
broad
brush
when
it
come
to
creativity
and
that
it
sometimes
come
in
unlikely
package
they
would
understand
our
customer
because
they
be
our
customer
they
could
be
excite
about
share
the
business
with
us
retailing
be
a
people
center
business
anyway
and
if
people
be
motivate
they
actually
work
harder
than
if
a
bos
yell
at
them
to
work
hard
we
could
work
to
give
value
to
the
customer
and
still
reward
employee
it
would
be
a
way
to
affect
life
financially
and
otherwise
day
in
and
day
out
maybe
i
really
have
be
call
into
this
business
although
i
hadn
t
be
good
at
all
at
my
early
retail
experience
i
have
be
profoundly
affected
by
that
episode
with
the
old
farmer
it
be
the
start
of
a
lifetime
in
the
family
business
a
lifetime
of
try
to
serve
people
it
turn
out
i
be
call
into
true
ministry
ministry
that
matter
in
the
real
world
the
world
of
hurt
and
pain
and
error
and
sin
which
to
my
mind
be
an
even
high
call
than
the
institutional
ministry
it
be
a
call
that
would
be
the
central
dynamic
of
my
life

academic
and
leadership
test
vanderbilt
and
the
navy
i
enjoy
college
it
be
excite
and
i
felt
challenged
i
live
with
a
roommate
in
barnard
hall
a
freshman
dorm
and
then
have
a
private
room
in
branscomb
quadrangle
for
the
next
three
year
i
join
beta
theta
pi
but
knew
well
than
to
live
in
the
house
i
want
to
be
able
to
study
when
i
want
and
sleep
when
i
want
and
i
knew
that
living
in
a
frat
house
wouldn
t
necessarily
be
conducive
to
either
i
be
in
vanderbilt
s
school
of
art
and
science
work
toward
a
ba
in
business
administration
at
one
point
i
need
to
improve
my
grade
in
freshman
english
and
the
assignment
at
hand
be
a
paper
on
a
poem
our
instructor
a
graduate
student
name
mr
lott
have
read
and
poked
fun
at
joyce
kilmer
s
tree
as
he
be
do
that
i
remember
think
i
agree
with
kilmer
not
you
i
love
the
poem
and
felt
almost
personally
attack
when
he
go
after
it
my
assignment
be
to
critique
some
obscure
poem
that
i
didn
t
think
i
understood
but
i
sequester
myself
in
my
dorm
room
and
thought
okay
cal
what
s
the
most
outlandish
stuff
you
can
sling
here
push
yourself
come
up
with
something
zany
i
give
it
the
most
esoteric
and
startle
interpretation
i
could
and
apparently
mr
lott
bought
what
i
be
sell
because
the
result
be
an
a
i
recall
be
very
impressed
with
a
management
policy
course
that
feature
a
lot
of
case
study
under
professor
david
steine
who
be
also
a
partner
at
j
c
bradford
a
major
regional
brokerage
firm
mr
steine
brought
an
urbane
southern
gentility
into
the
classroom
he
call
himself
a
businessman
and
respect
us
as
future
business
management
professional
on
the
other
hand
i
be
very
unimpressed
with
a
marketing
course
that
seem
like
a
hodgepodge
of
packaging
and
advertising
that
didn
t
know
what
it
want
to
be
when
it
grow
up
perhaps
the
most
important
course
i
take
be
managerial
accounting
which
taught
me
about
the
relationship
between
decision
and
the
number
behind
them
it
take
me
beyond
credit
debit
income
statement
and
balance
sheet
to
demonstrate
that
you
could
re
sort
your
data
to
shed
light
on
the
decision
you
be
try
to
make
in
matter
such
as
lease
versus
purchasing
or
the
desirability
of
outsource
a
give
activity
it
also
taught
me
among
other
thing
a
healthy
disdain
for
accounting
consistency
seem
to
be
the
high
priority
of
accounting
and
as
emerson
told
us
a
foolish
consistency
be
the
hobgoblin
of
little
mind
in
when
i
be
a
senior
at
vanderbilt
j
l
turner
and
son
have
seventy
six
dollar
general
store
and
my
dad
make
the
decision
to
go
public
in
fact
one
session
in
my
management
policy
class
under
david
steine
that
year
be
devote
to
the
prospectus
of
the
initial
public
offering
of
our
stock
steine
s
company
j
c
bradford
want
participation
in
the
deal
then
the
market
go
south
and
my
dad
advise
that
the
stock
would
decline
after
the
public
offering
withdrew
the
offer
rather
than
let
his
friend
suffer
a
loss
after
buying
the
stock
i
graduate
college
in
june
the
first
member
of
my
family
to
do
so
mama
and
daddy
be
extremely
proud
of
me
and
their
present
to
me
be
to
pay
for
fly
lesson
something
i
very
much
want
to
take
that
summer
i
drove
twenty
five
mile
to
and
from
bowling
green
twice
a
day
to
take
lesson
in
a
little
over
two
month
i
have
the
hour
i
need
for
my
license
so
i
take
the
write
exam
and
wait
for
the
result
i
may
have
know
where
i
be
go
with
my
life
but
i
be
in
no
real
hurry
to
get
there
i
still
want
time
away
from
scottsville
my
dad
and
the
business
i
want
to
learn
about
myself
and
my
capability
outside
that
goldfish
bowl
the
more
i
thought
about
the
next
few
year
the
more
the
military
make
sense
i
be
eligible
for
the
draft
and
enlist
would
give
me
some
control
over
how
i
enter
the
service
i
look
at
the
navy
a
college
graduate
could
sign
up
for
four
month
of
training
and
be
commission
an
ensign
a
word
i
do
not
know
how
to
pronounce
at
the
time
it
seem
a
great
way
to
learn
leadership
at
least
the
military
s
version
of
it
so
in
august
i
go
to
newport
rhode
island
to
naval
officer
candidate
school
they
be
take
college
graduate
who
knew
nothing
about
the
military
and
try
to
break
them
down
to
see
if
they
have
what
it
take
to
become
naval
officer
they
be
go
to
have
the
seemingly
impossible
task
of
extract
the
last
ounce
of
ego
from
cal
turner
jr
i
soon
learn
that
they
be
willing
to
work
on
that
with
a
great
deal
of
dedication
and
enthusiasm
i
ll
never
forget
my
first
night
there
i
checked
in
at
the
office
and
they
told
me
how
to
get
to
my
barrack
as
i
approach
them
with
my
duffel
bag
some
guy
who
have
be
there
for
two
month
be
lean
out
of
window
yell
go
home
it
s
hell
the
sun
be
set
i
d
be
travel
all
day
and
i
be
exhaust
i
flop
into
the
bottom
rack
of
the
bunk
bed
in
the
clothes
i
be
wear
and
go
to
sleep
sometime
during
the
middle
of
the
night
i
heard
a
fellow
come
in
and
climb
into
the
upper
rack
they
woke
us
before
dawn
and
i
sleepily
introduce
myself
to
the
man
in
the
upper
bunk
he
say
his
name
be
paul
barra
now
if
you
re
from
the
south
paul
barra
be
how
you
pronounce
pall
bearer
i
look
at
him
and
say
that
s
exactly
what
i
need
a
pall
bearer
military
life
be
certainly
an
adjustment
for
me
there
be
twenty
five
of
us
in
the
head
every
morning
line
up
at
four
sink
to
shave
or
at
the
commode
or
shower
yell
at
the
guy
in
front
of
us
to
hurry
you
have
to
shave
and
shower
get
your
quarter
ready
for
inspection
get
in
your
uniform
and
then
march
as
a
unit
to
the
mess
hall
for
breakfast
we
march
everywhere
with
one
of
us
call
cadence
and
with
john
philip
sousa
music
play
i
still
associate
sousa
with
all
the
march
i
do
the
school
combine
rigorous
all
day
class
work
weapon
and
gunnery
navigation
seamanship
signal
with
all
the
element
of
basic
training
all
crammed
into
four
month
i
never
look
forward
to
inspection
which
happen
right
after
breakfast
they
always
amount
to
an
officer
a
lieutenant
in
this
case
find
a
bunch
of
mickey
mouse
infraction
or
gig
you
could
get
them
for
unshined
shoe
unpolished
brass
or
fail
to
have
a
straight
gig
line
the
alignment
of
shirt
button
belt
and
fly
you
could
get
them
for
all
sort
of
other
thing
include
a
miss
spot
shave
and
give
the
ratio
of
men
to
sink
and
the
fact
that
we
be
always
rush
miss
a
spot
wasn
t
hard
to
do
after
afternoon
class
work
and
a
brief
break
we
have
dinner
then
study
hall
it
make
for
an
extremely
long
day
after
study
hall
right
before
bed
we
get
to
take
a
break
down
at
the
vend
machine
and
i
look
forward
every
day
to
the
one
real
treat
available
there
an
orange
and
vanilla
dreamsicle
i
still
remember
how
good
it
taste
the
course
work
especially
combine
with
all
the
physical
activity
and
those
long
day
be
tough
i
be
start
from
scratch
on
most
everything
and
rigorous
doesn
t
begin
to
describe
it
i
have
never
be
a
hunter
and
though
i
have
shot
at
target
at
camp
dunroamin
i
wasn
t
skilled
with
or
fond
of
gun
and
of
course
i
d
never
be
expose
to
signal
with
flag
every
class
be
a
major
challenge
it
would
have
be
difficult
to
place
me
in
a
more
foreign
world
i
have
go
to
a
great
university
and
take
a
very
intense
course
of
study
but
this
be
something
else
altogether
i
consider
naval
officer
candidate
school
to
be
my
first
real
brush
with
failure
at
vanderbilt
examination
mostly
call
for
long
essay
answer
at
the
end
of
the
semester
the
professor
would
come
up
with
a
statement
that
form
the
basis
of
the
final
exam
something
that
drew
on
everything
learn
in
the
course
in
the
navy
there
be
multiple
choice
examination
that
start
with
the
command
pencil
up
and
end
with
pencil
down
it
be
intense
give
the
workload
and
the
strangeness
of
the
material
i
almost
flunk
out
at
one
point
i
be
call
in
by
the
company
officer
for
the
kind
of
chew
out
officer
have
developed
into
an
art
form
i
can
t
believe
the
kind
of
university
they
run
down
there
in
nashville
tennessee
he
say
you
graduate
with
honor
and
you
can
t
pas
your
naval
weapon
course
i
m
go
to
have
to
get
in
touch
with
them
about
their
standard
they
let
somebody
like
you
out
with
honor
you
sorry
son
of
a
bitch
i
be
as
frustrate
as
i
d
ever
be
down
physically
emotionally
and
probably
spiritually
i
stew
and
stew
about
it
and
then
one
sunday
afternoon
i
go
down
to
the
cold
windblown
rhode
island
shore
i
couldn
t
cry
but
as
the
wave
crashed
i
just
start
scream
into
the
wind
i
yell
incoherently
in
what
amount
to
this
great
wordless
release
until
it
be
all
out
of
my
system
i
go
back
think
you
know
whatever
it
take
i
m
go
to
get
through
this
i
be
not
go
to
flunk
out
of
four
month
of
officer
candidate
school
and
have
to
spend
my
time
as
an
enlist
man
i
m
just
not
go
to
do
that
i
begin
to
feel
a
lot
more
confident
that
i
could
do
whatever
i
have
to
do
at
about
that
time
i
receive
my
private
pilot
s
license

the
mail
it
be
nice
after
all
the
trouble
i
d
be
have
to
have
that
feel
of
accomplishment
even
though
i
have
no
intention
of
pursue
fly
in
the
navy
the
military
still
have
its
trial
it
be
tough
to
avoid
the
occasional
gig
at
inspection
and
if
you
get
five
you
lose
your
weekend
privilege
and
have
to
stay
on
the
base
and
march
them
off
your
roommate
could
cost
you
gig
as
well
and
i
have
a
lanky
lawyer
name
phil
taliaferro
a
fellow
kentuckian
share
quarter
with
me
he
never
take
anything
very
seriously
and
be
really
sloppy
i
d
have
to
help
him
get
shape
up
so
he
d
pas
inspection
and
then
i
d
have
to
clean
up
for
him
so
our
quarter
would
pas
inspection
i
remember
get
my
fifth
red
gig
just
before
veteran
day
when
i
be
schedule
to
meet
my
parent
in

go
to
have
to
stay
on
board
and
march
all
weekend
i
told
phil
about
it
and
he
say
get
you
cover
he
be
the
political
type
and
he
have
land
a
job
as
yeoman
in
our
company
officer
s
office
which
meant
he
have
access
to
the
file
he
go
through
the
stack
of
paperwork
for
those
who
have
to
march
off
their
red
gig
pull
mine
and
brought
it
to
me
for
my
disposal
fortunately
i
m
a
backsliding
methodist
rather
than
a
baptist
so
that
be
fine
with
me
i
get
to
new
york
have
a
great
dinner
with
my
parent
friday
night
and
didn
t
have
to
be
back
on
base
until
monday
that
saturday
morning
my
dad
get
a
call
at
the
hotel
say
there
be
a
union
organization
effort
go
on
among
the
employee
in
scottsville
some
of
them
be
signing
card
ask
for
an
election
an
up
or
down
vote
on
whether
to
be
represent
by
the
machinist
union
he
get
physically
ill
and
stayed
in
the
room
all
weekend
while
mama
and
i
enjoy
the
city
when
the
trip
be
over
my
dad
go
home
and
pull
out
all
the
stop
he
be
ready
for
major
warfare
because
he
felt
it
be
clearly
so
wrong
for
the
company
ever
ever
ever
to
have
a
union
he
didn
t
want
anyone
tell
him
how
to
run
his
business
he
want
to
determine
whom
to
hire
what
to
pay
them
and
what
their
job
be
it
be
inevitable
that
he
would
react
for
starter
as
control
stockholder
of
the
large
bank
in
town
he
be
in
a
position
to
imply
that
loan
might
be
a
lot
harder
to
come
by
if
that
union
come
in
that
may
have
be
illegal
and
i
m
not
sure
if
daddy
knew
whether
it
be
or
wasn
t
at
the
time
although
if
he
have
i
don
t
know
that
it
would
have
matter
he
be
so
livid
in
any
case
the
union
effort
fail
at
the
end
of
my
four
month
of
training

diplomatically
a
stickler
harsh

perfectionist
be
a
little
closer
to
the
mark
he
want
everything

precisely
by
the
book
which
meant
when
he
or
any
other

ship
the
side
boy
who
be

as
an

guard
have
to
look
extra
sharp
and
all
the
pip
ruffle
and
flourish
have
to
be
just
so
that
s
why
all
of
us
be
so
delighted
by
one
particular
episode
we
get
the
word
on
deck
that
the
admiral
be
come
on
board
and
so
everything
come
to
a
stop
and
everybody
come
to
attention
then
just
as
admiral
mccain
reach
the
deck
a
very
slovenly
sailor
wander
out
onto
the
pier
with
a
load
of
garbage
he
never
stop
he
never
even
look
up
he
just
walk
on
by
admiral
mccain
be
furious
i
want
that
sailor
in
my
stateroom
immediately
he
say
to
the
officer
of
the
deck
and
he
storm
off
to
wait
the
ood
get
the
attention
of
the
sailor
who
put
down
his
garbage
can
and
go
up
to
the
admiral
s
stateroom
admiral
mccain
go
up
one
side
of
him
and
down
the
other
for
fifteen
minute
or
so
lecture
him
at
top
volume
about
respect
rank
navy
decorum
and
all
the
rest
of
it
use
his
normally
salty
approach
in
fact
we
call
him
goddammit
mccain
because
he
couldn
t
get
a
sentence
out
that
didn
t
call
for
the
deity
s
judgment
we
worried
when
he
didn
t
cuss
the
sailor
just
kind
of
stood
there
unexpectedly
calm
about
the
whole
thing
finally
mccain
wore
down
just
what
do
you
expect
of
your
career
in
the
navy
sailor
he
say
not
much
sir
say
the
sailor
i
muster
out
tomorrow
mccain
who
realize
he
have
just
waste
half
an
hour
of
his
time
dismiss
him
in
disgust
we
love
it
the
pocono
be
a
foot
float
command
post
that
carry
advanced
communication
equipment
and
a
complement
of
men
include

we
have
a
highly
intelligent
group
of
sailor
i
be
personnel
and
administrative
officer
run
the
office
for
the
captain
and
handle
his
mail

s
and

have
regular
office
hour
and
then
as
all

which
meant
a
four
hour
stint
from
to
midnight
midnight
to
a
m
or
to
a
m
every
six
week
or
so
we
would
spend
two
week
at
sea
we
d
steam
out
of
norfolk
on
monday
conduct
readiness
drill
through
the
week
spend
weekend
leave
at
a
port
in
florida
or
the
caribbean
then
steam
back
the
follow
week
do
drill
the
whole
time
and
return
to
norfolk
on
friday
my
first
time
at
sea
be
notable
for
the
difficulty
i
have
in
get
my
sea
leg
i
try
my
best
to
walk
across
the
deck
without
the
enlist
men
laugh
at
me
although
i
can
t
say
i
blame
them
when
they
do
then
there
be
learn
not
to
get
seasick
the
trick
i
discover
be
not
to
stay
below
deck
too
long
when
we
be
under
way
work
long
enough
at
a
desk
where
it
s
hot
stuffy
and
disorient
and
you
re
go
to
get
seasick
i
do
and
i
have
to
go
topside
and
vomit
over
the
side
yes
it
be
embarrass
then
there
be
more
basic
matter
like
lower
my
spoon
into
a
bowl
and
let
the
roll
ship
bring
the
soup
to
it
as
the
view
through
the
porthole
change
from
sky
to
horizon
to
ocean
and
back
again
over
and
over
it
soon
become
very
clear
why
the
course
work
i
d
do
be
so
rigorous
beyond
the
basic
of
naval
term
there
be
time
when
i
be
the
officer
of
the
deck
temporarily
in
charge
of
the
ship
i
have
to
know
thing
like
the
rule
of
the
road
for
collision
avoidance
or
what
to
do
if
there
be
a
problem
in
the
engine
room
at
least
i
be
suppose
to
know
my
roommate
dan
hecker
do
in
fact
face
a
fire
in
the
engine
room
while
ood
he
call
the
entire
ship
to
general
quarter
and
get
it
handle
it
be
frighten
to
think
about
what
might
have
happen
have
it
be
i
i
could
imagine
the
entire
ship
be
awaken
at
night
to
hear
me
say
well
everybody
we
have
a
fire
in
the
engine
room
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
you
can
t
aw
shuck
that
one
once
i
be
junior
ood
when
we
get
a
request
from
the
engine
room
to
blow
tube
i
be
fresh
from
kentucky
and
i
figure
if
your
tube
need
blowing
you
should
have
at
it
whether
or
not
i
knew
what
you
be
talk
about
permission
grant
i
say
well
i
have
give
them
permission
to
clean
the
boiler
tube
with
a
blast
that
would
send
black
smoke
and
soot
out
into
the
open
air
if
the
wind
be
blowing
favorably
that
s
not
a
problem
but
if
it
s
blowing
in
the
wrong
direction
as
it
be
that
day
you
have
that
mess
linger
and
settle
on
the
forward
deck
which
as
it
turn
out
be
just
be
paint
my
permanent
quarter
be
shipboard
even
when
we
be
in
port
unlike
some
of
the
married
officer
who
get
to
go
home
at
night
to
get
there
you
walk
down
one
flight
of
metal
step
everything
be
metal
past
the
wardroom
or
mess
cabin
and
the
lounge
you
step
over
the
raise
bottom
of
the
watertight
door
call
a
knee
knocker
into
a
passsageway
lead
to
quarter
mine
be
the
first
on
the
port
side
which
be
to
the
right
as
you
face
the
back
of
the
ship
it
be
maybe
foot
by
foot
and
i
share
it
with
three
other
officer
you
walk
in
and
my
rack
be
the
low
forward
one
each
of
us
have
a
countertop
with
a
mirror
on
it
and
drawer
underneath
it
we
each
have
a
small
closet
and
a
built
in
desk
there
be
three
of
those
four
person
quarter
in
our
passageway
across
the
passageway
be
the
head
and
there
be
three
more
quarter
across
the
passageway
on
the
other
side
of
that
learn
leadership
the
navy
way
be
a
long
process
part
of
it
be
negotiate
the
close
quarter
aboard
ship
officer
and
enlist
men
have
a
force
proximity
my
mother
have
always
drum
into
me
the
importance
of
be
a
friend
to
everyone
but
that
simply
didn
t
work
in
a
situation
that
call
for
some
separation
to
maintain
the
respect
necessary
for
discipline
since
it
couldn
t
be
a
physical
separation
it
have
to
be
one
of
bearing
you
couldn
t
be
a
buddy
and
a
leader
i
need
a
persona
that
elicit
respect
and
i
need
to
be
cognizant
of
the
kind
of
rapport
i
have
with
enlist
men
within
that
framework
the
job
you
have
often
affected
how
you
handle
yourself
the
boatswain
s
mate
for
example
be
the
rowdy
rough
and
tumble
men
that
do
the
grunt
work
topside
and
the
officer
in
charge
of
them
really
need
to
be
a
man
s
man
if
you
re
in
administration
on
the
other
hand
you
have
a
more
educate
enlist
group
and
you
can
have
a
softer
leadership
style
i
be
more
of
a
straight
arrow
than
most
of
the
other
officer
keep
the
line
more
rigidly
drawn
it
be
just
who
i
be
i
be
company
officer
for
the
radiomen
they
be
skilled
prima
donna
type
who
be
quite
sophisticated
at
their
gamesmanship
and
i
have
to
be
respectful
but
forceful
with
them
it
be
an
approach
that
be
consistent
with
who
i
be
and
there
be
no
need
for
me
to
try
to
change
to
match
someone
else
s
approach
i
m
not
the
shout
scream
curse
type
and
so
that
wasn
t
the
tack
i
take
i
didn
t
use
any
of
the
foul
language
of
the
navy
and
i
developed
the
reputation
of
be
circumspect
as
oppose
to
the
guy
who
be
in
charge
of
the
boatswain
s
mate
who
curse
as
they
do
there
be
one
sailor
aboard
ship
who
be
particularly
hard
to
control
everyone
have
trouble
discipline
him
i
brought
him
into
my
office
after
one
infraction
have
him
sit
down
and
just
look
at
him
after
about
thirty
second
i
say
to
him
who
in
the
hell
do
you
think
you
be
the
guy
broke
down
and
cry
like
a
baby
now
any
other
officer
would
have
start
lambast
him
give
him
a
good
curse
but
after
a
bit
of
silence
hearing
me
say
the
only
four
letter
word
he
d
ever
heard
me
say
just
tore
him
up
there
be
another
sailor
who
be
notorious
for
his
unkempt
appearance
and
for
the
fact
that
he
never
ever
show
up
on
time
i
dealt
with
him
by
have
him
stand
at
attention
once
for
thirty
minute
before
and
after
the
admiral
go
ashore
several
high
rank
officer
and
six
sideboys
in
sharp
respectful
military
lineup
be
pay
their
respect
as
the
admiral
depart
ship
and
then
here
be
my
sloppy
sailor
off
to
one
side
stand
at
attention
before
during
and
after
he
stood
out
like
a
sore
thumb
and
it
be
embarrass
enough
for
him
that
i
didn
t
have
any
more
trouble
with
him
the
one
exception
to
my
policy
of
rigid
separation
from
enlist
men
be
one
of
our
steward
a
large
african
american
man
we
d
go
out
for
maneuver
on
a
monday
drill
all
week
and
then
friday
we
d
come
in
to
shore
often
at
a
very
nice
place
it
could
be
a
port
in
florida
but
it
might
be
bermuda
nassau
or
somewhere
else
in
the
caribbean
our
steward
would
spend
the
entire
weekend
drinking
spending
every
dime
he
have
and
he
d
roll
back
to
the
ship
around
a
m
on
monday
and
tell
the
cab
driver
to
wait
while
he
get
the
fare
he
d
weave
his
way
into
the
stateroom
i
share
with
three
other
officer
i
d
feel
his
tower
if
wobbly
presence
before
i
be
fully
awake
smell
the
alcohol
and
sweat
he
d
grab
hold
of
me
and
shake
me
and
i
d
give
him
twenty
buck
that
be
the
one
time
i
didn
t
insist
on
the
proper
respect
due
an
officer
and
in
return
i
get
far
well
service
than
anyone
else
in
the
wardroom
any
favor
that
could
possibly
accrue
to
an
officer
come
my
way
first
no
one
quite
understood
why
i
get
serve
before
senior
officer
and
that
be
fine
with
me
we
travel
to
plenty
of
interest
port
and
the
admiral
have
his
favorite
i
remember
one
island
with
a
part
of
town
that
be
off
limit
for
american
sailor
each
officer
would
get
his
men
together
and
tell
them
you
will
not
go
over
the
hill
when
you
re
ashore
this
weekend
several
of
the
officer
begin
talk
about
it
during
one
visit
wonder
what
be
over
there
it
actually
sound
kind
of
neat
so
a
group
of
us
head
that
way
we
walk
into
this
big
entertainment
venue
with
a
show
that
wasn
t
exactly
family
friendly
we
sat
down
and
there
three
or
four
row
in
front
of
us
be
several
of
my
men
they
turn
around
and
wave
and
i
wave
back
and
eventually
one
of
them
normally
a
respectful
hardworking
introvert
be
drunk
enough
to
go
onstage
and
become
part
of
the
act
of
course
i
couldn
t
say
anything
to
them
when
we
get
back
to
the
ship
because
i
d
be
there
with
them
i
realize
that
they
be
really
surprised
that
mr
turner
have
visit
a
place
like
that
but
i
think
they
be
kind
of
proud
of
me
too
i
have
join
the
navy
in
part
to
be
my
own
man
but
it
wasn
t
simple
to
escape
my
name
i
learn
that
a
sailor
name
monty
lawrence
be
from
bowling
green
and
i
told
him
i
be
from
scottsville
he
write
home
to
his
folk
and
say
his
company
officer
be
a
mr
turner
from
scottsville
and
they
write
back
and
say
the
only
turner
they
knew
from
scottsville
be
cal
who
be
load
or
something
to
that
effect
it
wasn
t
long
before
i
have
numerous
opportunity
to
loan
money
to
sailor
opportunity
that
hadn
t
exist
before
that
letter
our
ship
visit
new
york
city
at
one
point
and
i
thought
this
be
a
perfect
opportunity
to
do
something
nice
for
harry
and
gladys
weiner
who
always
treat
us
royally
when
we
visit
new
york
and
who
by
this
time
be
practically
family
on
this
occasion
i
invite
the
weiners
to
have
dinner
in
the
wardroom
of
the
ship
set
up
a
major
clash
of
culture
harry
have
a
big
wide
nose
wore
horn
rim
glass
and
smoke
curlicue
cigar
it
be
cold
when
they
come
to
visit
so
gladys
who
be
taller
than
harry
and
wear
high
heel
have
on
her
full
length
mink
coat
they
be
quite
the
strike
couple
it
happen
that
they
come
across
the
brow
the
gangplank
from
the
pier
to
the
quarterdeck
as
the
admiral
be
about
to
depart
so
there
be
sideboys
everywhere
as
well
as
full
captain
and
other
officer
assemble
to
see
him
off
it
be
an
impressive
spectacle
and
as
harry
who
be
trail
gladys
get
closer
he
look
up
and
saw
the
officer
on
deck
stand
at
attention
and
salute
harry
who
never
met
a
stranger
but
be
unused
to
this
kind
of
formal
recognition
of
his
eminence
beam
eye
light
up
under
the
hat
sit
askew
on
his
head
and
say
hello
dere
as
the
officer
of
the
deck
salute
despite
the
requirement
for
military
decorum
it
be
all
many
of
the
sideboys
could
do
to
keep
from
crack
up
but
then
we
get
to
dinner
in
the
wardroom
and
harry
take
full
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
hold
court
he
inform
us
that
as
a
big
taxpayer
he
want
to
know
what
each
of
the
officer
do
to
justify
his
salary
i
get
more
and
more
embarrass
as
he
question
each
officer
about
how
much
work
he
do
and
even
in
some
case
how
much
he
be
paid
it
say
something
about
harry
that
everybody
like
him
anyway

want
to
end
up
in
a
tin
can
which

what
we
call
destroyer
since
i
didn
t
know
much
about

and
didn
t
want
the
kind
of
isolation
or
responsibility
that

an
executive
officer
i

of
a
worldwide
network
call
the
defense
communication
system
we
relayed
signal
to
the
north
atlantic
where
communication
with

really
difficult
to
accomplish
the
post
be
at
the
edge
of
a
cliff
on
a
rocky
shore
of
the
north
sea
with
few
than
a
hundred
men
in
three
building
overlook
the
orkney

gregarious
people
and
a
lot
of
frustrate
dog
the
temperature
seem
to
be
the
same
year
round
but
for
some
mysterious
reason
the
horizontal
rain
of
summer
knew
when
to
become
the
horizontal
snow
of
winter
you
have
to
learn
to
walk
with
difficulty
into
a
strong
steady
wind
or
deal
with
a
forceful

the
other
seasonal
change
be
the
amount
of
daylight
a
pendulum
that
swung
a
lot
far
than
it
do
in
the
continental
united
state
in
the
winter
the
sun
set
by

just
barely
and
that
wasn
t
until

so
there
would
be
a
little
bit
of
dusk
and
then
the
sun
rise
again
they
have
a
midnight
golf
tournament
every
year
play
all
night
the
landscape
be
bare
and
the
soil
rocky
except
for
the
big
swatch
of
peat
which
be
like
damp
coarse
carpeting
the
only
color
to
be
found
amid
the
drab
government
housing
come
from
the
front
door
which
people
paint
all
sort
of
bright
color
inside
it
be
a
different
story
that
s
where
people
s
personality
really
come
out
they
revel
in
bold
color
and
pattern
and
you
d
see
a
lot
of
plaid
and
polka
dot
life
be
a
struggle
the
fisherman
face
a
rough
cold
windy
sea
that
and
the
desolate
environment
make
for
tough
people
yet
warm
interpersonal
relationship
the
men
and
woman
be
wonderful
they
be
outgo
and
the
culture
be
nurture
and
supportive
to
both
family
and
friend
you
be
never
a
stranger
if
you
show
up
at
someone
s
house
close
to
dinnertime
you
be
suppose
to
sit
down
and
eat
with
them
i
remember
my
first
sunday
afternoon
there
drive
down
the
coast
with
harry
russell
one
of
the
local
stop
at
the
hotel
in
every
little
town
his
wife
netta
and
the
child
who
be
small
would
go
to
the
lobby
and
harry
my
fellow
officer
and
cottage
mate
john
mcgarrigle
and
i
would
go
to
the
bar
and
have
drink
i
learn
to
sing
the
old
scottish
song
and
to
drink
scotch
neat
it
be
if
anything
even
friendlier
than
scottsville
the
local
get
a
kick
out
of
the
yank
which
be
what
they
call
all
of
us
of
course
be
from
the
south
and
be
call
a
yankee
bother
me
but
that
s
what
they
call
us
it
be
my
first
exposure
to
a
very
different
culture
a
different
society
and
a
different
economy
and
it
be
a
delightful
time
in
my
life
it
take
me
quite
a
while
to
get
use
to
the
brogue
which
be
thicker
than
pudding
my
mother
and
my
brother
steve
come
to
visit
once
it
be
a
high
school
graduation
present
for
him
and
mama
call
me
at
work
one
day
she
be
at
my
cottage
and
a
workman
have
come
to
refill
the
diesel
fuel
in
the
generator
the
sole
source
of
electricity
she
couldn
t
understand
a
word
he
say
and
i
have
to
help
them
get
it
do
as
much
as
i
have
to
work
to
understand
the
local
they
have
their
own
challenge
with
me
in
fact
they
kind
of
steer
me
into
adjust
my
pronunciation
i
d
ask
for
hard
boil
egg
and
they
d
hear
ball
when
i
say
boil
it
s
boyled
they
d
say

enough
pronunciation
for
me

when
i
get
back
to
kentucky
my
family
start
call
me
a
yankee
the
northern
kind
because
i
d
lose
a
lot
of
the
southern
redneck
in
my
vocalization
the
twist
and
turn
of
language
make
for
one
of
the
more
interest

there
the

have
carcass
hang
on
the
wall
and
the
meat
be
wonderful
you

incredible
fillet

it
s
pronounce
fill
ets

of
course
there

plenty
of
lamb
since
they
raise
them
right
there
i
d
cook
the
lamb

the
way
my

them
in
a
paper
sack
with
a
lot
of
flour
and
seasoning
to
coat

in
hot
grease
in

skillet
it

great
eat
we

to
eat
with
them
we
have
good
bread
and
wonderful
fresh

stuff

since

be
damp
and
cold
all
the
time
that
bread
and
butter
really
hit
the
spot
in
the
restaurant
we
d
eat
fresh
salmon
give
all
that
great
food
it
s
probably
not
surprising
that
i
gain
quite
a
bit
of
weight
while
i
be
there
now
and
then
we
have
high
state
of
readiness
and
during
some
of
those
i
d
have
charge
of
the
whole
command
that
meant
i
be
oversee
the
men
who
monitor
the
communication
gear
serve
ship
steam
in
the
stormy
north
atlantic
i
d
have
hour
on
with
no
sleep
then
off
three
time
in
a
row
and
then
have
hour
off
depend
on
the
season
it
would
be
pretty
much
light
all
the
time
or
dark
all
the
time
and
day
and
night
get
all
jangled
up
just
as
in
norfolk
i
be
the
straightest
arrow
among
the
officer
once
i
found
the
enlist
men
play
card
when
they
be
suppose
to
be
monitoring
all
the
communication
equipment
so
i
have
them
get
back
to
work
the
chief
petty
officer
come
out
in
the
passageway
to
tell
me
condescendingly
mr
turner
commander
godfrey
and
lieutenant
buckley
the
command
officer
and
executive
officer
respectively
allow
them
to
play
card
when
they
have
the
watch
i
say
well
chief
i
respect
that
so
when
they
have
the
duty
the
men
can
play
card
but
when
i
have
the
duty
there
won
t
be
any
card
play
do
you
understand
that
yes
sir
i
don
t
know
why
i
felt
i
be
suppose
to
be
so
by
the
book
the
career
officer
be
more
what
the
heck
about
it
i
be
just
there
for
a
while
but

be
go
to
be
do
right
when
i
be
responsible
i
be
personnel
officer
in
scotland
again
just
as
i
d
be
in
norfolk
i
take
care
of
the
paperwork
which
include
detailed
record
on
every
sailor
include
fitness
report
and
officer
evaluation
there
be
occasional
offbeat
assignment
like
my
effort
to
assist
a
catholic
sailor
and
his
wife
in
get
their
marriage
annul
on
the
basis
of
his
impotence
we
be
under
a
really
tight
deadline
because
the
sailor
have
impregnate
the
daughter
of
the
local
sheriff
who
be
all
over
the
command
demand
that
this
man
marry
his
daughter
the
sheriff
write
to
our
command
ask
for
our
official
position
on
the
matter
as
personnel
officer
i
have
to
answer
him
and
calm
the
water
without
let
him
know
the
man
s
current
matrimonial
state
or
anything
else
about
him
i
pour
all
of
my
southern
concern
onto
the
page
tell
him
how
very
aware
we
be
of
what
a
difficult
time
this
be
for
his
family
and
how
we
want
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
help
life
go
well
for
this
couple
i
get
out
the
entire
string
section
and
conduct
it
very
well
if
i
do
say
so
myself
that
letter
come
to
the
attention
of
the
london
base
admiral
responsible
for
the
u
s
navy
throughout
great
britain
he
be
so
impressed
that
he
call
our
command
officer
and
told
him
to
do
everything
he
could
to
persuade
lieutenant
j
g
turner
to
consider
a
career
in
the
navy
he
have
great
prospect
for
a
successful
navy
career
the
admiral
say
i
have
never
see
anyone
able
to
say
nothing
so
beautifully
it
be
an
interest
take
on
what
might
foretell
success
in
the
navy
but
i
take
it
as
a
compliment
i
wasn
t
tempt
by
a
navy
career
and
i
come
back
across
the
atlantic
in
december
muster
out
at
the
brooklyn
naval
shipyard
after
three
year
and
four
month
it
be
one
of
only
a
handful
of
time
my
dad
ever
left
his
office
in
the
warehouse
in
kentucky
and
he
be
wait
for
me
when
the
ship
come
in
he
told
everybody
i
will
not
be
home
until
i
bring
cal
jr
and
so
he
wait
for
the
out
processing
which
take
three
or
four
day
and
the
unload
of
my
stuff
a
trunk
a
player
piano
i
d
bought
from
a
hotel
in
the
north
of
scotland
and
a
mercedes
i
bought
tax
free
from
a
dealer
in
london
we
get
in
that
mercedes
and
rode
home
together

intern
with
the
real
cal
turner
my
father
have
look
forward
to
the
time
i
would
come
back
and
run
the
company
but
neither
he
nor
i
knew
what
that
would
entail
any
father
son
relationship
be
complicate
and
conduct
one
while
run
a
business
make
it
that
much
more
so
luther
have
die
two
year
earlier
in
and
although
my
dad
have
run
the
show
essentially
since
the
begin
luther
be
a
huge
presence
in
my
father
s
life
his
last
year
as
his
dementia
worsen
have
be
very
difficult
i
remember
the
last
time
my
father
really
felt
that
he
get
through
to
him
luther
have
lose
most
of
his
ability
to
communicate
but
my
father
say
daddy
last
year
the
company
s
earnings
be
one
million
dollar
and
luther
chuckle
now
the
son
be
the
father
my
dad
be
fifty
i
be
twenty
five
and
this
would
be
new
territory
my
dad
s
bottom
line
since
the
begin
could
be
sum
up
in
one
word
survival
and
he
reason
that
the
key
to
survival
in
retailing
lay
in
something
his
father
have
say
he
d
quote
him
often
if
i
control
my
expense
well
than
the
competition
i
just
have
to
buy
as
well
as
he
do
and
i
ve
get
him
that
s
why
he
watch
the
company
s
sale
and
expense
report
so
closely
that
approach
kept
the
company
go
during
its
early
year
but
he
realize
it
wasn
t
go
to
be
enough
in
the
future
my
dad
knew
that
for
all
the
skill
he
brought
to
the
company
there
be
others
he
didn
t
have
he
be
an
entrepreneur
unschooled
in
business
theory
he
be
aware
of
the
gap
between
an
entrepreneur
and
a
season
leader
and
he
want
me
to
fill
it
my
dad
have
the
practical
savvy
it
take
to
run
a
business
i
didn
t
but
he
knew
the
company
need
a
different
kind
of
leadership
and
he
believe
that
give
my
temperament
education
and
experience
i
be
the
likeliest
one
in
the
family
to
provide
it
that
meant
we
be
go
to
have
to
deal
with
each
other
man
to
man
as
well
as
father
to
son
although
it
s
difficult
to
take
the
father
out
of
the
father
or
the
son
out
of
the
son
my
father
and
i
have
a
great
deal
of
love
and
respect
for
each
other
he
be
a
people
love
person
and
he
make
no
bone
about
his
admiration
for
me
he
be
very
proud
of
what
i
d
accomplish
to
that
point
graduate
cum
laude
something
else
i
couldn
t
pronounce
until
may
from
vanderbilt
university
and
serve
three
year
and
four
month
in
the
navy
and
he
be
eager
to
turn
the
family
business
over
to
his
firstborn
son
on
the
other
hand
both
of
us
be
highly
competitive
and
we
be
largely
unaware
of
just
how
that
might
set
us
up
for
occasional
conflict
in
fact
we
share
quite
a
few
personality
trait
although
his
heart
for
others
be
as
big
as
the
outdoors
my
dad
be
an
intense
man
whose
word
be
law
i
be
no
shrink
violet
myself
and
i
still
have
some
of
my
navy
rough
edge
a
bachelor
at
the
time
i
have
move
into
my
parent
house
for
a
while
the
room
and
board
be
great
but
the
situation
intensified
our
relationship
we
be
play
bridge
one
night
with
my
mother
and
one
of
her
friend
and
my
dad
in
his
own
type
a
way
be
be
pretty
aggressive
tease
and
heckle
me
as
we
played
he
may
have
be
unaware
that
his
competitive
streak
be
so
fully
engage
on
the
other
hand
that
may
have
be
his
message
you
re
go
to
have
to
accept
that
i
m
go
to
be
overbear
i
take
it
for
a
while
but
then
i
look
at
him
pointedly
and
cleaning
up
the
navy
language
considerably
say
would
you
get
off
my
butt
it
be
as
if
the
earth
have
stop
very
little
could
stun
my
father
into
silence
yet
i
have
just
do
it
he
be
as
shock
and
upset
as
i
have
ever
see
him
he
look
as
though
he
be
go
to
cry
and
see
that
i
want
to
cry
he
fold
his
card
and
set
them
down
we
all
do
the
same
it
be
obvious
the
game
be
over
i
m
not
sure
to
this
day
why
my
word
affected
him
so
profoundly
i
guess
they
seem
completely
out
of
character
for
me
since
this
be
probably
the
first
pushback
he
have
gotten
from
me
as
an
adult
and
he
wasn
t
accustom
to
any
pushback
at
all
yes
i
have
clean
up
the
language
but
in
the
turner
family
home
in
scottsville
kentucky
those
word
from
son
to
father
be
simply
unacceptable
the
very
air
seem
to
turn
frigid
it
wasn
t
any
warmer
the
next
morning
i
knew
i
be
go
to
have
to
do
something
my
plan
be
to
approach
him
at
work
and
render
an
apology
with
string
attach
the
way
most
people
do
i
d
say
i
be
sorry
and
tack
on
some
qualification
make
it
clear
i
expect
him
to
apologize
back
my
office
be
in
one
corner
of
the
upstairs
warehouse
above
the
ready
to
wear
department
his
be
in
the
diagonally
opposite
corner
he
have
an
executive
washroom
and
he
be
in
it
when
i
go
into
his
office
i
be
relieve
because
that
meant
i
could
apologize
through
a
close
door
i
stood
outside
and
start
talk
wrap
it
up
after
a
while
with
a
soft
and
so
daddy
i
m
sorry
there
be
a
long
long
silence
bad
than
the
one
that
have
descend
on
the
card
table
the
night
before
i
star
at
the
door
from
which
nothing
be
forthcoming
finally
he
clear
his
throat
and
say
son
i
accept
your
apology
he
let
that
sink
in
for
a
moment
and
then
say
you
know
son
in
any
successful
relationship
there
have
to
be
flexibility
however
in
a
father
son
relationship
i
don
t
think
anyone
should
expect
the
father
to
be
flexible
what
in
the
dickens
can
i
make
of
that
i
thought
i
walk
back
to
my
office
i
may
not
have
understood
it
then
but
that
statement
of
my
father
s
have
stuck
with
me
to
this
day
it
s
a
truly
important
concept
bring
me
into
j
l
turner
and
son
meant
major
change
for
the
company
for
my
father
for
me
and
for
our
relationship
inner
flexibility
be
vital
in
deal
with
change
and
as
a
practical
matter
i
can
never
count
on
anyone
else
to
have
it
yet
i
should
expect
it
of
myself
my
dad
and
i
need
to
find
a
way
to
move
toward
something
closer
to
equal
footing
but
as
much
as
he
want
that
it
be
hard
for
him
it
be
a
process
that
continued
throughout
his
life
and
it
be
not
always
smooth
sail
i
learn
over
and
over
the
importance
of
be
flexible
and
of
let
him
be
who
he
be
to
this
day
it
feel
as
if
he
be
wrong
to
have
make
such
a
big
deal
out
of
my
comeback
to
him
during
that
game
of
card
but
i
be
just
go
to
have
to
accept
that
now
and
then
he
might
pitch
a
fatherly
fit
i
have
to
learn
not
to
push
back
because
it
be
still
above
all
a
love
father
son
relationship
when
i
join
the
company
my
dad
put
me
to
work
opening
store
figure
that
one
of
the
best
way
to
learn
the
business
be
to
unload
and
stock
everything

that
the
bos
s
son

get
it
stuck
to
him
we
get
it
open
though
and
as
they
do
pretty
much
every
time
we
open
a
store
for
the
next
twenty
year
people
line
up
at
the
door
eventually
over
the
course
of
the
first
couple
of
year
i
be
part
of
opening
fifteen
or
twenty
store
and
my
dad
be
right
it
be
a
good
way
to
learn
we
have
four
day
to
put
one
together
from
scratch
take
truckloads
of
merchandise
as
well
as
shelf
and
table
and
move
them
into
a
newly
lease
building
we
d
start
work
first
thing
monday
morning
hire
people
who
come
in
off
the
street
to
help
unload
trailer
which
be
packed
use
the
same
method
we
use
for
manager
car
my
dad
have
the
side
of
the
trailer
line
with
table
stuffed
with
merchandise
that
have
be
take
out
of
the
box
we
d
open
the
trailer
and
haul
those
heavily
laden
table
out
and
into
the
store
the
process
start
with
walter
who
drew
on
graph
paper
the
outline
of
each
new
store
then
fill
in
the
layout
he
d
hand
draw
the
fixture
and
pencil
in
the
table
and
shoe
rack
the
wall
display
the
checkout
and
cash
register
take
into
account
post
and
the
like
then
he
d
add
up
all
the
table
and
rack
and
figure
how
many
linear
foot
of
shelve
we
need
the
paperwork
would
go
to
the
chicken
house
which
be
what
it
have
be
a
workshop
where
a
team
of
carpenter
manufacture
and
paint
everything
that
go
into
those
store
the
only
thing
we
have
to
hire
out
in
those
day
be
the
manufacture
of
metal
rack
for
shoe
display
instal
all
that
stuff
in
a
new
store
be
never
an
exact
science
though
walter
s
layout
would
invariably
miss
an
inset
on
this
wall
or
a
post
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
so
we
d
have
to
fit
those
table
in
as
well
as
we
could
there
would
be
leftover
and
piece
that
didn
t
fit
and
they
would
get
put
back
in
the
stockroom
in
fact
at
one
point
after
i
d
be
there
a
while
we
sent
a
trailer
around
to
the
store
to
try
to
purge
them
of
all
that
unused
stuff
hop
the
guy
in
the
chicken
house
could
recycle
it
you
have
to
be
half
carpenter
to
get
everything
instal
and
then
you
have
to
take
the
merchandise
which
would
be
spill
out
onto
the
floor
and
figure
out
how
to
get
it
all
sort
then
displayed
in
time
to
have
the
store
open
friday
morning
it
be
like
create
order
at
the
city
dump
we

famous
notorious
actually
for
be
able

opening
do
happen
on
friday
and
it
go
so
well
we
need
a
second
checkout
counter
trouble
be
we
only
have
one
cash
register
be
the
ingenious
lot
we
be
we
make
a
cash
drawer
out
of
a
plastic
cutlery
tray
we
be
sell
in
the
housewares

have
enough
knife
fork
and
spoon
compartment
for
all
the
bill
and
coin
and
work
well
enough
of
course
it
give
that
same
group
of
businessmen
more
fodder
for
their
gossip
that
store
won
t
last
long
one
say
they
can
t
even
afford
a
cash
register
ingenuity
take
many
form
once
fel
myers
who
have
go
to
school
with
my
dad
and
have
work
for
him
since
the
begin
be
opening
a
store
in
pineville
kentucky
he
be
have
trouble
get
electricity
and
he
call
my
dad
and
told
him
have
you
ever
heard
of
coleman
lantern
my
dad
ask
fel
knew
he
d
well
think
of
something
and
he
quickly
found
a
solution
that
didn
t
involve
lantern
set
up
that
fast
we
didn
t
have
time
to
make
sure
everything
met
health
code
so
those
store
didn
t
have
public
bathroom
they
be
for
employee
only
we
knew
we
have
a
win
formula
and
the
vast
majority
of
store
we
open
do
very
well
now
and
then
though
one
would
do
poorly
we
d
study
it
for
a
while
make
whatever
change
we
thought
necessary
and
then
give
it
another
year
or
two
to
see
if
we
could
turn
it
around
we
write
three
year
lease
with
three
year
option
and
that
s
about
all
it
take
to
see
whether
a
store
be
go
to
make
it
after
three
year
if
a
store
wasn
t
make
money
we
close
it
and
while
it
take
us
four
day
to
open
a
store
we
could
close
one
in
a
day
and
move
on
while
i
be
opening
store
i
get
a
letter
in
the
mail
from
the
u
s
navy
it
be
a
promotion
i
have
muster
out
as
a
lieutenant
junior
grade
and
the
letter
say
i
d
be
make
a
lieutenant
i
guess
they
figure
i
be
more
valuable
to
them
out
of
the
navy
than
in
it
i
think
if
i
d
have
be
anybody
else
i
d
have
jumped
at
the
chance
to
go
back
into
the
navy
as
a
lieutenant
rather
than
open
another
dollar
general
store
but
there
be
that
jr
at
the
end
of
my
name
it
wasn
t
long
before
my
dad
want
me
to
go
out
with
walter
and
learn
to
negotiate
lease
for
new
store
cheap
and
short
term
be
the
byword
the
rule
of
thumb
be
that
we
be
not
suppose
to
pay
more
than
a
square
foot
per
year
so
that
if
there
be
a
square
foot
building
available
we
didn
t
want
to
pay
any
more
than
a
year
we
don
t
have
to
have
great
location
my
dad
say
with
our
merchandise
and
our
price
we
just
need
some
kind
of
building
around
us
the
concept
conforms
to
the
location
we
will
take
almost
any
building
and
make
it
fit
we
don
t
have
store
built
to
our
specification
because
this
be
our
model
or
all
our
store
have
to
look
a
certain
way
so
we
feel
we
really
be
neighborhood
store
because
we
conform
to
the
neighborhood
in
which
we
operate
it
s
the
country
general
store
clone
over
and
over
those
two
thing
opening
store
and
negotiate
lease
be
the
only
bit
of
functional
training
my
dad
have
thought
of
for
me
since
i
already
have
year
of
warehouse
and
retail
experience
grow
up
when
i
be
back
in
scottsville
at
our
headquarters
i
be
suppose
to
do
anything
that
need
to
be
do
in
the
office
or
in
the
warehouse
actually
by
that
time
the
company
s
real
estate
subsidiary
goad
realty
company
inc
own
three
warehouse
in
scottsville
with
a
total
of
square
foot
and
we
lease
a
fourth
contain
square
foot
from
the
allen
realty
company
inc
which
have
my
dad
as
its
sole
stockholder
each
have
its
own
load
dock
although
often
you
d
see
a
truck
be
load
through
the
front
door
and
driver
would
have
to
make
stop
at
several
to
get
all
the
merchandise
for
delivery
to
a
give
store
my
dad
want
to
hang
on
to
the
two
thing
he
love
the
most
buying
merchandise
and
watch
weekly
expense
by
reading
the
report
prepared
by
the
bookkeeper
from
the
raw
data
come
in
from
store
and
warehouse
on
expense
inventory
and
sale
i
help
him
monitor
those
report
but
when
any
personnel
or
administrative
problem
come
up
or
when
there
be
anything
that
need
to
be
plan
or
organize
he
want
me
to
do
that
i
have
the
degree
from
vanderbilt
and
my
experience
in
the
navy
that
give
me
more
training
in
those
thing
he
didn
t
want
to
do
anyway
study
the
number
help
me
hone
my
knowledge
of
how
my
dad
look
at
business
he
strove
to
operate
the
store
at
a
gross
margin
of
percent
of
sale
it
be
an
outgrowth
of
the
way
he
charge
those
item
to
the
store
if
an
item
sell
for
he
d
bill
a
dozen
of
them
to
the
store
at
the
store
would
bring
in
for
a
gross
margin
of
or
percent
as
long
as
their
cost
of
business
be
below
that
they
be
make
money
simple
so
my
dad
want
to
keep
cost
as
a
percentage
of
gross
sale
as
follow
percent
for
rent
percent
for
payroll
percent
for
utility
and
no
more
than
percent
for
shrinkage
loss
of
inventory
from
shoplift
employee
theft
administrative
error
breakage
and
the
like
those
be
the
controllables
and
every
single
percentage
point
of
each
of
those
have
well
be
control
you
control
the
rent
when
you
negotiate
that
lease
and
you
simply
couldn
t
build
as
cheaply
as
you
could
rent
as
for
the
utility
my
dad
be
a
firm
believer
in
turn
the
light
off
when
you
didn
t
need
them
the
one
exception
be
the
black
and
yellow
electric
dollar
general
sign
above
every
store
his
desire
to
have
store
manager
turn
them
off
during
the
day
be
overrule
by
his
fear
that
they
wouldn
t
turn
them
back
on
again
at
night
those
sign
be
beacon
to
customer
even
on
cloudy
day
they
look
great
and
he
didn
t
want
to
chance
lose
that
extra
bit
of
visibility
so
he
hard
wire
them
to
stay
on
the
rest
of
that
percent
of
sale
give
you
a
little
room
for
advertising
supply
and
any
other
expense
and
anything
left
over
be
profit
those
percentage
be
something
my
dad
could
keep
a
close
eye
on
bookkeeper
work
in
scottsville
handle
twelve
to
fifteen
store
each
and
give
him
the
report
he
review
each
week
that
percent
rule
for
payroll
if
a
store
be
bring
in
a
week
it
could
spend
on
payroll
place
us
at
the
bottom
of
a
low
pay
industry
you
need
two
employee
in
the
store
at
all
time
at
least
that
s
what
we
strove
for
if
business
wasn
t
good
and
we
have
to
control
payroll
even
more
rigorously
we
d
have
one
person
come
in
and
open
the
store
and
stay
there
alone
for
a
couple
of
hour
before
the
second
come
in
each
store
have
a
manager
and
clerk
we
try
to
establish
pay
scale
system
wide
and
you
have
to
pay
minimum
wage
but
market
condition
have
an
effect
and
there
be
some
local
variation
below
a
certain
wage
you
couldn
t
attract
hardworking
people
so
a
manager
have
to
work
hard
to
find
that
balance
and
the
manager
kept
percent
of
the
store
profit
as
a
bonus
which
meant
that
get
sale
up
and
bring
payroll
in
at
say
percent
of
annual
revenue
meant
more
money
in
his
or
her
pocket
the
code
of
ethic
for
store
manager
and
everyone
above
them
be
pretty
straightforward
work
hard
be
honest
don
t
drink
on
the
job
don
t
screw
the
help
just
two
month
after
i
come
to
work
for
j
l
turner
and
son
those
rule
help
me
out
of
my
first
painful
company
decision
one
of
our
district
manager
have
show
up
in
a
store
drunk
it
just
so
happen
that
visit
the
store
be
a
saintly
couple
who
travel
to
our
store
take
inventory
they
quickly
place
a
call
to
my
dad
who
be
out
of
town
which
meant
the
call
come
to
me
i
be
go
to
have
to
fire
this
man
what
a
wretchedly
awful
thing
to
experience
for
the
first
time
i
wasn
t
very
good
at
it
i
go
through
a
lot
of
apologetic
explanation
which
be
not
the
way
you
handle
fire
somebody
you
just
make
the
announcement
and
let
the
person
adjust
to
it
in
this
case
i
do
the
adjust
i
be
aware
of
how
hard
this
be
on
him
but
i
be
self
conscious
enough
that
i
be
much
more
aware
of
how
hard
it
be
on
me
my
dad
hat
let
people
go
so
through
the
year
i
be
the
go
to
guy
when
it
come
to
firing
i
never
do
like
it
much
more
than
i
do
that
first
time
but
i
do
get
well
at
get
through
it
i
learn
a
great
deal
in
those
day
but
i
still
spent
a
lot
of
time
scratch
my
head
over
how
the
company
really
work
i
quickly
realize
that
meant
learn
how
my
father
work
and
it
wasn
t
go
to
be
easy
my
dad
be
an
accomplish
entrepreneur
who
couldn
t
quite
explain
how
he
make
decision
he
just
have
to
give
you
specific
in
an
ad
hoc
way
he
have
be
living
and
breathing
j
l
turner
and
son
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
it
seem
to
be
more
in
his
gut
than
in
his
head
he
have
a
lifetime
of
trial
and
error
experience
and
a
lifetime
of
pay
attention
to
the
way
others
do
business
that
go
into
every
decision
now
for
the
first
time
he
have
another
person
at
his
side
try
to
learn
what
he
knew
and
it
be
almost
as
if
we
be
speak
two
different
language
i
be
look
for
the
cognitive
for
an
analyzable
version
of
something
that
come
naturally
and
that
he
d
never
have
to
explain
to
anyone
before
he
be
more
attach
to
the
do
than
the
discuss
my
dad
be
a
reservoir
of
great
insight
whose
primary
outlet
be
the
work
i
would
have
to
learn
by
watch

deal
with
entrepreneurial
chaos
when
my
dad
brought
me
into
the
company
he
be
eager
to
hand
over
the
rein
at
the
same
time
he
have
in
the
back
of
his
mind
that
he
be
always
go
to
be
the
strong
background
advisor
to
cal
jr
as
his
father
have
be
to
him
in
fact
my
dad
never
understood
the
distinction
between
family
and
business
they
be
one
and
the
same
to
him
that
make
for
a
very
interest
dynamic
we
have
the
same
name
and
a
great
deal
of
love
and
respect
for
each
other
but
i
be
still
his
son
and
it
be
the
nature
of
father
son
relationship
that
conflict
be
inevitable
there
be
now
two
strong
personality
under
one
business
roof
my
dad
be
not
interpersonally
aggressive
but
he
be
so
intense
in
his
dedication
to
work
that
the
people
around
him
have
all
they
could
do
just
to
keep
up
once
as
we
drove
from
the
house
to
the
warehouse
i
be
share
with
him
that
i
be
have
a
hard
time
get
along
with
a
certain
employee
he
say
i
can
understand
that
how
can
you
understand
that
i
say
son
he
say
how
many
employee
do
we
have
around
twelve
hundred
i
say
do
you
realize
that
among
all
twelve
hundred
employee
there
be
just
one
i
have
trouble
get
along
with
well
daddy
i
say
do
you
realize
that
of
all
twelve
hundred
employee
there
be
only
one
who
will
tell
you
the
truth
a
know
grunt
be
all
i
get
from
him
my
dad
have
the
innate
assumption
that
if
somebody
didn
t
agree
with
him
that
person
just
wasn
t
listen
he
assume
he
knew
what
be
right
i
would
say
to
him
anytime
we
disagree
you
can
rest
assure
i
listen
even
harder
to
you
than
when
we
agree
and
i
m
really
careful
when
i
proceed
in
a
way
you
don
t
want
us
to
proceed
i
be
not
interested
in
conflict
for
its
own
sake
i
be
there
to
learn
if
i
have
come
in
to
j
l
turner
and
son
hungry
for
power
i
never
would
have
gotten
to
first
base
with
my
dad
or
the
company
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
be
more
interested
in
transfer
power
than
i
be
in
accept
it
because
i
recognize
that
i
didn
t
know
enough
about
the
business
my
dad
be
say
in
essence
you
just
take
this
go
with
it
what
i
saw
be
a
steep
learn
curve
with
my
be
a
cal
sr
intern
i
knew
though
that
nobody
else
in
the
company
be
privy
to
that
mind
set
what
they
saw
start
and
stop
with
the
fact
that
i
be
the
bos
s
son
my
mother
have
make
me
conscious
of
other
people
and
how
i
come
across
to
them
and
i
knew
that
in
this
case
human
nature
would
make
for
a
great
deal
of
resentment
what
they
didn
t
know
be
that
i
be
as
put
off
by
the
role
of
bos
s
son
as
they
be
i
knew
that
nobody
want
to
follow
the
guy
brought
into
the
role
by
birth
and
that
i
would
never
be
able
to
prove
myself
i
be
under
scrutiny
all
the
time
probably
even
more
so
than
i
d
be
in
the
navy
where
the
enlist
men
be
always
test
me
and
here
again
it
be
about
passing
the
test
people
would
be
analyze
how
i
say
thing
and
how
i
handle
situation
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
observe
my
dad
s
leadership
style
on
store
visit
he
could
seem
stormy
or
cantankerous
in
his
intensity
to
get
thing
do
the
way
he
want
and
he
have
a
knack
for
go
directly
to
the
thing
that
be
wrong
in
a
store
i
didn
t
want
that
to
be
my
style
i
didn
t
know
enough
about
retailing
to
know
in
detail
how
they
be
suppose
to
do
store
work
anyway
he
do
there
be
no
detail
too
small
for
his
attention
and
he
didn
t
point
out
a
problem
without
have
a
solution
if
he
found
a
smudge
on
a
piece
of
soft
good
he
would
get
out
his
handkerchief
he
knew
that
try
to
rub
it
off
with
your
hand
or
a
brush
would
make
it
bad
but
if
you
whack
it
just
right
with
a
cloth
you
could
get
out
most
of
the
smudge
he
want
quick
result
he
be
fast
and
efficient
and
he
want
others
to
be
that
way
he
could
be
impatient
he
didn
t
intend
to
be
hard
on
people
but
he
be
so
single
mindedly
focus
on
get
work
do
that
he
come
across
as
harsher
than
he
be
he
didn
t
realize
it
but
mama
for
one
do
cal
i
m
not
go
to
visit
another
store
with
you
if

re

to

that
mean
she
once
told
him
i
be

say
cal

ve
left
the
store
but
the
manager

the
stockroom
cry
right
now
my
dad
would
just
be
amaze
in
moment
like
that
he
simply
couldn
t
understand
that
that
be
how
he
have
come
across
he
never
slow
down
he
didn
t
trust
other
people
who
do
either
i
know
for
a
fact
that
he
wasn
t
manic
depressive
because
he
be
never
anything
other
than
manic
just
as
they
have
when
i
be
a
child
people

still

that
he
be
always
on
the
brink
of

have
also
gotten
to
the
point
where
he
decide
it
be
best
not
to
be
so
stretch
on
cash
that
he
have
to
sweat
it
down
to
the
penny
still
sam
be
satisfied
with
his
answer
and
like
so
many
people
who
work
with
cal
sr
he
have
another
good
story
to
tell
meanwhile
i
knew
i
have
to
get
a
handle
on
the
working
of
the
business
but
more
and
more
i
realize
it
be
just
as
important
for
me
to
get
a
handle
on
my
own
approach
to
leadership
every
potential
leader
have
strength
and
weakness
and
i
have
to
come
to
grip
with
mine
we
all
have
barrier
to
get
past
and
mine
be
right
there
at
the
end
of
my
name
as
much
as
i
want
to
be
my
own
man
i
understood
what
it
meant
to
be
cal
turner
jr
it
wasn
t
just
the
potential
for
resentment
it
be
also
the
potential
for
undue
expectation
i
be
in
some
sense
the
prince
be
train
by
the
king
success
would
not
likely
be
attribute
to
me
because
everything
have
be
hand
to
me
failure
on
the
other
hand
would
largely
be
mine
alone
people
can
resent
the
prince
in
those
circumstance
but
they
also
expect
him
to
have
the
answer
and
the
power
they
would
expect
cal
jr
to
be
fully
ground
in
authority
when
in
reality
of
course
i
be
not
i
certainly
do
not
sense
that
much
ground
underneath
myself
as
much
as
that
scenario
seem
to
put
me
in
a
lose
lose
situation
though
it
turn
out
to
be
a
rare
advantage
prod
me
toward
a
career
position
philosophy
that
help
me
in
major
way
throughout
my
business
life
leadership
exists
when
an
organization
overcomes
have
a
bos
or
a
bos
mentality
a
bos
only
get
result
a
leader
get
development
and
it
be
necessary
for
a
leader
to
get
over
him
or
herself
i
have
to
get
over
be
the
bos
s
son
and
it
seem
to
me
that
the
best
way
to
do
so
be
to
poke
fun
at
myself
as
the
bos
s
son
it
be
a
throwback
to
my
mother
s
effort
to
get
me
to
take
myself
less
seriously
and
it
become
part
of
my
management
style
i
d
say
i
m
over
my
head
here
and
i
need
your
help
i
have
such
great
respect
for
what
go
on
in
a
store
because
i
ve
try
most
of
the
job
in
the
company
and
i
m
not
good
at
any
of
them
it
be
an
approach
that
grow
out
of
the
genuine
respect
i
have
acquire
for
the
people
who
do
those
job
they
understand
the
business
well
than
any
of
us
because
they
understand
the
customer
well
i
knew
we
ought
to
bring
their
insight
into
what
we
be
do
with
the
company
that
i
realize
be
a
key
to
effective
leadership
this
thing
call
authority
work
only
when
it
s
share
with
everybody
a
true
leader
vest
the
authority
in
the
organization
my
objective
be
to
convince
people
that
i
really
want
them
to
tell
us
the
truth
and
i
knew
the
great
truth
be
what
we
get
from
our
customer
by
way
of
our
employee
in
a
retail
company
the
real
authority
lie
with
the
customer
and
you
respond
to
them
collectively
the
leader
responds
to
the
employee
who
respond
to
the
customer
try
to
get
out
from
under
my
role
as
bos
s
son
position
me
to
do
that
much
well
than
i
might
have
otherwise
which
be
a
very
good
thing
because
as
i
look
at
the
company
i
d
just
be
appoint
to
lead
i
knew
i
be
walk
into
entrepreneurial
chaos
the
company
have
essentially
no
organization
everything
be
within
the
gut
of
the
found
entrepreneur
if
the
company
have
drawn
up
an
organizational
chart
in
those
day
it
would
have
be
a
circle
with
my
father
at
the
center
and
line
radiate
out
in
all
direction
we
have
no
board
we
didn
t
have
a
cfo
we
have
no
annual
budget
or
consolidated
financial
statement
once
a
week
we
get
an
operating
report
on
every
store
and
on
our
warehouse
and
the
auditor
come
in
twice
a
year
from
the
louisville
office
of
lybrand
ross
bros
montgomery
which
eventually
become
pricewaterhousecoopers
and
put
together
our
quarterly
financial
report
something
they
could
never
do
today
since
there
s
a
strict
line
between
prepare
the
statement
and
audit
them
there
be
another
interest
aspect
to
our
financial
report
and
it
be
something
i
discover
as
i
talk
to
my
dad
about
shrinkage
merchandise
or
cash
that
have
be
steal
lose
or
otherwise
unaccounted
for
i
be
adamant
that
we
have
to
control
it
and
we
couldn
t
because
of
the
way
he
handle
the
book
sometimes
when
we
bought
an
item
for
say
a
dozen
he
d
make
an
entry
that
say
we
paid
for
them
that
create
an
overage
that
would
offset
some
of
the
inevitable
shrinkage
give
him
a
cushion
he
could
bring
to
bear
on
the
year
end
number
if
he
overdid
it
though
our
auditor
would
come
to
him
about
our
warehouse
overage
for
the
year
he
d
say
well
we
don
t
need
to
show
that
much
profit
and
he
d
start
subtract
from
the
overage
and
save
it
for
the
next
year
be
that
legal
we
didn
t
know
and
didn
t
think
about
it
i
knew
it
be
inaccurate
accounting
and
my
beef
with
him
be
that
that
overrode
our
shrinkage
so
we
could
never
really
get
a
handle
on
it
for
management
it
be
out
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
daddy
we
ve
get
to
control
shrinkage
i
say
and
we
can
t
control
it
if
we
don
t
know
what
it
be
the
way
you
re
handle
the
book
you
re
cover
it
son
he
say
in
retailing
you
re
never
go
to
be
able
to
control
your
shrinkage
completely
no
matter
what
you
do
you
re
always
go
to
have
a
surprise
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
i
m
go
to
see
to
it
you
have
a
positive
surprise
he
be
convince
it
be
the
right
way
to
do
it
and
i
have
to
accept
it
it
be
one
of
many
aspect
of
the
business
i
view
as
chaotic
and
my
dad
or
others
view
as
business
as
usual
it
amaze
me
how
much
chaos
there
be
in
what
have
by
then
grown
to
a
store
chain
you
have
to
have
a
sense
of
something
else
an
outside
norm
in
order
to
recognize
chaos
as
chaos
and
i
guess
that
s
part
of
what
i
brought
to
the
equation
now
chaos
can
be
threaten
or
empower
in
my
case
i
d
have
to
say
it
be
empower
in
the
sense
that
it
make
me
realize
how
badly
i
need
management
training
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
in
when
i
d
be
with
the
company
for
three
year
my
dad
decide
it
be
time
to
take
it
public
the
target
date
be
december
of
that
year
and
in
the
fall
i
sign
up
for
the
american
management
association
s
management
course
in
new
york
the
ama
study
and
taught
management
it
have
a
whole
catalog
of
course
in
various
field
from
accounting
for
the
nonfinancial
executive
to
sensitivity
training
i
first
heard
about
the
ama
through
don
marsh
of
marsh
supermarket
in
indiana
marsh
also
a
family
business
be
upgrade
its
store
move
to
big
building
in
a
number
of
town
and
the
company
want
to
talk
to
a
noncompetitor
like
us
about
lease
those
building
i
visit
don
who
be
just
a
little
old
than
i
and
then
he
come
to
scottsville
visit
our
headquarters
and
have
dinner
with
us
while
i
be
still
living
on
cherry
street
with
my
parent
he
talk
about
how
useful
the
ama
have
be
and
he
mention
the
management
course
in
particular
i
be
try
to
determine
the
management
and
development
need
of
the
company
and
thought
this
sound
like
something
i
need
i
knew
that
a
well
understand
of
management
as
a
profession
and
ground
in
leadership
principle
would
be
good
for
me
the
course
consist
of
four
week
one
month
of
good
solid
management
fundamental
and
it
show
me
how
little
i
knew
about
management
i
be
particularly
impressed
with
larry
appley
the
ama
s
charismatic
chairman
and
guru
he
address
a
large
auditorium
full
of
management
trainee
and
wowed
us
with
his
view
on
management
as
a
profession
in
a
league
with
law
and
medicine
like
them
it
have
a
code
of
ethic
and
well
establish
principle
and
discipline
as
he
elaborate
on
its
challenge
and
its
importance
his
word
resonate
very
deeply
with
me
i
thought
my
mandate
be
to
help
j
l
turner
and
son
evolve
into
a
company
with
professional
management
and
appley
s
characterization
both
excite
and
challenged
me
my
dad
understood
that
we
need
professional
management
to
grow
and
develop
long
term
and
he
rely
on
me
to
figure
out
how
to
do
it
my
dad
s
decision
to
go
public
have
come
with
pretty
much
no
warn
he
just
say
in
june
of
that
year
i
m
ready
sell
stock
would
allow
him
to
raise
capital
he
need
for
expansion
he
also
have
his
eye
on
the
high
net
worth
that
come
with
company
stock
be
value
at
a
multiple
of
its
earnings
rather
than
just
its
book
value
the
net
asset
of
the
company
as
reflect
on
its
book
we
be
on
a
great
run
sale
have
nearly
double
from
million
in
to
million
as
we
approach
this
stock
offering
this
would
allow
our
family
to
diversify
since
we
could
sell
some
stock
and
invest
elsewhere
so
we
wouldn
t
have
all
our
egg
in
one
basket
we
would
be
sell
percent
of
the
company
with
the
family
hold
on
to
percent
as
we
do
so
my
dad
decide
we
should
change
the
name
in
keep
with
the
name
of
the
store
we
d
be
launch
since
we
would
no
longer
be
j
l
turner
and
son
we
would
be
dollar
general
corporation
i
accepted
the
change
with
regret
because
i
hat
for
the
turner
name
to
come
down
it
take
a
while
but
later
i
realize
it
be
a
good
decision
it
be
time
to
choose
a
board
of
director
the
govern
body
of
a
company
tasked
with
look
over
management
s
shoulder
on
behalf
of
the
shareholder
ideally
at
least
actually
we
chose
director
but
just
as
a
formality
we
try
to
look
as
good
as
possible
on
paper
but
we
never
have
a
board
meeting
and
it
be
only
later
that
we
take
that
part
of
the
business
seriously
we
have
six
month
to
prepare
for
the
sale
jerry
kohlberg
of
bear
stearns
who
have
handle
the
propose
public
offering
in
handle
this
one
as
well
when
that
earlier
one
have
be
aborted
jerry
have
propose
and
arrange
a
loan
from
a
syndicate
of
insurance
company
with
the
turner
and
son
attorney
don
oresman
of
simpson
thacher
bartlett
draw
up
the
paper
those
loan
agreement
contain
certain
covenant
that
really
help
the
company
mature
between
and
for
instance
my
dad
have
to
pay
off
the
bank
loan
for
one
month
a
year
force
him
to
plan
a
little
well
and
run
a
tighter
ship
the
company
be
constantly
underfinanced
because
of
his
tendency
to
overbuy
he
acknowledge
only
one
limit
factor
when
it
come
to
buying
my
inventory
control
he
use
to
say
be
the
four
wall
of
the
warehouse
meaning
he
couldn
t
buy
any
more
than
we
could
stuff
into
our
actual
storage
space
my
grandfather
be
always
concerned
about
overexpansion
but
my
dad
knew
he
have
to
keep
opening
new
store
because
he
be
always
buying
more
than
the
store
need
take
all
the
seller
have
in
order
to
get
the
low
possible
price
of
course
once
he
have
more
store
he
d
overbuy
for
them
too
which
meant
he
have
an
even
big
need
for
cash
since
buying
really
soak
it
up
so
even
though
sale
and
profit

would
ask

marguerite

a
tiny
well
love
big
eyed
and
occasionally
outspoken
bundle
of
energy
who
ran
her
loan
desk
at
farmer
national
with
an
iron
will
she
be
a
vice
president
and
she
have

one
point
that
she
do
not
like
the
word
certify
what
the
hell
do
that
mean
she
say
we

the
word
good
as
in
this
check
be
good
and
we
have
an
officer
sign
or
initial
it
so
what
if
the
rest
of
the
world
doesn
t
do
it
that
way
we
re
right
they
re
wrong
well
i
don
t
need
to
tell
you
that
the
sec
didn
t
see
it
that
way
the
entire
process
stop
and
we
spent
a
couple
of
very
nervous
hour
as
don
go
to
his
firm
s
washington
office
and
have
them
scurry
to
prepare
a
certify
check
that
actually
say
certify
not
long
after
that
happen
i
go
to
marguerite
and
say
you
have
to
change
the
way
you
do
certify
check
it
held
up
our
stock
sale
she
say
cal
jr
you
and
your
family
may
own
control
of
the
farmer
bank
but
that
doesn
t
mean
you
have
control
of
marguerite
mcclellan
this
check
be
good
and
we
re
not
go
to
change
it
and
they
didn
t
until
after
marguerite
retire
the
stock
sell
at
and
the
company
and
cal
sr
raise
about
million
which
we
use
to
buy
inventory
and
open
more
store
the
sale
have
a
major
effect
on
both
my
dad
and
me
on
him
because
he
sell
some
of
the
stock
he
own
and
on
me
because
i
be
in
the
perhaps
unenviable
role
of
be
responsible
for
a
public
company
that
have
no
chief
financial
officer
no
budget
no
planning
and
scarcely
any
consolidated
financials
still
i
wasn
t
as
nervous
as
i
should
have
be
i
have
the
overconfidence
of
youth
my
dad
have
the
overconfidence
of
the
entrepreneur
and
he
probably
have
overconfidence
in
his
son
we
really
didn
t
know
what
we
be
get
into
for
starter
a
lot
of
previously
undisclosed
information
be
now
public
quite
a
few
of
the
people
who
have
watch
us
grow
now
own
stock
and
every
six
month
they
be
go
to
get
a
report
on
sale
and
earnings
number
that
have
be
available
only
to
the
family
and
the
banker
who
lent
us
money
i
soon
realize
it
would
be
up
to
me
to
let
them
know
how
we
be
do
i
also
have
the
responsibility
of
communicate
with
the
analyst
who
would
follow
the
company
in
january
a
month
after
we
d
go
public
somebody
mention
that
we
need
to
do
an
annual
report
on
the
year
that
have
just
end
what
s
an
annual
report
i
say
we
be
a
public
company
and
i
honestly
didn
t
know
somehow
i
d
gotten
through
four
year
of
vanderbilt
and
earn
a
degree
in
business
administration
and
didn
t
remember
hearing
the
term
i
have
study
accounting
but
our
case
study
be
about
the
operation
of
company
not
annual
or
quarterly
report
there
be
a
course
on
stock
and
market
but
i
never
do
take
it
now
however
there
be
an
annual
report
due
and
it
be
my
baby
we
take
inventory
of
the
store
and
warehouse
and
lybrand
ross
bros
montgomery
audit
our
financials
i
go
into
my
office
close
the
door
and
write
the
narrative
fortunately
the
news
be
good
and
it
take
me
just
six
short
paragraph
to
spell
it
out
in
term
of
profitable
growth
which
really
described
our
company
our
net
sale
have
increase
percent
to
million
and
our
net
income
have
risen
percent
to
nearly
million
both
sale
and
income
have
double
since
i
welcome
our
new
shareholder
give
them
those
figure
credit
the
influence
of
our
past
and
told
them
two
thing
i
thought
be
very
impressive
a
typical
new
store
open
in
less
than
a
week
and
turn
a
profit
in
less
than
two
month
a
typical
exist
store
show
a
gain
over
the
previous
year
in
both
sale
and
profit
it
take
just
eight
page
to
give
them
all
the
chart
graph
and
history
we
need
to
fill
out
the
picture
there
may
have
be
time
when
it
didn
t
seem
as
if
we
knew
exactly
what
we
be
do
but
as
the
report
point
out
we
be
do
very
well
sometimes
life
throw
a
lot
at
you
at
once
and
as
i
dealt
with
go
public
and
my
first
management
training
under
fire
i
be
also
prepare
to
get
married
margaret
be
almost
six
year
young
than
i
and
no
one
who
have
ever
see
her
wonder
why
i
be
attract
to
her
she
be
a
sensitive
and
intelligent
poetically
articulate
person
and
she
have
a
natural
class
about
her
i
have
first
spot
her
as
she
settle
into
a
pew
as
part
of
the
park
city
kentucky
delegation
to
a
sub
district
meeting
of
the
methodist
youth
fellowship
although
she
be
too
young
to
pay
attention
to
i
be
president
of
our
sub
district
group
comprise
of
the
church
from
a
number
of
little
town
in
the
area
i
think
she
would
say
she
be
impressed
with
me
too
and
be
drawn
to
the
confidence
i
exude
even
if
she
thought
i
may
have
overexuded
now
and
then
imagine
that
after
i
d
go
through
college
and
the
navy
and
have
come
into

relief
to
my

control
until
he
get
to
a
certain
age
after
that
his
mother
can
t
control
him
in
fact
he
s
out
of
control
from
that
time
until
he
get
married
and
then
his
wife
assumes
the
job
of
control
i
m
worried
that
you
will
have
too
much
of
a
span
of
time
between
them
and
will
be
too
far
out
of
control
when
you
finally
get
married
your
wife
will
not
be
able
to
get
you
back
into
control

the
right
time
and

a
great

the
one
marketing

make
much
of
an
impression

didn
t
need

plenty
of
that

company
and
we
don
t
know
what
we
re
do
when
it
come
to
pr
do
you
have
any
suggestion
rod
thought
about
it
and
call
a
couple
of
day
later
i
ve
get
a
good
idea
he
say
why
don
t
i
freelance
and
do
your
pr
for
you
he
have
do
pr
work
for
chrysler
during
a
stint
as
a
reporter
in
illinois
and
i
say
i
thought
it
be
a
great
idea
work
from
home
he
write
our
press
release
and
then
our
quarterly
and
annual
report
if
i
have
to
make
a
presentation
to
analyst
he
d
help
me
write
the
speech
and
prepare
the
slide
he
eventually
left
the
paper
and
with
randy
neely
set
up
the
wenz
neely
company
which
go
on
to
become
kentucky
s
large
pr
firm
with
client
include
kentucky
fry
chicken
and
the
louisville
international
airport
i
always
like
the
fact
that
dollar
general
be
a
client
of
rod
wenz
before
he
even
form
a
company
i
often
wish
i
could
have
found
a
rod
wenz
to
help
in
deal
with
wall
street
at
one
point
in
one
of
our
big
investor
banker
trust
want
to
talk
so
i
go
to
new
york
where
i
sat
down
with
three
of
their
executive
they
kick
off
the
discussion
by
say
we
own
a
hundred
thousand
share
of
your
stock
and
after
this
meeting
with
you
we
will
decide
whether
to
sell
the
hundred
thousand
we
own
or
buy
another
hundred
thousand
i
suddenly
realize
i
be
play
very
high
stake
poker
theirs
be
probably
the
most
sizable
block
of
stock
outside
our
family
at
the
time
i
have
to
convince
them
that
they
d
be
wise
to
invest
in
the
first
place
and
that
the
best
thing
they
could
do
be
to
increase
their
stake
they
start
ask
question
assume
of
course
that
i
could
answer
them
the
truth
be
that
i
couldn
t
all
the
financial
information
i
have
be
in
the
form
of
those
weekly
report
on
our
store
and
warehouse
would
you
like
to
know
how
we
re
do
in
arab
alabama
i
could
have
ask
them
i
ve
get
the
figure
right
here
normally
you
would
pull
all
those
figure
together
but
we
didn
t
yet
have
consolidated
statement
and
there
be
no
financial
analysis
there
wasn
t
a
cpa
in
the
company
so
when
they
ask
about
say
return
on
invest
capital
i
didn
t
have
an
answer
but
i
didn
t
want
them
to
know
that
i
decide
that
take
a
stab
in
the
dark
be
well
than
give
no
answer
at
all
so
that
s
what
i
do
i
take
wild
guess
about
what
the
correct
number
might
be
then
when
i
get
back
to
scottsville
i
go
through
the
process
of
figure
out
the
real
answer
subtract
my
guess
from
the
true
number
give
us
our
performance
gap
which
in
turn
give
us
our
march
order
it
be
no
way
to
run
a
public
company
but
that
s
the
way
we
do
it
then
from
the
time
i
join
the
company
in
until
i
be
name
president
in
i
wing
it
with
wall
street
and
by
the
way
i
be
so
engross
in
run
the
company
i
never
do
check
to
see
if
banker
trust
bought
more
that
be
the
pace
i
be
keep
then
i
didn
t
have
time
for
reconnaissance
i
be
already
on
to
the
next
battle
and
the
only
time
we
really
thought
about
our
stockholder
be
when
we
settle
up
twice
a
year
later
four
time
a
year
and
issue
our
report
we
be
a
solid
company
our
number
be
really
good
my
dad
be
on
top
of
the
business
store
by
store
week
by
week
so
dollar
general
be
a
successful
retail
venue
still
new
york
didn
t
understand
us
they
view
us
as
a
company
outside
the
normal
parameter
of
retailing
dollar
general
wasn
t
a
dime
store
like
woolworth
or
a
department
store
like
j
c
penney
so
they
couldn
t
categorize
us
we
weren
t
a
conventional
retailer
at
all
we
bought
opportunistically
and
sell
what
we
found
at
even
dollar
price
normally
an
analyst
would
compare
our
price
earnings
ratio
to
that
of
others
in
our
sector
but
we
weren
t
really
part
of
a
sector
one
of
the
question
pose
be
about
merchandise
continuity
they
knew
that
my
dad
have
a
way
of
find
one
of
a
kind
deal
and
that
a
good
percentage
of
our
merchandise
be
closeout
and
irregular
what
happens
an
analyst
would
ask
as
manufacturer
get
more
efficient
and
there
aren
t
any
more
irregular
or
when
the
deal
dry
up
you
re
bottom
feeder
and
so
what
happens
when
nothing
be
drop
to
the
bottom
i
point
to
our
record
of
success
in
find
deal
year
after
year
and
in
have
our
customer
accept
them
our
number
speak
for
themselves
i
d
tell
them
how
be
we
go
to
be
sure
that
s
go
to
continue
they
d
say
at
that
point
i
d
do
my
best
to
change
the
subject
we
kept
bobbing
along
that
way
and
they
always
wound
up
be
sell
on
us
after
the
fact
eventually
i
guess
the
number
do
speak
for
themselves
in
the
meantime
we
have
to
come
up
with
way
to
keep
them
engage
for
instance
we
d
schedule
lunch
in
various
city
invite
analyst
and
investor
so
we
could
tell
them
about
the
company
and
we
hop
convince
them
to
invest
or
recommend
us
the
trouble
be
it
be
hard
to
get
them
to
show
up
these
be
high
stake
meeting
so
i
decide
to
sweeten
the
deal
try
to
make
point
by
work
with
what
i
have
the
next
invitation
that
go
out
say
if
you
ll
let
me
know
your
size
i
ll
bring
you
a
golf
shirt
one
of
our
irregular
which
i
don
t
think
you
ll
be
able
to
tell
from
first
quality
merchandise
you
d
buy
in
a
high
end
department
store
they
usually
couldn
t
tell
the
difference
and
it
work
well
enough
to
attract
a
full
house
and
the
attention
of
the
wall
street
journal
which
thought
it
be
a
clever
approach
and
do
a
small
front
page
piece
still
i
remember
grumble
to
my
secretary
earline
frost
about
the
fact
that
it
be
selfishness
rather
than
the
desire
to
understand
the
company
that
brought
them
to
the
meeting
well
she
say
let
me
ask
you
this
if
you
have
several
luncheon
invitation
and
one
offer
you
a
golf
shirt
and
the
others
didn
t
which
would
you
accept
okay
i
get
it
i
say
much
of
what
we
do
be
that
way
my
dad
couldn
t
sift
out
what
he
knew
and
teach
it
and
i
didn
t
know
wall
street
an
entrepreneur
can
be
one
of
the
most
creatively
adaptive
person
you
ll
ever
meet
but
it
may
not
be
cerebral
he
be
probably
act
and
react
without
too
much
thought
to
pattern
or
structure
he
have
a
philosophy
and
experience
but
often
not
much
else
it
would
take
the
concept
of
strategic
planning
to
give
us
a
road
map
for
turn
that
from
the
hip
genius
into
a
solid
approach
to
do
business
and
that
be
still
a
long
way
off
in
the
meantime
we
have
entrepreneurial
seat
of
the
pant
growth
that
be
daddy
s
style
and
if
new
york
didn
t
understand
it
small
town
all
over
the
south
do
they
be
the
backdrop
the
ground
reality
of
the
company
and
the
people
in
those
town
love
the
store
no
town
ground
us
more
than
scottsville
whose
people
never
put
on
air
about
our
success
analyst
would
come
to
town
and
ask
direction
to
the
headquarters
of
dollar
general
i
don
t
know
someone
would
tell
them
but
the
turner
place
be
down
east
main
street
next
to
bob
graham
s
furniture
barn
then
there
be
the
time
the
townspeople
of
scottsville
bail
us
out
one
saturday
at
noon
lightning
struck
the
tobacco
barn
warehouse
and
the
sprinkler
system
rupture
water
go
all
over
the
place
and
since
the
merchandise
be
on
the
floor
rather
than
on
pallet
we
knew
practically
all
the
soft
good
would
get
wet
word
spread
through
the
town
that
we
have
a
problem
and
people
come
and
volunteer
to
help
we
work
until
p
m
saturday
get
merchandise
out
of
the
water
and
hang
it
up
i
can
still
see
the
long
john
hang
on
makeshift
clothesline
outside
then
most
of
those
people
come
back
sunday
morning
and
do
it
again
practically
the
whole
town
be
out
to
help
us
recover
the
pride
they
have
in
our
success
be
best
express
by
that
kind
of
teamwork
and
that
continue
to
be
a
very
move
memory
to
this
day
my
dad
have
a
great
measure
of
resourcefulness
when
it
come
to
salvage
merchandise
part
of
it
be
just
unwillingness
no
doubt
a
result
of
his
family
s
poverty
stricken
day
on
the
farm
to
see
anything
go
to
waste
he
once
bought
a
truckload
of
wet
sock
from
a
fire
sale
in
nashville
and
for
two
day
employee
sort
and
hung
them
all
over
the
warehouse
when
bell
bottom
go
out
of
style
he
have
them
cut
off
so
we
could
sell
them
as
short
he
be
always
buying
blouse
and
top
at
the
end
of
the
season
just
about
the
time
other
store
be
no
longer
sell
them
his
love
of
great
buy
be
still
a
foundational
element
some
of
them
take
on
mythic
proportion
once
before
i
come
to
the
company
full
time
he
bought
fruitcake
at
the
end
of
the
christmas
season
he
just
couldn
t
resist
the
price
i
think
the
population
of
scottsville
be
at
the
time
and
when
the
truck
driver
haul
those
fruitcake
pull
into
town
he
stop
and
call
the
dispatcher
man
you
have
really
screw
up
he
say
i
have
get
a
load
of
thirty
five
thousand
fruitcake
and
this
town
doesn
t
have
three
thousand
people
you
must
have
sent
me
to
the
wrong
place
we
sell
all
of
them
by
the
way
for
a
dollar
each
the
next
christmas
then
there
be
the
time
i
walk
into
my
dad
s
office
and
he
have
big
pile
of
this
synthetic
fabric
all
over
his
desk
there
be
pink
and
blue
and
yellow
and
it
couldn
t
be
fold
so
it
lay
there
in
glob
look
like
brightly
color
amoeba
obviously
someone
have
gotten
stuck
with
a
lot
of
it
and
have
give
him
a
deal
what
do
you
think
of
this
son
he
say
what
be
it
i
say
i
don
t
know
but
i
just
bought
it
be
you
kid
me
he
say
son
i
bought
this
for
a
penny
a
yard
i
ll
buy
anything
for
a
penny
a
yard
what
ll
our
customer
do
with
that
daddy
i
don
t
know
but
we
have
smart
customer
and
they
ll
figure
out
something
to
do
with
it
at
that
price
actually
they
never
do
figure
it
out
that
fabric
wouldn
t
pile
up
you
d
put
it
on
a
counter
and
it
would
slide
off
onto
the
floor
those
bright
pastel
color
show
dirt
easily
and
so
we
wound
up
throw
much
of
it
away
it
be
one
of
the
few
time
my
dad
s
intuition
really
miss
once
he
bought
hundred
of
thousand
of
slipper
at
a
dime
a
pair
another
time
he
bought
all
the
clear
plastic
sandal
a
manufacturer
have
for
cent
a
pair
then
the
fellow
found
out
he
have
another
warehouse
or
two
of
them
my
dad
didn
t
want
his
competition
get
hold
of
them
so
he
bought
those
too
for
cent
a
pair
then
whether
by
design
or
not
the
fellow
found
he
have
some
more
in
a
warehouse
in
jamaica
and
my
dad
bought
those
for
cent
a
pair
we
have
them
come
out
our
ear
but
it
be
a
good
buy
daddy
would
say
in
situation
like
that
if
i
have
to
declare
bankruptcy
i
won
t
be
embarrass
to
tell
the
judge
what
i
paid
for
this
inventory
i
can
t
get
rid
of
he
miss
on
hula
hoop
too
he
bought
them
by
the
carload
just
as
the
fad
end
and
finally
trade
them
to
another
company
at
bottom
though
the
company
wouldn
t
have
do
as
well
as
it
have
if
there
hadn
t
be
a
real
method
to
his
madness
one
of
the
best
example
involve
his
decision
to
stock
irregular
when
we
get
in
the
dollar
store
business
my
dad
knew
that
our
customer
appreciate
a
well
make
garment
and
he
knew
the
huge
quality
difference
between
the
clothing
of
the
good
manufacturer
and
that
of
the
low
end
manufacturer
who
would
cut
corner
to
achieve
low
price
so
he
reason
that
the
irregular
of
a
good
manufacturer
be
worth
more
than
the
first
quality
product
of
a
schlock
manufacturer
and
that
our
customer
would
appreciate
that
an
irregular
garment
might
not
meet
the
high
standard
of
big
merchandiser
like
sears
or
j
c
penney
but
their
imperfection
be
normally
so
slight
they
couldn
t
easily
be
detect
which
be
why
hand
them
out
to
investor
and
analyst
be
so
effective
so
my
dad
negotiate
contract
with
manufacturer
say
i
ll
take
every
irregular
you
have
at
this
percentage
of
your
price
he
knew
the
good
manufacturer
be
on
top
of
style
fabric
color
and
quality
so
he
didn
t
have
to
worry
about
those
thing
and
since
he
generally
picked
up
such
garment
at
to
percent
of
the
regular
cost
he
could
offer
our
customer
real
bargain
we
could
sell
slack
for
and
the
manufacturer
knew
their
brand
merchandise
would
be
bury
in
small
town
like
scottsville
far
from
their
department
store
client
my
dad
would
contract
for
irregular
with
eminent
manufacturer
such
as
blue
bell
which
make
wrangler
jean
and
with
the
company
that
manufacture
clothing
for
sears
or
j
c
penney
then
when
they
want
to
close
out
a
line
at
the
end
of
the
season
they
d
come
to
him
first
and
he
d
get
a
great
price
on
that
too
by
the
seventy
irregular
and
closeout
account
for
percent
of
the
merchandise
sell
in
dg
store
the
rest
be
first
quality
apparel
housewares
shoe
and
health
and
beauty
aid
he
be
completely
opportunistic
when
it
come
to
inventory
and
this
kind
of
buying
be
one
of
the
reason
we
be
so
successful
in
fact
through
the
year
my
dad
developed
a
reputation
for
be
a
genius
as
a
buyer
in
particular
for
look
at
something
and
know
what
it
could
bring
actually
you
re
a
genius
if
it
sell
at
the
price
you
put
on
it
on
the
other
hand
who
s
to
say
it
wouldn
t
have
sell
just
as
well
at
a
high
price
when
you
have
a
bos
like
cal
turner
love
by
everyone
you
re
go
to
make
him
a
genius
in
memory
the
truth
be
that
for
all
practical
purpose
he
be
really
good
he
knew
when
he
be
pretty
much
the
only
remain
outlet
for
something
a
manufacturer
have
and
he
d
negotiate
harder
in
those
instance
he
knew
where
he
could
price
something
give
his
cost
and
if
it
didn
t
sell
well
he
d
low
the
price
far
he
have
a
hand
on
relationship
with
warehouse
operation
as
well
and
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
go
up
and
down
the
aisle
he
would
say
send
this
to
the
guntersville
alabama
store
or
the
price
isn
t
right
on
this
let
s
change
it
his
approach
be
not
go
to
mix
well
with
computer
and
he
resist
them
from
the
first
time
he
be
introduce
to
the
early
version
he
wasn
t
crazy
about
machinery
of
any
kind
when
the
company
open
nashville
store
no
walter
gupton
bought
six
cash
register
for
without
tell
my
dad
who
react
so
badly
that
walter
thought
surely
he
d
be
fire
my
dad
thought
the
dollar
store
business
be
so
simple
especially
when
you
have
even
dollar
price
point
you
didn
t
need
sophisticated
equipment
that
would
cost
more
than
it
come
to
we
d
take
a
catch
as
catch
can
approach
to
cash
register
from
the
start
and
as
far
as
my
dad
be
concerned
the
more
basic
the
well
he
didn
t
want
to
pay
for
a
register
that
do
anything
more
than
add
number
computer
be
a
bone
of
contention
between
my
dad
and
me
as
well
when
i
start
work
for
the
company
i
look
at
way
we
might
improve
pretty
much
every
aspect
of
the
business
and
george
peterson
the
ibm
salesman
from
bowling
green
convince
me
in
that
we
ought
to
have
computer
for
inventory
control
he
and
i
go
into
my
dad
s
office
to
talk
about
it
my
dad
say
say
i
go
to
a
manufacturer
and
buy
all
that
he
have
if
your
computer
tell
me
i
ve
make
a
good
buy
i
can
t
take
any
action
because
there
s
no
more
to
buy
if
it
tell
me
i
ve
make
a
bad
buy
i
m
go
to
want
to
throw
the
thing
out
the
window
so
what
use
be
that
to
me
as
george
walk
out
of
my
dad
s
office
he
look
over
all
those
bookkeeper
with
their
add
machine
and
have
an
aha
moment
look
at
all
these
woman
pound
calculator
he
say
he
begin
talk
about
the
accounting
machine
we
could
bring
in
to
handle
all
those
calculation
finally
my
dad
agree
and
we
be
able
to
buy
ibm
system
computer
with
punch
card
give
his
aversion
to
the
word
computer
he
and
i
always
call
them
accounting
machine
my
dad
be
right
about
the
fact
that
computer
didn
t
make
sense
for
the
way
he
ran
the
business
but
we
have
them
now
and
that
be
a
step
forward
that
fulfil
that
prophecy
he
wasn
t
go
to
be
run
thing
as
he
have
be
a
lot
of
thing
be
go
to
change
and
that
be
go
to
create
problem
computer
didn
t
change
my
dad
s
approach
to
the
task
he
treasure
most
since
the
first
day
of
the
company
he
have
go
through
the
manually
prepared
report
on
every
store
when
we
start
use
computer
he
go
through
print
report
and
when
he
get
his
own
computer
all
he
ever
do
with
it
be
pull
up
store
report
for
the
rest
of
his
career
he
remain
passionate
in
his
dislike
of
computer
true
to
form
his
office
look
like
the
sanctuary
of
somebody
resist
change
he
have
paper
everywhere
both
those
report
and
note
he
d
write
to
himself
he
have
a
big
swedish
chair
with
an
ottoman
that
serve
almost
as
a
recliner
the
credenza
behind
his
desk
be
load
with
photograph
and
memorabilia
he
have
two
couch
that
face
each
other
one
of
which
he
use
for
the
occasional
nap
on
the
wall
behind
that
one
hung
an
old
fashion
rug
that
depict
a
saint
bernard
dog
walk
in
you
might
see
him
on
the
phone
buying
merchandise
or
talk
business
with
somebody
but
odds
be
he
be
go
through
those
report
he
read
every
one
every
week
circle
thing
that
caught
his
eye
and
make
note
to
district
manager
who
receive
report
with
attach
note
on
problem
store
in
their
district
he
might
circle
the
utility
and
write
please
stop
heating
the
out
of
door
he
d
see
an
amount
list
as
strip
and
wax
the
floor
and
write
in
the
old
day
we
do
this
ourselves
he
might
circle
payroll
and
write
look
like
enough
for
a
whole
district
the
district
manager
refer
to
those
missive
as
love
letter
they
definitely
have
personality
and
my
dad
would
show
me
the
choice
one
he
d
be
so
proud
of
some
remark
he
d
make
and
what
he
d
caught
in
the
report
that
he
d
want
me
to
see
it
before
he
mail
it
now
and
then
he
d
call
me
in
and
i
d
squirm
as
he
go
over
his
bitch
list
he
be
a
man
who
process
and
vent
his
anger
immediately
you
knew
exactly
where
you
stood
and
exactly
where
he
stood
on
any
point
he
generally
thought
he
be
right
and
he
have
a
world
of
experience
which
he
felt
deserve
to
be
respect
although
it
be
okay
to
stand
up
to
him
in
fact
he
hat
spineless
yes
men
most
likely
he
would
win
or
there
would
be
a
standoff
but
there
be
time
rare
though
they
be
when
he
would
lose
one
it
happen
now
and
then
with
me
and
when
he
have
clearly
lose
as
he
do
once
when
we
disagreed
on
pricing
greet
card
he
would
acknowledge
it
my
dad
like
to
see
people
in
motion
don
t
ever
hire
someone
who
doesn
t
walk
fast
he
would
say
once
as
he
be
practically
run
through
the
warehouse
he
saw
delbert
cushenberry
the
warehouse
supervisor
lean
against
the
shaft
of
our
old
slow
motion
freight
elevator
press
the
button
it
be
a
peculiarity
of
this
elevator
that
you
have
to
push
the
button
the
entire
time
it
be
move
or
it
would
stop
daddy
knew
that
but
his
intensity
be
such
that
the
sight
of
cush
who
be
never
in
much
of
a
hurry
just
stand
there
with
his
finger
on
the
button
get
to
him
cush
what
be
you
do
he
say
mr
turner
he
say
i
m
move
the
elevator
up
to
the
second
floor
i
ve
get
to
hold
this
button
in
my
dad
say
well
shuffle
your
foot
while
you
re
do
it
he
also
use
to
complain
about
meeting
if
someone
say
we
need
to
sit
down
and
talk
about
that
he
d
say
no
we
don
t
the
trouble
with
this
company
be
how
long
our
meeting
be
we
need
to
have
stand
up
meeting
he
like
people
to
keep
their
comment
brief
and
to
the
point
although
he
exempt
himself
from
that
prescription
it
be
like
that
with
golf
too
my
dad
would
play
a
round
now
and
then
but
he
wasn
t
a
fan
of
other
executive
who
do
i
m
not
go
to
hire
anybody
who
play
golf
he
d
say
to
howard
johnson
one
of
our
executive
often
while
they
be
play
a
round
son
he
say
to
me
look
out
if
you
re
about
to
hire
somebody
who
play
golf
it
take
too
much
time
and
be
careful
if
you
re
about
to
hire
somebody
who
fish
that
take
too
much
time
and
son
if
you
ever
hire
anybody
who
do
both
i
will
fire
you
my
dad
be
a
cut
to
the
chase
kind
of
guy
he
would
make
decision
as
an
entrepreneur
and
announce
them
but
he
couldn
t
explain
how
he
get
there
even
to
his
son
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
try
to
explore
the
why
of
his
what
i
would
ask
him
to
interpret
something
for
me
and
he
d
struggle
unable
to
tell
me
why
he
thought
this
or
do
that
or
decide
the
other
it
could
be
anything
from
a
pricing
decision
to
why
he
like
woman
s
clothing
to
the
right
of
the
front
door
and
men
s
to
the
left
sometimes
when
i
say
daddy
tell
me
why
you
decide
that
he
would
say
well
i
don
t
know
it
just
seem
right
i
could
follow
up
all
i
want
but
we
could
never
quite
get
it
pin
down
there
be
a
time
when
his
logic
left
me
completely
in
the
dark
it
happen
in
as
we
be
about
to
issue
another
public
offering
of
stock
reduce
the
family
s
ownership
of
the
company
from
to
percent
i
be
actually
kind
of
emotional
about
have
that
much
of
the
company
go
from
the
family
j
c
bradford
co
and
white
weld
co
be
the
underwriter
and
i
be
in
charge
of
the
process
everything
be
move
along
nicely
until
one
monday
morning
my
dad
walk
into
my
office
and
say
tell
luke
simon
of
j

can
t
tell
you

be
a
good
twenty
year
before

out
why
my

in
a
rural
area
with
a
population
under
go
back
to
the
day
when
i
be
a
part
time
employee
in
the
warehouse
and
in
the
store
as
a
teenager
i
have
be
with
the
company
for
more
than
twenty
year
i
be
thirty
two
year
old
with
a
wife
and
a
son
calister
iii
who
d
be
born
in
my
development
as
a
leader
and
as
a
man
be
still
a
work
in
progress
my
political
history
at
least
in
the
early
year
be
tie
to
my
parent
my
mother
s
family
include
quite
a
few
politician
some
of
them
prominent
all
of
them
democrat
and
a
lot
of
the
talk
at
family
event
be
political
my
dad
be
just
the
opposite
he
never
talk
about
politics
he
felt
that
a
businessman
ought
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
about
such
thing
as
michael
jordan
say
many
year
later
when
ask
why
he
wasn
t
politically
active
republican
buy
sneaker
too
my
dad
be
a
republican
but
in
this
case
he
want
neither
republican
nor
democrat
to
have
a
reason
not
to
shop
in
his
store
i
register
to
vote
at
eighteen
in
kentucky
be
one
of
the
first
state
to
low
the
voting
age
to
eighteen
do
so
in
as
a
democrat
if
you
be
voting
in
my
part
of
kentucky
and
in
much
of
the
south
the
democratic
primary
be
where
the
action
be
because
the
democrat
be
more
than
likely
go
to
win
the
general
election
i
have
believe
from
the
time
i
be
young
that
the
government
ought
to
do
everything
possible
to
help
the
less
fortunate
my
year
and
a
half
in
scotland
though
have
a
big
effect
on
my
outlook
many
of
the
people
around
thurso
live
in
socialize
housing
there
be
socialize
everything
really
and
it
seem
to
me
that
it
didn
t
work
shopkeeper
for
instance
weren
t
motivate
to
open
their
shop
long
enough
to
get
a
lot
of
business
clearly
the
government
have
its
hand
in
too
much
of
the
economy
and
it
be
obvious
that
the
system
be
not
design
to
encourage
enterprise
then
when
i
get
back
home
i
watch
lyndon
johnson
s
determination
to
fight
a
war
in
vietnam
while
simultaneously
launch
a
great
society
which
seem
to
me
to
be
a
movement
toward
the
very
society
that
wasn
t
work
very
well
in
great
britain
not
long
afterward
i
change
my
registration
become
what
i
call
an
lbj
republican
meaning
he
have
driven
me
to
the
gop
one
thing
i
appreciate
about
scotland
be
their
dress
they
may
not
have
open
for
business
often
enough
to
suit
me
but
they
always
seem
to
be
dress
well
for
business
i
like
that
in
my
early
year
of
lead
the
company
i
felt
that
i
need
to
dress
like
the
bos
that
be
a
part
of
the
turner
mentality
that
may
well
have
come
to
my
dad
through
the
goad
side
of
the
family
the
goad
be
sharp
dresser
and
one
frank
goad
clement
who
be
tennessee
s
governor
for
ten
year
in
the
s
and
s
once
told
a
story
about
show
up
in
a
small
town
look
like
a
million
dollar
and
meeting
a
man
who
beam
and
say
look

be
my
governor
and
when
you
show
up
i
want
you
to
be
dress
well
and
be
in
the
big
cadillac
they
make
both
my
parent
be
sharp
dresser
my
dad
be
generally
in
a
suit
he
felt
it
be
a
way
to
show
respect
to
the
people
you
be
deal
with
my
mother
wore
a
hat
and
glove
to
church
and
change
her
attire
seasonally
with
the
come
each
year
of
the
kentucky
derby
and
labor
day
and
their
example
make
me
conscious
of
dress
all
my
life
we
would
go
into
nashville
to
shop
at
the
castner
knott
harvey
s
and
cain
sloan
department
store
when
i
be
a
kid
i
remember
be
the
only
one
of
my
friend
to
wear
knickers
corduroy
knickers
no
less
which
make
noise
when
i
walk
my
parent
must
have
thought
they
be
stylish
i
remember
my
joy
in
receive
my
first
yellow
cashmere
sweater
a
christmas
present
from
my
mother
and
at
fifteen
or
sixteen
a
sharp
look
pale
blue
dinner
jacket
my
first
for
a
dance
in
my
late
twenty
while
i
be
still
single
i
be
appearance
conscious
enough
that
i
decide
to
get
hair
transplant
i
travel
regularly
to
new
orleans
for
the
procedure
and
before
i
left
on
one
of
those
trip
i
decide
to
get
the
lowrey
organ
i
have
at
home
repair
earline
i
say
to
my
secretary
while
i
m
go
i
want
you
to
get
the
lowrey
people
to
come
from
bowling
green
and
fix
the
wow
wow
on
my
organ
she
pause
and
clear
her
throat
well
if
you
ever
get
hair
grow
on
your
head
and
your
wow
wow
work
you
ll
be
something
won
t
you
there
be
always
a
lot
of
color
and
a
little
flair
to
the
way
i
dress
still
be
but
it
be
always
business
dress
it
wasn
t
until
very
late
in
my
career
that
i
be
willing
to
let
dollar
general
s
office
staff
adopt
casual
dress
on
friday
i
d
be
under
pressure
to
do
so
and
then
one
father
s
day
margaret
and
my
son
cal
give
me
a
lot
of
casual
clothes
so
i
get
the
hint
and
finally
loosen
up
i
do
find
that
it
be
harder
to
combine
color
and
pattern
in
put
together
a
casual
outfit
than
it
be
to
don
a
shirt
tie
and
coat
wear
the
suit
be
one
thing
fill
it
be
another
from
day
one
my
dad
want
me
to
share
the
number
one
role
and
for
twelve
and
a
half
year
i
carry
an
awesome
sense
of
the
weight
of
that
position
always
aware
that
i
have
the
responsibility
of
be
number
one
but
not
the
full
authority
that
be
something
i
share
with
my
father
but
i
be
go
to
have
to
amass
knowledge
as
though
the
responsibility
be
solely
mine
paradoxically
i
be
empower
by
my
dad
s
inability
to
teach
throughout
my
professional
life
i
ran
across
people
like
him
who
have
grassroots
creativity
but
didn
t
know
how
to
share
it
i
have
to
figure
out
how
to
draw
the
lesson
from
each
person
and
situation
even
when
those
lesson
be
subtle
or
not
articulate
i
have
to
take
charge
of
my
own
learn
that
position
me
to
learn
more
from
life
and
others
than
if
my
dad
have
simply
declare
principle
to
me
in
fact
i
have
trouble
with
principle
they
feel
like
something
that
come
from
on
high
that
you
accept
without
question
rather
there
should
be
proposition
arise
from
individual
experience
i
learn
that
principle
aren
t
completely
transportable
from
my
life
to
yours
i
can
t
profess
to
have
the
truth
to
declare
from
on
high
because
i
don
t
i
have
the
lesson
of
my
experience
consequently
i
be
sometimes
suspicious
of
management
paradigm
management
by
objective
be
king
when
i
start
but
i
realize
early
on
that
i
want
more
than
just
an
objective
do
this
be
not
enough
for
me
i
be
interested
in
the
people
side
of
get
thing
do
as
a
would
be
pastor
disguise
as
a
businessman
i
want
heart
not
just
objective
i
want
a
different
kind
of
leadership
agenda
my
observation
of
how
thing
be
do
in
the
early
day
make
me
conclude
that
organize
chaos
be
the
apt
description
of
our
company
our
warehouse
and
distribution
system
be
a
case
in
point
good
come
in
from
manufacturer
then
go
back
out
to
the
store
order
come
in
to
different
department
with
no
real
coordination
a
truck
driver
head
for
say
the
store
in
jackson
tennessee
would
go
from
department
to
department
in
the
warehouse
and
say
have
you
get
anything
for
jackson
if
that
store
s
merchandise
didn
t
fill
the
truck
he
d
be
assign
another
store
in
the
area
or
on
the
way
he
d
go
around
again
have
you
get
anything
for
dickson
he
d
fill
the
truck
and
drive
off
i
remember
walk
through
the
warehouse
with
david
wild
of
j
c
bradford
david
have
brought
a
potential
investor
to
look
at
the
company
the
three
of
us
be
in
the
cush
warehouse
name
for
its
slow
talk
manager
delbert
cushenberry
and
we
have
come
to
the
section
where
we
kept
our
blue
bell
stock
their
irregular
and
closeout
on
jean
we
have
them
pile
up
everywhere
my
dad
like
them
to
be
sent
to
store
bundle
by
the
dozen
in
a
mix
of
color
and
size
that
way
we
could
ask
the
store
how
many
dozen
do
you
think
you
need
of
the
five
dollar
jean
and
we
d
send
them
whatever
mix
we
come
up
with
we
do
the
same
thing
with
blouse
david
and
this
investor
look
at
what
amount
to
almost
an
entire
warehouse
of
jean
and
david

over
and
sure
enough
there

some

have
import
him

with
him
for
an
exit
interview
cal
jr
he
say
do
you
realize
we
have
six
different
warehouse
which
independently
ship
to
store
with
no
coordination
there
be
nobody
in
charge
of
warehouse
in
this
company
he
didn
t
say
distribution
he
say
warehouse
and
after
that
interview
i
thought
yes
somebody
should
be
in
charge
of
warehouse
so
we
take
that
step
somewhere
in
the
mid
seventy
as
we
work
to
tweak
our
seat
of
the
pant
process
by
we
have
more
than
stockholder
in
forty
five
state
and
five
country
we
have
employee
and
our
sale
be
at
million
up
from
million
a
decade
earlier
we
be
the
fourteenth
large
company
in
kentucky
in
term
of
net
sale
and
in
the
top
twenty
five
in
term
of
asset
we
be
the
only
one
headquarter
outside
a
major
metropolitan
area
thirty
of
the
top
forty
be
headquarter
in
louisville
and
i
m
convince
our
small
town
root
and
continued
presence
in
scottsville
help
us
to
be
in
touch
with
our
customer
one
of
our
annual
report
put
it
like
this
we
ve
always
live
in
small
town
always
do
business
in
small
town
and
we
re
their
kind
of
people
small
town
people
work
harder
for
their
money
and
often
have
less
of
it
to
spend
so
they
re
more
careful
and
practical
about
how
they
spend
it
they
judge
quality
by
the
garment
not
the
label
and
they
know
a
work
shirt
with
a
thread
pattern
flaw
will
last
just
as
long
as
first
line
merchandise
even
if
it
only
cost
half
as
much
they
don
t
mind
shopping
where
there
s
no
carpeting
indirect
light
or
soft
music
because
they
know
it
s
the
customer
who
pay
for
those
luxury
we
re
in
scottsville
kentucky
with
our
corporate
headquarters
and
warehouse
for
many
of
the
same
kind
of
reason
we
can
do
business
less
expensively
with
well
help
and
with
more
pleasant
surroundings
than
our
big
city
competitor
we
re
country
folk
and
we
intend
to
stay
that
way
even
though
we
think
we
re
do
a
big
city
job
of
merchandising
it
be
a
mind
set
i
watch
and
try
to
absorb
but
there
be
still
lesson
i
need
to
learn
it
take
my
brother
steve
to
teach
me
one
of
them
steve
who
graduate
from
vanderbilt
in
and
spent
a
couple
of
year
in
the
army
have
come
into
the
business
in
the
early
seventy
as
a
buyer
he
have
work
in
store
and
in
the
warehouse
as
a
teenager
too
so
that
seem
the
right
first
placement
of
him
in
the
company
there
aren
t
many
thing
i
would
do
over
but
give
the
chance
i
might
react
differently
to
my
brother
s
choice
of
career
grow
up
he
would
say
cal
jr
i
wish
you
d
go
on
and
decide
what
you
want
to
do
so
i
ll
know
what
i
m
not
go
to
do
i
don
t
want
you
to
be
my
bos
he
want
to
be
a
lawyer
at
one
point
but
my
dad
overrule
that
no
he
told
steve
i
want
you
to
be
productive
steve
have
married
and
start
a
family
while
at
vanderbilt
and
after
the
army
he
decide
to
join
the
company
he
and
i
should
have
have
a
real
heart
to
heart
about
how
it
would
be
with
one
brother
work
for
another
i
should
have
talk
to
my
dad
about
it
as
well
i
wasn
t
insightful
enough
to
understand
it
at
the
time
but
steve
be
come
in
under
two
shadow
i
only
come
in
under
one
my
father
s
steve
have
mine
as
well
i
be
already
establish
in
the
business
my
dad
make
sure
i
be
accepted
and
i
be
do
thing
he
wasn
t
do
steve
be
also
a
turner
in
need
of
establish
his
own
identity
i
have
start
out
learn
how
to
open
a
store
from
scratch
and
then
how
to
rent
store
building
at
per
square
foot
my
dad
didn
t
want
me
in
his
merchandising
playhouse
so
i
just
watch
him
and
observe
how
he
go
about
it
without
play
a
role
he
be
the
one
function
entity
in
merchandising
there
be
so
much
else
in
the
company
i
need
to
sink
my
teeth
into
but
i
wasn
t
a
buyer
so
that
be
somewhere
steve
could
serve
the
company
separate
from
me
my
dad
be
by
then
willing
to
bring
another
son
into
the
part
of
the
business
that
be
closest
to
his
heart
that
part
of
retailing
have
the
far
advantage
of
be
a
more
sociable
area
if
there
be
a
party
component
to
retailing
it
would
be
in
merchandising
in
schmooze
and
be
schmooze
by
the
salesman
but
have
both
my
dad
and
steve
in
that
part
of
the
business
set
the
stage
for
a
lot
of
father
son
difficulty
because
they
didn
t
think
or
act
alike
steve
do
respect
my
dad
as
a
merchant
but
they
would
inevitably
wind
up
at
odds
over
one
thing
or
another
at
one
point
i
need
some
more
management
body
to
take
to
a
meeting
with
financial
analyst
steve
i
say
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
to
represent
management
but
i
need
you
to
understand
your
assignment
you
re
suppose
to
be
nice
look
smart
and
keep
your
mouth
shut
i
ll
answer
the
question
that
would
be
the
time
i
be
bitten
in
the
butt
by
my
own
cockiness
at
one
point
someone
say
mr
turner
other
retailer
end
their
fiscal
year
in
january
why
do
dollar
general
have
a
december
year
end
i
go
blank
and
be
obviously
struggle
for
an
answer
after
a
long
awkward
moment
steve
decide
to
come
to
my
rescue
heck
he
say
in
scottsville
we
thought
that
be
when
the
year
end
everybody
have
a
good
laugh
and
that
be
the
end
of
that
when
we
get
back
home
i
say
to
my
dad
why
do
our
year
end
in
december
he
say
because
that
s
when
i
can
make
the
most
liquid
statement
to
the
bank
after
our
december
sale
we
have
a
well
look
balance
sheet
and
with
the
extra
cash
it
s
easy
for
me
to
stay
out
of
the
bank
in
the
month
of
january
which
he
have
to
do
because
of
our
loan
agreement
of
course
in
february
we
go
right
back
into
debt

scottsville
divide
the
teamster
strike
late
in
the
summer
of
the
teamster
union
launch
an
effort
to
organize
our
truck
driver
and
warehouse
employee
the
teamster
have
be
found
in
and
have
classically
represent
driver
and
warehouse
worker
although
they
have
since
expand
into
other
job
type
we
have
maybe
twenty
driver
and
a
fleet
of
two
dozen
tractor
and
four
dozen
trailer
carry
merchandise
from
the
warehouse
in
scottsville
our
only
distribution
location
to
store
that
stretch
from
delaware
to
oklahoma
and
from
indiana
to
florida
we
have
face
a
number
of
organize
effort
by
union
date
back
to
the
one
that
so
upset
my
dad
when
i
be
in
the
navy
he
be
sick
about
all
of
them
my
dad
be
passionate
and
outspoken
about
his
opposition
to
union
he
would
get
red
in
the
face
at
the
very
mention
of
them
i
remember
that
during
one
attempt
to
organize
j
l
turner
and
son
employee
a
bookkeeper
name
barbara
invite
two
other
bookkeeper
to
join
her
for
lunch
with
a
union
organizer
my
dad
found
out
about
it
and
saw
to
it
that
she
be
fire
by
five
o
clock
that
afternoon
she
call
him
at
home
and
i
happen
to
be
there
i
knew
what
we
as
a
company
could
and
couldn
t
say
to
employee
at
time
like
this
you
couldn
t
threaten
or
fire
employee
for
get
information
about
union
and
i
have
try
to
explain
all
that
to
my
dad
i
stood
by
the
phone
hop
for
the
best
as
they
begin
talk
mr
turner
she
say
i
want
to
know
why
i
be
fire
from
j
l
turner
and
son
well
barbara
he
say
i
can
t
discus
that
with
you
until
mr
craddock
who
be
in
charge
of
the
bookkeeper
and
i
can
sit
down
together
and
talk
about
it
yes
i
thought
he
s
ace
it
now
if
i
could
just
get
him
off
the
phone
however
he
say
and
i
knew
something
bad
be
come
i
think
everyone
should
know
that
we
don
t
intend
to
have
any
union
sympathizer
work
for
j
l
turner
and
son
he
have
just
blown
it
of
course
from
then
on
at
every
single
hearing
we
have
before
the
national
labor
relation
board
usually
involve
a
grievance
file
during
an
organize
drive
that
quote
from
cal
sr
be
introduce
and
place
in
the
record
often
without
any
relevance
to
the
case
at
hand
the
toughness
on
our
side
go
back
to
the
earlier
organizational
effort
when
my
dad
help
make
it
harder
on
union
sympathizer
to
get
bank
loan
will
certainly
raise
eyebrow
give
present
day
sensibility
but
in
those
day
labor
relation
like
race
relation
be
much
different
union
organizer
played
hardball
as
do
those
who
oppose
them
one
have
only
to
look
to
the
coal
mine
of
kentucky
and
west
virginia
and
their
decade
of
sometimes
deadly
strife
to
know
that
there
be
genuine
horror
in
many
town
include
scottsville
at
the
prospect
of
union
activity
in
the
face
of
my
dad
s
complete
hatred
of
the
union
and
his
inability
to
disguise
it
or
remain
silent
i
be
the
one
who
have
to
remain
measure
and
calm
and
i
oversaw
the
company
s
handle
of
the
matter
give
that
we
be
a
family
business
in
a
small
town
the
fight
give
me
the
first
taste
of
hell
in
my
career
we
have
manage
our
own
transportation
since
the
begin
when
leo
allen
be
haul
merchandise
in
his
own
cattle
truck
in
the
company
invest
in
two
truck
of
its
own
and
leo
start
drive
one
of
them
through
the
year
we
bought
truck
and
trailer
one
or
two
at
a
time
from
various
source
and
we
drove
them
hard
we
figure
it
be
well
to
pay
the
maintenance
bill
and
keep
truck
on
the
road
as
long
as
we
could
rather
than
trade
them
in
too
often
leo
for
instance
put
a
quarter
of
a
million
mile
on
each
of
five
new
truck
through
in
those
one
and
a
quarter
million
mile
by
the
way
he
be
involve
in
only
two
accident
and
the
insurance
company
rule
that
neither
be
his
fault
the
company
have
always
be
more
union
vulnerable
with
the
driver
than
with
any
other
group
of
employee
they
travel
they
come
in
contact
with
driver
from
all
over
the
country
and
knew
they
be
paid
less
than
many
of
their
counterpart
on
the
other
hand
our
truck
driver
make
more
money
than
our
warehouse
worker
and
that
be
its
own
problem
there
be
always
go
to
be
some
tension
there
union
or
no
union
at
one
point
well
over
two
year
before
this
union
drive
begin
we
have
decide
we
could
kill
several
bird
with
one
stone
by
outsource
our
transportation
we
could
let
someone
else
be
responsible
for
the
driver
wage
and
benefit
so
we
petition
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
permission
to
bring
in
outside
contractor
but
then
as
with
so
many
other
thing
the
idea
sat
on
the
shelf
the
election
to
determine
whether
our
driver
would
choose
representation
by
the
teamster
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
with
the
company
come
and
the
driver
vote
the
teamster
in
meanwhile
the
union
be
still
talk
to
the
warehouse
worker
who
have
their
own
vote
schedule
thirty
day
later
my
dad
be
beside
himself
we
have
to
do
something
we
have
a
kentucky
lawyer
advise
us
during
the
run
up
to
the
driver
vote
now
we
decide
we
need
more
horsepower
and
we
brought
in
an
atlanta
law
firm
one
of
their
lawyer
lead
our
negotiation
concern
the
trucker
contract
and
another
ran
our
campaign
against
the
teamster
regard
the
warehouse
worker
pending
vote
we
thought
it
be
a
shame
that
the
driver
have
vote
in
the
union
as
far
as
we
be
concerned
they
have
a
good
thing
go
since
we
care
more
about
their
welfare
than
do
the
teamster
who
be
look
for
due
money
and
for
a
checkoff
system
require
that
all
driver
be
unionized
willingly
or
not
we
thought
that
agree
to
those
thing
would
have
be
a
betrayal
of
the
very
driver
the
union
be
claim
to
represent
still
we
understood
human
nature
well
enough
to
know
that
peer
pressure
can
sway
everyone
we
thought
they
have
be
lock
into
a
narrow
and
short
term
self
interest
by
a
union
that
have
issue
like
their
pay
well
down
its
list
of
concern
our
official
position
in
negotiate
with
the
driver
be
that
we
couldn
t
agree
to
the
teamster
demand
we
have
the
concern
of
several
constituency
to
think
about
we
have
to
think
about
customer
employee
include
the
driver
and
dollar
general
itself
there
be
a
huge
gap
between
what
we
as
a
company
base
in
scottsville
kentucky
could
pay
and
what
they
be
demand
it
would
upset
the
entire
cost
structure
of
the
company
the
whole
model
of
low
cost
retailing
that
give
low
everyday
price
to
the
customer
and
allow
us
to
succeed
in
the
first
place
be
in
jeopardy
raise
their
pay
and
benefit
that
much
would
lead
to
similar
demand
from
our
warehouse
worker
and
our
store
employee
we
view
fight
those
demand
as
something
we
have
to
do
give
the
election
result
there
be
nothing
we
could
do
about
the
driver
except
to
negotiate
but
we
could
certainly
work
on
the
warehouse
employee
we
brought
in
the
department
head
and
give
them
common
sense
talk
point
to
take
back
to
their
worker
we
have
a
direct
relationship
with
you
now
we
told
our
employee
through
them
the
union
be
a
third
party
any
promise
they
make
to
you
be
something
we
have
to
fulfill
so
they
re
not
really
in
a
position
to
make
those
promise
can
you
imagine
any
successful
marriage
that
invite
a
third
party
in
to
run
interference
can
you
imagine
that
make
for
well
communication
or
a
well
marriage
meanwhile
our
law
firm
go
into
high
gear
it
be
an
interest
dynamic
to
see
them
work
both
front
of
this
conflict
while
try
to
create
the
perception
that
those
be
separate
and
unrelated
endeavor
it
be
all
high
stake
gamesmanship
with
a
lot
of
grandstand
it
be
also
very
serious
the
lawyer
we
have
engage
in
the
election
campaign
say
we
re
not
go
to
lose
the
closest
i
ve
ever
come
to
lose
an
election
there
be
a
guy
in
charge
of
the
plant
who
be
really
like
by
everybody
he
be
in
charge
of
our
campaign
which
be
go
badly
he
have
a
new
car
and
we
told
him
it
be
go
to
be
smash
in
that
night
at
his
house
don
t
go
out
don
t
do
anything
we
told
him
just
drive
it
in
to
work
tomorrow
and
park
it
in
your
regular
parking
place
he
told
me
the
worker
be
so
incense
at
what
have
be
do
to
the
bos
s
car
that
they
vote
the
union
down
that
s
use
a
falsely
create
perception
to
help
you
win
a
union
election
and
to
my
mind
it
s
outside
the
rulebook
i
hat
to
think
of
a
law
firm
engage
in
that
kind
of
thing
and
fortunately
so
far
we
hadn
t
have
to
take
that
route
still
i
felt
really
bad
about
observe
the
union
negotiate
for
itself
and
not
for
employee
and
we
take
a
hard
line
particularly
in
regard
to
the
checkoff
system
whereby
all
employee
be
require
to
belong
to
the
union
and
the
company
would
be
automatically
collect
due
and
send
them
to
the
union
in
response
the
union
want
to
take
the
driver
out
on
strike
but
held
off
because
they
knew
a
strike
would
erode
their
support
among
the
warehouse
worker
they
knew
it
be
in
their
interest
to
wait
for
the
warehouse
vote
as
that
election
near
we
take
the
advice
of
our
law
firm
and
divide
paycheck
in
two
the
department
head
would
hand
out
check
that
represent
each
worker
s
pay
minus
what
he
or
she
would
be
pay
the
union
in
due
that
s
what
you
ll
take
home
if
you
vote
this
union
in
they
say
then
they
hand
out
the
check
that
represent
the
union
due
this
will
be
go
to
the
union
they
say
but
don
t
forget
it
be
really
your
pay
and
the
money
do
come
from
us
that
little
bit
of
drama
be
perfectly
legal
and
we
do
attempt
to
stay
inside
the
line
something
we
be
concerned
the
union
might
not
do
i
call
bill
coble
of
coble
system
a
transportation
company
in
nashville
bill
and
i
have
be
talk
for
a
long
time
about
a
truck
lease
deal
although
we
d
never
be
able
to
agree
on
a
price
besides
solve
our
teamster
problem
a
deal
with
coble
would
place
the
responsibility
for
truck
driver
fuel
and
insurance
with
someone
else
now
we
need
to
get
serious
about
our
negotiation
bill
told
me
he
d
talk
with
his
father
and
brother
and
his
department
head
and
get
back
to
me
i
found
out
later
that
his
department
head
consider
the
possible
danger
and
all
say
no
we
don
t
want
to
do
this
bill
like
challenge
but
he
still
hadn
t
make
up
his
mind
he
go
into
work
that
next
morning
and
told
his
secretary
cal
be
go
to
call
me
at
ten
let
me
know
when
he
s
on
the
phone
finally
he
decide
to
flip
a
coin
a
half
dollar
if
it
come
up
head
he
thought
i
m
go
to
tell
him
we
re
not
go
to
do
it
it
come
up
head
and
he
say

to
do
it
anyhow
bill

and
come
to
see

he
work

and
night
for
two
or
three
day
and
then
come
to
my
office
with
a
thick
proposal
he
sat
down
at
my
desk
and
start
talk
i
saw
him
look
over
my
shoulder
and
he
start
laugh
you
ve
see
my
sign
i
say
it
say
in
foot
high
letter
hasten
thy
story
i
told
him
i
d
take
the
proposal
home
and
meet
him
at
eight
o
clock
the
next
morning
it
take
some
negotiate
but
we
reach
an
agreement
it
be
far
more
lucrative
for
them
than
we
d
have
like
under
ordinary
circumstance
but
we
be
desperate
to
get
merchandise
to
our
store
and
his
company
be
ready
to
do
battle
we
won
the
election
in
the
warehouse
the
worker
vote
down
the
union
and
that
s
when
the
firework
start
the
teamster
call
a
strike
of
the
driver
and
set
up
a
picket
line
in
an
attempt
to
intimidate
the
warehouse
worker
that
shut
down
our
warehouse
and
since
the
only
one
we
have
be
in
scottsville
effectively
shut
down
the
company
some
people
cross
the
picket
line
braving
the
taunt
and
threat
of
the
striker
some
didn
t
one
who
do
be
toncie
towe
who
be
eighty
year
old
the
first
day
she
reach
the
line
one
of
the
picketers
told
her
to
turn
around
and
go
home
look
here
she
say
if
the
turner
be
nice
enough
to
give
an
old
lady
a
job
she
s
go
to
come
to
work
get
out
of
my
way
she
rev
her
motor
and
they
do
give
the
circumstance
we
go
ahead
with
our
plan
to
divest
the
company
of
its
in
house
transportation
dad
and
i
realize
that
in
the
long
run
outsource
be
go
to
be
the
way
to
handle
our
shipping
we
contact
the
icc
and
the
application
we
have
submit
year
earlier
become
our
emergency
authorization
to
bring
in
outside
contractor
the
situation
in
scottsville
get
more
and
more
tense
as
people
take
either
the
union
s
side
or
the
turner
we
have
a
brand
new
minister
at
the
methodist
church
and
i
remember
his
come
to
me
and
ask
about
the
company
and
the
strike
i
could
tell
by
his
question
that
he
hadn
t
decide
whether
he
be
go
to
side
with
the
driver
or
with
us
one
of
the
striker
say
at
one
point
that
the
problem
with
the
company
be
that
the
wrong
turner
boy
be
run
it
seven
year
young
than
i
be
steve
be
almost
of
a
different
generation
he
be
a
hail
fellow
well
met
kind
of
guy
someone
everyone
like
and
could
identify
with
i
be
the
straight
arrow
always
have
be
and
he
be
socially
inclined
with
quick
wit
and
the
gift
of
gab
i
think
part
of
it
be
that
he
take
on
that
kind
of
persona
in
order
to
be
his
own
person
as
that
be
true
to
his
nature
if
anything
i
may
have
be
too
serious
my
dad
be
what
he
d
always
be
sort
of
the
god
of
the
company
each
turner
son
form
his
company
image
relative
to
that
reality
sometimes
my
role
be
define
by
default
if
someone
work
for
steve
have
to
be
fire
i
would
sometimes
have
to
do
it
since
he
didn
t
want
to
any
more
than
my
dad
do
it
seem
at
time
i
be
the
only
turner
who
fire
anybody
it
be
a
skill
i
learn
on
the
job
although
it
be
never
something
i
relish
i
once
try
to
fire
somebody
and
just
couldn
t
bring
myself
to
do
it
on
the
first
attempt
he
come
to
work
the
next
day
and
i
have
to
do
it
again
i
call
him
back
in
and
i
say
you
know
yesterday
i
intend
to
fire
you
but
i
just
couldn
t
do
it
so
that
s
what
i
m
do
today
go
back
to
my
day
in
the
military
and
perhaps
before
i
have
a
tendency
to
be
too
rigid
but
that
s
not
the
same
as
be
decisive
and
clearly
this
be
a
time
for
decisiveness
we
have
to
get
our
merchandise
move
we
have
arrange

to
bed
one
saturday
night
after
take
some
cold
medicine
and
around
a
m
i
woke
to
a
couple
of
loud
retort
i
remember
think
that
sound
like
gunshot
but
i
be
groggy
and
go
back
to
sleep
the
next
afternoon
calister
and
i
be
at
a
friend
s
home
and
i
get
a
call
from
margaret
who
have
go
into
the
living
room
and
found
bullet
hole
in
our
front
door
we
call
the
police
and
they
come
to
investigate
about
a
week
later
steve
come
into
my
office
to
tell
our
father
and
me
that
a
manufacturer
s
rep
say
his
secretary
have
heard
that
there
be
a
kidnapping
contract
on
five
year
old
calister
it
be
an
unbelievably
frighten
thing
for
us
to
hear
we
immediately
make
provision
for
wackenhut
to
provide
an
arm
guard
to
be
near
my
son
twenty
four
hour
a
day
oddly
enough
as
worried
as
we
be
it
be
great
for
calister
because
he
have
somebody
he
could
play
with
someone
on
whose
shoulder
he
could
ride
he
actually
enjoy
it
our
newspaper
carrier
wasn
t
nearly
as
enthusiastic
he
would
drive
down
our
street
and
pull
far
enough
into
the
drive
that
he
could
toss
the
louisville
courier
journal
close
to
the
door
then
turn
around
and
drive
off
he
drove
up
one
morning
only
to
have
two
wackenhut
guard
emerge
from
the
bush
and
accost
him
mr
turner
he
say
in
the
note
he
left
with
the
newspaper
that
morning
i
will
not
be
deliver
your
paper
again
until
the
strike
be
over
for
a
few
night
we
slept
in
the
basement
of
my
parent
home
it
be
concrete
so
it
be
the
safest
place
available
to
us
not
long
afterward
one
of
our
executive
who
have
be
through
situation
like
this
elsewhere
urge
us
to
up
the
ante
cal
jr
he
say
to
me
one
day
you
re
play
by
the
rule
and
it
isn
t
work
you
re
lose
they
ve
shot
into
your
home
there
s
a
kidnapping
contract
on
calister
they
ve
shot
into
employee
home
and
bash
in
store
window
it
s
time
for
us
to
show
them
that
they
can
bleed
too
this
doesn
t
need
to
be
trace
to
you
all
you
have
to
do
be
blink
your
eye
and
i
ll
take
care
of
it
i
can
tell
you
that
you
don
t
really
understand
temptation
until
you
experience
it
like
this
i
knew
it
would
be
wrong
to
go
down
that
road
but
i
don
t
want
to
claim
that
it
be
pure
virtue
that
make
me
tell
him
no
i
knew
what
be
right
but
i
also
knew
what
be
practical
say
yes
would
make
a
bad
situation
bad
any
violence
to
come
shouldn
t
be
come
from
our
side
i
m
tell
you
specifically
that
we
be
not
go
to
do
that
i
say
i
don
t
want
you
to
think
you
saw
me
nod
or
blink
we
re
not
do
it
as
it
be
there
be
probably
as
much
tension
in
that
little
town
of
as
there
have
ever
be
or
would
ever
be
again
there
be
four
time
as
many
wackenhut
guard
in
scottsville
as
there
be
city
policeman
the
atmosphere
be
just
awful
and
to
this
day
i
be
security
conscious
with
a
part
of
me
fully
in
tune
with
the
mob
type
who
sit
with
their
back
to
the
wall
always
aware
of
who
be
come
and
go
scottsville
s
size
also
meant
that
interconnection
be
many
and
interest
at
one
point
after
a
session
in
which
one
of
our
lawyer
joe
bill
campbell
have
counsel
our
witness
in
preparation
for
a
hearing
about
an
injunction
related
to
the
strike
steve
joe
bill
and
i
be
talk
joe
bill
i
say
do
you
have
any
advice
for
steve
or
me
no
he
say
then
he
pause
for
a
moment
oh
just
one
thing
please
don
t
refer
to
the
judge
as
uncle
frank
uncle
frank
goad
my
mother
s
brother
be
by
then
the
circuit
judge
and
he
saw
no
reason
to
recuse
himself
he
do
handle
himself
well
during
one
hearing
he
say
well
everybody
s
here
union
management
we
re
all
in
the
room
we
have
just
have
a
bomb
threat
but
nobody
s
go
to
leave
this
room
for
the
next
two
hour
we
re
go
to
stay
right
here
which
be
what
we
do
somehow
amid
all
of
this
you
could
sense
the
tide
begin
to
shift
from
the
teamster
toward
the
turner
maybe
it
be
that
the
percentage
of
townspeople
who
d
join
the
union
be
so
small
maybe
it
be
all
the
mischief
that
have
go
on
in
any
case
opinion
be
move
our
way
and
i
m
convince
that
turn
down
our
executive
s
offer
be
the
wise
thing
i
could
have
do
if
i
have
give
him
the
go
ahead
it
would
really
have
exacerbate
an
already
explosive
situation
ruling
start
come
our
way
as
well
the
nlrb
which
i
felt
be
prejudice
in
favor
of
union
nevertheless
rule
against
the
teamster
then
a
court
rule
in
a
lawsuit
file
by
the
union
that
the
company
be
within
its
right
to
employ
outsider
to
do
its
haul
because
it
have
apply
for
authority
to
do
so
long
before
the
strike
there
be
no
apparent
connection
between
the
union
s
organization
drive
and
the
company
s
application
for
outside
transportation
in
the
face
of
those
ruling
and
amid
unusually
cold
october
weather
the
picket
stop
those
in
house
trucking
job
be
go
for
good
that
be
one
of
the
saddest
part
of
the
situation
the
people
who
d
lose
those
job
be
from
scottsville
and
allen
county
a
lot
of
them
have
be
good
company
men
some
of
them
eventually
start
speak
to
me
again
but
some
never
do
i
hat
it
this
be
a
company
that
have
be
like
family
in
a
town
that
support
worker
and
management
alike
we
still
hand
out
bonus
and
box
of
candy
to
each
warehouse
employee
at
our
annual
christmas
party
yet
the
strike
have
inject
a
dose
of
harsh
reality
into
all
of
it
coble
handle
our
trucking
for
many
year
through
expansion
into
other
warehouse
around
the
south
as
the
company
enter
yet
another
growth
phase
we
never
again
have
in
house
transportation
as
sort
of
a
postscript
five
or
six
year
later
an
agent
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearm
be
in
my
office
he
say
oh
by
the
way
i
heard
your
name
mention
in
the
pen
last
week
what
do
you
mean
i
say
well
i
be
talk
with
the
inmate
who
have
the
contract
to
kidnap
your
son
cold
fear
go
all
over
me
i
have
do
what
have
to
be
do
in
order
to
protect
young
calister
but
the
fact
that
somebody
be
actually
planning
to
kidnap
him
didn
t
sink
in
until
that
moment
i
have
always
be
somewhat
na
ve
and
have
even
cherished
that
na
vet
but
this
as
the
last
bit
of
fallout
from
a
traumatic
time
in
company
history
show
me
how
the
real
world
can
shatter
rise
color
glass

expansion
break
the
commandment
i
become
company
president
in
and
the
conversation
that
kick
off
the
process
like
the
one
that
follow
that
card
game
blowup
year
earlier
take
place
through
a
close
door
as
my
dad
sat
on
the
john
sometimes
it
be
easy
for
us
to
reveal
what
we
be
really
think
when
we
couldn
t
see
each
other
son
he
say
i
have
decide
it
s
time
for
you
to
become
president
so
i
can
be
chairman
for
a
long
time
i
knew
he
be
refer
to
his
age
his
attitude
be
that
although
i
could
run
the
company
forever
as
executive
vice
president
maybe
it
be
time
to
change
title
and
let
him
wear
chairman
a
new
position
for
us
from
here
on
out
he
be
make
it
sound
as
if
he
be
do
it
for
himself
when
we
both
knew
he
be
do
it
for
me
so
i
want
you
and
rod
wenz
who
be
still
run
our
public
relation
from
louisville
to
decide
the
right
time
to
do
it
he
say
okay
the
idea
just
sat
there
until
three
month
later
when
an
editor
for
fortune
name
eleanor
tracy
come
to
scottsville
with
an
assistant
and
a
photographer
to

a
story
for
the
magazine
my
dad
and
i
along
with

and
a
couple
of
other

manager
take
her
outside

most
perplexed
expression
on
her
face

this
article
be
about
well
she
say
i
heard
from
rod
wenz
that
you

from
people
magazine
call
and
say
we
ll
do
a
story
on
mr
turner
if
you
ll
tell
us
how
much
he

much
he

worth
now
that
he
be
we
decline
i
go
from
executive
vice
president
to
president
and
my
dad
go
from
president
to
chairman
not
long
afterward
a
reporter
for
the
louisville
time
ask
who
be
now
ceo
i
say
i
be
until
my
dad
decides
he
want
to
be
for
a
while
and
then
he
be
until
he
get
tire
of
it
then
i
pick
it
back
up
again
it
be
just
the
kind
of
truth
a
newspaper
doesn
t
know
what
to
do
with
so
it
didn
t
make
the
story
at
first
the
word
president
kind
of
caught
in
my
throat
it
scar
me
i
have
move
from
bos
s
son
to
the
leader
officially
responsible
for
the
future
of
a
company
the
challenge
and
opportunity
come
hard
and
fast
i
take
a
look
at
thing
like
our
long
stand
practice
of
self
insure
we
dealt
with
the
occasional
fire
or
flood
ourselves
but
by
now
we
be
big
enough
and
complex
enough
that
it
might
not
be
possible
to
operate
ourselves
out
of
an
insurance
problem
particularly
if
thing
go
wrong
in
several
place
at
once
meanwhile
as
the
number
of
store
grow
the
cost
of
commercial
insurance
per
store
fell
we
take
bid
and
realize
it
finally
make
more
sense
to
buy
insurance
with
high
deductible
then
there
be
acquisition
opportunity
we
be
conservative
about
such
thing
or
so
we
thought
in
those
day
we
have
what
amount
to
a
handful
of
company
commandment
thou
shalt
not
acquire
sick
company
thou
shalt
not
own
a
company
plane
thou
shalt
not
deal
with
a
new
york
or
chicago
bank
thou
shalt
not
have
more
than
one
warehouse
we
be
about
to
break
every
one
of
them
we
resist
acquisition
because
it
be
easy
to
open
and
profit
from
our
own
store
than
to
convert
other
store
to
our
system
but
our
principle
be
about
to
come
face
to
face
with
back
to
back
opportunity
that
would
test
them
as
never
before
each
be
large
than
any
previous
purchase
we
d
undertaken
the
first
come
when
united
dollar
store
a
duma
arkansas
retailer
file
under
chapter
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
november
just
as
our
strike
be
end
along
with
store
mostly
in
arkansas
louisiana
and
mississippi
uds
have
among
its
asset
a
square
foot
warehouse
in
duma
and
a
company
plane
we
talk
to
their
principal
creditor
a
bank
in
chicago
which
agree
to
finance
the
deal
at
prime
rate
even
so
we
wouldn
t
have
seriously
consider
the
acquisition
if
our
large
franchisee
the
rankin
co
hadn

gotten
into
a
tight
spot
financially
rankin
base
in
columbia
mississippi
consist
of
franchise
store
own
by
three
partner
who
paid
us
a
franchise
fee
and
store
it
own
jointly
with
us
geographically
uds
and
rankin
overlap
quite
nicely
and
the
uds
warehouse
sat
just
about
in
the
middle
take
together
it
all
make
sense
we
bought
rankin
with
long
term
note
put
no
money
down
uds
have
a
book
value
of
million
and
we
paid
million
for
all
but
the
warehouse
which
we
be
nevertheless
able
to
use
rent
free
until
the
merchandise
inside
which
we
have
bought
be
go
then
we
turn
around
and
conduct
a
bankruptcy
sale
we
gross
million
and
incur
expense
of
our
total
investment
for
store
be
since
we
have
greatly
expand
our
area
we
decide
to
keep
the
plane
finally
a
year
later
we
purchase
the
warehouse
for
million
or
a
square
foot
we
knew
what
have
happen
to
both
company
uds
have
once
operate
a
successful
dollar
store
chain
but
have
move
away
from
that
core
business
opening
discount
store
that
charge
a
membership
fee
rankin
have
raise
price
and
reduce
inventory
to
counteract
high
transportation
and
administration
expense
and
have
see
its
retail
sale
decline
their
experience
make
us
even
more
determine
to
stick
with
our
simple
conservative
business
concept
which
we
thought
would
restore
both
to
profitability
still
we
recognize
quickly
after
the
acquisition
of
uds
and
rankin
that
we
didn
t
have
the
executive
staff
or
the
battle
plan
to
oversee
the
vastly
big
company
we
have
become
we
have
go
from
company
own
store
serve
by
square
foot
of
warehouse
space
to
store
serve
by
warehouse
total
more
than
square
foot
we
have
a
small
management
team
with
plenty
of
rough
edge
and
it
take
us
two
year
to
absorb
the
purchase
as
all
of
this
unfolded
so
early
in
my
presidency
a
thought
hit
me
oh
my
gosh
i
need
more
training
it
have
be
nearly
a
decade
since
i
d
take
the
ama
s
management
course
but
i
knew
it
be
time
to
tap
into
their
expertise
again
their
management
course
for
president
seem
ideal
and
i
sign
up
early
in
i
go
to
hamilton
new
york
and
over
the
course
of
a
week
learn
the
basic
of
strategic
planning
a
formal
process
by
which
a
senior
management
team
determines
where
an
organization
be
go
and
how
it
s
go
to
get
there
settle
on
the
company
s
mission
strategy
and
objective
if
do
well
the
process
empowers
team
success
the
implementation
of
strategic
planning
at
dollar
general
would
eventually
change
the
way
we
operate
its
principle
would
guide
the
process
that
lead
to
our
big
breakthrough
as
a
company
in
though
it
be
just
a
great
idea
something
i
knew
could
be
useful
for
us
and
something
i
knew
would
fail
unless
i
could
get
my
father
on
board
i
need
his
endorsement
i
thought
i
have
to
get
his
attention
and
when
a
farmer
have
to
get
the
attention
of
a
mule
sometimes
the
best
way
to
do
that
be
with
a
plank
so
i
come
home
after
that
training
meeting
walk
into
my
dad
s
office
shut
the
door
and
sat
down
wait
for
him
to
get
off
the
telephone
when
he
do
i
say
daddy
we
have
a
decision
to
make
what
s
that
son
he
ask
me
whether
to
do
strategic
planning
now
or
wait
until
you
re
dead
what
be
strategic
planning
he
say
look
startle
i
knew
at
that
moment
i
have
his
attention
it
s
a
process
where
we
open
this
company
up
to
non
turner
and
talk
honestly
about
strength
and
weakness
and
opportunity
and
threat
and
we
decide
about
our
mission
and
our
objective
it
get
everyone
on
the
same
page
and
help
everybody
pull
together
so
we
can
really
develop
the
company
there
be
silence
for
a
long
moment
and
he
say
well
son
i
know
that
the
way
i
ve
always
run
the
company
be
not
right
for
the
future
i
do
not
know
what
the
right
way
be
but
i
respect
you
and
your
ability
to
figure
that
out
mind
you
i
m
still
go
to
get
on
my
stump
from
time
to
time
well
daddy
i
know
that
some
thing
be
a
give
he
say
now
i
will
say
this
to
you
i
hope
you
won
t
create
plan
planner
but
will
have
plan
doer
again
i
have
underestimated
my
father
the
old
boy
understood
the
gut
of
thing
very
well
i
always
knew
that
my
dad
be
wonderful
and
he
have
just
let
go
of
something
very
big
his
hold
on
the
right
to
manage
the
process
that
determine
the
company
s
direction
that
moment
set
in
motion
a
profound
change
in
dollar
general
in
the
fall
of
a
few
month
after
i
d
go
through
the
management
course
for
president
i
go
with
ten
other
dollar
general
executive
back
to
hamilton
new
york
to
undertake
the
ama
s
strategic
planning
process
we
need
to
push
strategic
planning
into
the
culture
of
our
company
and
that
have
to
be
do
through
senior
management
these
session
be
design
to
get
everyone
on
board
the
dg
executive
i
often
refer
to
as
our
renegade
redneck
and
i
be
assign
to
larry
appley
s
prot
g
hank
pattison
one
of
the
ama
s
best
planning
coordinator
he
begin
to
lead
us
through
the
process
of
come
up
with
the
plan
we
would
all
implement
when
we
get
back
to
scottsville
i
remember
hank
s
eye
swim
around
as
he
dealt
with
us
it
be
quickly
obvious
why
they
put
their
best
facilitator
with
the
dollar
general
group
we
be
a
curious
amalgam
of
human
talent
from
an
entrepreneurial
company
where
there
be
no
budget
and
no
real
planning
in
fact
i
m
pretty
sure
there
s
never
be
another
company
that
s
go
into
strategic
planning
before
it
s
do
budgeting
early
on
hank
take
advantage
of
our
lack
of
knowledge
about
our
own
company
who
be
your
customer
he
ask
to
laughter
from
this
motley
group
okay
he
say
as
the
snicker
subside
just
tolerate
me
here
i
want
everybody
to
write
down
without
talk
to
each
other
about
it
just
who
your
customer
be
we
do
and
he
collect
the
piece
of
paper
then
he
write
our
answer
one
after
the
other
on
the
board
at
the
front
of
the
room
they
be
all
over
the
place
so
we
don
t
have
agreement
here
he
say
let
s
try
it
again
what
business
be
you
in
there
be
laughter
again
but
this
time
it
be
much
more
subdue
he
do
the
same
thing
with
those
answer
and
get
the
same
result
so
you
re
unclear
about
the
nature
of
your
business
he
say
after
a
couple
more
of
those
it
be
obvious
that
what
have
look
like
a
team
may
well
have
be
pull
in
different
direction
because
we
hadn
t
share
a
single
and
well
articulate
vision
at
that
point
we
be
chasten
and
ready
for
him
to
lead
us
in
a
discussion
of
exactly
what
we
be
bring
to
whom
and
why
we
spent
most
of
those
first
session
two
set
of
them
about
a
month
apart
focus
on
question
that
basic
we
define
our
customer
as
deserve
salt
of
the
earth
people
struggle
to
make
end
meet
that
definition
help
us
to
come
up
with
our
first
mission
statement
to
serve
well
than
anyone
else
do
our
customer
s
need
for
quality
basic
merchandise
at
everyday
low
price
the
so
what
of
a
mission
statement
be
in
light
of
that
in
what
direction
should
we
move
that
give
you
your
strategy
get
more
specific
about
strategic
objective
give
you
operating
objective
and
operational
action
plan
that
s
the
process
we
begin
in
hamilton
although
in
actuality
we
be
off
and
run
with
our
immature
version
of
a
mission
statement
our
first
order
of
business
be
to
establish
clear
communication
about
where
we
be
presently
i
have
be
study
the
business
and
my
father
and
have
consider
myself
pretty
well
up
to
speed
now
it
be
time
to
pull
the
other
executive
into
that
and
see
where
we
stood
in
their
eye
i
have
begin
to
set
the
tone
with
my
acknowledgment
that
as
the
bos
s
son
i
be
in
over
my
head
and
need
their
help
i
need
your
honesty
about
our
strength
and
weakness
i
say
at
one
of
our
early
strategic
planning
session
i
want
your
idea
about
what
we
can
most
effectively
do
next
i
want
to
let
them
know
too
that
this
be
a
team
effort
in
every
sense
include
financial
the
success
we
have
i
say
will
be
share
with
everybody
they
knew
i
be
be
sincere
and
they
felt
empower
to
be
honest
there
be
any
number
of
specific
recommendation
but
before
long
they
go
straight
to
what
they
saw
as
a
fundamental
problem
in
our
business
ron
humphrys
one
of
our
buyer
be
the
person
who
nail
the
truth
for
us
well
cal
jr
he
say
i
ll
tell
you
what
s
wrong
with
the
company
it
s
the
way
you
and
your
father
quote
your
grandfather
if
it
s
bought
right
it
s
half
sell
yes
i
say
so
what
s
wrong
with
that
so
look
at
all
this
half
sell
inventory
we
be
stuck
with
we
need
to
think
about
the
other
half
the
sell
part
what
the
customer
want
we
push
your
dad
s
big
deal
out
to
the
store
and
a
lot
of
time
they
just
sit
there
if
we
re
go
to
have
this
business
grow
we
re
go
to
have
to
stock
what
the
customer
want
so
that
they
come
in
more
often
and
we
can
serve
them
well
we
now
have
buyer
push
what
we
need
be
customer
pull
my
dad
s
buying
habit
be
one
of
the
thing
that
set
us
apart
by
and
large
the
other
retailer
study
and
copy
one
another
that
s
why
you
could
probably
go
into
any
department
store
and
find
pretty
much
what
be
in
every
other
you
still
can
they
advertise
the
heck
out
of
be
like
one
another
then
try
to
put
just
a
bit
more
style
a
bit
more
froufrou
into
the
presentation
hop
to
woo
you
to
this
one
instead
of
that
one
that
froufrou
also
allows
them
to
mark
thing
up
a
little
high
get
more
from
shopper
for
the
same
merchandise
that
be
perhaps
a
good
retailing
example
of
what
happens
when
you
pay
more
attention
to
the
competition
than
to
the
customer
we
be
different
we
avoid
froufrou
we
knew
it
be
harder
to
convince
the
customer
she
s
get
a
bargain
if
she
see
carpeting
and
a
boutique
set
that
s
part
of
why
our
furnishing
be
so
sparse
what
be
the
best
buy
we
can
find
and
pas
along
to
our
customer
be
my
dad
s
bottom
line
we
reason
that
lower
the
price
would
bring
more
customer
in
the
door
it
be
an
opportunistic
business
run
by
a
founder
who
be
a
true
entrepreneur
we
never
worried
about
whether
we
be
in
stock
on
anything
except
shoe
where
you
have
to
keep
up
with
a
lot
of
size
we
be
simply
try
to
empty
the
warehouse
of
what
my
dad
have
overbought
and
spread
it
among
the
store
which
have
to
be
happy
with
what
they
get
it
s
like
christmas
be
how
my
dad
look
at
it
you
don
t
know
what
you
be
get
until
you
open
the
package
now
sell
it
in
one
sense
it
be
work
it
may
not
have
make
us
recession
proof
but
the
downturn
of
kick
off
in
part
by
the
quadruple
of
oil
price
have
proven
we
be
at
least
recession
resistant
tough
time
make
people
more
cost
conscious
and
they
found
their
way
to
us
the
recession
meant
that
manufacturer
have
merchandise
pile
up
because
few
people
be
buying
we
d
buy
it
at
bargain
price
we
d
pay
apiece
for
irregular
shirt
that
others
be

and
sell
them
at
or
two
for
we
d
buy
gray
velour
sport
jacket
for
and
sell
them
for
as
compare
to
their
sell
price
in
department
store
with
the
manufacturer
ask
only
that
we
not
advertise
them
by
brand
name
we
be
still
get
irregular
from
blue
bell
and
from
many
other
quality
manufacturer
of
blouse
sweatshirt
and
infant
wear
and
we
be
buying
lot
of
closeout
all
in
all
it
be
a
unique
niche
and
it
help
explain
why
wall
street
have
a
hard
time
classify
us
now
that
model
be
face
real
pushback
our
own
people
be
tell
us
that
the
stuff
we
be
buying
and
push
out
to
the
store
wasn
t
always
stuff
for
which
our
customer
be
hungry
we
could
be
do
much
well
we
take
a
look
at
it
strictly
from
our
customer
point
of
view
they
be
the
same
as
they
d
be
since
the
begin
they
didn
t
have
much
money
and
they
need
a
retailer
who
could
help
them
make
what
they
do
have
go
far
to
make
our
approach
truly
customer
driven
we
be
go
to
have
to
do
that
not
just
with
great
buy
but
also
with
the
thing
they
need
day
to
day
we
would
call
those
thing
core
item
and
keep
them
in
stock
at
all
time
it
be
really
that
simple
as
the
best
idea
often
be
it
s
amaze
in
one
sense
that
it
didn
t
occur
to
us
until
nevertheless
it
be
an
insight
that
give
us
the
single
great
growth
opportunity
we
d
ever
have
it
would
drive
the
company
s
success
for
a
quarter
century
and
create
a
dynamic
growth
sector
for
retailing
the
process
of
strategic
planning
lead
us
to
undertake
a
degree
change
in
our
business
model
over
the
course
of
several
year
as
we
go
from
a
turner
buyer
push
to
our
struggle
customer
pull
upon
us
our
system
have
be
overturn
completely
as
desirable
as
i
thought
that
be
it
be
scary
for
my
dad
and
for
me
the
trick
be
that
this
new
model
be
go
to
require
us
to
develop
strength
we
have
never
even
aspire
to
have
at
the
time
cal
sr
bought
if
the
price
be
right
he
bought
all
they
have
and
have
it
ship
to
the
warehouse
distribution
amount
to
apply
a
warehouse
enema
that
unloaded
whatever
he
d
bought
into
the
store
we
d
ship
them
more
than
they
want
of
whatever
it
be
because
we
need
them
to
take
it
off
our
hand
when
that
wasn
t
enough
we
have
to
open
more
store
because
we
always
have
too
much
inventory
and
we
need
more
place
to
sell
it
now
we
be
go
to
keep
store
fill
with
thing
customer
actually
need
and
want
but
to
stay
in
stock
on
an
item
you
have
to
keep
track
of
how
many
you
re
sell
and
how
many
you
have
you
have
to
know
which
store
need
which
merchandise
that
mean
technology
it
call
for
logistics
and
distribution
expertise
we
have
none
of
that
we
have
to
figure
out
a
road
map
for
change
and
decide
who
in
our
management
team
be
go
to
do
what
we
knew
that
the
task
that
lay
before
us
be
enormous
for
all
the
training
we
d
receive
and
for
all
the
enthusiasm
we
brought
to
the
task
we
didn
t
have
the
wherewithal
to
undertake
strategic
planning
the
ama
way
but
that
be
actually
a
good
thing
if
we
d
go
into
it
with
all
the
structure
and
sophistication
they
recommend
we
would
not
have
be
nearly
as
successful
as
we
be
we
d
have
be
overwhelmed
by
detail
and
bury
under
report
i
think
that
s
what
my
dad
meant
by
plan
do
and
not
plan
planning
his
approach
be
to
take
the
action
and
observe
what
work
give
yourself
some
latitude
to
make
mistake
along
the
way
that
be
creative
learn
which
undertaken
in
response
to
mistake
be
a
very
powerful
tool
it
s
something
that
would
serve
us
well
as
we
move
from
my
father
s
autocratic
style
to
the
more
broadly
base
planning
in
which
everyone
have
a
stake
it
be
our
way
of
dollar
generalize
strategic
planning
let
it
resonate
with
our
people
and
our
culture
i
come
into
an
entrepreneurial
objective
driven
organization
one
built
on
measurable
short
term
performance
target
how
much
be
we
sell
per
store
i
spent
from
to
try
to
transform
it
into
a
mission
driven
entity
what
be
our
purpose
here
it
s
more
about
know
that
say
at
bottom
you
be
provide
low
cost
basic
to
struggle
people
management
by
objective
although
important
be
not
my
first
priority
result
would
come
as
the
result
of
a
unify
vision
with
a
clear
long
term
goal
an
organization
can
get
stymie
if
it
operates
on
nothing
more
than
command
bark
from
the
top
i
be
interested
in
the
people
side
of
get
thing
do
i
want
heart
not
just
brain
brain
can
set
objective
and
yet
performance
just
might
be
limited
to
those
objective
heart
can
empower
my
first
teacher
be
my
dad
who
didn
t
actually
manage
with
the
concept
of
mission
but
who
carry
it
deep
inside
himself
although
he
couldn
t
verbalize
or
teach
it
my
job
be
to
take
what
be
inside
him
and
make
it
work
for
us
as
we
expand
application
would
be
the
key
a
preacher
may
discus
the
purpose
driven
life
but
the
concept
have
to
be
apply
one
day
at
a
time
to
one
person
at
a
time
in
his
or
her
specific
situation
to
do
that
you
develop
process
that
work
to
some
degree
and
then
you
keep
tweak
them
do
well
it
can
become
the
underpin
of
good
leadership
my
take
on
leadership
played
out
in
real
time
in
the
store
as
do
my
dad
s
and
it
be
interest
to
see
the
way
they
intersect
i
remember
visit
a
store
once
with
margaret
and
our
teenage
son
cal
remain
stand
near
the
front
as
margaret
and
i
walk
toward
the
back
and
he
overheard
one
employee
say
to
another
do
you
know
who
that
be
apparently
the
other
didn
t
because
the
first
say
that
s
mr
turner
the
other
employee
cringed
and
the
first
say
don
t
worry
this
isn
t
the
bad
one
my
dad
be
tough
he
be
the
bos
i
d
try
to
be
a
nice
guy
emphasize
teamwork
and
camaraderie
when
my
son
told
me
what
he
d
overheard
i
felt
bad
about
this
evidence
of
the
downside
of
my
dad
s
leadership
style
and
thought
perhaps
my
leadership
style
be
more
effective
that
last
until
a
visit
to
another
store
where
i
met
one
of
its
employee
for
the
first
time
mr
turner
she
say
i
m
so
pleased
to
meet
you
at
last
i
be
told
what
it
would
be
like
what
be
you
told
i
ask
her
i
be
told
that
you
would
only
say
good
thing
you
d
be
a
nice
person
very
likable
and
we
d
have
a
good
visit
while
you
be
here
then
we
would
only
know
what
you
really
thought
the
next
day
when
the
district
manager
come
in
and
the
shit
hit
the
fan
my
dad
s
style
be
to
low
the
boom
on
the
spot
sam
he
would
say
why
be
those
towel
displayed
like
that
well
mr
turner
they
say
do
it
that
way
that
would
get
all
over
my
dad
time
out
sam
he
would
say
his
voice
boom
you
be
now
talk
to
they
now
let
me
tell
you
what
they
say
they
say
display
the
towel
this
way
and
he
would
reposition
them
the
way
he
thought
best
he
go
in
with
answer
with
directive
and
his
checklist
of
thing
to
be
do
and
when
they
d
be
do
wrong
he
say
something
he
always
saw
thing
from
the
customer
perspective
he
want
men
s
pajama
up
on
easily
reachable
shelf
where
old
customer
could
get
at
them
when
a
man
go
to
the
hospital
he
reason
his
wife
be
go
to
buy
him
some
pajama
and
if
he
s
an
old
man
she
ll
also
be
old
and
she
shouldn
t
have
to
stoop
too
low
to
reach
them
he
want
our
piece
good
our
sew
material
up
high
as
well
as
he
consider
it
more
likely
to
be
old
woman
who
be
still
sew
i
would
go
in
with
question
what
s
sell
what
s
not
how
be
our
work
go
how
can
we
make
it
simpler
and
easy
for
everyone
to
serve
our
customer
well
i
be
like
that
throughout
my
year
with
the
company
i
always
felt
that
i
be
learn
my
job
in
visit
the
store
be
to
create
a
culture
that
allow
me
to
get
at
the
real
truth
and
leave
people
feel
good
about
our
company
then
i
need
to
position
the
right
person
to
act
on
any
problem
in
part
it
be
a
demonstration
of
leadership
from
ignorance
since
i
didn
t
know
how
to
straighten
out
a
store
that
cal
jr
seem
like
a
nice
guy
they
would
think
when
i
d
left
i
wonder
what
he
s
really
like
they
may
have
thought
i
be
a
closet
sob
with
my
dad
they
knew
exactly
where
they
stood
in
real
time
my
approach
though
i
consider
to
be
well
for
our
large
company
because
it
stuck
with
the
chain
of
command
a
ceo
should
not
come
in
and
straighten
out
a
store
my
dad
could
create
problem
for
the
company
because
the
store
manager
would
say
to
the
district
manager
mr
turner
say
to
do
it
this
way
when
that
happens
the
district
manager
have
be
blindside
he
can
t
say
no
don
t
pay
attention
to
him
it
be
the
district
manager
s
job
to
raise
cain
if
thing
be
wrong
not
the
ceo
s
i
often
wonder
if
the
people
in
the
store
really
get
it
after
my
dad
left
what
they
get
from
him
wasn
t
even
principle
it
be
rule
i
d
often
stop
in
store
later
and
see
where
they
d
take
one
of
those
rule
too
far
and
i
could
see
that
if
they
d
simply
put
a
bit
of
their
own
common
sense
into
it
they
would
have
thought
yeah
that
s
what
he
say
but
there
s
no
sense
take
it
to
an
extreme
they
didn
t
get
that
far
in
part
because
our
leadership
be
still
in
the
form
of
bossism
there
be
law
there
be
a
lawgiver
and
the
most
important
thing
be
not
to
make
him
angry
so
you
do
what
he
say
even
if
do
so
create
its
own
problem
my
dad
s
main
concern
and
mine
be
the
same
to
see
that
our
store
be
serve
our
customer
well
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
be
there
to
support
the
store
and
area
manager
not
confuse
them
or
interfere
with
their
work
i
go
in
with
the
interpersonal
style
of
my
mother
who
believe
you
caught
more
fly
with
honey
than
with
vinegar
i
want
to
listen
to
their
opinion
and
motivate
them
to
be
creative
in
solve
problem
it
be
the
opposite
of
the
heavy
hand
approach
of
old
school
retail
operator
i
really
believe
that
underneath
it
all
my
father
fundamentally
agree
with
my
approach
but
be
too
impatient
to
use
it
when
he
spot
something
that
need
a
quick
fix
which
be
always
the
truth
be
that
our
company
need
a
bit
of
both
management
style
sometimes
problem
require
a
hit
the
mule
hard
on
the
head
style
of
management
although
that
situation
usually
arose
because
the
laura
katherine
turner
honey
over
vinegar
management
style
hadn
t
be
employ
soon
enough
ultimately
we
need
employee
invest
in
the
betterment
of
the
store
in
its
mission
and
its
smooth
operation
we
need
people
who
care
enough
about
dollar
general
to
bring
their
best
thought
their
best
common
sense
to
the
task
you
want
them
to
be
thoughtful
enough
and
empower
enough
that
the
shelf
be
stock
correctly
before
you
get
there
you
need
a
good
merchandising
plan
that
get
your
employee
think
about
your
customer
and
you
need
clear
instruction
and
clear
standard
you
want
to
involve
everybody
in
how
can
we
do
it
well
rather
than
involve
one
employee
at
a
time
in
how
can
we
fix
this
mess
on
the
surface
what
we
do
as
a
company
remain
the
same
throughout
that
twenty
year
period
we
operate
retail
store
sell
merchandise
at
low
price
which
meant
we
have
to
control
overhead
coordinate
shipping
and
do
all
the
other
thing
that
go
with
the
retail
business
but
we
have
to
talk
about
how
those
element
could
come
together
in
a
way
that
have
the
inspiration
of
mission
do
that
would
take
the
company
to
another
level
we
have
to
transform
dollar
general
fortunately
the
same
thing
that
give
us
the
ability
to
revolutionize
our
approach
strategic
planning
would
give
us
the
day
to
day
tool
to
carry
it
out
my
dad
have
come
to
realize
that
his
management
style
alone
be
no
longer
right
for
our
future
and
he
and
i
agree
that
we
would
go
forward
with
strategic
planning
to
develop
both
the
company
and
its
leader
we
would
bring
good
people
in
develop
them
to
their
full
potential
and
get
where
we
be
go
together
it
be
my
job
to
lead
the
necessary
transition
after
we
d
refine
our
definition
of
core
merchandise
we
work
to
establish
the
discipline
necessary
to
stay
in
stock
on
those
item
while
still
look
for
opportunistic
buy
we
be
schizophrenic
in
a
way
with
two
separate
business
approach
yes
we
be
focus
on
basic
good
apparel
shoe
and
health
and
beauty
aid
but
we
be
also
court
serendipity
scour
the
marketplace
for
bargain
we
could
push
through
to
customer
the
former
be
the
new
path
i
want
us
to
continue
to
blaze
the
latter
be
the
update
of
my
dad
s
entrepreneurial
opportunism
which
be
still
a
big
part
of
the
business
both
be
part
of
who
we
be
well
into
the
eighty
in
either
case
we
have
learn
that
price
trumped
everything
once
a
certain
quality
threshold
be
pass
our
customer
would
always
buy
the
cheaper
of
two
item
even
if
the
high
price
item
do
offer
some
incrementally
high
quality
we
reason
that
if
we
offer
low
price
basic
every
day
our
customer
would
do
our
advertising
by
word
of
mouth
after
all
we
be
in
small
community
and
neighborhood
word
would
get
around
it
wasn
t
go
to
take
merchandising
genius
just
the
fundamental
of
common
sense
our
projection
about
growth
in
same
store
and
new
store
sale
usually
come
pretty
close
and
that
surprised
us
since
we
still
weren
t
good
at
connect
all
the
dot
we
knew
the
strategic
planning
formula
work
from
value
through
mission
to
strategy
to
objective
but
in
reality
we
move
from
mission
statement
directly
to
store
and
warehouse
metric
we
be
essentially
say
this
be
what
we
want
to
be
in
our
store
how
many
be
we
go
to
open
this
year
somehow
it
work
at
first
we
didn
t
have
the
measurables
heck
we
still
didn
t
have
a
budget
but
we
have
the
performance
that
be
because
the
concept
be
sound
core
merchandise
and
low
price
drew
in
any
number
of
first
time
shopper
who
then
kept
come
back
we
have
three
distinct
advantage
we
have
an
ever
grow
number
of
store
so
we
could
draw
people
who
want
to
shop
close
to
home
we
be
in
small
town
so
lease
rate
be
low
and
competition
from
mall
be
at
a
minimum
and
we
be
largely
in
the
south
which
be
draw
more
and
more
industry
from
the
rust
belt
thanks
to
milder
climate
low
wage
right
to
work
law
and
a
grow
labor
pool
fuel
in
part
by
southward
migration
this
be
true
even
though
the
economy
be
terrible
the
last
year
of
the
carter
presidency
and
the
begin
of
ronald
reagan
s
first
term
be
troubled
time
with
high
inflation
and
a
rough
business
climate
we
kept
grow
anyway
in
fact
we
have
the
wind
at
our
back
for
four
or
five
year
we
return
to
our
classic
growth
strategy
expand
by
increase
same
store
sale
by
opening
individual
new
store
and
by
purchasing
the
occasional
small
chain
of
store
the
uds
and
rankin
deal
have
go
well
but
they
prove
to
us
that
absorb
a
major
acquisition
be
extremely
challenge
that
kind
of
quick
expansion
by
acquisition
wasn
t
our
style
besides
we
have
plenty
of
growth
opportunity
left
in
the
market
we
already
serve
we
be
obviously
in
a
great
position
meanwhile
we
kept
grow
stick
to
the
old
pattern
of
expansion
we
d
use
before
the
uds
and
rankin
acquisition
but
with
strategic
planning
guide
us
we
study
thing
like
traffic
flow
but
we
knew
that
get
too
scientific
be
no
guarantee
we
would
discern
our
best
opportunity
when
it
come
to
pick
location
for
new
store
it
help
that
our
main
warehouse
be
in
scottsville
twenty
mile
from
interstate
and
a
one
day
drive
from
much
of
the
country
s
population
then
it
be
a
matter
of
find
potential
customer
with
enough
income
to
shop
with
us
regularly
sometimes
it
would
be
a
spot
where
there
be
already
several
store
and
a
lot
of
traffic
and
we
d
come
in
and
take
our
share
sometimes
it
be
in
spot
where
an
exist
population
be
underserved
and
we
d
fill
a
void
we
be
look
to
step
up
every
aspect
of
the
business
and
one
opportunity
come
with
the
retirement
of
a
venerable
employee
year
after
we
d
go
public
we
still
didn
t
have
consolidated
financials
or
a
budget
what
we
have
be
a
former
teacher
of
high
school
commercial
subject
bookkeeping
type
and
so
forth

in
charge
of
all
our
bookkeeper
i
walk
into
my
dad
s
office
one
day
and
saw
that
he
be
wear
an
expression
i
can
only
describe
as
glum
what
s
the
matter
daddy
i
say
hubert
have
decide
to
retire
early
he
be
really
deject
hubert
have
make
stellar
contribution
to
the
company
and
held
the
title
secretary
treasurer
he
have
common
sense
and
he
work
hard
and
exceed
any
reasonable
expectation
of
performance
we
might
have
have
my
dad
look
up
at
me
you
ve
have
several
accounting
course
so
we
don
t
have
to
replace
him
do
we
of
course
we
do
i
say
not
with
somebody
expensive
he
say
and
i
knew
he
meant
someone
whose
salary
would
be
north
of
a
year
yes
daddy
with
somebody
expensive
we
greet
hubert
s
retirement
with
polar
opposite
reaction
i
be
delighted
the
company
could
finally
position
the
need
financial
oversight
by
expand
the
job
s
role
from
accountant
to
full
financial
executive
someone
who
could
use
the
accumulate
information
for
planning
and
decision
make
dad
be
deject
dread
the
extra
overhead
we
brought
in
several
experienced
executive
to
bolster
the
company
s
leadership
team
we
hire
ed
burke
who
have
be
with
the
louisville
office
of
cooper
lybrand
as
vice
president
of
finance
he
would
be
our
first
true
chief
financial
officer
we
add
bob
carpenter
of
first
american
corporation
i
knew
him
from
be
on
first
american
s
board
as
general
counsel
and
vice
president
of
administration
at
the
same
time
we
promote
my
brother
steve
to
executive
vice
president
of
merchandising
there
be
a
good
deal
of
irony
in
the
fact
that
at
the
first
hamilton
planning
meeting
we
have
list
continuity
of
management
as
one
of
our
strength
yet
every
time
we
go
back
to
do
more
planning
we
have
just
a
few
of
the
same
executive
most
of
the
group
would
be
newcomer
in
as
we
be
firm
up
that
new
management
team
a
st
louis
base
manufacturing
and
retailing
conglomerate
name
interco
offer
to
sell
us
its
p
n
hirsch
chain
which
consist
of
store
in
eleven
midwestern
and
southern
state
our
strategy
do
not
include
deal
of
that
magnitude
they
have
sale
of
million
but
we
believe
in
break
the
rule
for
the
right
reason
and
this
seem
to
be
one
of
those
time
we
could
increase
the
number
of
dollar
general
store
by
percent
and
our
total
sell
space
by
percent
something
it
would
otherwise
take
us
three
year
to
do
actually
what
we
really
want
be
interco
s
eagle
family
discount
store
locate
throughout
florida
a
marketplace
where
we
need
a
large
footprint
at
the
time
though
the
eagle
store
weren
t
for
sale
we
analyze
p
n
hirsch
closely
then
bought
their
outlet
in
november
our
employee
work
like
crazy
for
the
next
eight
month
to
convert
them
to
dg
store
they
be
under
order
to
have
the
old
store
close
no
longer
than
hour
before
they
reopen
under
the
dollar
general
banner
we
be
adamant
about
get
them
all
open
in
time
for
back
to
school
sale
during
the
first
half
of
we
convert
store
and
of
those
stretch
from
michigan
to
louisiana
open
on
one
day
june
we
add
foot
of
warehouse
space
in
scottsville
and
sale
do
indeed
rise
a
quarter
of
our
sale
be
from
convert
hirsch
store
but
all
of
that
be
a
real
hardship
for
our
employee
and
a
strain
on
the
company
overall
the
level
of
difficulty
that
arose
in
try
to
absorb
those
store
point
to
deeper
and
broader
systemic
problem
i
knew
for
certain
those
problem
weren
t
because
of
competition
we
have
our
own
niche
operating
in
market
other
retailer
didn
t
want
occupy
building
they
bypass
buying
merchandise
they
ignore
and
serve
customer
they
overlook
no
our
trouble
be
of
our
own
make
we
weren
t
able
to
match
the
level
of
employee
training
and
development
hirsch
have
be
deliver
so
well
we
weren
t
bring
new
employee
up
to
speed
fast
enough
so
there
be
problem
with
everything
from
customer
service
to
record
keep
and
our
leadership
in
the
field
be
lack
we
weren
t
marketing
well
enough
in
the
new
area
let
potential
customer
know
who
we
be
and
what
we
do
what
s
more
problem
in
these
new
area
distract
us
from
our
core
responsibility
still
i
be
hopeful
that
with
the
right
attitude
and
the
right
help
we
could
recognize
and
correct
our
mistake
while
maintain
one
of
our
key
strength
our
unique
ability
to
retain
a
sense
of
perspective
even
to
laugh
at
ourselves
and
to
tap
the
latent
problem
solve
genius
of
our
employee
as
the
month
turn
into
a
year
and
we
still
hadn
t
digest
the
hirsch
store
i
get
nervous
very
nervous
as
big
as
the
hirsch
acquisition
be
i
knew
if
the
eagle
deal
come
through
it
would
be
much
big
and
much
tougher
the
hirsch
store
be
in
the
heartland
of
our
operation
and
their
merchandising
and
culture
be
compatible
with
ours
convert
them
be
a
lot
of
work
but
there
be
a
great
deal
of
common
ground
the
eagle
store
be
in
florida
which
be
outside
our
normal
operating
area
and
the
company
have
a
culture
much
different
from
ours
we
knew
the
hirsch
store
need
our
attention
we
need
to
settle
down
sell
some
merchandise
and
let
growth
take
care
of
itself
in
fact
we
say
as
much
to
our
stockholder
we
go
on
record
with
them
as
oppose
another
acquisition
stress
in
our
annual
report
that
year
that
our
primary
strategy
be
to
build
sale
in
exist
store
with
a
secondary
strategy
of
increase
the
number
of
store
in
operation
in
an
orderly
and
profitable
manner
i
concentrate
on
the
management
area
uniquely
my
responsibility
planning
and
people
i
be
responsible
for
determine
the
direction
of
the
company
articulate
it
to
our
constituent
and
preserve
the
culture
as
we
expand
and
i
be
force
to
delegate
more
i
held
on
to
the
people
intensive
activity
communicate
and
the
total
human
development
need
of
the
company
i
be
also
very
aware
that
my
name
be
turner
and
that
i
need
to
be
a
presence
in
the
warehouse
and
store
no
one
want
to
work
for
a
bureaucracy
then
in
february

ceo
of
interco

less
active
since
i
knew
he
have
to
be

impressed
by
him

take
his
management
course
for

more
than
fifteen
year
earlier
and

in
help
us
implement
strategic

and
kick
off
five
year
of
amaze
growth
i
wasn
t
go
to
pas
up
the
chance
to
learn
more
about
communication
from
the
quintessential
communicator
larry
be
a
true
legend
he
have
developed
the
ama
s
strategic
planning
model
he
have
be
on
dozen
of
board
and
have
won
the
presidential
medal
of
merit
for
his

the
author
of
several
book
include
management
in
action
larry
conduct
the
session
himself
and
he
be
as
impressive
as
ever
the
course
dealt
with
how
to
communicate
as
a
leader
and
how
to
connect
with
people
and
it
add
a
great
deal
to
what
i
d
learn
from
him
earlier
know
we
be
about
to
do
the
eagle
acquisition
i
arrange
for
a
one
on
one
meeting
a
growth
company
need
great
management
and
i
knew
we
need
larry
to
help
us
establish
a
system
that
would
let
us
develop
it
we
sat
down
and
begin
talk
we
have
a
lot
in
common
i
learn
he
be
a
methodist
minister
s
son
and
have
other
minister
and
a
bishop
in
his
family
we
really
clicked
on
a
personal
level
finally
i
turn
to
business
larry
i
say
the
ama
have
its
stamp
all
over
my
company
we
ve
just
go
through
the
best
five
year
in
the
company
s
history
strictly
follow
the
ama
s
model
of
strategic
planning
now
we
re
about
to
undertake
an
acquisition
that
scare
the
bejeebers
out
of
me
and
i
don
t
think
we
have
the
management
development
program
in
place
to
prepare
us
for
what
s
come
in
less
than
a
year
and
half
we
re
go
to
add
fifty
percent
more
store
i
m
worried
the
company
could
get
into
trouble
we
need
the
right
plan
and
the
right
management
to
carry
it
out
we
need
your
management
development
program
as
a
complement
to
strategic
planning
and
we
need
people
train
as
well
as
only
you
can
help
us
train
them
i
pause
for
a
moment

consultant
to
our
company
i
don
t
consult
for
company

my
calendar

t

wasn
t
ask
you
i
m
tell
you
that
you
don
t
have
a
choice

so
much
at
stake
here
the
planning
our
company
have
put
in
place
be
your
do
your
prot
g
hank

us
what
we
know
and
look
at
our
common
root
we
re
even
fellow
methodist
i
watch
a
tear
roll
down
his
cheek
apparently
we
have
connect
well
he
say
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
i
go
home
know
i
have
to
get
my
dad
to
buy
into
the
plan
i
told
him
about
larry
and
say
i
want
him
on
the
board
i
m
not
sure
he
be
sell
on
the
idea
but
he
say
all
right
if
he
s
eighty
he
won
t
be
around
too
long
anyway
my
dad
be
a
dozen
year
young
larry
resign
from
the
board
of
two
other
company
and
join
dollar
general
we
agree
that
he
would
give
us
three
day
a
month
to
help
us
get
the
management
development
program
in
place
larry
turn
out
to
be
as
much
soul
mate
as
mentor
to
me
he
have
never
have
a
son
and
he
kind
of
look
at
me
in
that
way
my
dad
have
be
and
always
would
be
my
mentor
and
only
he
could
ever
be
a
true
father
figure
in
my
life
but
larry
give
me
something
beyond
what
my
father
could
give
something
vital
as
i
try
to
move
the
company
forward
at
that
point
in
my
career
i
need
both
of
them
desperately

a
company
out
of
control
the
relationship
between
larry
appley
and
my
dad
start
off
cordially
enough
but
that
didn
t
last
long
larry
be
go
to
help
us
move
from
family
business
to
professionally
run
company
my
dad
embody
the
family
business
he
felt
about
strategic
planning
the
way
he
felt
about
computer
if
it
say
we
should
do
something
he
agree
with
it
be
superfluous
if
it
say
something
he
disagreed
with
it
would
just
anger
him
until
the
end
of
his
life
larry
s
perspective
brought
out
the
very
bad
in
my
dad
who
hat
what
happen
to
the
company
from
the
moment
larry
join
give
the
radical
difference
in
their
approach
it
make
sense
in
hindsight
i
remember
larry
say
to
me
you
need
to
sound
more
professional
as
the
ceo
of
a
large
company
when
you
reference
your
father
don
t
call
him
daddy
but
that
s
who
he
be
i
say
meanwhile
we
be
still
wrestling
with
the
eagle
proposal
i
knew
why
we
shouldn
t
do
it
most
of
their
store
be
in
large
city
most
of
ours
be
in
small
town
our
headquarters
our
ethos
and
our
entire
identity
be
firmly
ensconce
in
scottsville
they
cater
to
a
male
customer
we
cater
to
a
female
customer
while
dg
sell
clothing
and
basic
consumables
eagle
sell
sport
automotive
electrical
and
plumbing
good
along
with
swim
pool
chemical
and
accessory
to
top
it
off
more
than
percent
of
their
sale
be
cigarette
which
we
didn
t
sell
and
didn
t
want
to
there
be
still
more
reason
our
people
have
go
through
hell
with
the
hirsch
acquisition
and
we
still
hadn
t
digest
those
store
we
be
understaffed
with
ten
vacant
district
manager
position
our
advertising
expense
be
up
and
we
need
money
to
build
a
third
warehouse
in
spite
of
all
that
we
be
torn
here
be
the
opportunity
we
have
want
a
year
earlier
the
chance
to
enter
on
a
large
scale
a
ripe
and
lucrative
market
i
call
a
meeting
of
the
planning
group
comprise
of
some
of
our
key
executive
and
look
for
consensus
ultimately
we
be
smart
enough
collectively
to
know
we
couldn
t
do
it
and
we
decline
interco
s
initial
proposal
then
they
lower
the
price
we
look
still
more
closely
and
saw
that
the
goodwill
for
which
they
want
million
be
vastly
overrate
the
price
come
down
some
more
the
cost
per
square
foot
of
some
of
florida
s
most
promising
retail
location
kept
get
low
i
knew
that
we
d
never
have
an
opportunity
like
this
for
position
ourselves
in
one
of
the
country
s
fast
grow
state
i
have
to
admit
that
i
be
starry
eyed
so
be
my
dad
and
everyone
in
senior
management
and
that
s
a
dangerous
thing
finally
we
all
decide
the
deal
be
too
good
to
pas
up
we
bought
the
store
in
february
for
million
we
have
our
entr
e
into
florida
as
he
have
with
hirsch
steve
would
direct
the
transition
we
give
ourselves
six
month
to
convert
store
we
would
liquidate
the
merchandise
that
didn
t
fit
our
customer
and
reopen
eagle
outlet
as
dollar
general
store
i
be
weary
but
i
jumped
for
joy
when
my
dad
say
son
you
and
the
management
team
have
do
a
wonderful
thing
i
m
proud
of
you
and
excite
about
what
s
ahead
for
our
company
as
we
look
at
what
we
have
bought
though
we
recognize
that
there
be
as
many
problem
as
possibility
i
go
to
florida
for
a
visit
the
warehouse
complex
in
opa
locka
consist
of
several
dilapidate
world
war
ii
era
hangar
and
the
corporate
culture
be
totally
different
from
ours
eagle
have
even
few
system
in
place
than
we
do
and
management
discipline
seem
to
be
lack
there
be
also
a
major
communication
problem
the
company
s
employee
be
largely
non
english
speak
cuban
while
i
be
there
someone
mention
our
vet
you
mean
veterinarian
i
say
yes
what
do
he
do
for
us
he
work
on
the
horse
my
goodness
i
thought
what
have
we
really
acquire
here
it
take
a
good
deal
of
back
and
forth
for
me
to
figure
that
one
out
we
do
indeed
have
a
veterinarian
in
our
employ
he
couldn
t
practice
his
give
profession
because
he
be
license
in
cuba
not
the
united
state
the
only
employment
he
could
get
be
an
hourly
warehouse
job
with
eagle
and
in
one
of
life
s
great
irony
eagle
have
place
him
in
charge
of
repair
the
coin
operate
mechanical
horse
that
sat
in
front
of
store
it
certainly
make
poetic
if
not
logical
sense
such
be
the
culture
of
those
eagle
store
that
this
dollar
general
ceo
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
during
that
familiarization
tour
in
various
state
of
wonder
and
consternation
and
it
wasn
t
lose
on
me
that
we
d
have
be
much
well
serve
if
i
d
visit
the
warehouse
during
work
hour
before
our
purchase
rather
than
accept
their
offer
of
a
nighttime
tour
that
give
no
hint
of
the
chaos
i
be
now
see
we
have
work
for
month
inspect
every
store
and
every
store
lease
look
at
their
merchandise
their
price
their
store
location
operation
and
customer
but
we
hadn
t
take
this
peek
behind
the
warehouse
curtain
i
have
take
steve
with
me
on
that
trip
and
he
and
i
be
talk
to
employee
through
an
interpreter
at
one
stop
i
introduce
him
this
be
my
brother
steve
i
say
he
will
be
down
here
work
with
you
the
interpreter
point
at
steve
and
as
he
repeat
what
i
d
say
in
spanish
steve
and
i
distinctly
heard
the
word
yeh
ho
steve
s
eye
get
huge
and
no
doubt
mine
do
too
he
look
at
me
with
a
face
that
say
do
he
just
call
me
a
yeh
ho
again
it
take
some
think
and
ask
after
we
d
walk
away
but
it
seem
he
be
use
the
word
viejo
which
normally
mean
old
don
t
ask
me
why
that
word
seem
useful
to
him
it
be
the
example
of
the
imperfect
mash
up
of
redneck
and
hispanic
we
face
as
we
begin
try
to
blend
these
culture
i
left
hop
that
once
the
company
be
expose
to
the
dg
mission
and
spirit
from
top
to
bottom
they
d
come
around
we
begin
the
long
expensive
and
exhaust
process
of
convert
store
again
closing
the
eagle
office
and
run
the
operation
out
of
scottsville
we
have
manager
in
other
store
who
hadn
t
see
their
district
manager
in
month
because
the
dm
have
be
off
help
open
store
our
warehouse
and
trucking
operation
and
our
office
and
merchandising
staff
be
all
overload
our
sale
increase
by
million
to
million
with
four
fifth
of
that
increase
in
florida
but
our
expense
rise
even
more
on
a
percentage
basis
and
we
experienced
a
percent
drop
in
income
the
cost

the

over
what

it
be
bad
during

that
at

we
have

do
something
right
because
of
our
long

of
growth

like
our
potential
to
turn
our
present
trouble
around
in
a
year
or
two
in
the

just
the
rapid

give
us
problem
we
weren
t
execute
well
on
the
basic
we
have
always
operate
with
a
small
upper
level
staff
and
we
need
system
that
could
handle
this
new
and
large
organization
we
have
to
undertake
what
i
call
at
the
time
a
serious
re
examination
of
all
major
business
assumption
and
practice
of
the
company
we
ask
the
tough
question
about
why
earnings
have
go
to
pot
and
what
have
go
wrong
with
the
new
store
we
saw
that
in
addition
to
weakness
in
management
we
weren
t
do
a
good
job
of
merchandising
our
company
in
market
different
from
those
in
our
kentucky
and
tennessee
base
in
the
fall
of
i
restructure
the
company
i
brought
in
a
new
vice
president
of
marketing
who
would
also
oversee
advertising
steve
would
oversee
buying
store
operation
and
distribution
ed
burke
would
remain
at
the
head
of
finance
our
new
security
chief
would
oversee
data
processing
and
bob
carpenter
would
run
human
resource
we
brought
all
the
senior
executive
together
in
hamilton
to
chart
a
course
we
pour
ourselves
again
into

lit
on
our

need
for
quality
basic
merchandise
at
everyday
low
price
he
have
real
problem
with
that
recognize
it
as
the
long
unwieldy
and
off
base
statement
it
be
he
say
it
s
not
a
mission
statement
when
you
compare
yourself
to
the
competition
a
mission
statement
be
about
you
your
unique
situation
and
the
opportunity
you
want
to
strive
for
we
begin
as
a
group
to
come
up
with
a
new
one
and
eventually
we
hit
on
one
as
short
and
simple
as
it
be
lofty
serve
others
which
held
echo
for
me
of
the
gospel
song
others
which
miss
havelon
have
sung
so
beautifully
at
camp
dunroamin
when
i
be
a
boy
it
be
a
great
example
of
someone
who
have
an
impact
far
beyond
what
she
would
ever
know
in
this
case
on
a
fortune
company
we
re
examine
our
business
strategy
assign
each
executive
the
task
of
develop
an
operating
plan
to
achieve
his
or
her
department
s
goal
we
be
go
to
share
those
plan
in
december
i
wasn
t
immune
to
learn
from
these
session
either
one
in
particular
remind
me
of
luther
turner
s
default
position
that
there
be
something
to
learn
from
everyone
no
matter
which
side
of
the
classroom
or
leadership
aisle
you
re
on
i
be
speak
to
senior
executive
at
a
leadership
development
training
program
tell
them
about
the
importance
of
a
personal
mission
statement
i
told
them
the
element
that
a
mission
should
be
brief
and
motivate
something
you
could
never
fully
accomplish
but
which
would
help
you
screw
your
head
on
straight
every
day
i
share
dollar
general
s
mission
statement
serve
others
and
then
as
i
encourage
them
to
write
their
personal
mission
statement
down
i
share
mine
at
the
time
mine
be
rejoice
in
my
god
give
potential
and
develop
it
to
the
full
in
a
way
that
encourages
others
to
do
the
same
it
be
actually
quite
a
mouthful
give
what
i
have
just
say
about
brevity
and
when
i
d
finish
a
shy
bespectacled
man
name
allen
bullard
come
up
to
me
and
say
mr
turner
i
want
to
share
my
mission
statement
with
you
i
think
it
meet
your
test
it
really
help
me
every
day
to
get
my
head
screw
on
right
and
to
motivate
me
and
it
s
only
three
word
god
honor
change
i
thought
wow
that
s
what
mine
be
try
to
say
here
i
be
tell
them
how
to
do
it
and
i
didn
t
have
it
nail
down
nearly
as
well
as
he
do
he
have
capture
the
essence
of
my
mission
statement
in
a
distinct
and
memorable
way
he
say
in
every
unique
circumstance
with
whatever
person
be
involve
i
think
my
mission
here
be
the
change
that
honor
god
and
that
s
what
i
m
motivate
to
do
it
be
one
of
those
case
when
the
trainee
have
gotten
it
more
right
than
the
trainer
i
present
okay
and
he
have
return
great
i
chose
to
follow
his
lead
god
honor
change
have
be
my
personal
mission
statement
ever
since
all
the
session
seem
to
be
go
well
but
then
in
december
when
the
senior
executive
met
to
go
over
our
progress
on
operating
plan
no
one
have
held
planning
session
and
there
be
no
plan
everything
be
still
unravel
we
have
little
presence
in
the
store
an
erode
customer
base
in
many
area
and
no
real
system
to
provide
unity
it
be
a
matter
say
one
of
our
executive
of
try
to
hold
the
thing
together
with
chew
gum
and
paper
clip
then
come
the
big
blow
ed
burke
our
cfo
walk
into
my
office
one
morning
in
the
spring
and
say
our
audit
firm
be
suggest
that
we
not
announce
our
financial
result
until
we
checked
with
our
lender
ed
i
say
we
ve
never
believe
in
sit
on
our
financial
result
we
announce
them
when
we
have
them
but
cal
he
say
we
have
covenant
violation
in
our
term
loan
agreement
and
if
we
don
t
get
a
waiver
our
lender
could
use
them
as
a
basis
for
call
it
in
and
we
can
t
cover
the
loan
we
could
be
force
into
chapter
i
be
devastate
our
chief
financial
officer
be
suggest
the
possibility
of
bankruptcy
sale
in
have
drop
for
the
first
time
in
the
company
s
history
net
income
be
down
from
million
to
just
million
shrinkage
alone
dwarfed
that
number
million
in
merchandise
have
simply
disappear
it
be
obvious
that
we
be
in
big
trouble
i
have
to
face
the
fact
that
i
be
not
in
control
of
the
company
none
of
us
be
we
step
up
internal
security
and
hire
investigator
we
study
the
florida
store
which
alone
have
one
third
of
the
shrinkage
and
found
undertrained
undermotivated
sometimes
resentful
employee
and
the
picture
didn
t
improve
as
you
go
up
the
chain
of
command
we
uncovered
theft
at
every
level
of
the
organization
from
store
clerk
to
the
area
manager
and
some
of
our
buyer
we
fire
people
and
of
them
be
arrest
turnover
among
manager
and
clerk
hit
percent
meaning
on
average
every
position
be
turn
over
twice
a
year
our
bookkeeper
be
overwhelmed
and
as
much
as
it
pain
me
i
knew
our
cfo
be
not
up
to
the
job
in
a
company
this
size
he
have
to
be
replace
we
have
be
like
a
teenager
whose
jean
be
too
short
because
he
be
grow
so
rapidly
he
will
get
use
to
that
since
it
s
pretty
normal
but
if
he
really
have
a
spurt
of
growth
he
ll
burst
the
rear
end
right
out
of
them
and
that
be
what
happen
to
us
our
butt
be
show
all
of
this
might
have
be
much
easy
if
our
family
have
be
pull
in
one
direction
but
it
wasn
t
while
in
many
way
we
still
thought
of
the
company
as
a
family
business
it
have
to
be
operate
as
a
true
public
company
the
stress
of
our
rapid
growth
meant
we
have
to
resolve
some
fundamental
family
issue
we
need
a
unified
vision
and
that
didn
t
exist
steve
and
i
be
apple
and
orange
or
more
exactly
i
be
a
turner
and
he
be
a
goad
my
mother
s
side
of
the
family
he
study
philosophy
i
study
business
administration
he
be
a
thoughtful
debater
i
be
a
decision
maker
who
be
now
force
to
make
those
decision
in
haste
plain
old
sibling
rivalry
be
part
of
the
deal
it
wasn
t
my
fault
it
wasn
t
his
we
just
view
the
world
differently
and
have
different
vision
for
the
company
that
couldn
t
be
reconcile
i
love
him
deeply
and
he
love
me
yet
we
be
not
effectively
work
together
as
ceo
i
be
responsible
for
the
entire
company
concentrate
on
human
resource
planning
and
administration
steve
be
responsible
for
merchandising
distribution
and
store
operation
neither
of
us
be
thrill
with
the
job
the
other
be
do
i
thought
that
we
be
lose
our
edge
in
opportunistic
buying
and
that
indecisive
merchandising
leadership
be
hurt
us
i
have
to
fire
the
general
merchandising
manager
who
report
to
steve
and
i
become
convince
that
we
have
become
a
buying
rather
than
a
sell
culture
and
that
some
sort
of
fundamental
shift
have
to
take
place
part
of
steve
s
restlessness
have
to
do
with
scottsville
you
have
your
nashville
friendship
and
business
connection
he
say
i
m
not
intellectually
stimulate
by
talk
to
a
cow
in
the
field
steve
have
be
lobbying
for
some
time
for
us
to
move
the
company
headquarters
from
scottsville
to
nashville
motivate
primarily
i
thought
by
a
desire
to
move
to
nashville
himself
i
resist
steve
i
say
scottsville
be
central
to
the
culture
of
our
company
it
s
where
it
be
found
our
root
be
here
let
s
get
back
to
the
important
issue
we
re
work
on
let
s
not
let
ourselves
be
distract
by
this
discussion
i
finally
convince
him
to
let
it
go
for
a
time
but
it
come
up
again
in
strategic
planning
we
discuss
whether
we
have
outgrown
scottsville
as
a
corporate
home
some
people
just
aren
t
cut
out
to
live
in
small
town
and
we
knew
that
be
a
factor
in
limit
the
kind
of
first
rate
people
we
need
to
attract
to
senior
management
nashville
because
of
its
size
industry
university
and
culture
have
much
more
to
offer
potential
hire
steve
be
right
move
be
something
we
be
go
to
have
to
do
that
left
my
dad
no
matter
whose
idea
this
be
i
be
go
to
have
to
broach
the
subject
with
him
and
then
do
the
negotiate
it
be
not
go
to
be
easy
son
he
told
me
with
fire
in
his
eye
i
admit
i
m
emotional
about
this
but
i
know
i
m
right
this
company
need
to
stay
here
sam
walton
stayed
in
bentonville
and
that
company
s
do
pretty
well
my
dad
go
so
far
as
to
buy
a
company
helicopter
to
go
with
the
company

we
d
picked
up
in
the

figure
we
could
use
it
to
fly
to
store
and
he
thought
if
his
boy
could
use
it
for
quick
hop
to
nashville
they
might
be
persuade
to
forget
this
move
it
didn
t
work
and
it
turn
out
to
be
a
bad
investment
as
well
as
a
source
of
embarrassment
for
howard
johnson
who
handle
store
lease
i
hat
to
fly
to
some
little
town
in
a
helicopter
he
say
and
talk
to
a
guy
about
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
square
foot
when
my
trip
there
cost
six
hundred
dollar
my
dad
ask
me
to
talk
to
john
holland
who
have
move
the
fruit
of
the
loom
headquarters
from
new
york
to
bowling
green
so
i
go
to
visit
him
i
told
him
about
the
discussion
and
he
say
well
cal
i
think
move
to
nashville
would
be
the
smartest
thing
you
could
do
i
never
do
tell
my
dad
what
john
have
say
because
i
saw
in
john
someone
who
could
be
a
great
asset
for
our
board
and
i
didn
t
want
my
dad
angry
at
him
i
be
ready
for
us
to
make
the
decision
but
when
i
checked
the
company
bylaw
i
discover
that
the
location
of
the
corporate
office
be
a
board
decision
not
a
management
decision
i
knew
that
wouldn
t
work
because
the
board
be
align
with
my
dad
the
only
vote
we
have
be
mine
steve
s
and
larry
appley
s
fortunately
i
also
knew
that
nobody
really
knew
or
paid
attention
to
the
bylaw
so
i
go
into
the
next
board
meeting
and
say
i
m
announce
management
s
decision
to
locate
the
corporate
office
in
nashville
well
that
meeting
get
hot
the
only
person
to
side
with
me
be
larry
appley
ed
burke
say
nothing
steve
say
nothing
my
dad
get
so
emotional
he
left
the
room
when
the
meeting
finally
end
steve
ask
to
meet
privately
we
go
into
my
office
and
close
the
door
cal
jr
he
say
there
be
a
lot
of
emotion
in
that
meeting
you
re
tell
me
i
say
well
i
think
we
need
to
pay
attention
to
emotion
do
you
think
we
really
ought
to
do
this
i
say
steve
be
you
say
that
you
ve
change
your
mind
be
you
say
move
to
nashville
isn
t
the
right
thing
for
us
to
do
no
he
say
but
there
be
a
lot
of
emotion
there
look
i
told
him
the
last
thing
the
turner
boy
need
to
do
be
to
throw
in
the
towel
on
this
we
ve
take
a
stand
and
it
s
the
right
thing
to
do
we
need
to
proceed
and
that
s
what
we
do
we
open
an
square
foot
executive
office
in
green
hill
an
upscale
section
of
nashville
and
move
a
dozen
top
executive
there
late
in
in
what
amount
to
a
headquarters
for
our
strategic
planning
division
that
would
fit
nicely
with
the
management
resource
development
program
we
have
initiate
we
also
transfer
more
than
person
in
our
accounting
human
resource
insurance
and
security
department
to
a
square
foot
building
we
bought
and
renovate
in
downtown
scottsville
where
we
still
have
a
huge
presence
we
have
more
than
office
employee
with
a
payroll
of
more
than
million
and
our
large
warehouse
there
we
paid
in
county
and
city
property
tax
and
in
city
payroll
tax
but
nashville
would
now
be
headquarters
ironically
it
wouldn
t
be
long
after
the
move
that
steve
s
tenure
with
the
company
would
end
we
d
be
sell
the
helicopter
too

the
toughest
decision
of
my
life
our
new
presence
in
nashville
make
it
easy
to
draw
high
level
executive
talent
and
also
make
it
easy
for
us
to
lead
without
cal
sr
interference
although
he
be
still
look
over
our
shoulder
from
scottsville
all
of
us
do
have
the
opportunity
to
mature
in
decision
make
early
in
we
reorganize
the
company
divide
it
into
three
broad
area
operation
finance
and
development
we
brought
in
some
of
the
best
business
mind
we
could
find
include
a
high
power
executive
bruce
quinnell
as
our
cfo
in
order
to
establish
great
financial
control
as
we
dealt
particularly
with
shrinkage
he
would
also
have
primary
responsibility
for
investor
relation
so
it
wouldn
t
take
so
much
of
my
time
we
hire
a
new
executive
vice
president
to
lead
the
company

examine
distribution
which
we
decide
to
consolidate
and
automate
and
we
make
our
first
major
investment
in
technology
to
get
us
into
a
database
environment
overexpansion
have
lead
us
to
the
most
intensive
implementation
of
strategic
planning
in
dg
s
history
now
our
new
management
team
be
conduct
a
serious
re
examination
of
all
the
major
business
assumption
and
practice
of
the
company
bruce
be
appalled
to
find
out
that
we
didn
t
pay
store
employee
with
check
the
store
manager
paid
them
out
of
the
cash
drawer
fill
out
voucher
and
mail
them
to
scottsville
that
be
the
extent
of
the
paper
trail
bruce
be
adamant
that
we
need
more
control
over
the
million
of
dollar
that
go
out
to
thousand
of
employee
across
the
country
my
dad
have
take
the
common
sense
position
that
we
didn
t
really
have
control
of
the
cash
in
the
store
anyway
and
that
this
save
a
step
and
a
great
deal
of
manpower
and
paperwork
we
handle
the
irs
form
and
payment
from
scottsville
and
the
system
have
work
since
the
begin
it
be
time
for
yet
another
aspect
of
the
company
to
enter
the
present
age
though
and
bruce
come
up
with
a
payroll
system
to
accomplish
that
it
drove
everybody
nut
for
a
while
but
eventually
it
get
smooth
out
and
employee
get
their
check
out
of
scottsville
amid
this
flurry
of
activity
it
be
obvious
within
a
matter
of
week
that
our
new
executive
vice
president
wasn
t
a
good
fit
for
the
company
he
and
steve
just
didn
t
get
along
among
other
thing
and
we
let
him
go

be
also
apparent
that
steve
and
i
have
work
to
do
the
turner

go
to
have
to
get

fourteen
acquisition
our
company
have
do
to
date
i
ve
be
involve
in
all
of
them
and
the
common
denominator
for
all
of
those
troubled
company
be
a
problem
at
the
top
if
the
turner
don
t
get
their
act
together
we
re
go
to
face
the
same
situation
merchandising
and
operation
be
both
broken
merchandising
turn
cash
into
merchandise
your
customer
want
then
turn
that
merchandise
back
into
more
cash
be
the
fundamental
dynamic
of
any
retail
company
and
it
be
also
the
prime
mover
of
our
family
dilemma
merchandising
be
okay
steve
say
it
s
not
go
to
change
you
take
operation
and
run
it
the
way
you
want
i
want
our
new
people
run
both
i
offer
steve
the
chance
to
head
the
real
estate
development
of
the
company
he
knew
that
would
remove
him
from
the
day
to
day
mainstream
and
he
want
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
i
can
t
be
actively
involve
in
run
the
business
he
say
i
m
not
go
to
do
it
then
act
like
a
chief
operating
officer
i
told
him

agree
on
an
agenda
for
the
development
of

back
with
an
action
plan
that
be
long
on
plan
and
short
on
action

didn
t
impress
me
at
all
it
felt
as
if
my
brother
and
i
be
at
a
complete
impasse
no
amount
of
creativity
or
strategic

face
of
this
split
between

a
cal
camp
and

company
even
more
than
i
have
as
much
as
this
be
my
father
s
business
i
believe
steve
look
at
it
as
his
father
s
business
to
an
even
great
extent
i
love
that
about
him
but
give
the
situation
it
add
an
extra
burden
as
i
try
to
reach
a
decision
we
brought
in
a
psychologist
to
help
steve
and
me
communicate
the
psychologist
would
stand
behind
me
and
paraphrase
what
i
be
really
try
to
say
then
he
d
get
behind
steve
and
paraphrase
him
once
after
steve
have
finish
the
psychologist
look
at
me
and
say
cal
jr
you
be
a
self
righteous
son
of
a
bitch
steve
jumped
and
i
do
too
well
yes
i
guess
i
be
i
say
somehow
in
the
stress
and
strain
of
this
relationship
that
may
be
what
i
ve
become
we
be
in
an
impossible
situation
i
talk
now
and
then
to
trust
confidant
turn
especially
to
friend
in
the
young
president
organization
forum
we
could
be
honest
with
one
another
which
be
something
that
usually
could
not
happen
elsewhere
it
s
an
occupational
hazard
of
the
top
of
an
organization
that
you
re
protect
from
the
truth
people
have
a
lot
of
reason
for
not
give
it
to
you
straight
in
this
group
though
we
bond
talk
about
business
and
personal
matter
and
so
we
have
a
history
we
have
each
other
s
permission
to
say
you
re
full
of
crap
when
the
occasion
warrant
i
be
talk
with
them
about
what
we
be
go
through
when
one
of
them
turn
to
me
and
say
cal
i
think
dollar
general
may
be
a
dinosaur
an
extinct
specie
still
walk
around
as
dramatic
as
that
statement
be
it
be
in
line
with
what
i
knew
about
the
fact
that
we
have
to
change
dramatically
although
it
be
obvious
we
hadn
t
yet
hit
on
the
best
kind
of
change
another
say
cal
we
ve
be
listen
to
you
talk
about
the
dynamic
between
you
and
your
brother
and
you
keep
say
i
think
it
s
get
well
i
think
we
ll
get
beyond
this
stuff
we
ve
heard
that
for
so
long
that
we
all
know
it
s
not
go
to
get
any
well
your
relationship
with
your
brother
have
a
fatal
flaw
within
it
the
sibling
rivalry
the
two
of
you
can
t
get
beyond
it
s
also
obvious
to
us
that
you
re
not
willing
to
do
anything
to
change
it
my
friend
be
tell
me
i
be
not
be
a
good
steward
of
the
company
unless
i
put
into
motion
the
change
it
need
however
daunt
that
change
could
be
give
my
relationship
with
steve
they
be
remind
me
that
sometimes
you
either
let
an
impossible
situation
go
on
indefinitely
or
you
become
an
agent
of
change
my
personal
mission
be
god
honor
change
and
my
high
value
be
reconcile
love
which
pursues
the
change
that
honor
god
i
have
to
ask
myself
how
commit
i
be
to
both
precept
i
have
go
in
with
one
question
which
have
move
pretty
rapidly
to
another
and
then
to
this
one
and
ironically
it
be
my
brother
who
help
me
arrive
at
the
bottom
line
as
much
as
i
hat
to
have
to
be
the
one
to
ask
whether
i
should
fire
my
brother
i
have
to
ask
it
i
have
to
be
willing
i
thought
to
accept
the
responsibility
of
ask
the
question
that
can
break
up
our
family
but
which
the
business
the
public
corporation
have
a
cry
need
for
me
to
answer
as
ceo
i
be
not
take
full
accountability
as
ceo
of
the
company
because
of
the
constraint
i
felt
have
my
brother
as
the
number
two
officer
we
want
to
do
different
thing
with
the
company
but
i
have
to
remember
that
i
be
the
one
ultimately
responsible
for
it
i
be
go
to
have
to
step
up
to
bat
and
assume
responsibility
dollar
general
have
three
power
base
a
father
and
two
son
and
i
have
let
myself
feel
that
i
wasn
t
really
responsible
because
i
didn
t
fully
feel
like
the
ceo
i
could
see
that
the
company
if
it
have
one
fully
position
ceo
one
goal
one
direction
could
do
well
i
be
that
person
on
paper
but
i
now
have
to
be
and
perform
as
that
person
follow
a
tough
course
of
action
be
seldom
a
straightforward
proposition
there
be
all
sort
of
twist
and
turn
layer
and
motif
we
can
t
see
go
in
it
take
courage
it
take
openness
it
also
take
ground
a
rootedness
in
god
that
can
give
a
firm
place
to
stand
even
when
all
around
be
change
i
be
go
to
have
to
get
my
head
on
straight
in
fact
i
have
really
be
try
amid
all
the
turmoil
of
the
last
few
year
to
look
for
a
little
more
order
and
balance
in
my
life
my
dad
always
felt
that
a
retailer
need
to
devote
all
his
time
and
energy
to
business
but
that
wasn
t
how
i
look
at
it
i
like
preach
the
occasional
sermon
at
the
scottsville
methodist
church
and
i
want
to
be
active
in
its
music
program
a
lot
of
wonderful
little
old
lady
want
me
to
sing
at
their
funeral
i
also
want
to
get
my
golf
and
tennis
game
back
in
shape
and
occasionally
hit
the
ski
slope
with
my
son
everybody
need
someplace
to
go
when
he
doesn
t
have
the
answer
late
in
i
go
skiing
i
be
try
to
get
my
head
clear
but
my
mind
be
on
the
business
and
the
problem
with
steve
and
me
i
be
hurt
and
the
pain
and
stress
of
the
process
literally
drove
me
to
my
knee
i
have
to
go
to
my
god
i
wasn
t
a
daily
bible
reader
as
a
good
bible
belt
methodist
be
suppose
to
be
but
in
the
face
of
that
crisis
my
reading
of
the
scripture
become
one
of
cry
inquiry
i
read
intently
and
i
get
the
conviction
i
need
in
the
fifteenth
chapter
of
john
i
be
the
true
vine
and
my
father
be
the
vinedresser
every
branch
in
me
that
do
not
bear
fruit
he
take
away
and
every
branch
that
do
bear
fruit
he
prune
so
that
it
may
bear
more
fruit
that
seem
to
be
god
s
march
order
regard
my
father
s
business
and
it
involve
both
turner
brother
steve
would
undergo
the
pain
of
be
take
away
from
the
company
i
have
to
undergo
the
pain
of
cut
away
any
excuse
i
have
for
not
be
able
to
lead
within
this
family
dynamic
only
with
that
kind
of
prune
could
we
as
a
company
bear
more
fruit
i
have
to
assume
responsibility
and
take
on
the
full
yoke
of
leadership
we
desperately
need
clarity
in
decision
make
not
two
camp
jockeying
for
position
i
be
responsible
for
fire
steve
i
be
responsible
for
put
everything
back
together
and
make
it
okay
it
be
the
mr
fix
it
part
of
my
personality
on
steroid
still
it
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
go
forward
with
what
i
knew
would
be
a
painful
rend
of
company
and
family
make
a
decision
be
one
thing
carry
it
out
can
be
pure
hell
when
i
get
back
to
the
office
after
my
skiing
trip
and
found
thing
somehow
well
between
steve
and
me
i
begin
to
waver
i
be
accustom
to
give
advice
more
than
receive
it
but
this
be
such
a
critically
important
decision
that
i
knew
i
need
the
perspective
of
someone
i
trust
i
spoke
at
length
to
the
senior
pastor
at
my
church
and
he
didn
t
try
to
dissuade
me
from
what
i
knew
i
need
to
do
not
long
afterward
i
come
across
another
scripture
it
be
from
corinthian
and
it
say
therefore
have
such
a
hope
we
act
with
great
boldness
i
read
it
as
god
tell
me
i
ve
told
you
what
to
do
now
get
your
butt
in
gear

be
the
hardest
thing
i
ever
have
to
do
and
it
be
steve
who
force
the
issue
and
actually
help
me
carry
out
the
decision

again
in
january
about
a
move
for
him
into
the
real
estate
side
of
the
business

be
a
repeat
of
the
conversation
we
d
have
month
earlier

want
to
stay
in
merchandising
and
he
wasn

way

much
as

be
yours

say
i
m
a
turner
too
if
you
insist
on
this
change
brother
you
re
go
to
have
to
step
up
to
the
plate
and
deny
me
my
birthright
you
re
go
to
have
to
fire
me
and
live
with
that
the
rest
of
your
life

answer
him
with
the
word
from
the
wedding
vow
i
do
with
that
my
brother
be
fire
i
can
t
tell
you
how
hard
that
moment
and
the
next
day
and
week
be
as
it
sank
in
for
both
of
us
what
have
just
happen
he
say
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
be
call
mama
and
daddy
in
florida
where
they
spent
january
and
february
every
year
we
knew
they
d
be
devastate
i
can
t
believe
in
a
company
this
big
i
ve
raise
two
son
who
can
t
get
along
say
our
dad
our
mother
say
i
love
you
both
but
if
i
be
there
i
d
spank
you
both
to
his
credit
my
dad
call
me
the
next
day
and
say
son
i
haven
t
slept
at
all
since
that
call
but
it
have
come
to
me
that
just
as
an
animal
cannot
survive
with
two
head
neither
can
a
company
you
do
what
you
have
to
do
and
you
have
my
full
support
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
hear
at
a
time
when
i
be
really
hurt
for
year
afterward
though
my
dad
would
revisit
steve
s
fire
he
may
have
agree
that
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
but
he
have
a
terrible
time
adjust
to
it
and
every
time
he
brought
it
up
it
be
like
a
dagger
through
my
heart
i
d
have
to
go
back
and
talk
him
through
it
and
help
him
process
it
again
the
last
time
he
brought
it
up
i
say
daddy
let
me
try
this
on
you
how
would
you
like
to
be
in
business
with
uncle
frank
he
and
uncle
frank
often
fought
like
cat
and
dog
at
farmer
national
bank
board
meeting
one
would
say
no
simply
because
the
other
have
say
yes
he
close
his
eye
for
a
moment
and
i
could
almost
see
his
relive
those
fight
it
be
the
goad
turner
divide
the
same
one
that
ran
like
a
river
between
steve
and
me
my
dad
and
frank
love
each
other
just
as
steve
and
i
do
but
that
didn
t
make
it
any
easy
for
them
to
deal
with
each
other
i
have
finally
hit
on
something
that
let
him
understand
why
it
didn
t
work
for
steve
and
me
to
be
in
the
same
business
ohhh
he
say
sigh
i
understand
son
i
m
okay
with
it
now
the
next
step
be
to
tell
the
world
about
steve
s
departure
it
would
have
be
so
wonderful
if
we
could
have
handle
it
quietly
but
as
a
public
company
we
didn
t
have
that
option
i
craft
a
press
release
that
paint
the
best
possible
face
on
it
steve
say
well
you
can
put
this
nice
spin
on
it
all
you
want
but
i
m
go
to
tell
all
my
friend
you
fire
me
steve
i
say
we
can
t
handle
it
that
way
well
you
handle
it
the
way
you
want
you
ve
get
the
company
now
but
i
m
go
to
tell
my
friend
that
you
fire
me
he
be
right
i
have
the
company
and
whatever
he
do
it
be
time
for
me
to
move
it
in
the
right
direction
then

felt
steve
who
be
still
on
the
board
be
in
the
room
as
well
it
be
a
pitiful
family
gathering
the
fact
that
he
have
call
me
and
stood
with
me
when
i
fire
steve
make
it
that
much
harder
for
me
to
support
the
board
s
stand
against
him
he
be
force
by
the
board
to
retire
as
chairman
but
they
relent
and
he
be
allow
to
remain
on
the
board
essentially
he
have
be
put
on
notice
to
behave
the
directive
that
he
move
out
of
his
office
remain
but
i
would
make
sure
it
wasn
t
put
into
effect
still
the
damage
have
be
do
i
become
chairman
during
the
meeting
nothing
have
ever
felt
less
like
a
promotion
after
the
meeting
we
issue
a
press
release
state
that
cal
sr
be

member
of
the
board
with
mama
go
steve
fire
and
my
dad
force
out
as
chairman
neither
the
company
nor
the
family
would
ever
feel
the
same
again
that
christmas
my
dad
my
brother
and
sister
and
their
family
make
plan
for
the
family
get
together
in
scottsville
i
call
my
dad
and
say
i
assume
that
it
be
best
for
margaret
calister
and
me
not
to
come
up
for
christmas
he
clear
his
throat
and
say
i
think
that
s
right
we
spent
a
long
and
lonely
christmas
in
nashville
away
from
the
family
and
the
first
family
holiday
gathering
without
my
mother
at
its
center
after
the
first
of
the
year
my
dad
gather
a
little
resolve
under
kentucky
law
he
still
have
the
vote
to
fire
outside
director
and
he
want
two
of
the
four
go
larry
appley
have
to
go
he
say
nothing
s
be
right
in
this
company
since
that
sob
show
up
i
want
to
fire
him
wallace
rasmussen
too
there
be
no
use
argue
about
larry
he
have
already
taught
us
a
great
deal
about
strategic
planning
and
he
be
in
his
eighty
but
it
be
important
that
we
hang
on
to
wallace
daddy
i
say
wallace
rasmussen
be
chairman
of
the
audit
committee
he
s
know
to
be
one
of
the
best
in
that
capacity
and
he
s
be
on
the
board
for
less
than
a
year
i
don
t
care
he
say
i
don
t
like
how
he
talk
to
me
daddy
i
say
that
s
not
good
enough
if
i
can
t
determine
my
own
board
of
director
as
ceo
then
i
think
i
m
go
to
have
to
resign
his
eye
fill
with
tear
and
i
watch
as
one
roll
down
his
cheek
son
it
would
devastate
my
lifelong
dream
to
see
anybody
but
you
as
ceo
of
this
company
and
i
hope
you
don
t
do
that
when
i
fire
wallace
rasmussen
it
be
quite
apparent
he
be
deadly
serious
and
that
we
be
two
bull
elephant
face
off
he
have
the
legal
authority
to
fire
two
director
i
could
have
renominated
them
and
gotten
them
reelect
at
a
separate
special
shareholder
meeting
afterward
but
that
would
amount
to
a
huge
spectacle
there
be
no
sense
in
air
our
dirty
linen
publicly
i
decide
to
nominate
two
other
director
to
replace
them
i
knew
though
that
we
have
to
hang
on
to
wallace
so
i
announce
at
the
shareholder
meeting
that
the
turnaround
require
such
a
concentration
of
effort
that
wallace
rasmussen
be
go
to
come
off
the
board
and
become
a
management
development
consultant
that
would
allow
him
to
dedicate
the
necessary
time
and
energy
to
his
work
for
the
company
and
to
have
more
involvement
than
be
appropriate
for
a
director
wallace
accepted
and
we
slowly
very
slowly
start
the
turnaround
we
so
desperately
need
wallace
be
also
able
to
rebuild
a
bridge
to
my
dad
make
two
trip
to
scottsville
to
talk
to
him
mr
turner
i
have
to
tell
you
he
say
at
one
point
if
i
have
be
cal
turner
and
have
go
through
all
that
you
have
go
through
i
wouldn
t
have
handle
myself
nearly
as
well
as
you
do
i
honestly
think
my
dad
would
have
prefer
that
wallace
not
be
so
nice
to
him
i
believe
he
gradually
get
to
the
point
where
he
be
say
no
i
can
t
hate
this
man
a
year
and
a
half
after
it
all
happen
my
dad
say
okay
wallace
can
come
back
on
the
board
i
think
he
have
learn
his
lesson
with
wallace
back
in
place
we
be
position
for
the
ninety
a
period
of
explosive
growth
for
us
my
dad
and
i
would
have
only
one
more
big
disagreement
and
that
be
over
the
fire
of
the
only
district
manager
out
of
to
fail
a
random
drug
test
we
have
a
drug
free
policy
and
i
knew
he
should
be
fire
his
father
though
be
my
dad
s
favorite
operation
employee
and
my
dad
say
you
re
not
go
to
fire
him
his
father
have
do
more
for
this
company
than
all
of
your
senior
management
team
put
together
i
fire
him
but
the
fight
convince
me
we
couldn
t
keep
go
through
this
i
need
to
make
my
dad
behave
if
at
all
possible
i
knew
the
company
be
his
baby
and
that
he
love
it
as
he
love
family
that
help
me
come
up
with
a
plan
i
go
to
scottsville
again
and
say
daddy
our
family
s
be
through
a
lot
of
pain
i
don
t
want
any
more
fight
but
these
thing
keep
come
up
every
time
it
tear
my
heart
out
i
know
my
sibling
wouldn
t
want
to
sell
their
stock
unless
i
sell
mine
so
why
don
t
we
agree
that
the
whole
turner
family
will
sell
dollar
general
let
s
get
our
family
back
i
knew
what
he
be
go
to
say
he
d
be
flabbergast
no
he
d
tell
me
then
here
s
what
i
need
from
you
i
d
say
and
i
d
convince
him
to
stay
out
of
thing
well
i
finish
my
spiel
make
my
pitch
for
sell
the
company
and
he
say
okay
i
be
the
one
who
be
flabbergast
okay
i
say
well
i
ll
have
to
share
this
with
my
management
team
we
need
them
to
get
the
company
in
good
enough
shape
to
sell
and
i
ll
suggest
they
go
to
the
board
with
a
bonus
and
compensation
plan
that
would
reward
them
upon
a
successful
sale
of
the
company
they
come
back
with
something
i
consider
far
too
lucrative
but
the
board
surprised
me
and
approve
it
with
the
carrot
of
big
incentive
pay
and
a
real
ownership
stake
dangle
before
them
they
take
this
turnaround
that
have
be
so
slow
in
get
start
and
kick
it
into
overdrive
the
team
come
together
and
we
be
off
on
the
best
run
in
the
company
s
history
soon
it
be
apparent
that
dollar
general
be
the
kind
of
company
none
of
us
management
or
family
would
want
to
sell
my
bluff
backfire
in
the
best
way
possible
and
we
remain
owner
of
a
company
that
prosper
greatly
it
be
one
of
the
most
productive
change
the
company
underwent
in
my
entire
career
it
have
begin
with
family
turmoil
with
a
company
be
pull
in
three
direction
i
have
to
reach
as
deeply
as
i
ve
ever
reach
to
discover
my
great
value
the
one
that
trump
all
the
others
when
i
have
to
make
a
decision
i
have
to
see
if
i
have
what
it
take
to
be
decisive
to
do
what
i
thought
best
for
the
company
to
direct
that
misplace
wedding
vow
i
do
at
my
brother
and
take
him
out
of
the
picture
it
be
a
matter
of
see
that
the
company
have
gotten
big
than
our
family
and
that
it
need
more
expertise
and
resolve
than
we
could
bring
to
it
as
a
family
if
we
hadn
t
gotten
in
trouble
we
never
would
have
grapple
with
the
big
question
that
lead
us
to
well
more
professional
management
ultimately
though
that
have
played
out
with
my
brother
leave
the
company
and
my
father
force
into
an
advisory
role
ironically
my
brother
would
be
make
wealthy
by
the
success
of
a
management
team
he
be
no
longer
part
of
and
he
and
i
be
closer
today
than
we
have
ever
be
because
although
it
be
the
hardest
thing
i
ve
ever
do
in
my
life
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
and
he
be
prophetic
i
still
feel
the
scar
of
it
and
yes
i
will
live
with
it
the
rest
of
my
life
there
be
during
that
long
season
of
turmoil
a
development
that
spawn
a
wonderful
family
legacy
it
grow
out
of
our
recognition
that
the
company
s
charitable
effort
be
haphazard
local
organization
from
little
league
team
to
the
united
way
approach
individual
store
manager
who
do
what
they
could
use
their
own
judgment
as
to
what
be
effective
and
appropriate
by
the
mid
eighty
the
company
have
grown
so
large
we
realize
this
be
too
random
and
ineffective
an
approach
it
only
make
sense
for
dollar
general
to
choose
a
cause
or
cause
and
attempt
to
make
a
collective
difference
something
that
offer
a
long
term
boost
to
those
we
serve
we
look
at
our
customer
and
their
community
both
be
often
rural
and
isolated
the
people
have
limited
income
and
skill
set
through
it
all
ran
a
lack
of
educational
opportunity
we
knew
that
some
of
our
customer
have
reading
difficulty
and
that
some
be
illiterate
we
knew
too
that
some
of
our
employee
have
never
finish
high
school
they
would
need
help
in
get
ahead
our
research
turn
up
statistic
that
put
what
we
saw
into
national
perspective
many
of
the
state
serve
by
dollar
general
be
on
the
lead
edge
of
a
disastrous
trend
that
saw
student
drop
out
of
school
each
year
while
just
be
earn
geds
the
best
thing
we
could
do
we
thought
be
to
support
literacy
program
something
that
definitely
hit
home
with
us
luther
turner
have
succeed
despite
a
third
grade
education
or
perhaps
because
of
his
ability
to
turn
his
lack
of
education
into
a
lifelong
willingness
to
learn
from
others
our
cause
become
the
terrible
gap
in
education
income
and
opportunity
that
afflict
so
many
dg
customer
we
decide
we
would
do
whatever
we
could
to
far
literacy
especially
economic
literacy
among
those
customer
and
our
employee
we
begin
in
by
pick
up
the
cost
of
ged
study
material
and
test
fee
for
our
employee
meanwhile
we
talk
to
national
adult
education
official
who
told
us
that
many
agency
exist
to
help
but
that
people
be
often
discourage
or
intimidate
by
the
process
of
track
down
and
access
information
they
might
make
several
long
distance
call
to
a
state
government
office
only
to
be
sent
to
another
and
another
if
they
do
reach
the
right
agency
they
might
wait
week
for
information
on
program
offer
in
their
community
we
be
in
those
community
and
we
decide
to
help
get
that
information
to
them
quickly
and
at
our
expense
in
we
launch
our
learn
to
read
information
program
a
customer
could
pick
up
a
preaddressed
reply
card
at
one
of
our
store
mail
it
to
our
home
office
and
receive
information
about
the
closest
adult
education
office
we
devote
half
a
million
dollar
worth
of
our
paid
retail
advertising
to
encourage
customer
to
go
to
their
near
dg
store
for
help
and
radio
station
devote
over
in
air
time
to
assist
the
program
we
put
brochure
in
circulation
in
the
first
year
nearly
people
in
twenty
eight
state
request
information
the
government
notice
and
in
we
be
one
of
thirty
organization
receive
the
presidential
citation
for
private
sector
initiative
from
ronald
reagan
but
statistic
and
citation
don
t
tell
the
story
hearing
a
man
in
his
sixty
say
that
he
come
to
us
want
more
than
anything
to
be
able
to
write
a
love
note
to
his
wife
or
have
another
tell
us
how
he
have
once
shy
away
from
any
attention
out
of
shame
that
he
couldn
t
read
or
write
and
be
able
to
overcome
that
those
be
the
story
that
let
us
know
we
be
do
something
worthwhile
as
a
corporation
we
contribute
money
as
an
individual
i
want
to
know
more
about
the
problem
and
i
talk
about
it
with
nelson
andrew
a
friend
who
be
on
the
board
of
first
american
bank
with
me
i
be
interested
in
education
as
it
be
play
out
in
local
school
since
that
be
where
our
next
generation
of
leader
be
go
to
come
from
nelson
have
his
finger
on
that
pulse
as
he
have
on
so
many
he
be
a
community
leader
someone
who
reach
out
and
genuinely
try
to
make
life
well
for
others
he
have
do
a
lot
of
work
in
education
and
he
challenged
me
say
cal
if
you
presume
to
understand
the
problem
of
education
and
literacy
you
need
to
spend
a
full
day
in
an
inner
city
classroom
and
i
mean
you
need
to
be
there
when
the
teacher
get
there
you
need
to
go
through
everything
she
experience
and
you
need
to
leave
when
she
do
there
s
too
much
about
the
educational
problem
you
re
not
go
to
understand
unless
you
do
i
agree
that
it
be
a
good
idea
and
nelson
arrange
for
me
to
spend
the
day
with
fourth
grader
at
a
school
in
nashville
i
arrive
at
and
met
with
the
teacher
before
the
student
come
in
as
they
do
she
told
me
a
little
about
each
one
so
and
so
have
a
bad
night
she
d
say
she
told
me
that
most
have
only
one
parent
and
some
didn
t
know
where
that
one
be
some
want
to
spend
the
night
in
the
classroom
because
they
be
afraid
they
d
get
shot
at
home
it
be
terrible
terrible
stuff
and
it
be
a
major
effort
just
to
get
their
attention
so
we
could
proceed
with
some
instruction
as
a
manager
i
would
say
that
it
be
the
most
unmanageable
situation
i
have
ever
encounter
but
it
be
good
for
me
because
i
become
sympathetic
about
the
problem
that
teacher
have
it
s
easy
to
blame
them
for
our
bad
educational
system
but
i
learn
that
many
of
the
student
they
deal
with
every
day
come
to
school
with
so
many
problem
and
so
much
dysfunction
at
home
that
they
be
often
simply
not
ready
to
meet
the
challenge
the
classroom
present
the
teacher
assign
me
to
work
especially
with
a
boy
name
tony
say
he
could
use
a
little
extra
help
and
attention
i
talk
to
him
a
lot
through
the
course
of
the
day
and
he
really
warm
up
to
me
he
could
tell
i
care
about
him
and
his
classmate
and
i
could
see
that
he
admire
and
respect
this
adult
who
be
there
try
to
encourage
him
at
one
point
late
in
the
day
he
ask
me
if
i
be
rich
i
be
embarrass
the
thought
of
be
rich
have
always
embarrass
me
i
say
no
i
knew
when
i
say
it
that
i
be
be
dishonest
to
this
day
i
think
i
blew
it
if
i
have
say
yes
he
would
have
gotten
the
idea
that
be
rich
didn
t
automatically
mean
you
re
a
bad
person
he
might
even
have
gotten
the
idea
that
if
he
work
hard
he
could
someday
be
a
rich
person
himself
there
be
dot
i
wish
i
d
connect
for
him
during
a
day
that
taught
me
a
great
deal
and
that
didn
t
end
when
the
student
left
at
i
stayed
there
with
the
teacher
until
she
finish
up
between
and
p
m
the
other
development
in
the
wake
of
our
family
s
turmoil
be
paradoxically
enough
the
most
impressive
period
of
success
in
our
history
the
outcome
of
the
crisis
a
new
independent
board
and
a
much
strong
management
team
have
lead
us
into
a
new
era
still
the
twin
reality
of
my
dad
s
ouster
as
chairman
and
his
continued
presence
on
the
board
be
indicative
of
the
dichotomy
at
the
heart
of
dollar
general
as
we
enter
the
s
our
legacy
be
small
town
but
we
be
headquarter
in
nashville
we
be
small
neighborhood
store
and
we
be
a
fortune
company
we
have
move
from
entrepreneurial
chaos
to
strategic
planning
from
family
rule
to
an
independent
board
but
we
be
very
much
a
mix
of
two
world
part
of
splitting
the
difference
i
thought
be
my
continue
effort
to
bring
a
personal
touch
to
my
leadership
it
s
why
i
have
a
column
every
month
in
our
company
newsletter
and
why
it
be
often
of
a
personal
nature
i
d
talk
shop
explain
policy
reminisce
and
try
to
let
everyone
in
the
company
know
he
or
she
be
appreciate
often
use
personal
anecdote
to
bring
the
point
home
dollar
general
be
constantly
change
grow
and
adapt
in
an
evolve
marketplace
and
part
of
what
i
want
to
do
be
to
make
change
attractive
i
hit
on
the
notion
of
sacred
cals
statement
that
sum
up
the
old
company
culture
and
which
might
or
might
not
need
skewer
base
on
the
fact
that
cal
turner
and
his
summation
of
policy
be
pretty
much
sacrosanct
my
willingness
to
talk
about
slaughter
sacred
cals
be
just
the
kind
of
attention
grab
irreverence
that
let
me
set
the
right
tone
while
make
important
point
it
be
a
logical
extension
of
the
self
efface
management
style
i
d
use
since
the
begin
and
since
i
be
a
cal
turner
too
i
could
include
myself
in
the
sacred
cals
all
the
while
i
be
make
clear
our
commitment
to
change
and
the
fact
that
i
be
personally
excite
by
it
i
be
ask
everyone
to
join
me
in
make
change
happen
base
on
the
right
foundation
one
example
involve
pack
trailer
for
shipment
something
i
d
do
since
i
be
a
kid
as
we
get
into
logistics
i
held
it
as
a
principle
a
sacred
cal
that
the
trailer
have
to
be
cubed
out
if
you
have
packed
all
the
merchandise
go
to
one
store
into
the
trailer
and
have
room
left
over
whether
it
be
six
foot
or
twenty
foot
you
start
on
the
next
store
s
stuff
you
d
pack
until
that
trailer
be
full
then
start
on
the
nose
of
the
next
one
the
principle
be
maximum
utilization
of
space
underneath
that
be
the
notion
that
you
didn
t
want
to
be
haul
air
from
one
place
to
another
cube
out
every
trailer
be
a
sacred
cal
if
there
ever
be
one
which
meant
it
have
to
come
face
to
face
with
our
new
approach
which
go
like
this
we
ll
slaughter
every
sacred
cal
of
this
company
after
we
inspect
why
and
how
it
become
a
sacred
cal
and
determine
how
relevant
it
be
to
our
future
we
come
to
realize
that
cub
out
trailer
meant
the
truck
be
drive
a
lot
more
mile
because
they
have
to
go
to
multiple
store
we
be
get
more
sophisticated
about
analyze
what
we
do
so
we
look
at
the
bottom
line
when
we
do
and
didn
t
cube
out
the
truck
the
cost
of
have
two
truck
go
to
one
store
often
outweigh
the
saving
we
get
from
run
full
we
realize
pretty
quickly
that
we
have
take
a
principle
that
be
often
good
don
t
waste
truck
space
and
make
it
a
cardinal
rule
without
think
it
through
completely
that
give
us
one
of
the
unofficial
motto
of
our
new
approach
to
sacred
cals
don
t
take
any
good
principle
too
far
the
big
sacred
cal
be
the
one
that
have
be
slaughter
with
the
introduction
of
strategic
management
if
it
s
bought
right
it
s
half
sell
that
be
something
neither
my
dad
nor
i
would
have
thought
to
challenge
but
once
it
have
be
challenged
and
slaughter
i
saw
that
there
wasn
t
necessarily
anything
sacred
about
sacred
cals
there
be
many
others
that
held
up
under
scrutiny
nothing
should
cost
more
than
it
come
to
this
be
my
grandfather
s
way
of
say
it
s
possible
to
pay
a
lot
more
for
something
than
it
will
ever
return
in
value
the
result
determines
whether
something
be
worth
it
in
fact
he
disagreed
with
the
notion
that
you
get
what
you
pay
for
you
do
pay
for
what
you
get
he
reason
but
pay
for
quality
doesn
t
assure
that
you
ll
get
it
we
don
t
want
to
make
more
money
we
want
to
make
more
friend
you
ll
make
more
money
if
you
set
out
to
make
friend
than
if
you
just
set
out
to
make
money
success
in
other
word
be
about
relationship
don
t
hire
anyone

my
dad
could
not
stand
to
see
people
idle

dawdle
don
t
describe
the

me
the

he

once
a

learns
his

i

good
at

i
also

me
to

what
i
need

with
in

of

and

my
dad
have
sacred
cals
in
the
personal
realm
as
well
marry
a
woman
who
life
where
you
want

that

where
you
will
live

anytime
you

he
s
the
bos
at

don
t
believe
anything
else
he
say
in
keep
with
our
approach
to
sacred
cals
i
look
at
my
father
s
ground
rule
for
employee
work
hard
be
honest
don
t
drink
on
the
job
don
t
screw
the
help
they
be
that
simple
or
that
simplistic
those
be
in
essence
childhood
rule
i
want
to
bring
adult
rule
to
bear
on
the
company
childhood
rule
work
from
the
outside
adult
rule
work
from
the
inside
childhood
rule
be
a
great
start
point
and
you
can
t
get
to
adult
rule
unless
you
understand
the
more
fundamental
childhood
rule
but
just
as
a
child
have
to
move
from
external
coercion
to
internal
guidance
to
reach
adulthood
a
company
have
to
encourage
its
people
to
be
guide
by
the
internal
rather
than
the
external
those
childhood
rule
become
another
sacred
cal
we
put
that
approach
in
motion
by
encourage
each
executive
to
apply
the
principle
of
strategic
planning
on
a
personal
level
our
executive
training
include
the
process
of
help
and
encourage
each
executive
to
arrive
at
an
individual
value
statement
and
work
from
there
on
a
company
basis
we
look
at
the
way
we
make
decision
as
well
there
be
always
the
risk
that
management
will
get
out
of
touch
with
the
reality
of
life
in
the
store
so
we
try
to
require
that
before
any
instructional
memo
go
out
to
the
store
its
author
have
to
take
the
action
it
suggest
and
successfully
implement
it
in
a
store
once
it
be
proven
to
work
it
could
be
put
on
paper
and
mail
out
it
be
in
keep
with
our
notion
that
the
real
genius
in
the
company
lay
with
the
employee
in
the
store
because
they
be
in
closest
contact
with
customer
and
day
to
day
problem
nevertheless
that
be
somehow
one
of
those
rule
we
be
not
always
able
to
follow
all
of
that
help
us
deal
with
a
retailing
landscape
that
have
by
the
s
change
dramatically
many
of
the
old
giant
have
disappear
or
be
in
trouble
wal
mart
have
grown
in
twenty
five
year
from
to
store
and
since
we
study
everything
we
knew
that
sale
in
dg
store
be
well
if
they
be
within
a
mile
of
a
wal
mart
since
wal
mart
chose
great
location
and
drew
even
more
customer
to
the
area
many
of
the
chain
that
have
follow
our
example
be
flourish
still
when
retailer
gather
you
could
hear
many
of
them
complain
about
the
fact
that
there
be
no
more
customer
loyalty
the
way
i
look
at
it
customer
grant
loyalty
when
retailer
earn
it
and
it
have
to
be
earn
every
day
i
always
thought
that
when
a
retailer
begin
complain
about
customer
loyalty
he
have
somehow
fall
short
of
earn
that
loyalty
our
customer
have
always
be
very
smart
they
have
to
be
give
their
struggle
they
weren
t
as
sell
on
brand
loyalty
they
weren
t
as
interested
in
keep
up
with
the
jones
they
be
struggle
to
keep
up
with
life
at
a
time
when
it
take
two
paycheck
to
keep
family
afloat
people
paid
attention
to
economics
we
knew
the
best
thing
we
could
do
be
to
dig
more
deeply
into
our
found
concept
dollar
pricing
meant
you
could
check
customer
out
quickly
small
store
be
less
intimidate
and
they
make
it
easy
to
keep
up
with
what
be
sell
and
keep
track
of
inventory
and
since
we
be
sell
basic
we
be
not
as
vulnerable
to
change
fashion
as
other
merchant
we
knew
economics
would
always
force
low
income
customer
to
know
value
and
we
knew
there
be
a
real
niche
in
retailing
for
a
low
cost
provider
of
basic
thing
people
use
up
and
buy
when
they
run
out
such
as
soap
shampoo
toothpaste
and
the
like
people
don
t
replace
their
toilet
seat
very
often
they
replace
their
toilet
paper
frequently
we
want
to
be
in
stock
on
it
and
all
the
other
basic
when
our
customer
ran
out
of
them
most
retailer
at
one
point
or
another
fall
prey
to
the
temptation
to
upgrade
they
start
with
an
eye
to
value
but
then
bring
in
high
price
good
with
big
markup
in
time
of
economic
stress
the
middle
market
produce
a
lot
of
corps
we
be
fortunate
in
our
stubborn
determination
to
stay
at
the
low
end
and
serve
the
low
income
customer
there
would
be
no
french
perfume
designer
dress
or
diamond
stud
dog
collar
my
father
have
always
kept
it
simple
value
be
what
it
s
all
about
he
say
get
what
you
pay
for
know
what
you
re
buying
and
find
what
you
re
look
for
it
work
for
dollar
general
the
ninety
start
with
a
bang
the
company
be
reenergized
in
large
part
due
to
the
incentive
plan
we
put
in
place
when
we
thought
we
d
be
sell
the
company
our
bonus
package
for
manager
date
back
to
the
first
dollar
general
store
in
but
once
we
start
strategic
planning
we
begin
talk
about
expand
that
to
include
the
senior
management
group
the
people
charge
with
grow
the
company
we
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
measure
the
effectiveness
of
the
strategic
initiative
they
undertook
and
ultimately
we
decide
it
should
be
company
performance
as
reflect
in
profitability
return
on
asset
if
we
be
perform
for
the
shareholder
we
would
get
a
bonus
it
seem
to
be
a
great
way
to
ensure
teamwork
and
cooperation
provide
an
incentive
to
low
that
all
important
cost
to
sale
ratio
perhaps
most
important
compensation
would
not
be
target
to
individual
group
performance
would
be
the
key
as
we
sought
to
include
as
much
of
management
as
possible
in
what
amount
to
real
ownership
in
the
company
i
view
a
lot
of
this
through
the
lens
of
my
life
as
a
practice
backsliding
methodist
which
let
me
evolve
my
own
take
on
what
my
dad
say
i
only
expect
the
competition
to
do
everything
it
can
to
me
people
be
basically
self
center
look
out
for
their
own
interest
it
s
built
into
us
as
a
survival
mechanism
still
it
s
an
instinct
we
need
to
overcome
and
the
way
to
get
over
human
selfishness
be
first
to
see
that
we
all
have
it
and
to
forgive
one
another
and
then
to
recognize
that
all
of
us
be
in
need
of
help
and
cooperation
we
can
turn
that
innate
selfishness
to
good
by
help
one
another
to
attain
mutual
success
collaboration
then
be
the
process
of
raise
individual
selfishness
to
group
cooperation
and
accomplishment
which
can
spur
the
group
or
the
organization
the
nation
or
the
planet
to
great
success
in
our
case
we
need
to
recognize
that
meeting
our
customer
need
and
want
be
our
key
to
success
everyone
in
the
company
have
to
pull
in
the
same
direction
to
get
that
do
our
employee
stock
option
program
encourage
us
to
do
just
that
and
it
be
show
remarkable
result
sometime
in
i
be
talk
to
one
of
our
field
person
about
our
obvious
success
and
he
say
there
be
two
reason
our
store
carry
the
basic
at
the
right
price
and
all
our
people
have
stock
option
a
year
later
we
expand
and
formalize
our
profit
share
under
a
program
call
teamshare
it
extend
both
profit
share
and
stock
option
to
store
manager
and
assistant
store
manager
with
at
least
two
year
on
the
job
manager
would
have
share
under
option
and
assistant
manager
that
more
than
double
the
pool
of
employee
with
performance
base
stock
option
to
as
far
as
i
knew
we
be
the
only
retail
company
to
do
that
not
all
of
the
manager
even
knew
what
stock
option
be
so
i
use
the
newsletter
column
to
attempt
an
explanation
a
share
of
stock
be
an
ownership
stake
in
the
company
and
its
profit
its
price
reflect
the
health
of
the
company
generally
as
the
company
do
well
its
stock
price
rise
grant
a
stock
option
the
right
to
purchase
a
give
number
of
share
at
a
set
price
be
a
mean
of
extend
company
ownership
the
option
be
available
at
that
same
price
for
a
period
that
may
not
expire
for
year
if
the
stock
rise
that
option
becomes
more
valuable
as
you
may
be
able
to
buy
for
a
stock
that
be
now
worth
so
there
s
a
great
incentive
to
work
hard
to
make
the
company
more
successful
as
reflect
in
a
high
stock
price
my
hope
be
always
that
the
prospect
of
wealth
would
become
the
prospect
of
serve
others
in
a
deeper
and
well
way
because
they
be
one
and
the
same
success
be
base
on
satisfied
customer
it
be
only
if
we
could
truly
deliver
on
our
mission
of
give
them
a
well
life
that
the
company
would
succeed
enough
to
make
all
the
holder
of
dg
stock
option
rich
at
the
same
time
we
be
pour
thought
and
money
into
our
warehouse
spending
million
to
streamline
distribution
we
redesign
our
homerville
georgia
facility
and
convert
the
one
in
scottsville
from
manual
operation
to
automation
complete
a
million
warehouse
know
as
building
which
feature
state
of
the
art
distribution
equipment
include
computer
operate
conveyor
belt
bar
cod
shipping
label
and
starburst
laser
scanner
we
be
now
shipping
to
ninety
six
store
from
twenty
four
load
dock
in
scottsville
alone
we
add
fifty
three
employee
and
work
them
hard
the
amount
of
overtime
in
scottsville
and
homerville
jumped
from
hour
to
in
one
year
we
also
add
seven
new
buyer
two
merchandise
manager
and
a
director
of
merchandise
administration
what
s
more
in
spite
of
the
aggressive
agenda
of
change
total
employee
turnover
drop
by
percent
in
we
double
the
size
of
the
homerville
center
at
an
additional
cost
of
million
and
gradually
we
open
up
new
distribution
center
in
ardmore
oklahoma
and
south
boston
virginia
we
would
soon
invest
million
in
automate
cash
register
for
all
our
store
as
well
behind
those
fact
and
figure
lay
the
reality
that
the
early
ninety
represent
a
sea
change
in
the
way
we
sent
out
merchandise
when
i
say
we
be
convert
our
warehouse
from
manual
operation
i
mean
people
have
be
push
two
wheeler
around
inside
the
building
wonder
where
thing
be
it
be
a
best
guess
operation
since
they
didn
t
know
what
the
store
really
need
and
be
scar
to
rely
on
manager
to
order
the
correct
item
and
quantity
our
new
buyer
be
look
at
customer
pull
not
buyer
push
in
line
with
the
approach
we
have
undertaken
since
our
first
implementation
of
strategic
planning
new
technology
in
the
form
of
a
mar
order
system
let
us
keep
track
of
precisely
what
be
sell
store
by
store
and
the
buyer
set
about
cream
the
line
to
figure
out
the
percent
of
each
category
of
merchandise
that
generate
percent
of
the
sale
that
s
what
we
have
to
be
stock
then
it
be
a
matter
of
keep
merchandise
flow
to
the
store
on
a
frequent
and
predictable
basis
we
have
hop
to
be
move
to
carton
a
day
out
of
scottsville
in
the
wake
of
these
improvement
and
it
actually
turn
out
to
be
over
we
have
come
a
long
way
since
the
day
when
store
manager
take
out
the
backseat
of
their
car
so
we
could
stuff
a
lot
of
whatever
we
have
into
them
then
there
be
shrinkage
merchandise
be
go
to
disappear
our
problem
have
settle
down
quite
a
bit
since
the
day
after
we
d
take
on
the
eagle
store
in
florida
but
at
one
point
in
the
head
of
operation
and
merchandising
come
to
me
say
it
have
gotten
bad
again
the
loss
prevention
department
want
more
money
so
it
can
do
more
of
what
it
s
do
he
say
but
it
s
obvious
it
isn
t
work
i
m
wonder
if
we
shouldn
t
have
them
do
less
of
what
they
re
do
why
don
t
we
cut
back
on
that
department
he
be
obviously
proud
of
what
amount
to
a
counterintuitive
suggestion
i
thought
it
be
a
great
idea
in
fact
i
didn
t
think
it
go
far
enough
i
appreciate
your
thought
i
say
and
i
accept
it
completely
in
fact
let
s
just
eliminate
the
loss
prevention
department
his
expression
be
priceless
he
never
expect
me
to
push
less
to
zero
it
make
sense
though
let
s
say
a
store
be
lose
a
lot
of
merchandise
and
the
best
guess
be
that
it
be
an
employee
the
store
manager
would
call
loss
prevention
and
they
might
send
in
somebody
from
a
shopping
service
to
catch
the
dishonest
employee
then
the
loss
prevention
people
would
come
in
and
get
the
confession
which
would
be
turn
over
to
a
district
manager
who
would
come
in
and
do
the
fire
now
the
clerk
know
he
s
go
to
be
fire
but
there
s
a
delay
until
the
district
manager
can
get
there
to
make
it
official
so
he
s
get
day
or
even
a
couple
of
week
to
steal
more
with
nothing
more
to
lose
in
the
meantime
you
have
to
hire
a
replacement
and
since
you
re
do
it
quickly
you
don
t
have
time
for
a
thorough
screen
so
you
might
end
up
with
someone
who
s
just
as
dishonest
overall
that
s
address
the
symptom
not
the
disease
play
cop
and
robber
be
not
loss
prevention
it
s
deal
with
loss
on
the
back
end
rather
than
the
front
end
so
why
not
let
the
operator
the
manager
and
assistant
manager
back
up
by
the
district
manager
take
charge
of
the
total
operation
of
that
store
include
loss
control
you
re
bring
accountability
closer
to
the
action
so
you
should
be
more
effective
in
control
it
in
this
case
we
make
it
clear
that
shrinkage
affected
bonus
if
they
could
stop
it
at
the
store
level
their
year
end
check
would
be
large
we
figure
that
would
inspire
sufficient
self
police
to
make
a
difference
the
clerk
would
report
a
manager
who
be
steal
good
just
as
readily
as
a
manager
would
report
a
clerk
so
that
s
what
we
do
above
all
we
make
it
clear
that
the
best
thing
they
could
do
as
operator
be
to
make
sure
we
hire
the
right
people
in
the
first
place
then
make
sure
the
operating
culture
be
right
and
it
work
our
shrinkage
to
sale
ratio
drop
from
percent
in
to
percent
a
year
later
without
a
loss
prevention
department
the
early
ninety
also
saw
four
straight
year
of
double
digit
same
store
gain
six
month
figure
end
july
show
a
percent
leap
in
earnings
on
a
sale
increase
of
percent
to
million
net
sale
for
the
fiscal
year
be
well
over
million
up
percent
net
income
be
million
up
a
remarkable
percent
the
company
whose
economic
growth
once
prompt
my
dad
to
whisper
to
his
father
that
we
have
pass
a
million
dollar
in
profit
be
now
approach
a
billion
dollar
in
sale
just
as
financial
incentive
for
employee
fed
those
increase
the
increase
fed
employee
compensation
across
the
board
the
turner
of
course
benefit
greatly
from
all
this
although
i
have
long
recognize
the
great
gap
between
the
life
of
the
turner
and
people
like
that
poor
old
farmer
buying
panty
for
his
wife
when
i
be
a
teenage
sale
clerk
i
never
felt
rich
until
sometime
after
the
company
have
move
to
nashville
in
we
have
always
be
conservative
in
term
of
the
salary
we
have
drawn
from
the
company
in
fact
i
remember
my
sister
laura
jo
ask
me
to
come
out
to
her
house
in
scottsville
once
cal
jr
she
say
when
will
the
company
ever
pay
my
husband
a
living
wage
laura
jo
i
say
i
don
t
know
that
be
just
the
way
my
dad
be
i
remember
talk
to
her
husband
wayne
many
year
later
and
say
wayne
do
you
know
that
when
i
come
out
of
the
navy
and
go
to
work
for
my
dad
i
take
a
cut
in
pay
wayne
with
his
rich
southern
accent
say
cal
juniah
when
i
come
to
work
for
your
fathah
i
also
take
a
cut
in
pay
and
i
have
be
a
schoolteachah
in
the
wake
of
all
that
have
happen
that
be
no
longer
the
case
that
left
one
member
of
the
family
look
at
a
possible
career
my
son
calister
have
work
in
dollar
general
store
during
high
school
and
of
course
he
be
steep
in
the
culture
as
i
have
be
when
i
be
young
he
also
knew
the
turmoil
the
family
have
be
through
in
the
late
eighty
and
that
i
didn
t
want
him
to
go
through
that
i
have
told
him
i
didn
t
want
him
to
join
the
company
still
one
day
he
say
dad
i
love
dollar
general
if
there
be
a
job
available
in
the
company
i
d
be
qualify
for
be
it
all
right
if
i
apply
i
say
before
you
even
apply
i
want
you
to
discus
it
with
me
there
might
have
be
something
in
my
voice
that
nail
down
what
he
knew
of
my
sentiment
because
that
be
the
end
of
that
he
never
talk
about
work
for
dollar
general
again
and
he
go
on
to
make
his
own
mark
in
nashville
at
about
that
time
i
receive
one
of
the
big
shock
of
my
life
my
dad
call
me
into
his
office
one
day
and
say
son
i
need
to
tell
you
something
i
don
t
want
you
to
think
ill
of
me
if
you
ever
take
a
look
at
my
estate
and
you
can
t
figure
out
what
happen
to
the
nine
million
dollar
i
get
from
our
public
offering
in
that
be
the
deal
my
dad
have
call
off
and
then
restart
it
baffle
me
at
the
time
but
i
d
just
let
it
go
after
he
adamantly
decline
to
answer
my
question
i
hadn
t
thought
about
that
million
since
the
deal
but
now
of
course
my
ear
perked
up
he
pause
in
truth
he
say
at
that
time
mr
guy
comer
own
half
of
our
company
he
and
i
have
a
letter
of
agreement
on
the
side
sign
by
both
of
us
guy
comer
have
own
washington
manufacturing
company
in
nashville
they
make
overall
then
jean
and
later
sportswear
he
be
a
good
friend
of
my
dad
s
and
a
father
figure
to
him
from
the
early
day
of
the
company
i
remember
their
get
together
to
talk
about
business
at
our
house
but
i
have
no
idea
he
own
half
the
company
this
be
completely
out
of
the
blue
my
dad
say
that
in
the
late
fifty
he
want
to
carry
many
of
the
good
mr
comer
be
manufacturing
they
work
up
a
deal
where
mr
comer
would
provide
quite
a
lot
of
them
in
exchange
for
half
the
company
they
never
told
anyone
they
didn
t
even
bring
in
a
lawyer
they
drew
up
a
simple
agreement
and
sign
it
all
of
the
common
stock
be
issue
to
turner
family
member
when
we
go
public
and
no
one
but
my
father
and
mr
comer
knew
that
he
own
half
of
it
i
be
the
one
talk
to
wall
street
analyst
and
the
sec
and
i
have
no
idea
of
the
true
state
of
our
ownership
my
dad
knew
i
would
have
be
unable
to
function
with
that
knowledge
so
he
kept
it
from
me
if
i
d
know
i
would
have
be
guilty
of
falsify
statement
and
the
ramification
would
have
be
huge
mr
comer
die
in
and
as
they
be
settle
his
estate
his
management
call
my
dad
and
ask
to
meet
with
him
my
dad
take
his
personal
accountant
ed
lynch
to
the
meeting
because
no
one
at
dollar
general
knew

paul
say
washington
manufacturing
brought
the
price
down
and
my
dad
bought
them
out
that
s
where
the
million
from
our
issuance
of
stock
have
go
in
our
representation
of
ownership
in
various
turner
name
in
the
prospectus
be
untrue
that
s
why
he
call
off
the
sale
while
negotiate
who
be
really
the
owner
of
that
portion
of
the
company
he
couldn
t
tell
me
this
at
the
time
because
i
be
innocently
represent
that
the
family
own
percent
of
the
company
s
stock
now
at
this
point
my
dad
simply
want
me
to
know
that
he
hadn
t
squander
the
money
even
with
the
episode
well
in
the
past
i
wasn
t
about
to
share
the
revelation
with
anybody
else
in
fact
it
would
be
more
than
twenty
year
before
i
told
a
soul

serve
others
a
mission
that
matter
we
learn
the
lesson
of
strategic
planning
and
the
application
of
mission
statement
as
we
go
and
one
of
the
key
lesson
be
that
neither
be
worth
much
unless
it
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
culture
and
operation
of
the
company
that
be
true
for
all
of
our
constituency
when
it
come
to
our
boss
the
person
who
believe
in
us
enough
to
put
their
retirement
fund
at
risk
in
our
stock
we
be
commit
to
deliver
not
just
great
result
but
superior
return
on
their
investment
make
that
happen
for
shareholder
depend
on
our
other
critically
important
constituency
our
employee
and
our
customer
tie
it
all
together
be
the
phrase
serve
others
and
in
we
revisit
our
mission
statement
expand
it
to
make
clear
how
serve
others
impact
every
constituent
group
it
read
our
mission
serve
others
our
customer
with
great
everyday
value
our
shareholder
with
superior
return
on
investment
our
employee
as
partner
in
total
development
for
employee
the
mission
of
serve
others
color
everything
do
at
work
in
keep
with
a
truth
of
the
retailing
business
that
date
back
before
the
first
turner
store
exist
and
be
in
effect
to
this
day
our
employee
work
long
and
hard
but
those
grueling
store
hour
be
essential
to
serve
our
customer
with
the
great
everyday
value
which
be
our
opportunity
to
help
give
them
a
well
life
furthermore
serve
others
rather
than
self
be
our
opportunity
to
partner
with
fellow
employee
to
accomplish
their
total
development
most
of
those
employee
be
woman
i
think
retailing
do
as
serve
others
have
a
feminine
quality
a
mother
dynamic
a
store
becomes
a
home
to
customer
a
place
where
they
be
always
welcome
when
they
go
in
they
be
greet
in
a
way
that
say
you
be
special
they
be
give
concerned
care
attention
of
course
the
store
be
clean
and
neat
and
the
price
be
low
the
mother
dynamic
also
include
toughness
and
hard
work
housekeep
and
storekeeping
involve
lot
of
work
that
must
be
do
over
and
over
and
the
personal
requirement
of
both
be
love
patience
and
sweat
give
the
family
dynamic
of
the
company
one
of
the
criticism
direct
at
us
really
stung
we
get
plenty
of
letter
in
those
day
about
the
fact
that
on
sunday
and
holiday
we
close
our
office
and
distribution
center
but
not
our
store
christmas
and
easter
be
the
only
day
the
store
close
why
people
would
write
do
a
retail
organization
with
spiritual
and
family
value
not
honor
the
majority
of
its
employee
with
much
deserve
time
off
on
sunday
and
holiday
frankly
the
subject
always
bother
me
those
letter
begin
almost
as
soon
as
we
open
our
store
for
business
on
sunday
in
and
a
lot
of
those
letter
come
from
minister
my
reply
to
them
be
aggressive
reverend
jones
i
would
write
i
share
your
regret
about
our
store
be
open
on
sunday
but
unfortunately
the
majority
of
your
congregation
want
to
shop
with
us
on
sunday
until
you
can
change
their
mind
about
that
from
the
pulpit
we
will
have
to
keep
our
store
open
on
sunday
may
your
ministry
become
more
effective
i
have
to
admit
that
i
now
feel
bad
about
that
answer
particularly
since
i
have
seriously
consider
the
ministry
and
should
not
have
criticize
the
effectiveness
of
anyone
call
to
preach
i
always
felt
bad
about
our
store
employee
have
to
work
on
sunday
and
holiday
but
give
our
customer
well
life
and
honor
our
shareholder
investment
require
our
store
to
be
open
and
sell
consumable
basic
anytime
our
customer
need
them
and
we
encourage
employee
who
do
not
routinely
work
seven
day
a
week
to
have
life
balance
in
work
recreation
and
leisure
what
i
say
at
the
time
be
perhaps
there
be
a
great
blessing
in
minister
to
mankind
on
sunday
or
holiday
than
in
minister
to
self
or
even
to
family
there
be
other
policy
that
fit
with
the
family
s
attitude
about
business
for
one
we
never
take
credit
card
back
then
my
dad
have
always
be
against
it
and
i
inherit
his
disdain
for
them
credit
card
would
have
work
against
the
simple
value
orient
nature
of
our
concept
our
whole
business
be
built
on
the
simplicity
of
the
cash
transaction
at
the
store
for
item
we
sell
at
the
low
possible
price
our
customer
visit
us
frequently
and
bought
just
what
they
need
at
the
time
of
need
and
it
be
all
cash
in
those
day
credit
card
company
charge
about
percent
on
each
transaction
and
that
be
our
net
profit
margin
we
do
not
want
to
charge
our
customer
more
or
have
to
hire
more
people
at
our
headquarters
to
deal
with
the
credit
card
company
and
all
the
related
paperwork
and
expense
but
we
use
to
hear
about
it
now
and
then
my
friend
martha
ingram
a
nashvillian
who
in
become
chairman
and
ceo
of
ingram
industry
and
who
be
know
for
her
commitment
to
and
generosity
toward
the
art
community
have
a
summer
home
in
the
blue
ridge
mountain
of
north
carolina
one
day
she
go
to
our
store
in
the
town
of
cashier
to
stock
up
she
come
to
the
checkout
with
a
shopping
cart
full
of
stuff
and
offer
the
clerk
her
credit
card
we
don
t
take
credit
card
the
cashier
told
her
she
pull
out
her
checkbook
and
when
the
clerk
saw
she
be
from
tennessee
she
say
we
don
t
take
out
of
state
check
well
martha
say
be
it
okay
if
i
put
my
cart
to
the
side
here
and
find
an
atm
and
get
cash
and
the
cashier
assure
her
it
be
not
long
afterward
she
say
to
me
so
much
for
the
thought
that
we
live
in
a
paperless
society
the
next
year
as
she
be
get
ready
to
go
back
to
the
mountain
she
say
cal
be
you
go
to
take
my
credit
card
this
year
no
i
say
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
re
not
martha
but
we
re
work
on
debit
card
so
we
can
accept
your
food
stamp
fortunately
she
have
a
good
laugh
about
that
that
and
all
the
other
cost
cut
move
we
undertook
as
a
matter
of
principle
continued
to
pay
off
in
our
operating
cost
as
a
percentage
of
sale
be
down
from
to
percent
and
i
be
start
to
think
percent
be
possible
i
hadn
t
announce
it
or
commit
to
it
yet
but
i
thought
i
would
indeed
make
it
a
goal
soon
enough
by
now
everyone
have
caught
on
to
the
kind
of
roll
we
be
on
dollar
general
stock
appreciate
percent
in
alone
hit
a
record
high
of
on
september
we
be
roar
in
we
open
store
and
we
plan
to
open
at
least
as
many
in
in
the
fall
of
senior
management
take
a
week
to
make
plan
for
the
next
five
year
the
excitement
be
electric
we
be
convince
we
could
keep
the
spectacular
growth
trend
of
the
first
half
of
the
ninety
go
through
the
second
half
we
do
feel
that
we
need
a
statement
of
strategy
to
guide
our
entire
team
and
in
look
over
our
progress
we
agree
that
our
system
of
reward
spur
people
to
do
their
best
work
since
we
hadn
t
micromanaged
that
we
didn
t
need
to
start
now
we
didn
t
want
control
interfere
with
the
performance
of
good
people
want
to
demonstrate
what
they
could
do
it
go
back
to
my
childhood
where
my
mother
give
us
value
that
would
serve
us
far
well
than
restrictive
control
she
believe
in
us
and
we
developed
belief
in
ourselves
it
be
the
most
productive
growth
influence
we
could
have
have
it
s
the
way
i
want
to
position
the
company
move
from
my
dad
s
external
control
to
a
value
base
internal
dynamic
the
statement
we
come
up
with
be
this
the
least
control
for
the
most
development
of
our
niche
the
statement
of
company
value
also
rewrite
that
week
include
this
sentence
we
believe
that
productivity
be
attain
by
emphasize
strength
in
a
positive
environment
not
by
dwell
on
weakness
in
an
environment
of
guilt
and
blame
set
people
in
motion
with
value
and
a
mission
we
reason
and
let
them
do
what
they
do
best
i
sum
up
our
approach
to
a
reporter
this
way
we
be
try
to
be
a
neighborhood
store
that
be
customer
friendly
that
be
one
smooth
function
unit
of
a
distribution
network
we
distribute
the
basic
to
low
income
people
we
don
t
run
sale
or
stress
fashion
at
christmas
our
best
sell
item
might
be
toilet
paper
it
wasn
t
glamorous
but
it
work
analyst
love
us
dollar
general
have
become
so
feverish
in
keep
its
price
down
say
craig
weichmann
of
morgan
keegan
company
they
be
emerge
as
the
price
leader
in
the
community
in
their
overwhelm
success
the
last
five
year
they
truly
have
pass
on
saving
to
the
consumer
and
consumer
have
reward
them
with
strong
sale
growth
weichmann
cite
a
discount
store
price
survey
in
which
he
found
dg
s
price
on
sample
product
to
be
to
percent
below
wal
mart
s
the
year
temper
our
optimism
a
bit
as
our
growth
be
slow
although
still
solid
in
january
we
plan
on
give
out
the
fourth
straight
payout
under
our
teamshare
profit
share
program
for
executive
store
manager
and
assistant
manager
but
it
turn
out
there
be
way
to
game
the
system
something
that
s
just
a
fact
of
business
life
all
at
once
we
could
tell
there
be
excessive
claim
charge
nonexistent
markdowns
to
the
warehouse
then
sell
the
merchandise
at
full
price
we
d
be
lenient
and
they
be
take
advantage
of
us
on
march
i
sent
a
memo
to
store
manager
and
district
manager
announce
a
teamshare
bonus
adjustment
as
the
result
of
slow
sale
when
it
become
clear
that
it
be
even
bad
than
we
thought
i
announce
that
teamshare
bonus
would
be
withdrawn
altogether
something
that
affected
office
and
distribution
center
employee
as
well
as
store
employee
i
get
lobby
hard
on
that
one
and
after
a
bit
of
internal
debate
i
change
my
mind
our
system
create
some
real
problem
and
some
employee
take
advantage
of
that
i
say
i
didn
t
want
them
to
take
advantage
of
other
employee
and
shareholder
but
i
realize
there
be
no
way
to
make
this
come
out
right
without
hurt
a
lot
of
good
loyal
hardworking
employee
the
decision
cost
million
and
will
reward
a
few
dishonest
people
we
put
into
place
tighten
security
measure
when
it
come
to
processing
delivery
and
resist
call
for
accept
credit
card
which
the
company
didn
t
do
until
a
year
after
i
left
take
together
all
of
those
cost
cut
measure
combine
with
record
sale
help
boost
us
pretty
quickly
right
back
into
record
territory
throughout
my
year
with
the
company
our
realize
gross
profit
margin
range
between
and
percent
it
never
hit
our
competition
be
generally
in
the
s
and
part
of
the
reason
lay
in
our
different
approach
our
competitor
have
a
broader
assortment
of
merchandise
and
great
markup
to
cover
their
high
expense
our
focus
be
on
a
limited
assortment
and
low
everyday
price
keep
a
tight
rein
on
cost
we
kept
bring
operating
expense
down
finally
in
fact
we
set
that
goal
of
bring
them
under
percent
of
sale
we
be
run
a
pretty
tight
ship
in
most
area
and
i
d
even
be
rethink
advertising
which
at
one
time
amount
to
percent
of
sale
or
more
than
million
per
year
advertising
wasn
t
the
necessity
it
would
seem
to
be
and
it
actually
give
us
problem
our
store
be
scatter
in
small
town
over
a
wide
area
which
make
it
difficult
for
us
to
get
every
item
offer
in
a
direct
mail
sale
brochure
out
of
our
warehouse
into
our
truck
and
out
to
every
store
by
a
print
sale
deadline
and
if
an
item
prove
to
be
especially
popular
we
never
seem
to
have
enough
of
it
in
store
customer
get
frustrate
they
d
show
up
and
we
d
have
to
give
them
rain
check
more
often
we
d
ship
merchandise
that
wouldn
t
sell
completely
and
we
d
have
the
cost
of
unsold
inventory
plus
the
cost
of
all
those
truck
roll
and
warehouse
hustle
to
get
good
out
into
the
store
then
our
truck
would
be
so
load
with
sale
merchandise
that
we
sometimes
wouldn
t
have
room
to
ship
the
basic
i
thought
wait
a
minute
why
can
t
we
be
the
one
retailer
with
the
gut
to
stop
this
advertising
madness
we
could
eliminate
that
percent
of
cost
against
sale
low
our
price
and
give
well
value
to
the
customer
we
would
also
be
more
consistently
in
stock
on
everyday
item
because
the
truck
wouldn
t
be
full
of
advertised
good
and
low
cost
would
mean
low
everyday
price
which
be
what
we
be
all
about
i
get
input
from
everybody
and
i
can
t
say
anybody
saw
it
completely
the
way
i
do
nobody
in
our
business
operate
without
this
kind
of
advertising
my
mind
be
make
up
though
we
d
be
run
company
wide
circular
for
year
as
many
as
thirteen
of
them
in
a
year
but
our
best
advertising
be
word
of
mouth
and
i
be
convince
it
be
all
we
need
we
go
through
withdrawal
each
time
we
decide
not
to
print
a
company
wide
circular
and
we
take
short
term
sale
hit
up
to
or
percent
at
first
but
i
be
confident
that
use
that
money
to
low
price
would
boost
sale
in
the
long
run
in
we
print
just
five
circular
and
we
gradually
get
the
number
down
to
two
and
then
to
zero
in
the
process
we
lower
our
advertising
cost
from
percent
to
less
than
percent
sale
bounce
back
quickly
and
soon
outpace
what
we
d
be
do
by
with
advertising
cost
on
the
wane
we
saw
our
operating
expense
as
a
percentage
of
sale
come
down
to
percent
in
fact
in
the
five
year
we
discontinue
advertising
we
have
the
high
gain
in
same
store
sale
in
our
segment
of
retailing
and
maybe
in
all
retailing
the
truth
be
we
have
well
sale
when
we
stop
advertising
they
be
well
than
the
sale
of
our
competitor
who
continued
to
advertise
we
understood
our
customer
who
bought
when
she
need
something
at
the
best
price
she
could
find
if
she
didn
t
need
it
a
low
price
wasn
t
go
to
entice
her
to
buy
it
low
everyday
price
increase
sale
it
be
a
gutsy
and
scary
move
to
undertake
and
it
prove
to
be
very
profitable
in
january
total
sale
be
up
by
percent
and
same
store
sale
by
percent
there
be
a
lot
more
go
on
we
add
a
whole
new
department
nonperishable
food
to
our
store
result
in
the
reconfiguration
of
every
store
in
the
company
store
in
the
first
six
month
alone
we
instal
scanner
at
the
checkout
which
help
with
checkout
speed
and
accuracy
they
help
with
one
aspect
of
shrinkage
you
couldn
t
ring
up
an
item
at
a
low
price
for
instance
although
it
be
still
possible
to
bypass
the
register
altogether
the
scanner
be
part
of
a
move
to
position
new
technology
throughout
the
company
to
prepare
for
more
growth
which
be
well
under
way
we
open
a
record
number
of
new
store
and
a
new
distribution
center
that
year
it
be
a
performance
i
didn
t
think
anybody
else
in
the
business
could
have
pull
off
and
i
say
so
in
our
annual
report
if
eliminate
advertising
be
counterintuitive
perhaps
a
merchandising
strategy
we
inaugurate
at
the
time
be
too
we
decide
to
reduce
the
number
of
item
with
high
profit
margin
mainly
clothing
in
their
place
come
low
margin
but
faster
sell
general
merchandise
such
as
paper
towel
and
detergent
we
also
add
hundred
of
so
call
consumable
item
mainly
snack
food
to
increase
customer
traffic
we
more
than
double
the
number
of
item
we
carry
in
each
store
and
narrow
our
profit
margin
but
the
increase
sale
more
than
compensate
at
first
we
couldn
t
stock
the
shelf
fast
enough
but
once
we
get
that
part
of
the
equation
down
we
enjoy
yet
another
boost
in
profit
in
march
we
report
that
same
store
sale
for
february
be
up
percent
and
dollar
general
stock
jumped
percent
on
the
news
the
next
morning
we
make
the
the
wall
street
journal
i
call
my
dad
and
i
could
hear
the
tear
of
joy
in
his
voice
as
i
told
him
the
company
be
do
well
than
he
could
ever
have
imagine
we
carry
billion
in
inventory
and
have
spent
million
just
on
capital
improvement
that
year
they
be
unbelievable
number
give
where
he
d
come
from
my
dad
still
look
at
sale
figure
and
he
be
as
proud
of
dollar
general
as
he
have
ever
be
he
be
eighty
two
and
frailer
than
i
like
but
he
be
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
company
thanks
to
the
great
run
we
be
on
i
be
just
as
enthusiastic

selective
unscrew
we
hadn
t
mention
vendor
in
our
company
mission
statement
but
we
knew
they
be
critically
important
to
our
success
my
dad
always
consider
them
to
be
partner
in
deliver
great
value
to
our
struggle
customer
he
want
the
relationship
to
be
cooperative
we
should
not
engage
in
the
typical
retailer
s
gamesmanship
when
it
come
to
negotiate
with
vendor
our
number
one
vendor
at
the
time
be
procter
gamble
one
of
the
world
s
large
and
best
know
corporation
and
one
day
p
g
s
chairman
john
pepper
come
to
our
nashville
office
to
meet
with
our
executive
and
thank
us
for
our
business
john
want
to
explore
opportunity
for
an
even
well
relationship
he
ask
for
some
one
on
one
time
with
me
and
i
thought
about
how
far
dollar
general
have
come
and
how
pleased
luther
turner
would
have
be
that
a
turner
s
opinion
would
be
of
interest
to
that
kind
of
corporate
leader
the
meeting
signal
that
we
have
grown
enough
for
them
to
want
a
real
partnership
john
look
as
if
he
have
come
out
of
central
cast
he
be
impeccably
dress
polished
and
dignify
with
gray
hair
and
glass
he
be
button
down
and
a
bit
formal
something
make
me
want
to
tweak
that
to
bring
a
little
of
the
turner
earthiness
to
bear
on
our
conversation
i
be
in
the
habit
of
give
my
executive
study
bible
i
chose
the
unusual
gesture
of
give
one
to
him
and
then
say
john
would
you
like
to
know
the
real
strategic
genius
of
dollar
general
yes
he
say
look
very
interested
what
be
it
cal
well
i
told
him
our
past
have
always
be
screw
up
and
every
year
we
just
selectively
unscrew
a
bit
that
certainly
put
a
different
expression
on
his
face
i
could
almost
see
him
think
how
on
earth
do
i
react
to
that
behind
the
irreverence
of
my
statement
there
be
a
point
i
want
to
make
the
strategic
secret
of
dollar
general
lie
in
its
past
we
freely
admit
we
have
never
operate
our
company
to
its
full
potential
and
management
be
genuinely
interested
in
learn
the
truth
from
frontline
employee
who
experience
and
analyze
company
problem
firsthand
one
of
the
fine
example
of
that
come
when
we
decide
to
tinker
with
one
of
our
best
seller
a
three
pack
of
microwave
popcorn
that
sell
for
let
s
give
them
an
eight
pack
for
two
dollar
we
say
and
that
s
what
we
do
we
figure
customer
couldn
t
resist
the
add
value
and
we
d
be
generate
a
sale
instead
of
a
sale
the
problem
be
that
popcorn
sale
fell
nobody
could
figure
out
why
it
wasn
t
a
big
success
we
finally
go
into
the
store
and
ask
and
our
people
there
told
us
our
customer
could
only
afford
to
spend
at
a
time
for
something
like
popcorn
we
have
lose
some
of
our
essential
understand
of
our
customer
an
understand
our
store
employee
still
have
all
company
have
problem
the
progressive
one
develop
the
management
and
culture
to
solve
problem
holistically
every
year
we
improve
a
little
bit
and
a
little
bit
of
improvement
at
a
company
like
dollar
general
be
powerful
in
order
to
understand
dollar
general
and
the
turner
family
s
way
of
think
about
life
and
business
john
be
go
to
have
to
see
the
common
sense
and
ego
management
that
ground
us
he
be
proffer
all
of
procter
gamble
s
finely
hone
logistical
prowess
to
a
company
whose
cofounder
use
to
say
shuck
the
only
inventory
control
i
have
be
the
four
wall
of
my
warehouse
because
he
couldn
t
buy
any
more
than
he
could
fit
inside
i
knew
that
behind
all
the
expertise
and
the
closer
tie
they
be
offering
the
bottom
line
be
that
this
be
a
way
for
p
g
to
get
more
business
from
dollar
general
a
potential
win
for
both
company
in
the
brief
time
we
have
together
i
want
to
cut
through
the
formality
and
yet
emphasize
that
our
bottom
line
be
do
more
for
our
customer
i
want
every
vendor
big
or
small
to
know
it
have
to
support
the
relationship
we
have
with
our
customer
which
involve
use
low
price
on
consumable
basic
to
help
give
them
a
well
life
p
g
be
look
to
help
us
move
merchandise
through
our
store
faster
and
they
be
promising
to
help
with
the
supply
side
of
that
equation
they
say
we
could
get
our
inventory
turn
the
rate
at
which
merchandise
flow
through
the
company
to
six
time
a
year
that
meant
with
ninety
day
term
our
vendor
expect
payment
ninety
day
after
we
receive
the
merchandise
we
d
be
sell
merchandise
before
we
paid
for
it
we
d
never
be
out
of
stock
and
we
could
sell
more
with
less
shelf
space
of
course
we
could
fill
that
leftover
shelf
space
with
more
p
g
product
the
meeting
and
follow
up
be
helpful
and
i
do
believe
my
kentucky
bluntness
help
set
the
tone
the
concept
of
unscrew
have
to
do
with
change
and
change
be
something
most
of
us
resist
it
may
be
simple
fear
of
the
unknown
for
we
cling
to
the
security
of
a
predictable
structure
or
pattern
although
it
s
worth

a
straight
up
comparison
give
everyone
me
include
heartburn

it
doesn

address
the
reality
of
the

talk
about
executive
who
make
a
lot
of
money
and
store
employee
we
hop
would
share
in
the
challenge
and
reward
of
run
the
company
on
the
other
end
of
the
economic
scale
we
have
customer
who
be
often
struggle
that
s
why
our
business
model
offer
quality
basic
merchandise
at
low
price
we
knew
something
else
we
could
offer
be
our
continued
support
of
literacy
program
and
one
outgrowth
of
that
effort
be
something
i
m
still
proud
of
we
met
with
some
volunteer
who
ran
a
day
care
program
in
the
neighborhood
of
nashville
s
sam
levy
housing
project
they
say
they
would
love
to
give
out
gift
certificate
redeemable
in
dollar
general
store
to
people
enrol
in
their
adult
literacy
program
as
we
talk
about
the
challenge
they
face
we
realize
that
for
all
of
our
thousand
of
store
there
wasn
t
one
close
enough
for
them
to
shop
conventional
wisdom
say
we
d
be
crazy
to
put
a
store
in
a
depressed
high
crime
neighborhood
we
d
lose
our
shirt
yet
few
resident
of
the
project
have
transportation
to
our
store
they
be
basically
trap
we
recognize
that
for
the
shame
it
be
and
start
talk
about
what
a
store
like
ours
might
contribute
to
the
neighborhood
primarily
it
could
provide
real
value
people
there
couldn
t
buy
anything
like
the
merchandise
dollar
general
carry
at
the
price
we
offer
second
our
desire
to
draw
our
employee
from
our
customer
base
meant
we
d
be
bring
one
of
the
thing
this
neighborhood
most
desperately
need
job
since
this
literacy
program
be
really
about
work
literacy
a
work
store
be
the
best
thing
we
could
offer
the
program
student
could
learn
on
the
job
and
the
neighborhood
resident
could
be
take
ownership
of
the
store
this
be
a
chance
to
offer
real
help
in
the
form
of
paycheck
they
have
day
care
and
transportation
wasn
t
an
issue
since
we
d
bring
the
job
and
training
to
where
they
live
this
have
the
potential
to
be
a
real
success
story
and
we
begin
to
get
excite
about
it
we
want
to
start
out
quietly
no
press
no
publicity
we
knew
this
be
a
store
with
big
failure
prospect
and
as
a
public
company
we
want
the
option
to
close
it
if
it
didn
t
work
make
a
lot
of
noise
about
the
opening
would
make
it
very
difficult
to
do
that
as
excite
as
we
be
we
be
also
nervous
we
open
in
and
it
wasn
t
long
before
the
ywca
express
interest
in
work
with
us
we
team
up
with
them
they
even
invest
in
the
store
and
the
program
grow
under
them
in
fact
thing
go
well
for
nearly
four
year
then
in
the
midst
of
unrest
that
follow
the
fatal
shoot
of
a
resident
by
a
police
officer
the
store
be
loot
and
burn
it
be
a
huge
disappointment
to
lose
this
symbol
of
private
public
partnership
in
a
neighborhood
that
sorely
need
this
kind
of
business
presence
after
some
deliberation
i
be
happy
to
say
that
we
roll
up
our
sleeve
and
rebuilt
the
store
during
the
year
it
be
open
more
than
area
resident
go
through
job
readiness
and
life

program
we
ran
in
conjunction
with
the
ywca
the
center
have
computer
and
electronic
cash
register
and
provide
training
that
would
be
useful
in
many
kind
of
work
the
store
s
profit
help
fund
program
include
internship
at
the
store
and
those
lead
to
job
forty
of
them
in
business
other
than
our
store
we
field
a
lot
of
inquiry
about
get
other
private
public
partnership
like
this
one
go
and
we
open
other
dollar
general
store
in
poor
neighborhood
in
south
carolina
kentucky
and
tennessee
include
one
between
the
tony
sudckon
apartment
and
the
j
c
napier
home
just
off
lafayette
street
in
nashville
our
involvement
lead
to
several
award
for
the
company
but
the
statement
we
make
about
what
this
kind
of
business
can
do
for
a
neighborhood
be
even
more
satisfy

my
dad
s
final
year
still
think
about
the
customer
though
i
be
no
longer
work
with
my
dad
he
remain
proud
of
the
company
and
of
my
role
in
it
he
have
a
regular
breakfast
meeting
with
old
friend
at
a
local
diner
and
now
and
then
he
would
arrive
in
a
coat
and
tie
rather
than
his
normal
casual
clothes
that
meant
i
be
go
to
be
in
scottsville
and
we
d
be
get
together
the
bos
be
come
to
town
he
would
proudly
tell
his
friend
he
be
living
out
his
longtime
contention
that
your
dress
reflect
the
respect
you
be
show
the
other
person
i
treasure
my
time
with
him
more
than
ever
our
relationship
have
change
yet
we
both
want
the
deep
connection
we
d
always
have
he
have
lose
a
great
deal
his
grief
over
the
loss
of
his
lifetime
sweetheart
have
an
effect
on
everything
he
do
i
believe
if
mama
have
live
longer
he
would
have
be
well
able
to
accept
the
change
that
have
to
happen
with
the
transformation
of
the
company
from
family
business
to
professionally
run
organization
as
it
be
his
removal
from
the
company
and
the
loss
of
steve
from
its
management
continued
to
affect
him
business
be
synonymous
with
family
and
these
be
tough
blow
he
be
more
emotional
in
those
year
he
have
always
be
quick
to
express
emotion
with
his
anger
rise
and
express
itself
suddenly
then
dissipate
just
as
quickly
but
good
and
bad
be
both
closer
to
the
surface
as
he
get
old
our
disagreement
have
always
tapped
into
those
emotion
and
one
of
the
big
change
he
face
be
that
he
be
no
longer
the
bos
his
position
on
any
issue
be
not
necessarily
the
company
s
position
he
have
to
adapt
to
that
change
and
to
the
fact
that
his
take
on
an
issue
or
a
decision
no
matter
how
emotionally
charge
have
less
effect
than
it
once
do
yet
it
be
touch
to
watch
him
deal
with
his
displacement
and
the
way
he
reach
out
for
family
contact
and
reassurance
he
be
lonesome
and
want
companionship
and
so
at
one
point
he
survey
all
four
kid
look
for
permission
to
ask
a
family
friend
for
a

around
on
the
subject
of
philanthropy

seven
consecutive
quarter
only
one
other
company
cisco
system
could
equal
that
performance
by
this
time
look
forward
meant
give
thought
to
a
succession
plan
i
have
be
president
of
the
company
for
twenty
three
year
and
have
be
chairman
ceo
and
coo
for
much
of
that
time
those
four
post
would
have
be
held
by
at
least
three
people
almost
anywhere
else
i
be
in
no
hurry
to
step
aside
and
i
be
reluctant
to
fill
the
post
of
coo
which
be
steve
s
last
company
role
but
i
knew
it
be
time
to
begin
the
process
of
great
succession
planning
in
march
we
name
bob
carpenter
someone
i
knew
well
and
trust
president
and
coo
i
be
also
hopeful
about
our
cfo
someone
we
want
to
groom
for
senior
management
while
he
wasn
t
a
financial
person
as
such
we
felt
he
have
the
leadership
skill
the
company
need
besides
we
have
a
vice
president
controller
with
a
solid
retail
accounting
background
reporting
to
him
with
those
executive
in
place

at
a
number
of
way
of
improve
our
operation

jump
start
distribution
expand
our
warehouse
capacity
to
support
growth
in
exist
territory
our
distribution
center
could
handle
about
store
each
and
we
want
to
get
that
number
to
inside
those
center
our
technology
be
state
of
the
art
but
we
want
to
stretch
it
far
we
need
to
be
able
to
coordinate
customer
checkout
store
order
and
perpetual
stock
inventory
as
we
sought
to
move
good
through
the
store
ever
more
efficiently
we
be
reset
every
store
widen
and
rearrange
aisle
and
wall
display
in
an
effort
to
improve

presentation
and
we
be
rethink
what
we
carry
tweak
merchandise
assortment
as
different
item
do
well
or
poorly

over
the

all
eager
to
outdo
one
another
and
earn
their
keep
by
find
thing
that
be
wrong
or
out
of
place
everybody
seem
to
have
a
stake
in
make
us
look
bad
the
process
be
terribly
injurious
and
punitive
and
a
lot
of
people
be
get
hurt
two
hour
before
the
next
board

into
my
office
and
suggest
that
i
resign
at
the
meeting
they
say
that
my
do
so
would
make
it
easy
to
deal
with
the
sec
would
show
that
i
and
the
company
be
take
the
matter
seriously
and
would
make
it
easy
for
the
company
to
make
other
tough
management
decision
i
be
stun
i
have
be
ceo
for
thirty
five
year
and
now
they
be
say
i
have
two
hour
to
make
a
decision
about
whether
or
not
to
step
down
i
didn
t
say
no
i
simply
told
them
that
two
hour
be
not
enough
time
to
process
and
make
a
decision
like
that
it
do
give
me
plenty
to
think
about
i
work
under
the
long
stand
assumption
that
my
job
be
to
fix
whatever
be
wrong
with
the
company
it
be
what
my
father
have
want
when
i
sign
on
it
give
him
breathing
room
and
it
be
what
i
plan
to
do
here
i
saw
great
irony
in
the
fact
that
my
dad
have
once
told
me
son
you
re
always
go
to
have
a
surprise
at
year
s
end
his
bookkeeping
system
be
an
attempt
to
make
it
a
positive
surprise
offset
shrinkage
now
here
we
be
with
a
huge
fulfillment
of
his
prediction
an
accounting
shock
yet
to
play
out
fully
he
be
right
it
burst
one
bubble
i
d
have
the
thought
that
we
have
manage
the
company
beyond
such
surprise
maybe
it
be
an
endemic
flaw
in
my
father
s
business
that
as
ceo
i
have
to
admit
i
have
fail
in
achieve
thorough
professional
management
that
wouldn
t
fall
prey
to
such
surprise
on
april
we
issue
a
press
release
announce
the
discovery
of
accounting
irregularity
we
say
we
would
be
restate
our
audit
financial
statement
for
the
year
and
and
those
statement
would
reflect
low
earnings
the
sec
s
entry
into
the
matter
have
take
it
to
yet
another
level
their
responsibility
be
to
protect
shareholder
and
they
be
charge
with
uncover
wrongdoing
so
their
report
invariably
emphasize
the
negative
the
sec
s
involvement
set
in
motion
a
very
dramatic
and
very
public
chain
of
event

the
way
the
system

the
cure

often
be
bad

the

sometimes
kill
it
the
process
of
forensic
accounting
and
legal
investigation
add
a
major
financial
cost
and

just
take
the

out
of

dedicate
to
its
customer
its

and
its
value
a
company
with
a
harsh
management

to
air
such
terribly
dirty
linen
in
public
just
after
my
dad
s
death
be
an
incredibly
tough
event
to
witness
i
be
so
glad
it
have
not
occur
while
my
father
be
there
to
see
it
the
son
he
view
as
his
shin
star

preside
over
event
that
reflect
very
badly
on
the
integrity
that
have
be
such
a
part
of
building
the
company
i
miss
him
terribly
i
have
often
joked
when
i
excuse
myself
from
some
meeting
or
function
that
i
must
leave
to
be
about
my
father
s
business
i
be
play
both
with
the
scriptural
reference
luke
and
the
fact
that
it
be
in
a
very
real
sense
my
dad
s
company
he
be
cal
sr
the
real
cal
turner
as
i
sometimes
say
i
be
cal
jr
i
have
always
drawn
on
him
as
a
resource
and
now
i
couldn
t
i
recall
the
difference
in
our
management
style
as
reflect
in
some
of
our
conversation
when
something
go
wrong
he
use
to
ask
who
do
that
my
approach
be
different
daddy
i
m
not
go
to
tell
you
who
do
it
the
important
response
be
what
happen
and
who
need
help
to
fix
it
it
become
part
of
who
we
be
as
a
company
in
one
of
the
intense
self
evaluation
we
do
during
the
day
when
we
be
first
implement
strategic
planning
our
statement
of
value
become
we
believe
in
building
our
company
with
person
who
have
a
living
commitment
to
moral
integrity
who
have
a
sense
of
personal
mission
who
value
work
and
other
people
who
believe
in
develop
human
potential
by
emphasize
strength
in
a
blame
free
environment
where
performance
gap
be
process
in
a
way
that
develops
the
team
and
the
person
it
be
a
statement
that
be
all
encompass
as
to
principle
and
purpose
now
though
with
cal
sr
dead
i
be
tempt
to
ask
his
question
who
do
this
dastardly
thing
where
i
could
act
though
i
have
to
see
if
i
have
what
it
take
to
get
past
blame
to
constructive
action
i
have
to
own
the
failure
especially
the
incentive
and
bonus
compensation
structure
that
have
put
excessive
pressure
on
everyone
throughout
the
company
to
attain
profit
objective
earnings
per
share
trigger
the
bonus
and
stock
option
of
everyone
from
assistant
store
manager
to
the
ceo
in
a
store
chain
that
be
a
lot
of
people
in
my
mind
it
be
a
noble
thing
to
do
it
be
the
ultimate
statement
of
our
be
in
this
as
a
team
and
yet
it
put
such
emotion
laden
gut
churn
emphasis
on
achieve
that
number
that
some
good
people
do
thing
that
be
wrong
i
have
some
real
processing
to
do
i
be
go
to
have
to
dig
deeply
into
myself
the
issue
be
how
to
handle
myself
in
the
way
that
would
produce
the
best
outcome
for
everybody

be
a
lot
of
people
hurt
and

of
my

and
yet
i
be

i
have
to
go
through
hour
and
hour
of
grill
by
lawyer
and
prepare
myself
for
my
time
in
the
barrel

this
be
different
i
didn
t
have
any
idea
how
to
handle
it
i
would
need
someone
to
talk
to
besides
the
company
lawyer
i
especially
value
the
opinion
of
two
director
david
wild
and
john
holland
so
i
consult
both
of
them
in
house
i
talk
to
bob
carpenter
and
stonie
o
briant
one
of
our
executive
vice
president
i
would
go
to
one
who
would
emphatically
recommend
one
course
of
action
and
another
who
would
recommend
something
else
i
get
great
support
from
margaret
it
be
wonderful
have
a
love
partner
at
a
time
like
that
still
as
she
have
never
be
involve
in
the
business
it
be
not
easy
for
her
to
understand
all
the
intricacy
of
the
company
of
the
sec
of
all
the
legal
and
financial
thing
go
on
the
conversation
i
have
with
her
and
with
my
fellow
executive
brought
some
benefit
but
all
be
incomplete
no
one
have
the
big
picture
the
complete
overview
of
dollar
general
as
a
family
business
turn
public
company
the
kind
of
perspective
that
go
with
longevity
and
deep
insight
no
one
that
be
except
my
brother
steve
in
the
absence
of
my
dad
he
have
more
knowledge
and
insight
than
anybody
it
have
be
a
dozen
year
since
i
d
fire
him
we
have
dealt
with
each
other
on
well
term
especially
in
the
day
before
and
after
daddy
s
death
although
there
be
still
a
great
deal
of
space
between
us
maybe
honest
and
open
conversation
with
him
would
re
cement
more
of
the
bond
we
d
have
as
brother
i
decide
to
talk
with
him
i
didn
t
go
in
expect
much
help
but
i
be
try
to
achieve
some
additional
bonding
i
have
lose
my
brother
and
my
dad
and
i
be
in
the
process
of
lose
the
company
i
want
to
regain
my
brother
as
much
as
possible
we
sat
down
a
couple
of
time
and
he
be
sympathetic
to
my
need
to
process
all
that
have
go
on
he
didn
t
know
the
in
and
out
but
he
understood
that
in
the
absence
of
our
father
his
old
brother
need
love
and
support
from
him
the
young
i
could
sense
that
he
be
try
to
do
just
that
and
yet
i
knew
that
his
feeling
about
our
difference
still
have
to
be
in
the
background
the
meeting
be
congenial
and
steve
be
sympathetic
but
there
have
be
an
ironic
switch
of
role
steve
have
always
be
the
one
to
debate
and
i
have
be
the
one
to
counsel
and
console
now
i
need
his
counsel
and
consolation
i
have
to
give
him
high
mark
for
his
valiant
effort
to
offer
both
but
neither
of
us
be
quite
right
for
the
role
we
be
try
to
fill
here
temperamentally
i
be
a
turner
he
be
a
goad
we
both
miss
the
real
cal
turner
it
would
have
be
natural
for
our
father
to
act
as
the
catalyst
for
the
heal
that
need
to
happen
to
some
degree
he
could
have
help
steve
and
me
relate
well
to
each
other
i
be
glad
he
have
be
spar
all
this
but
his
absence
make
for
a
great
deal
of
pathos
in
that
meeting
i
go
in
to
testify
before
the
sec
and
as
they
fire
question
at
me
i
be
able
to
find
an
emotional
anchor
in
a
memory
of
mr
jimmy
s
sunday
vesper
at
camp
dunroamin
i
thought
about
light
my
candle
say
the
lord
be
my
light
and
my
salvation
whom
shall
i
fear
i
could
see
mr
jimmy
on
the
other
side
of
the
candle
and
the
thought
brought
me
real
peace
in
the
midst
of
a
truly
terrible
session
sometimes
you
have
to
walk
that
lonesome
valley
by
yourself
and
this
would
be
one
of
those
time
i
knew
nothing
be
go
to
be
the
same
from
here
on
out
it
be
time
to
find
out
how
the
best
future
for
dollar
general
could
be
craft
out
of
all
the
pain
and
carnage
and
what
my
role
in
that
future
be
to
be
there
be
a
new
ingredient
in
my
think
one
that
have
come
by
way
of
the
lawyer
it
be
a
startle
revelation
that
at
this
point
the
best
way
to
fix
the
company
be
to
realize
that
perhaps
i
wasn
t
the
one
to
fix
it
for
the
first
time
in
thirty
seven
year
the
solution
might
not
involve
me
once
i
get
past
the
shock
the
newness
of
it
i
come
to
believe
that
the
right
course
of
action
would
be
extricate
myself
from
dollar
general
management
that
would
enable
the
company
to
reconstruct
its
future
without
me
it
would
be
best
for
everybody
during
the
year
i
lead
dollar
general
the
thing
i
always
hat
most
be
fire
people
i
never
get
comfortable
with
it
and
i
often
thought
it
would
be
poetic
justice
if
someday
i
have
to
fire
myself
that
s
just
how
i
look
now
at
what
happen
i
have
begin
to
feel
pressure
from
the
sec
attorney
we
hire
to
prepare
me
for
the
hearing
i
have
say
no
to
their
request
just
before
that
board
meeting
that
i
submit
my
resignation
but
now
i
could
see
the
value
in
that
option
the
board
committee
deal
with
sec
matter
be
still
exert
pressure
but
ultimately
the
decision
be
mine
as
painful
as
it
be
in
september
i
step
down
as
ceo
donald
shaffer
serve
as
interim
ceo
until
april
when
former
reebok
president
david
perdue
become
ceo
with
shaffer
continue
as
coo
i
remain
board
chairman
until
june
that
month
we
institute
the
last
major
change
under
my
watch
opening
the
first
dollar
general
market
which
offer
perishable
food
along
with
our
regular
merchandise
it
be
in
hendersonville
tennessee
a
ten
minute
drive
from
goodlettsville
where
we
have
move
our
headquarters
in
and
just
forty
five
mile
from
scottsville
where
it
all
start
from
there
dollar
general
would
go
on
without
me
while
this
end
the
turner
management
of
the
company
i
take
pride
and
solace
in
know
that
the
turner
family
value
be
truly
remain
in
the
company
lovingly
found
by
my
father
and
my
grandfather
yes
it
would
always
be
true
that
this
incredible
professionally
manage
enterprise
would
be
about
my
father
s
business

retirement
redefine
who
i
be
in
august
i
attend
the
funeral
of
walter
gupton
dollar
general
s
longtime
number
one
operation
person
and
the
man
who
have
sent
me
to
open
my
second
store
in
anniston
alabama
with
someone
even
greener
at
opening
store
than
i
be
the
funeral
be
held
at
a
little
country
church
and
as
i
stood
outside
with
two
former
district
manager
i
told
the
story
of
that
anniston
opening
well
say
one
of
the
manager
that
s
not
the
way
it
be
here
s
what
really
happen
and
he
proceed
to
tell
the
story
with
a
decidedly
different
mix
of
fact
and
quotation
i
have
ridden
to
the
church
with
the
other
manager
and
as
he
and
i
head
back
to
town
he
say
well
that
lie
sob
that
s
not
the
way
it
happen
at
all
and
he
go
through
his
recollection
i
have
always
thought
my
version
be
the
sacred
history
of
what
have
happen
and
i
have
told
it
from
time
to
time
with
the
authority
of
a
ceo
now
i
realize
that
mine
be
just
one
of
at
least
three
equally
authoritative
version
truth
it
turn
out
be
a
bit
different
for
everybody
it
s
why
most
of
us
be
notoriously
unreliable
witness
our
version
be
shade
by
the
emotion
of
the
time
there
be
no
complete
truth
on
earth
there
be
simply
each
person
s
version
of
that
truth
this
book
have
look
through
my
eye
at
the
event
that
entwine
my
life
with
the
story
of
dollar
general
it
be
my
story
my
truth
write
from
the
position
of
retirement
a
time
in
life
i
ve
give
great
consideration
my
great
insight
about
retirement
lie
in
the
first
few
verse
of
my
favorite
chapter
in
the
bible
roman
retirement
be
our
last
opportunity
to
present
our
body
as
living
sacrifice
as
death
be
more
imminent
than
ever
my
thought
be
that
god
center
processing
of
our
life
and
their
meaning
be
the
great
of
all
opportunity
in
retirement
and
roman
tell
us
how
be
not
conform
to
this
world
but
be
transform
by
the
renew
of
your
mind
that
you
may
prove
what
the
will
of
god
be
that
which
be
good
and
acceptable
and
perfect
our
great
and
last
chance
for
creative
partnership
with
god
come
in
retirement
it
be
also
our
best
opportunity
for
serve
others
who
learn
more
from
what
we
model
than
from
what
we
message
i
see
this
as
a
time
of
reflection
a
haven
outside
the
event
of
a
work
life
from
which
to
look
back
with
new
perspective
as
observer
rather
than
participant
from
this
vantage
i
see
more
of
the
hand
of
god
in
my
life
guide
me
through
the
good
and
the
bad
especially
when
event
force
me
toward
earnest
prayer
and
deep
reflection
as
they
do
in
that
fateful
season
when
the
family
and
company
be
split
in
and
retirement
have
give
me
the
opportunity
to
review
the
lesson
of
a
lifetime
and
to
reestablish
my
connection
to
the
cal
jr
who
really
begin
his
spiritual
journey
which
happen
to
coincide
by
and
large
with
his
family
s
retail
journey
at
age
eleven
my
relationship
with
jesus
christ
remains
an
integral
part
of
who
i
be
a
practice
backsliding
methodist
for
jesus
christ
himself
be
the
ultimate
standard
and
that
be
the
point
of
reference
from
which
we
be
backsliding
backsliding
in
that
sense
have
become
a
virtue
to
me
for
its
standard
of
measurement
be
god
himself
it
be
also
a
great
way
to
practice
ego
management
because
when
you
think
of
yourself
as
a
practice
backslider
you
re
willing
to
reach
out
for
help
and
support
from
others
and
that
brings
people
together
it
be
my
hope
in
write
this
book
that
you
can
be
inspire
to
pursue
your
mission
i
hope
you
will
find
way
to
use
your
gift
for
the
betterment
of
those
around
you
always
strive
to
close
that
gap
between
aim
and
achievement
but
accept
that
as
human
we
will
never
do
so
perfectly
we
be
all
work
in
progress
in
retirement
we
may
have
set
aside
day
to
day
career
pursuit
we
may
have
tie
our
work
life
up
with
a
bow
still
god
be
not
through
with
us
until
we
walk
through
that
final
portal
we
can
retire
from
meeting
from
work
e
mail
from
the
stress
of
new
product
and
bottom
line
but
we
can
t
retire
from
the
much
more
important
task
of
living
spiritual
growth
and
serve
others
my
mission
statement
remains
god
honor
change
and
i
believe
there
be
continuity
between
the
way
i
try
to
carry
it
out
as
an
executive
and
the
way
i
do
so
now
as
a
retire
person
a
mission
statement
should
open
us
to
great
possibility
and
there
be
as
many
of
those
now
as
there
ever
have
be
several
thing
have
give
me
meaning
in
retirement
for
starter
there
be
philanthropy
something
i
view
in
its
broad
sense
it
be
poor
philanthropy
indeed
that
be
measure
only
in
dollar
and
cent
each
of
us
have
time
energy
talent
and
experience
and
i
believe
we
be
call
to
share
all
of
those
thing
for
the
betterment
of
others
as
ceo
of
dollar
general
i
be
especially
drawn
to
the
cause
of
literacy
it
be
one
of
the
issue
face
our
struggle
customer
and
it
be
close
to
my
heart
because
of
my
grandfather
luther
turner
s
third
grade
education
i
remain
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
dollar
general

eight
million

the

your

into

this

be
a
major
force
in
philanthropy
in
our
community
of
nashville

turner
concert
hall
in
honor
of
our
mother
then
there
be
mentor
here
too
i
think
the
term
refers
to
far
more
than
the
narrow
definition
we
often
use
mentor
be
unique
to
every
person
and
situation
it
happens
on
a
small
scale
every
time
one
person
model
any
positive
behavior
from
kindness
to
goal
set
my
appreciation
for
mentorship
come
from
my
be
the
beneficial
recipient
of
it
as
i
saw
my
grandfather
s
eagerness
to
learn
from
everyone
my
father
s
work
ethic
my
mother
s
emphasis
on
treat
everyone
with
respect
and
her
oh
so
healthy
separation
of
the
person
from
the
problem
throughout
my
year
at
dollar
general
i
learn
from
my
father
from
larry
appley
wallace
rasmussen
john
holland
and
others
with
great
business
and
life
lesson
to
share
and
i
learn
from
those
on
the
front
line
the
clerk
and
manager
who
make
each
store
work
throughout
my
faith
connect
me
with
christ
the
ultimate
role
model
and
mentor
what
if
in
take
responsibility
and
assess
our
effort
to
live
up
to
that
model
we
come
up
short
of
the
mark
i
don
t
like
the
word
sin
but
i
can
embrace
the
word
failure
look
at
correctly
failure
be
often
a
well
mentor
than
success
i
spoke
a
while
back
to
senior
at
florida
southern
college
they
be
near
graduation
so
i
guess
they
would
all
have
their
fear
about
the
future
they
may
well
have
be
expect
bromide
a
keep
your
chin
up
and
it
will
all
work
out
sort
of
message
that
s
not
what
i
give
them
i
say
what
if
you
fail
let
s
talk
about
that
i
share
with
them
my
experience
of
failure
and
show
them
how
that
be
where
i
experienced
the
most
growth
the
fear
of
failure
be
generally
bad
than
the
failure
and
it
teach
far
few
useful
lesson
yet
i
don
t
think
there
s
a
mistake
we
can
make
that
can
t
be
useful
to
others
many
leader
in
business
church
and
not
for
profit
have
some
of
the
same
tribulation
to
endure
as
mine
my
aim
be
that
my
experience
in
retirement
can
help
them
while
they
re
still
mid
career
what
i
learn
in
time
of
joy
and
success
be
not
nearly
as
helpful
as
what
i
learn
in
the
bad
time
fortunately
both
the
good
and
the
bad
provide
the
opportunity
to
serve
others
one
of
the
most
crucial
lesson
i
have
learn
about
life
and
leadership
be
that
the
sense
of
purpose
embody
in
a
mission
statement
be
vital
without
a
mission
ground
in
the
perspective
offer
by
a
coherent
worldview
we
be
simply
cork
float
in
the
sea
of
event
around
us
until
i
fully
know
who
i
be
and
what
my
purpose
be
my
movement
can
be
directionless
it
be
never
too
late
to
reassess
to
realign
to
bring
the
focus
of
new
perspective
to
bear
on
life
a
great
biblical
example
of
a
change
of
mission
that
work
wonder
can
be
found
in
the
thief
on
the
cross
his
life
have
clearly
be
a
failure
and
when
we
meet
him
life
be
nearly
over
but
something
in
the
eye
word
and
demeanor
of
jesus
convict
him
he
be
a
change
man
he
admonish
the
other
thief
remind
him
that
jesus
be
innocent
as
they
be
not
then
he
ask
that
jesus
remember
him
when
he
come
into
his
kingdom
truly
i
say
to
you
jesus
say
today
you
will
be
with
me
in
paradise
talk
about
be
position
for
a
great
retirement
the
thief
wrap
his
failure
in
a
bow
and
embrace
success
it
show
that
it
s
never
too
late
to
reevaluate
and
change
direction
and
that
the
reward
of
do
so
can
be
everlasting
my
look
back
can
t
be
complete
without
my
acknowledgment
that
steve
played
his
role
in
the
company
well
than
i
would
have
my
dad
played
his
role
well
than
i
would
have
as
well
if
i
have
more
fully
own
my
ultimate
impotence
to
fix
the
thing
that
need
fix
in
the
company
i
would
perhaps
have
be
position
as
a
more
graceful
change
agent
i
have
the
big
brother
syndrome
and
my
determination
to
do
the
right
thing
as
i
saw
it
make
me
tough
to
live
with
for
steve
my
motive
in
this
book
have
be
to
examine
my
father
s
business
and
make
sense
of
it
in
a
way
that
might
invite
you
to
do
the
same
so
that
you
may
help
others
to
do
the
same
in
turn
it
s
part
of
love
others
as
ourselves
life
be
a
stream
you
come
in
with
the
contribution
of
everyone
in
the
past
behind
you
you
go
into
the
stream
and
you
accept
their
influence
and
add
yours
alongside
your
contemporary
when
you
die
you
come
out
of
the
stream
as
yet
others
go
in
with
your
influence
go
forward
in
those
you
have
affected
mission
be
take
seriously
your
opportunity
to
affect
that
stream
while
you
re
part
of
it
something
we
re
all
call
to
do
you
be
one
of
a
kind
that
s
why
i
ve
try
to
share
life
lesson
rather
than
offer
advice
i
can
t
offer
well
advice
than
you
can
glean
for
yourself
for
only
you
know
the
life
to
which
those
lesson
and
advice
can
be
apply
i
or
anyone
share
the
lesson
of
experience
can
provide
only
a
little
sun
a
little
rain
a
little
fertilizer
yours
be
the
ground
in
which
the
seed
have
be
plant
i
don
t
want
to
have
go
through
all
of
this
without
there
be
some
benefit
for
others
that
too
be
a
turner
trait
each
of
us
be
best
serve
by
face
and
learn
and
relearn
the
lesson
of
our
life
and
apply
them
anew
each
day
i
acknowledge
by
the
way
that
i
m
the
right
person
to
talk
about
this
process
because
i
m
still
try
to
figure
it
out
myself
god
would
have
nothing
to
be
waste
in
any
of
our
life
i
hope
that
share
the
good
and
the
bad
of
my
journey
the
process
of
be
about
my
father
s
business
can
be
helpful
in
your
reflection
on
your
journey
and
in
your
continued
progress
toward
more
fulfillment
as
you
seek
to
be
about
your
heavenly
father
s
business
on
earth
