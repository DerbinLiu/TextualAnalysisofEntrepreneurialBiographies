prologue
i
spent
most
of
the
saturday
morning
after
thanksgiving
wait
for
the
new
guy
that
be
the
secret
code
for
my
successor
the
future
chairman
and
ceo
of
general
electric
on
friday
night
the
board
have
unanimously
approve
jeff
immelt
to
succeed
me
i
call
him
right
away
i
have
some
good
news
can
you
and
your
family
come
to
florida
tomorrow
and
spend
the
weekend
obviously
he
knew
what
be
go
on
but
we
left
it
at
that
and
go
quickly
to
the
arrangement
to
get
him
to
florida
on
saturday
morning
i
could
hardly
wait
to
see
him
the
long
ceo
succession
process
be
over
i
be
already
outside
when
jeff
pull
into
my
driveway
he
have
a
big
smile
on
his
face
and
be
barely
out
of
the
car
before
i
have
my
arm
around
him
say
exactly
what
reg
jones
say
to
me
year
earlier
congratulation
mr
chairman
as
we
hug
i
felt
we
be
closing
the
loop
in
that
moment
my
memory
take
me
straight
back
to
the
day
when
reg
walk
into
my
fairfield
connecticut
office
and
embrace
me
in
just
the
same
way
bear
hug
or
any
hug
be
not
natural
gesture
for
reg
yet
here
he
be
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
his
arm
wrap
tightly
around
me
on
that
december
day
in
i
be
the
happiest
man
in
america
and
certainly
the
lucky
if
i
could
pick
a
job
in
business
this
one
would
be
it
it
give
me
an
unbelievable
array
of
business
from
aircraft
engine
and
power
generator
to
plastic
medical
and
financial
service
what
ge
make
and
do
touch
virtually
everyone
most
important
it
be
a
job
that
s
close
to
percent
about
people
and
percent
about
other
stuff
i
work
with
some
of
the
smartest
most
creative
and
competitive
people
in
the
world
many
a
lot
smarter
than
i
be
when
i
join
ge
in
my
horizon
be
modest
as
a
year
old
junior
engineer
fresh
from
a
ph
d
program
i
be
get
paid
a
year
and
want
to
make
by
the
time
i
be
that
be
my
objective
if
i
have
one
i
be
pour
everything
i
have
into
what
i
be
do
and
have
a
helluva
good
time
do
it
the
promotion
start
come
enough
of
them
to
raise
my
sight
so
that
by
the
mid
s
i
begin
to
think
that
maybe
i
could
run
the
place
one
day
the
odds
be
against
me
many
of
my
peer
regard
me
as
the
round
peg
in
a
square
hole
too
different
for
ge
i
be
brutally
honest
and
outspoken
i
be
impatient
and
to
many
abrasive
my
behavior
wasn
t
the
norm
especially
the
frequent
party
at
local
bar
to
celebrate
business
victory
large
or
small
fortunately
a
lot
of
people
at
ge
have
the
gut
to
like
me
reg
jones
be
one
of
them
on
the
surface
we
could
not
have
be
more
different
trim
and
dignify
he
be
born
in
britain
and
have
the
bearing
of
a
statesman
i
have
grown
up
just
mile
north
of
boston
in
salem
massachusetts
the
only
son
of
an
irish
american
railroad
conductor
reg
be
reserve
and
formal
i
be
earthy
loud
and
excitable
with
a
heavy
boston
accent
and
an
awkward
stutter
at
the
time
reg
be
the
most
admire
businessman
in
america
an
influential
figure
in
washington
i
be
unknown
outside
of
ge
and
inexperienced
in
policy
issue
still
i
always
felt
a
vibration
with
reg
he
rarely
reveal
his
feeling
never
provide
even
a
hint
yet
i
have
a
feel
that
he
understood
me
in
some
way
we
be
kindred
spirit
we
respect
each
other
s
difference
and
share
some
important
thing
we
both
like
analysis
and
number
and
do
our
homework
we
both
love
ge
he
knew
it
have
to
change
and
he
thought
i
have
the
passion
and
the
smart
to
do
it
i
m
not
sure
he
knew
how
much
i
want
ge
to
change
but
his
support
for
all
i
do
over
year
never
waver
the
competition
to
succeed
reg
have
be
brutal
complicate
by
heavy
politics
and
big
ego
my
own
include
it
be
awful
at
first
there
be
seven
of
us
from
various
part
of
the
company
who
be
put
in
the
spotlight
by
the
very
public
contest
for
reg
s
job
he
hadn
t
intend
it
to
be
the
divisive
and
highly
politicize
process
that
it
turn
out
to
be
i
make
a
few
mistake
in
those
year
none
fatal
when
reg
get
the
board
to
approve
me
as
his
successor
on
december
i
still
wasn
t
the
most
obvious
choice
not
long
after
the
announcement
be
make
one
of
my
ge
friend
walk
into
the
hi
ho
the
local
water
hole
near
headquarters
and
overheard
one
of
the
oldtime
staffer
repeat
glumly
into
a
martini
i
ll
give
him
two
year
then
it
s
bellevue
he
miss
by
more
than
over
all
the
year
that
i
be
chairman
i
receive
widespread
attention
in
the
medium
both
good
and
bad
but
a
lengthy
cover
story
in
business
week
magazine
in
early
june
prompt
a
flood
of
mail
that
inspire
me
to
write
this
book
why
because
of
the
magazine
article
literally
hundred
of
total
stranger
write
me
move
and
inspirational
letter
about
their
career
they
described
the
organizational
pressure
they
felt
to
change
as
individual
to
conform
to
something
or
become
someone
they
weren
t
in
order
to
be
successful
they
like
the
story
s
contention
that
i
never
change
who
i
be
the
story
imply
that
i
be
able
to
get
one
of
the
world
s
large
company
to
come
closer
to
act
like
the
crowd
i
grow
up
with
together
with
thousand
of
others
i
try
to
create
the
informality
of
a
corner
neighborhood
grocery
store
in
the
soul
of
a
big
company
the
truth
of
course
be
more
complex
in
my
early
year
i
try
desperately
to
be
honest
with
myself
to
fight
the
bureaucratic
pomposity
even
if
it
meant
that
i
wouldn
t
succeed
at
ge
i
also
remember
the
tremendous
pressure
to
be
someone
i
wasn
t
i
sometimes
played
the
game
at
one
of

chose
my
word
carefully
i
want
to
show
the
board
member
that
i
be
old
and
more
mature
than
either
my
year
or
my
reputation
i
guess
i
want
to
look
and
act
like

typical

an
effort
to
acquire
honeywell
in
october
and
i
agree
to
stay
on
through
the
transition
some
thought
of
me
as
the
long
in
the
tooth
jack
hang
on
by
his
fingertip
to
his
ceo
job
those

say
less
about
me
and
a
lot
more
about
the
phase
our
company
go
through
truth
be
down
deep
i
ve
never
really
change
much
from
the
boy
my
mother
raise
in
salem
massachusetts
when
i
start
on
this
journey
in
stand
before
wall
street
analyst
for
the
first
time
at
new
york
s
pierre
hotel
i
say
i
want
ge
to
become
the
most
competitive
enterprise
on
earth
my
objective
be
to
put
a
small
company
spirit
in
a
big
company
body
to
build
an
organization
out
of
an
old
line
industrial
company
that
would
be
more
high
spirit
more
adaptable
and
more
agile
than
company
that
be
one
fiftieth
our
size
i
say
then
that
i
want
to
create
a
company
where
people
dare
to
try
new
thing
where
people
feel
assure
in
know
that
only
the
limit
of
their
creativity
and
drive
their
own
standard
of
personal
excellence
will
be
the
ceiling
on
how
far
and
how
fast
they
move
i
ve
put
my
mind
my
heart
and
my
gut
into
that
journey
every
day
of
the
plus
year
i
ve
be
lucky
enough
to
be
a
part
of
ge
this
book
be
an
effort
to
bring
you
along
on
that
trip
in
the
end
i
believe
we
create
the
great
people
factory
in
the
world
a
learn
enterprise
with
a
boundaryless
culture
but
you
judge
for
yourself
whether
we
ever
reach
the
destination
i
described
in
my
vision
speech
at
the
pierre
in
this
be
no
perfect
business
story
i
believe
that
business
be
a
lot
like
a
world
class
restaurant
when
you
peek
behind
the
kitchen
door
the
food
never
look
as
good
as
when
it
come
to
your
table
on
fine
china
perfectly
garnish
business
be
messy
and
chaotic
in
our
kitchen
i
hope
you
ll
find
something
that
might
be
helpful
to
you
in
reach
your
own
dream
there
s
no
gospel
or
management
handbook
here
there
be
a
philosophy
that
come
out
of
my
journey
i
stuck
to
some
pretty
basic
idea
that
work
for
me
integrity
be
the
big
one
i
ve
always
believe
in
a
simple
and
direct
approach
this
book
attempt
to
show
what
an
organization
and
each
of
us
can
learn
from
opening
the
mind
to
idea
from
anywhere
i
ve
learn
that
mistake
can
often
be
as
good
a
teacher
as
success
there
be
no
straight
line
to
anyone
s
vision
or
dream
i
m
living
proof
of
that
this
be
the
story
of
a
lucky
man
an
unscripted
uncorporate
type
who
manage
to
stumble
and
still
move
forward
to
survive
and
even
thrive
in
one
of
the
world
s
most
celebrate
corporation
yet
it
s
also
a
small
town
american
story
i
ve
never
stop
be
aware
of
my
root
even
as
my
eye
open
to
see
a
world
i
never
knew
exist
mostly
though
this
be
a
story
of
what
others
have
do
thousand
of
smart
self
confident
and
energize
employee
who
taught
each
other
how
to
break
the
mold
of
the
old
industrial
world
and
work
toward
a
new
hybrid
of
manufacturing
service
and
technology
their
effort
and
their
success
be
what
have
make
my
journey
so
reward
i
be
lucky
to
play
a
part
because
reg
jones
come
into
my
office
year
ago
and
give
me
the
hug
of
a
lifetime
section
i
early
year

building
self
confidence
it
be
the
final
hockey
game
of
a
lousy
season
we
have
won
the
first
three
game
in
my
senior
year
at
salem
high
school
beating
danvers
revere
and
marblehead
but
have
then
lose
the
next
half
dozen
game
five
of
them
by
a
single
goal
so
we
badly
want
to
win
this
last
one
at
the
lynn
arena
against
our
archrival
beverly
high
as
co
captain
of
the
team
the
salem
witch
i
have
score
a
couple
of
goal
and
we
be
feel
pretty
good
about
our
chance
it
be
a
good
game
push
into
overtime
at
but
very
quickly
the
other
team
score
and
we
lose
again
for
the
seventh
time
in
a
row
in
a

what

way
into

the
most
influential
person
in
my
life
grace
welch
taught
me
the
value
of
competition
just
as
she
taught
me
the
pleasure
of
win
and
the
need
to
take
defeat
in
stride
if
i
have
any
leadership
style
a
way
of
get
the
best
out
of
people
i
owe
it
to
her
tough
and
aggressive
warm
and
generous

be
a
great
judge
of
character
she
always
have
opinion
of
the
people
she
met
she
could
smell
a
phony
a
mile
away

be
extremely
compassionate
and
generous
to
friend
if
a
relative
or
neighbor
visit
the
house
and
compliment
her
on
the
water
glass
in
the
breakfront
she
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
give
them
away
on
the
other
hand
if
you
cross
her
watch
out
she
could
hold
a
grudge
against
anyone
who
betrayed
her
trust
i
could
just
as
easily
be
describe
myself
and
many
of
my
basic
management
belief
thing
like
compete
hard
to
win

reality
motivate
people
by
alternately
hug
and
kick
them
set
stretch
goal
and
relentlessly
follow
up
on
people
to
make
sure
thing

do
can
be
trace
to
her
as
well
the
insight
she
drill
into
me
never
fade
she
always
insist
on
face
the
fact
of
a
situation
one
of
her
favorite
expression
be
don
t
kid
yourself
that
s
the
way
it
be
if
you
don
t
study
she
often
warn
you
ll
be
nothing
absolutely
nothing
there
be
no
shortcut
don
t
kid
yourself
those
be
blunt
unyielding
admonition
that
ring
in
my
head
every
day
whenever
i
try
to
delude
myself
that
a
deal
or
business
problem
will
miraculously
improve
her
word
set
me
straight
from
my
early
year
in
school
she
taught
me
the
need
to
excel
she
knew
how
to
be
tough
with
me
but
also
how
to
hug
and
kiss
she
make
sure
i
knew
how
want
and
love
i
be
i
d
come
home
with
four
as
and
a
b
on
my
report
card
and
my
mother
would
want
to
know
why
i
get
the
b
but
she
would
always
end
the
conversation
congratulate
and
hug
me
for
the
as
she
checked
constantly
to
see
if
i
do
my
homework
in
much
the
same
way
that
i
continually
follow
up
at
work
today
i
can
remember
sit
in
my
upstairs
bedroom
work
away
on
the
day
s
homework
only
to
hear
her
voice
rise
from
the
living
room
have
you
do
it
yet
you
well
not
come
down
until
you
ve
finish
but
it
be
over
the
kitchen
table
play
gin
rummy
with
her
that
i
learn
the
fun
and
joy
of
competition
i
remember
race
across
the
street
from
the
schoolyard
for
lunch
when
i
be
in
the
first
grade
itch
for
the
chance
to
play
gin
rummy
with
her
when
she
beat
me
which
be
often
she
d
put
the
win
card
on
the
table
and
shout
gin
i
d
get
so
mad
but
i
couldn
t
wait
to
come
home
again
and
get
the
chance
to
beat
her
that
be
probably
the
start
of
my
competitiveness
on
the
baseball
diamond
the
hockey
rink
the
golf
course
and
business
perhaps
the
great
single
gift
she
give
me
be
self
confidence
it
s
what
i
ve
look
for
and
try
to
build
in
every
executive
who
have
ever
work
with
me
confidence
give
you
courage
and
extends
your
reach
it
let
you
take
great
risk
and
achieve
far
more
than
you
ever
thought
possible
building
self
confidence
in
others
be
a
huge
part
of
leadership
it
come
from
provide
opportunity
and
challenge
for
people
to
do
thing
they
never
imagine
they
could
do
reward
them
after
each
success
in
every
way
possible
my
mother
never
manage
people
but
she
knew
all
about
building
self
esteem
i
grow
up
with
a
speech
impediment
a
stammer
that
wouldn
t
go
away
sometimes
it
lead
to
comical
if
not
embarrass
incident
in
college
i
often
order
a
tuna
fish
on
white
toast
on
friday
when
catholic
in
those
day
couldn
t
eat
meat
inevitably
the
waitress
would
return
with
not
one
but
a
pair
of
sandwich
have
heard
my
order
as
tu
tuna
sandwich
my
mother
serve
up
the
perfect
excuse
for
my
stutter
it
s
because
you
re
so
smart
she
would
tell
me
no
one
s
tongue
could
keep
up
with
a
brain
like
yours
for
year
in
fact
i
never
worried
about
my
stammer
i
believe
what
she
told
me
that
my
mind
work
faster
than
my
mouth
i
didn
t
understand
for
many
year
just
how
much
confidence
she
pour
into
me
decade
later
when
look
at
early
picture
of
me
on
my
sport
team
i
be
amaze
to
see
that
almost
always
i
be
the
shortest
and
small
kid
in
the
picture
in
grade
school
where
i
played
guard
on
the
basketball
squad
i
be
almost
three
quarter
the
size
of
several
of
the
other
player
yet
i
never
knew
it
or
felt
it
today
i
look
at
those
picture
and
laugh
at
what
a
little
shrimp
i
be
it
s
just
ridiculous
that
i
wasn
t
more
conscious
of
my
size
that
tell
you
what
a
mother
can
do
for
you
she
give
me
that
much
confidence
she
convince
me
that
i
could
be
anyone
i
want
to
be
it
be
really
up
to
me
you
just
have
to
go
for
it
she
would
say
my
relationship
with
my
mother
be
powerful
and
unique
warm
and
reinforce
she
be
my
confidante
my
best
friend
i
think
it
be
that
way
partly
because
i
be
an
only
child
born
to
her
late
in
life
for
those
day
when
she
be
and
my
dad
be
my
parent
have
try
unsuccessfully
to
have
child
for
many
year
so
when
i
finally
arrive
in
peabody
massachusetts
on
november
my
mother
pour
her
love
into
me
as
if
i
be
a
found
treasure
i
wasn
t
born
with
a
silver
spoon
i
have
something
well
ton
of
love
my
grandparent
on
both
side
be
irish
immigrant
and
neither
they
nor
my
parent
graduate
from
high
school
i
be
nine
when
my
parent
bought
our
first
house
a
modest
two
story
masonry
home
on
lovett
street
in
an
irish
work
class
section
of
salem
massachusetts
the
house
be
across
the
street
from
a
small
factory
my
father
would
often
remind
me
that
be
a
real
plus
you
always
want
a
factory
for
a
neighbor
they
re
not
around
on
the
weekend
they
don
t
bother
you
they
re
quiet
i
believe
him
never
recognize
that
he
be
engage
in
some
confidence
building
himself
my
dad
work
hard
as
a
railroad
conductor
on
the
boston
maine
commuter
line
between
boston
and
newburyport
when
big
jack
go
off
in
the
early
morning
at
five
in
his
press
dark
blue
uniform
his
white
shirt
starch
to
perfection
by
my
mother
he
look
like
he
could
salute
god
himself
nearly
every
day
be
the
same
a
ticket
punch
journey
through
the
same
ten

general
electric

and
then
back
again
over
some
mile
of
track
later
i
would
get
a
kick
out
of
know
that
one
of
his
regular
stop
be
at
ge
s
aircraft
engine
complex
in
lynn
just
outside
boston
every
workday
he
look
forward
to
climb
back
on
the
b
m
train
that
he
always
thought
of
as
his
own
my
father
love
greet
the
public
and
meeting
interest
people
he
move
through
the
center
aisle
of
those
passenger
car
like
an
ambassador
with
good
humor
punch
ticket
and
welcome
the
familiar
face
in
the
bench
seat
as
if
they
be
close
friend
during
every
rush
hour
he
trade
smile
and
hello
with
passenger
and
spread
a
good
bit
of
irish
blarney
his
cheerful
disposition
on
the
train
would
often
contrast
with
his
quiet
and
withdrawn
behavior
at
home
this
would
annoy
my
mother
who
would
complain
why
don
t
you
bring
some
of
that
baloney
you
pas
out
on
the
train
home

my
father

a
diligent
worker

put
in
long
hour
and
never
miss
a
day
of
work
if
he
get
a
bad
weather
report
he
d
ask
my
mother
to
drive
him

the
station
the
night
before
he
would
sleep
in
one
of
the
car
on
his
train
so
he
d
be
ready
to
go
in
the
morning
rarely
would
he
get
home
before
seven
at
night
always
picked
up
at
the
station
in
the
family
car
by
my
mother
he
d
come
home
with
a
bundle
of

lifetime

my

that

big
shot

about
their
golf

she
be
shameless
that
way
my
mother

clearly
the
disciplinarian
in

family
when

though
all
of
us
be
juiced
on
some
cheap
cent
a
bottle
muscatel
instead
he
simply
told
my

who
confront

and
doled
out

punishment
another
time

to
play
hockey
on
the
frozen

home
during

game
i
fell
through
the
ice
and
get
completely
soak
to
try
to
cover
up
what
happen
i
strip
off
my
wet
clothes
and
hung
them
on
a
tree
over
a
fire
we
built
we
shiver
in
the
january
cold
wait
for
our
clothes
to
dry
it
be
i
thought
a
rather
clever
cover
up
until
i
walk
through
the
front
door
it
take
a
second
for
my
mother
to
smell
the
smoke
on
my
clothes
duck
altar
boy
practice
be
a
big
deal
to
someone
who
hung
a
crucifix
on
the
wall
prayed
the
rosary
and
consider
father
james
cronin
the
longtime
pastor
of
our
church
a
saint
so
she
sat
me
down
force
out
a
confession
and
then
deliver
her
own
penance
whack
me
with
a
damp
shoe
she
d
just
take
off
my
foot
while
she
could
be
strict
she
could
also
be
a
real
softie
once
when
i
be
not
much
more
than
year
old
i
stole
a
ball
from
a
carnival
that
come
through
town
you
know
the
type
of
lousy
ball
you
throw
to
knock
metal
milk
bottle
off
a
pedestal
to
win
a
kewpie
doll
it
didn
t
take
long
before
my
mother
found
the
ball
and
ask
me
where
i
get
it
when
i
admit
that
i
have
steal
it
she
insist
that
i
go
to
father
cronin
return
the
ball
to
him
and
then
confess
what
i
do
since
all
the
priest
knew
me
as
an
altar
boy
i
be
convince
that
they
d
recognize
me
in
the
confessional
the
second
i
open
my
mouth
i
be
scar
of
them
i
ask
my
mother
if
i
could
take
the
ball
down
to
the
north
canal
a
murky
river
that
ran
through
town
and
toss
it
away
after
negotiate
with
her
she
let
me
have
my
way
she
drove
down
to
the
bridge
on
north
street
and
watch
as
i
threw
the
ball
into
the
water
another
time
when
i
be
a
senior
in

that
time
i
have
be
a
caddy
there
for

little
too
long
for
my
own
good
we
get
to
the
sixth
hole
a
tee
where
the
drive

to
go
only
about
a
hundred
yard
to

day

guy
topped
his
ball
straight
into
the
water

at
least
ten
foot
into
the
muddy
pond

me
to

my
shoe
and
sock
off
and
wade
into
the
pond
after

the
water
told
him
to
get
his
ball
and
club
himself
and
ran
off
the
course
it
be
a
stupid
thing
to
do
even
bad
than
fling
my
hockey
stick
across
the
ice
even
though
my
mother

disappointed
because
this
incident

and
didn
t
make
as
much
of
a
big
deal
out
of
it
as
she
might
have
an
even
great
disappointment

little
about
college
that
i
almost
didn
t
get
there
i
didn
t
take
the
sat
assume
instead
that
the
score
on
my
rotc
naval

be
enough
i
didn
t
get
my
acceptance

just
a
few
day
before
i
graduate
from
high

i
must
have
be
on
the
wait
list
but
i
never
realize
it
get
into
a
less
competitive
school
rather
than
the
columbia
or
dartmouth
i
want
would
in
the
end
give
me
a
tremendous
advantage
the
caliber
of
the
competition
i
face
at
uma
in
those
day
make
it
easy
to
shine

though
i
be
never
short
on
confidence
my
first
week
at

the
fall

in
the
middle
of
the
pile
my
proud
parent

me
a
brand
new

lot
of
good
offer
but
my
professor
convince
me
to
go
to
graduate
school
i
turn
down
the
corporate
offer
and
decide
to
go
to
the
university
of
illinois
at
champaign
where
i
be
offer
a
fellowship
the
school
be
consistently
ranked
among
the
top
five
graduate
program
in
chemical
engineering
it
be
a
great
school
for
my
major
i
have
be
on
campus
no
more
than
two
week
when
i
met
a
pretty
girl
and
ask
her
out
our
saturday
night
date
go
so
well
that
we
end
up
just
off
a
campus
parking
lot
in
the
wood
the
window
in
my
vw
have
gotten
foggy
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
light
flash
through
it
be
the
campus
police
and
we
be
caught
in
an
awkward
position
i
froze
terrify
of
the
consequence
in
those
day
thing
be
quite
different
the
s
be
conservative
time
and
we
be
in
the
conservative
midwest
the
police
take
us
both
down
to
the
campus
station
and
kept
us
there
until
four
or
five
in
the
morning
before
send
us
home
my
life
flash
before
me
i
thought
i
be
about
to
lose
everything
my
fellowship
my
chance
to
get
a
graduate
degree
my
career
but
most
of
all
i
thought
about
my
mother
s
reaction
when
she
found
out
what
i
have
do
my
fate
would
be
decide
after
a
monday
meeting
with
the
university
provost
who
would
determine
the
disciplinary
action
on
sunday
morning
i
gather
up
the
nerve
to
call
the
chairman
of
the
chemical
engineering
department
dr
harry
drickamer
i
knew
him
only
by
his
gruff
reputation
scar
as
i
be
i
thought
he
be
my
only
hope
dr
drickamer
i
say
i
have
a
real
problem
the
campus
police
caught
me
mess
around
i
m
devastate
by
it
and
i
need
help
i
be
practically
wet
my
pant
tell
him
what
have
happen
damn
he
respond
of
all
the
graduate
student
i
ve
have
here
you
be
the
first
guy
to
do
something
like
that
i
ll
take
care
of
this
but
you
well
keep
your
pant
on
from
now
on
whatever
drickamer
do
save
my
butt
i
still
have
to
go
through
a
difficult
meeting
with
the
provost
but
i
wasn
t
thrown
out
of
the
school
yet
that
frighten
incident
get
me
much
closer
to
harry
we
form
a
wonderful
relationship
he
too
treat
me
like
a
son
we
bet
on
football
game
we
argue
over
thing
in
the
news
in
the
hallway
harry
would
tease
me
mercilessly
always
rag
me
about
the
red
sox
or
my
already
thin
hair
he
become
an
important
influence
in
my
life
a
mentor
throughout
my
graduate
year
i
need
the
help
at
illinois
i
wasn
t
as
well
prepared
as
the
kid
from
brooklyn
polytechnic
columbia
or
minnesota
so
in
my
first
year
i
struggle
there
as
well
i
have
to
really
fight
for
my
grade
i
wasn
t
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
star
after
my
first
year
at
illinois
in
when
i
be
to
graduate
with
my
master
s
degree
the
country
be
in
a
recession
instead
of
have
twenty
job
offer
i
get
two
one
from
an
oklahoma
oil
refinery
near
tulsa
and
another
from
the
ethyl
corp
in
baton
rouge
louisiana
on
the
airplane
for
my
ethyl
interview
i
be
travel
with
one
of
my
associate
from
the
university
of
illinois
when
something
odd
happen
the
stewardess
come
back
and
say
mr
welch
would
you
like
a
drink
she
then
turn
to
my
colleague
and
say
dr
gaertner
would
you
like
a
drink
i
thought
that
dr
gaertner
sound
a
lot
well
than
mr
welch
all
i
have
to
do
be
stay
a
couple
of
more
year
so
with
not
much
more
foresight
than
that
i
stayed
at
the
university
and
go
for
my
ph
d
it
help
that
the
job
market
wasn
t
very
good
it
also
help
that
i
really
like
my
illinois
professor
especially
drickamer
and
my
thesis
adviser
dr
jim
westwater
in
graduate
school
especially
in
a
ph
d
program
you
live
in
the
lab
you
come
in
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
go
home
at
eleven
at
night
sometimes
you
felt
like
you
be
judged
on
the
number
of
hour
your
light
be
on
my
thesis
be
on
condensation
in
steam
supply
system
so
i
spent
hour
vaporize
water
and
watch
it
condense
on
a
copper
plate
day
after
day
i
snap
high
speed
photograph
of
the
geometry
of
the
condense
drop
on
the
surface
i
developed
heat
transfer
equation
from
these
experiment
the
funny
thing
about
a
graduate
thesis
be
that
you
get
so
hooked
on
it
you
think
you
re
do
nobel
prize
work
with
jim
westwater
s
strong
support
i
get
my
ph
d
in
three
year
faster
than
almost
anyone
it
take
the
typical
grad
student
four
to
five
year
to
get
a
ph
d
i
be
hardly
the
program
s
resident
genius
to
pas
the
program
s
two
language
requirement
one
summer
i
study
french
and
german
day
and
night
for
three
straight
month
i
go
into
an
exam
room
and
tipped
my
head
everything
i
have
put
in
my
brain
pour
out
the
other
side
i
manage
to
pas
the
exam
but
if
you
ask
me
one
word
in
french
or
german
a
week
later
i
be
do
my
knowledge
empty
the
moment
i
hand
in
those
exam
despite
not
be
the
smartest
i
do
have
the
focus
to
get
the
work
do
some
of
the
more
intelligent
people
in
the
program
have
trouble
finish
their
thesis
they
couldn
t
bring
them
to
a
conclusion
my
impatience
help
me
i
have
always
felt
that
chemical
engineering
be
one
of
the
best
background
for
a
business
career
because
both
the
classwork
and
require
thesis
teach
you
one
very
important
lesson
there
be
no
finite
answer
to
many
question
what
really
count
be
your
thought
process
a
typical
exam
question
go
something
like
this
an
ice
skater
weighs
pound
and
be
do
figure
eight
on
ice
an
inch
thick
the
temperature
be
rise
a
degree
every
ten
minute
to
degree
and
the
wind
be
blowing
mile
an
hour
when
will
the
skater
fall
through
the
ice
there
be
no
formulaic
answer
to
that
question
the
same
be
true
for
most
business
problem
the
process
help
you
get
closer
to
the
darker
shade
of
gray
there
be
rarely
black
or
white
answer
more
often
than
not
business
be
smell
feel
and
touch
as
much
as
or
more
than
number
if
we
wait
for
the
perfect
answer
the
world
will
pas
us
by
by
the
time
i
left
illinois
in
i
have
decide
what
i
like
and
want
to
do
and
just
as
important
what
i
wasn
t
so
good
at
my
technical
skill
be
pretty
good
but
i
wasn
t
the
best
scientist
by
any
mean
compare
to
many
of
my
classmate
i
be
outgo
someone
who
love
people
more
than
book
and
sport
more
than
scientific
development
i
figure
those
skill
and
interest
be
best
suit
for
a
job
that
bridge
the
laboratory
and
the
commercial
world
know
that
be
a
little
bit
like
know
i
be
a
pretty
good
athlete
but
far
from
a
very
good
one
what
i
want
to
do
make
me
something
different
from
most
ph
d
s
they
usually
go
into
university
classroom
to
teach
or
corporate
laboratory
to
do
research
i
toyed
with
the
idea
of
teach
and
even
interviewed
at
syracuse
and
west
virginia
university
but
in
the
end
i
decide
against
that
option
besides
a
degree
long
term
friendship
and
a
way
of
think
through
problem
illinois
give
me

appeal
to
me
most
the
development
group
be
small
it
be
work
on
new
plastic
and
i
like
the
idea
of
go
back
to
massachusetts
like
my
earlier
professor
fox
struck
me
as
someone
who
be
smart
and
whom
i
could
trust
in
fox
i
saw
a
coach
and
a
role
model
who
brought
the
best
out
of
everyone
who
work
with
him
he
be
already
something
of
a
hero
inside
ge
because
he
have
discover
lexan
plastic
for
the
company
ge
begin
sell
lexan
in
a
potential
replacement
for
glass
and
metal
it
be
use
for
everything
from
electric
coffeemakers
to
the
light
cover
on
the
wing
of
supersonic
aircraft
fox
like
most
inventor
be
already
on
to
the
next
project
become
champion
for
a
new
thermoplastic
call
ppo
polyphenylene
oxide
he
convince
me
that
ppo
be
go
to
be
the
next
great
thing
he
described
its
unique
ability
to
withstand
high
temperature
it
have
the
potential
to
replace
hot
water
copper
pip
and
stainless
steel
medical
instrument
he
capped
off
the
sell
job
by
tell
me
that
i
would
be
the
first
employee
in
charge
of
get
the
plastic
out
of
the
lab
and
into
production
i
accepted
within
a
week
what
i
didn
t
know
when
i
show
up
for
work
my
first
day
on
october
be
how
quickly
i
would
become
frustrate
in
just
one
year
ge
s
bureaucracy
would
nearly
drive
me
out
of
the
company

get
out
of
the
pile
in
i
have
be
work
at
ge
for
a
year
as
an
engineer
make
when
my
first
bos
hand
me
a
raise
i
be
okay
with
it
until
i
found
out
later
that
day
that
i
get
exactly
what
all
four
of
us
share
an
office
receive
i
thought
i
deserve
more
than
the
standard
increase
i
talk
to
my
bos
and
the
discussion
go
nowhere
frustrate
i
start
look
for
another
job
i
begin
scan
the
help
want
ad
in
chemical
week
magazine
and
the
wall
street
journal
hop
to
find
a
quick
escape
i
felt
trap
in
the
pile
near
the
bottom
of
a
big
organization
i
want
out
i
get
a
nice
offer
from
international
mineral
chemical
in
chicago
not
far
from
where
my
wife
s
mother
live
it
seem
like
a
chance
to
escape
the
standard
predetermine
raise
be
just
a
part
of
my
irritation
at
what
i
saw
as
the
company
s
stingy
behavior
when
ge
recruit
me
the
company
have
laid
out
a
cushy
red
carpet
they
convince
me
i
be
just
what
they
be
look
for
to
help
develop
a
new
plastic
ppo
when
carolyn
and
i
arrive
in
pittsfield
massachusetts
i
be
expect
at
least
a
little
of
the
seductive
treatment
to
continue
we
come
to
ge
with
little
more
than
change
in
our
pocket
we
have
driven
mile
from
illinois
in
my
fading
black
volkswagen
when
i
join
ge
in
october
the
local
union
be
on
strike
in
order
to
avoid
the
picket
line
i
report
for
work
with
the
title
of
process
development
specialist
in
a
local
warehouse
quickly
my
new
bos
burt
coplan
make
it
clear
that
the
woo
process
be
over
coplan
a
thin
forty
something
development
manager
ask
me
if
my
wife
and
i
have
already
found
an
apartment
in
town
when
i
told
him
we
be
stay
at
the
local
hotel
he
say
well
we
don
t
cover
that
you
know
i
couldn
t
believe
it
if
it
hadn
t
be
my
first
week
in
the
job
i
would
have
let
him
have
it
but
i
wasn
t
about
to
blow
it
coplan
could
not
have
be
more
charm
during
the
interview
process
in
fact
he
be
a
decent
guy
he
just
saw
it
as
his
job
to
try
to
scrimp
on
everything
he
act
as
if
ge
be
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
the
romance
that
brought
me
to
ge
be
evaporate
we
move
out
of
the
hotel
i
checked
into
a
cheaper
motel
while
carolyn
go
to
live
with
my
parent
in
salem
for
a
couple
of
week
until
we
could
find
an
apartment
we
eventually
move
into
a
small
first
floor
flat
in
a
two
story
wood
frame
house
on
first
street
where
the
landlady
be
so
chintzy
with
the
heat
that
we
have
to
knock
on
the
wall
to
get
her
to
put
the
thermostat
up
even
then
she
d
often
shout
through
the
paper
thin
wall
for
carolyn
or
me
to
wear
a
sweater
to
help
furnish
the
place
my
parent
give
us
to
buy
a
couch
and
a
bed
everything
that
first
year
wasn
t
awful
there
be
thing
i
like
the
autonomy
to
design
and
build
a
new
pilot
plant
for
ppo
and
the
sense
of
be
part
of
a
team
in
what
felt
like
a
small
company
i
work
closely
with
dr
al
gowan
who
join
ge
the
same
month
as
i
do
he
ran
the
early
experiment
on
the
new
plastic
in
beaker
i
design
the
kettle
to
test
the
big
batch
and
built
them
at
a
local
machine
shop
we
construct
a
pilot
plant
from
scratch
in
a
small
outbuilding
in
the
back
of
our
office
each
day
we
d
run
several
experiment
test
different
process
for
someone
just
off
a
college
campus
it
be
a
real
adventure
work
with
a
new
plastic
like
ppo
we
need
all
the
scientific
help
we
could
get
so
at
least
twice
a
month
i
d
jump
into
my
car
and
drive
mile
to
ge
s
central
research
and
development
lab
in
schenectady
new
york
where
the
plastic
be
invent
i
d
spend
the
day
work
with
researcher
and
scientist
always
try
to
excite
them
about
the
product
s
potential
in
those
day
the
central
lab
be
fund
entirely
by
corporate
so
there
be
no
direct
incentive
for
the
lab
s
scientist
to
focus
their
effort
on
any
one
business
or
for
that
matter
any
commercialization
the
scientist
like
do
advanced
research
the
game
be
to
get
them
to
put
time
into
the
development
of
your
project
after
the
invention
phase
i
have
no
authority
it
be
all
persuasion
it
be
easy
to
get
attention
from
al
hay
the
inventor
of
the
plastic
and
several
of
his
associate
but
some
weren
t
interested
in
commercialize
product
i
look
forward
to
those
trip
to
the
r
d
lab
because
it
be
fun
sell
my
project
and
the
lab
be
a
real
help
these
trip
turn
out
to
be
relatively
lucrative
i
could
make
the
trip
in
my
vw
for
a
buck
of
gas
four
gallon
at
cent
a
gallon
and
ge
would
pay
me
seven
cent
a
mile
to
use
my
own
car
so
i
d
pocket
something
like
seven
buck
on
every
trip
i
make
to
schenectady
it
seem
crazy
now
but
all
of
us
would
drive
somewhere
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
to
get
a
little
extra
cash
in
spite
of
the
good
stuff
i
be
get
more
frustrate
every
day
the
penny
wise
behavior
that
start
that
first
week
continued
in
a
redbrick
building
on
plastic
avenue
four
of
us
share
a
small
cramped
office
we
have
to
make
do
with
only
two
phone
scramble
to
pas
them
around
the
desk
on
business
trip
burt
ask
us
to
double
up
in
hotel
room
for
me
the
standard
raise
be
the
proverbial
last
straw
so
i
go
to
coplan
and
quit
just
as
i
be
about
to
drive
my
car
back
across
the
country
again
coplan
s
bos
call
me
reuben
gutoff
a
young
executive
base
in
connecticut
invite
carolyn
and
me
out
to
a
long
dinner
at
the
yellow
aster
in
pittsfield
gutoff
be
no
stranger
we
have
met
in
several
business
review
we
have
make
a
connection
because
i
would
always
give
him
more
than
he
expect
as
a
junior
development
engineer
i
have
give
him
a
complete
cost
and
physical
property
analysis
of
our
new
plastic
versus
every
major
compete
product
offer
by
the
duponts
dows
and
celaneses
of
the
world
it
project
the
long
range
product
cost
of
nylon
polypropylene
acrylic
and
acetel
against
our
product
it
be
by
no
mean
an
earth
shatter
analysis
but
it
be
more
than
the
usual
from
a
guy
in
a
white
lab
coat
what
i
be
try
to
do
be
get
out
of
the
pile
if
i
have
just
answer
his
question
it
would
have
be
tough
to
get
notice
boss
usually
have
answer
in
mind
when
they
hand
out
question
they
re
just
look
for
confirmation
to
set
myself
apart
from
the
crowd
i
thought
i
have
to
think
big
than
the
question
pose
i
want
to
provide
not
only
the
answer
but
an
unexpected
fresh
perspective
gutoff
obviously
notice
over
dinner
for
four
straight
hour
he
be
hell
bent
on
keep
me
at
ge
he
make
his
pitch
promising
to
get
me
a
big
raise
and
more
important
vow
to
keep
the
bureaucracy
of
the
company
out
of
my
way
i
be
surprised
to
learn
that
he
share
my
frustration
with
the
bureaucracy
this
time
i
be
lucky
because
many
ge
boss
would
have
be
happy
to
let
me
go
i
undoubtedly
be
a
pain
in
the
as
to
coplan
fortunately
gutoff
didn
t
see
it
that
way
but
he
didn
t
have
to
deal
with
me
every
day
the
dinner
with
him
go
on
without
an
answer
during
his
two
hour
drive
back
home
to
westport
connecticut
he
stop
at
a
pay
phone
next
to
the
highway
to
continue
sell
it
be
one
a
m
carolyn
and
i
be
already
in
bed
and
reuben
be
still
make
his
case
by
put
more
money
on
the
table
add
to
the
raise
coplan
give
me
by
promising
an
increase
in
responsibility
and
air
cover
from
the
bureaucracy
gutoff
show
me
he
really
care
a
few
hour
after
daybreak
on
the
morning
before
my
go
away
party
i
decide
to
stay
that
night
surround
by
a
pile
of
gift
at
what
be
suppose
to
be
my
farewell
celebration
at
coplan
s
house
i
told
my
colleague
that
i
be
not
leave
after
all
most
of
them
seem
happy
although
i
saw
massive
anxiety
from
burt
at
the
thought
of
have
me
back
i
don
t
remember
if
i
kept
the
gift
but
i
think
i
do
gutoff
s
recognition
that
he
consider
me
different
and
special
make
a
powerful
impression
ever
since
that
time
differentiation
have
be
a
basic
part
of
how
i
manage
that
standard
raise
i
get
over
four
decade
ago
have
probably
driven
my
behavior
to
an
extreme
but
differentiation
be
all
about
be
extreme
reward
the
best
and
weed
out
the
ineffective
rigorous
differentiation
delivers
real
star
and
star
build
great
business
some
contend
that
differentiation
be
nut
bad
for
morale
they
say
that
differential
treatment
erodes
the
very
idea
of
teamwork
not
in
my
world
you
build
strong
team
by
treat
individual
differently
just
look
at
the
way
baseball
team
pay
game
win
pitcher
and
plus
home
run
hitter
the
relative
contribution
of
those
player
be
easy
to
measure
their
stats
jump
out
at
you
yet
they
be
still
part
of
a
team
everybody
s
get
to
feel
they
have
a
stake
in
the
game
but
that
doesn
t
mean
everyone
on
the
team
have
to
be
treat
the
same
way
from
my
day
in
the
pit
i
learn
that
the
game
be
all
about
fielding
the
best
athlete
whoever
field
the
best
team
there
won
reuben
gutoff
reinforce
that
it
be
no
different
in
business
win
team
come
from
differentiation
reward
the
best
and
remove
the
weak
always
fight
to
raise
the
bar
i
be
lucky
to
get
out
of
the
pile
and
learn
this
my
very
first
year
at
ge
the
hard
way
by
nearly
quit
the
company

blowing
the
roof
off
year
before
i
be
give
the
nickname
neutron
jack
i
have
actually
blown
up
a
factory
for
real
it
be
early
in
my
ge
career
i
be
year
old
and
have
be
with
the
company
for
all
of
three
year
i
can
remember
that
spring
day
as
if
it
be
yesterday
it
be
one
of
the
most
frighten
experience
of
my
life
i
be
sit
in
my
office
in
pittsfield
just
across
the
street
from
the
pilot
plant
when
the
explosion
occur
it
be
a
huge
blast
that
blew
the
roof
off
the
building
and
knock
out
all
the
window
on
the
top
floor
it
shook
everyone
especially
me
to
their
very
toe
with
the
sound
of
the
explosion
still
ring
in
my
ear
i
race
out
of
my
office
and
toward
the
redbrick
plant
yard
away
on
plastic
avenue
oh
my
god
i
thought
i
hope
no
one
get
hurt
roof
shingle
and
shard
of
glass
be
scatter
everywhere
cloud
of
smoke
and
dust
hung
over
the
building
i
ran
up
the
stair
to
the
third
floor
i
be
scar
as
hell
my
heart
be
pound
and
i
be
bath
in
sweat
the
wreckage
the
explosion
cause
be
bad
than
i
expect
a
big
chunk
of
roof
and
ceiling
have
collapse
onto
the
floor
miraculously
no
one
be
seriously
injured
we
be
experiment
with
a
chemical
process
we
be
bubbling
oxygen
through
a
highly
volatile
solution
in
a
large
tank
an
unexplainable
spark
set
off
the
explosion
we
be
lucky
because
the
safety
bolt
let
go
as
design
and
allow
the
top
to
shoot
straight
up
through
the
ceiling
as
the
bos
i
be
clearly
at
fault
the
next
day
i
have
to
drive
mile
to
bridgeport
connecticut
to
explain
to
a
corporate
group
executive
charlie
reed
why
the
accident
occur
he
be
over
my
direct
bos
reuben
gutoff
the
guy
who
have
persuade
me
not
to
leave
ge
gutoff
would
also
attend
the
meeting
but
i
be
the
guy
on
the
line
and
i
be
prepared
for
the
bad
ge
s
boss
have
all
sort
of
expectation
of
their
manager
they
expect
them
to
come
up
with
new
idea
for
product
they
expect
them
to
enter
new
market
and
increase
revenue
they
do
not
expect
someone
to
blow
up
a
plant
i
knew
i
could
explain
why
the
blast
go
off
and
i
have
some
idea
on
how
to
fix
the
problem
but
i
be
a
nervous
wreck
my
confidence
be
shaken
almost
as
much
as
the
building
i
have
destroyed
i
didn
t
know
charlie
reed
that
well
yet
from
the
first
minute
i
walk
into
his
office
in
bridgeport
reed
make
me
feel
completely
at
ease
a
ph
d
in
chemical
engineering
from
mit
charlie
be
a
brilliant
scientist
with
a
professorial
bent
in
fact
he
have
be
on
the
mit
faculty
as
a
teacher
of
apply
mathematics
for
five
year
before
join
ge
in
he
be
a
balding
fellow
of
medium
height
and
build
with
an
ever
present
glitter
in
his
eye
he
also
have
a
passion
for
technology
a
bachelor
married
to
the
corporation
he
be
the
high
rank
ge
executive
with
hand
on
experience
in
chemical
charlie
understood
what
could
happen
when
you
be
work
at
high
temperature
with
volatile
material
that
day
he
be
incredibly
understand
he
take
an
almost
socratic
approach
in
deal
with
the
accident
his
concern
be
what
i
have
learn
from
the
explosion
and
if
i
thought
i
could
fix
the
reactor
process
he
question
whether
we
should
continue
to
move
forward
on
the
project
it
be
all
intellect
no
emotion
or
anger
it
s
well
that
we
learn
about
this
problem
now
rather
than
later
when
we
have
a
large
scale
operation
go
he
say
thank
god
no
one
be
hurt
charlie
s
reaction
make
a
huge
impression
on
me
when
people
make
mistake
the
last
thing
they
need
be
discipline
it
s
time
for
encouragement
and
confidence
building
the
job
at
this
point
be
to
restore
self
confidence
i
think
pile
on
when
someone
be
down
be
one
of
the
bad
thing
any
of
us
can
do
it
s
a
standard
joke
during
ge
operating
review
that
if
one
of
the
business
ceo
be
get
heat
and
someone
in
the
room
jump
on
the
bandwagon
the
staff
team
will
typically
pull
out
the
white
handkerchief
toss
it
in
the
air
and
flag
the
person
for
pile
on
pile
on
during
a
weak
moment
can
force
people
into
what
i
call
the
ge
vortex
it
can
happen
anywhere
you
see
the
vortex
when
leader
lose
their
confidence
begin
to
panic
and
spiral
downward
into
a
hole
of
self
doubt
i
ve
see
it
happen
to
strong
bright
and
self
confident
general
manager
of
billion
dollar
business
they
be
do
just
fine
in
good
time
but
then
miss
an
operating
plan
or
make
a
bad
deal
not
for
the
first
time
and
self
doubt
begin
to
creep
in
they
become
willing
to
agree
to
anything
just
to
get
out
of
the
room
and
make
it
through
another
day
it
s
a
terrible
thing
to
see
few
ever
recover
from
the
vortex
i
ve
try
to
do
everything
to
help
people
through
it
or
well
yet
avoid
it
don
t
get
me
wrong
i
enjoy
challenge
a
person
s
idea
no
one
love
a
good
and
passionately
fought
argument
more
than
i
do
this
isn
t
about
be
tough
mind
and
straightforward
that
s
the
job
but
so
be
sense
when
to
hug
and
when
to
kick
of
course
arrogant
people
who
refuse
to
learn
from
their
mistake
have
to
go
if
we
re
manage
good
people
who
be
clearly
eat
themselves
up
over
an
error
our
job
be
to
help
them
through
it
that
doesn
t
mean
you
have
to
take
it
easy
on
your
top
performer
a
perfect
example
involves
one
of
our
real
a
player
an
executive
with
global
r
d
responsibility
for
a
major
ge
business
just
last
year
he
and
i
be
chat
casually
over
cocktail
the
night
before
our
annual
officer
meeting
i
have
recently
return
from
a
tour
of
our
r
d
operation
in
india
and
be
excite
by
what
i
have
see
as
i
described
my
impression
of
his
operation
this
guy
told
me
i
be
give
a
load
of
b
on
my
trip
they
aren
t
do
anywhere
near
the
quality
of
work
in
india
you
think
he
say
his
comment
irritated
me
i
couldn
t
believe
him
the
engineer
and
scientist
in
india
be
on
his
payroll
yet
he
be
make
a
distinction
between
his
people
here
in
the
united
state
where
he
be
locate
and
there
in
india
i
always
knew
we
have
a
problem
get
the
whole
organization
s
mind
set
around
the
idea
of
global
intellect
tap
every
great
mind
in
the
world
no
matter
where
it
be
locate
when
i
get
that
reaction
from
one
of
my
best
i
knew
it
be
a
helluva
lot
big
problem
than
i
d
thought
without
name
him
i
launch
into
that
story
the
next
morning
in
front
of
of
ge
s
top
executive
i
use
it
as
an
example
of
how
our
company
wasn
t
get
what
maximize
global
intellect
be
all
about
i
challenged
everyone
in
the
room
to
look
at
themselves
in
the
mirror
to
make
sure
they
weren
t
in
the
same
boat
we
could
not
have
the
r
d
team
in
the
united
state
do
all
of
the
advanced
fun
work
while
farm
out
the
low
value
project
to
place
like
india
my
visit
to
india
convince
me
that
their
research
lab
be
fill
with
scientist
equal
to
or
well
than
those
in
the
united
state
and
in
a
lot
more
discipline
than
software
understandably
the
guy
felt
i
have
clobber
him
in
public
and
in
front
of
his
peer
i
wouldn
t
have
do
that
if
he
weren
t
one
of
the
brightest
and
most
confident
executive
in
the
company
he
be
a
ge
all
star
not
a
turkey
within
a
day
or
two
of
the
meeting
he
sent
me
a
note
explain
that
he
have
inadvertently
diminish
the
significant
progress
make
by
his
team
in
india
and
have
left
me
with
the
wrong
impression
i
immediately
call
to
thank
him
for
his
note
and
assure
him
that
he
have
not
screw
up
obviously
this
negative
role
model
act
doesn
t
work
with
everyone
you
can
do
it
with
your
very
best
as
long
as
they
know
they
re
your
best
use
role
model
always
help
me
make
the
point
to
a
large
group
the
same
applies
to
people
who
take
what
i
call
a
big
swing
at
something
and
miss
one
of
the
real
advantage
of
a
big
company
be
the
ability
to
take
on
big
project
with
huge
potential
the
quick
way
to
neutralize
that
advantage
be
to
go
after
the
scalp
of
those
who
dare
to
dream
and
reach
but
fail
that
just
reinforces
a
risk
averse
culture
the
best
way
to
support
dream
and
stretch
be
to
set
apart
small
idea
with
big
potential
then
give
people
positive
role
model
and
the
resource
to
turn
small
project
into
big
business
a
good
example
of
this
be
our
early
attempt
in
the
late
s
to
develop
a
revolutionary
new
light
bulb
call
halarc
it
be
an
ambitious
effort
to
create
a
light
bulb
that
last
ten
time
longer
than
the
typical
product
at
a
fraction
of
the
energy
it
appear
to
be
a
perfect
environmental
solution
this
be
a
big
million
swing
problem
be
no
one
want
to
pay
for
a
single
light
bulb
no
matter
how
green
or
revolutionary
and
our
project
fail
instead
of
punish
those
involve
in
the
halarc
effort
we
celebrate
their
great
try
we
hand
out
cash
management
award
and
promote
several
halarc
player
to
new
job
while
no
one
be
happy
with
the
result
we
make
a
big
point
of
reward
the
people
on
the
team
we
want
everyone
in
the
company
to
know
that
take
a
big
swing
and
miss
be
okay
by
our
project
to
make
a
new
plastic
have
come
a
long
way
we
be
get
close
to
a
product
we
could
sell
gutoff
assign
a
general
manager
name
bob
finholt
to
run
it
he
be
a
dreamer
and
big
thinker
who
quickly
sell
his
boss
on
the
idea
that
we
have
something
go
in
pittsfield
charlie
reed
get
the
board
to
approve
our
new
plastic
plant
in
the
million
factory
would
produce
the
ppo
product
that
brought
me
to
ge
in
the
first
place
the
same
product
that
lead
to
the
disaster
in
the
pilot
plant
we
get
the
money
on
the
basis
that
we
have
a
breakthrough
plastic
that
be
a
step
beyond
ge
s
first
engineer
plastic
lexan
which
have
just
set
a
new
performance
standard
it
be
a
hard
sell
in
part
because
we
didn
t
want
to
move
to
mount
vernon
indiana
where
our
first
lexan
plastic
plant
have
be
built
instead
we
picked
a
acre
site
in
selkirk
new
york
i
found
it
on
a
sunday
afternoon
drive
over
from
pittsfield
with
my
wife
and
three
kid
in
the
car
the
five
of
us
get
out
and
walk
all
over
the
site
it
be
a
beautiful
piece
of
land
a
former
marshal
yard
for
the
new
york
central
railroad
with
a
right
of
way
on
the
hudson
river
i
love
the
site
and
wouldn
t
leave
until
the
kid
give
out
some
ge
executive
be
skeptical
of
the
location
because
it
be
only
mile
away
from
schenectady
where
ge
already
have
one
of
our
large
and
old
manufacturing
plant
there
be
a
lot
of
selfishness
in
our
request
too
we
want
to
run
our
own
show
and
stay
where
we
be
to
justify
it
we
argue
that
we
be
create
a
highly
technical
product
and
need
access
to
the
chemist
and
scientist
in
ge
s
r
d
center
in
schenectady
as
well
as
our
own
research
lab
in
pittsfield
some
mile
away
we
won
the
argument
and
the
money
by
this
time
bob
finholt
s
more
creative
bent
earn
him
a
promotion
to
strategic
planning
at
headquarters
with
the
general
manager
s
slot
open
i
go
after
it
after
a
dinner
in
selkirk
with
gutoff
and
the
rest
of
our
team
i
follow
gutoff
to
his
car
behind
the
stone

potential
market

at
the
selkirk
site
on
a
cold
winter
day
in

ge
corporate
research
lab
scientist
who

in
our
overcoat
and
glove
we
stood
at
the
top
of
a
massive
hole
in
the
ground
that
must
have
be
foot
deep
enough
to
bury
all
of
us
with
the
product
s
newly
found
technical
flaw
and
the
gap
hole
in

before
me
al
you

turn
to
us
and
reply
calmly
hey
guy
don
t
worry
about
it
i
have
a
couple
of
new
plastic
come
along
i
felt
like
throw
him
in
the
hole
i
wonder
what
i
have
gotten
myself
into
we
be
way
ahead
of
ourselves
this
be
a
million
investment
in
a
business
that
the
company
didn
t
really
understand
now
it
become
clear
we
didn
t
have
a
work
product
for
the
plant
to
produce
even
bad
the
scientist
who
invent
the
product
have
no
idea
how
to
fix
it
it
take
six
frantic
month
before
we
work
our
way
out
of
the
problem
i
practically
live
in
the
lab
during
that
time
we
try
everything
we
be
stick
every
compound
we
could
think
of
into
ppo
to
see
if
it
would
stop
the
crack
dan
fox
the
chemist
who
convince
me
to
join
ge
lead
a
team
of
chemist
in
pittsfield
who
eventually
found
the
solution
by
blending
ppo
with
low
cost
polystyrene
and
some
rubber
we
have
to
juggle
the
plant
design
to
take
care
of
the
blending
process
but
it
work
the
story
have
a
happy
end
the
blend
plastic
be
call
noryl
and
eventually
become
a
win
product
that
today
do
more
than
billion
in
worldwide
sale
what
make
it
work
be
a
crazy
band
of
people
who
believe
we
could
do
almost
anything
we
be
scar
to
death
but
fill
with
dream
and
just
nut
enough
to
try
anything
to
get
the
plastic
to
work
we
may
have
be
in
one
of
the
world
s
large
corporation
but
in
pittsfield
or
selkirk
we
saw
ourselves
as
a
very
small
family
business
with
a
bank
behind
us
talk
about
luck
this
whole
experience
in
the
plastic
business
be
like
god

down
and
say
jack
this
be
your
moment
take
it

remember
the
first
time

today
but
everything
be
a
new
experience
i
love
every
minute
of
it
and
i
found
pleasure
in
the
small
thing

fly
a
two
engine
united
caravelle
jet
from
hartford

on
our
way
to
the

lexan
in
mount
vernon
indiana

stewardess
would
hand
each
of
us
a
can
of
macademia
nut
and
two
tiny
bottle
of
scotch
we
d
look
forward
to
that
treat
all
the
way
to
the
airport
at
time
i
couldn
t
believe
that
i
be
be
paid
to
do
all
these
thing
neither
could
my
mother
when
i
travel
to

for
the
first
time
in
on
a
business
trip

not
reimburse
me
be
you

part
of

a
business
from
scratch
and
we
make
just
about
every
one
of
them
an
excuse
for
celebration
when
we
land
an
order
of
for
plastic
pellet
we
d
stop
off
for

standard
practice
in
silicon
valley
but
they
be
also
standard
for

and
pittsfield
in
the
mid
s
every
early
promotion
every
bonus
and
every

i
feel
on
top
of
the
world
but
i
d
quickly
get
a
reminder
of
how
thing
can
change
besides
the
car
i
also
bought
a
new
suit
i
like
to
differentiate
myself
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
in
those
early
day
in
the
summer
i
would
often
wear
tan
poplin
suit
make
by
haspel
with
blue
button
down
shirt
and
strip
tie
silly
as
it
now
seem
i
even
like
the
ring
of
hearing
someone
address
me
as
dr
welch
after
work
on
one
beautiful
spring
day
i
go
to
the
parking
lot
and
get
into
my
shiny
new
car
i
push
the
lever
to
put
the
top
down
for
the
first
time
all
of
a
sudden
the
hydraulic
hose
sprang
a
leak
dark
grungy
oil
shot
up
onto
my
suit
and
ruin
the
paint
job
on
the
front
of
my
beautiful
new
car
i
couldn
t
believe
it
there
i
be
think
i
be
big
than
life
and
smack
come
the
reminder
that
brought
me
back
to
reality
it
be
a
great
lesson
just
when
you
think
you
re
a
big
shot
something
happens
to
wake
you
up
it
would
by
no
mean
be
the
last
time

happen

real
rock
for
me
not

then
but
on
many
other
occasion
when
i
worried
about
the
consequence
of
rock
the
boat
at
work
carolyn
would
encourage
me
to
do
exactly
what
i
thought
be
right
regardless
of
what
others
at
ge
might
think
after
each
promotion
she
and
the
kid
would
celebrate
by
decorate
the
house
and
driveway
with
colorful
streamer
follow
my
promotion
to
general
manager
of

i
have
a
interview
with
the
monogram
the
company
magazine
when
the
writer
come
out
to
pittsfield
for
our
interview
he
refer
to
me
as
dr
welch
i
shot
back
i
don
t
make
house
call
so
call
me
jack
a
quote
he
include
in
the
article
i
be
now
ready
to
act
as
a
businessman
and
not
an
engineer
so
i
be
anxious
to
bag
the
dr
welch
moniker
i
brag
that
my
employee
be
a
turn
on
bunch
who
generate
their
own
electricity
i
boast
that
we
grow
the
plastic
business
more
in
my
first
year
as
general
manager
than
in
the
previous
ten
year
there
s
gold
here
and
we
be
lucky
enough
to
come
along
and
dig
the
mine
what
an
as
i
be
so
completely
full
of
myself
without
regard
for
any
of
the
previous
leader
of
the
business
i
claimed
we
would
break
all
the
sale
and
profit
record
those
who
read
the
article
must
have
damn
near
choked
fortunately
i
be
below
the
radar
insulate
from
the
ge
bureaucracy
when
i
get
the
entire
plastic
operation
which
include
lexan
i
really
believe
i
have
inherit
gold
compare
to
noryl
lexan
be
a
thoroughbred
it
be
clear
as
glass
and
tough
as
steel
it
be
flame
resistant
and
lightweight
boeing
put
pound
of
lexan
into
every
jumbo
jet
it
make
in
those
day
half
of
its
application
replace
metal
for
year
we
have
be
sell
a
blend
product
in
noryl
and
we
be
always
try
to
get
it
to
work
we
be
the
second
class
citizen
with
the
second
class
product
with
a
low
sell
price
we
manage
to
get
it
into
business
machine
housing
lawn
sprinkler
hair
dryer
disposable
razor
cartridge
and
color
television
but
we
have
to
fight
for
every
pound
order
when
we
finally
get
lexan
i
thought
we
could
take
on
the
world
and
be
cocky
enough
to
say
so
the
statement
be
even
more
outrageous
since
the
company
s
view
of
plastic
be
a
lot
less
flatter
the
guy
who
have
be
run
the
business
be
promote
to
general
manager
of
silicone
then
about
percent
large
than
plastic
silicone
be
very
profitable
while
plastic
be
just
get
to
breakeven
nevertheless
the
future
look
very
bright
this
be
a
time
when
forecaster
believe
that
plastic
would
be
the
fast
grow
industry
over
the
next
decade
faster
than
computer
and
electronics
even
the
movie

into

in
the
graduate
dustin
hoffman

to
get
a
career
in

we
add
marketing

office
the
local
press
cover
the
event
all
this
promotion
get
a
lot
of
attention
because
it
be
really
different
marketing
for
an
industrial
plastic
we
want
to
replace
every
metal
part
in
a
car
with
lexan
from
the
trim
on
the
dashboard
to
the
crank

because
our
five

office
in

compete
against

office
we
have
to
be
faster
and
more
creative
we
take
on
the
big
chemical
company
and
do
well
because
we
could
outrun
them
we
be
use
the
strength
of
a
big
company
and
try
to
run
with
the
speed
of
a
small
company
we
be
fly
by
we
have
beaten
my
boastful
prediction
by
more
than
double
the
plastic
business
in
less
than
three
year
despite
the
obvious
success
i
be
clearly
ruffle
the
feather
of
some
powerful
people
at
corporate
headquarters
one
of
them
be
roy
johnson
the
head
of
ge
s
human
resource
department
johnson
be
the
keeper
of
the
key
reporting
directly
to
chairman
fred
borch
at
the
time
and
eventually
to
reg
jones
and
he
have
a
big
impact
on
hire
decision
year
later
i
found
a
memo
that
johnson
write
in
july
to
vice
chairman
herm
wei
at
the
time
i
be
be
consider
for
another
promotion
to
vice
president
of
the
chemical
and
metallurgical
division
a
million
sale
group
of
business
in
the
memo
johnson
conclude
that
i
deserve
the
promotion
but
that
the
appointment
carry
with
it
more
than
the
usual
degree
of
risk
despite
his
many
strength
jack
have
a
number
of
significant
limitation
on
the
plus
side
he
have
a
drive
motivation
to
grow
a
business
natural
entrepreneurial
instinct
creativeness
and
aggressiveness
be
a
natural
leader
and
organizer
and
have
a
high
degree
of
technical
competence
on
the
other
hand
continued
johnson
he
be
somewhat
arrogant
reacts
or
overreacts
emotionally
particularly
to
criticism
get
too
personally
involve
in
the
detail
of
his
business
tends
to
overrely
on
his
quick
mind
and
intuition
rather
than
on
solid
homework
and
staff
assistance
in
get
into
and
out
of
complex
situation
and
have
something
of
an
anti
establishment
attitude
toward
general
electric
activity
outside
his
own
sphere
i
m
glad
i
found
this
evaluation
later
or
i
might
have
do
something
stupid
even
if
he
have
some
pretty
good
point
at
the
time
i
probably
wouldn
t
have
accepted
the
criticism
johnson
chalked
up
my
limitation
to
youthfulness
and
lack
of
maturity
but
fortunately
didn
t
block
me
for
the
division
job
thank
goodness
herm
wei
support
me
look
back
there
be
enough
reason
for
johnson
and
others
to
have
reservation
obviously
i
wasn
t
a
natural
fit
for
the
corporation
i
have
little
respect
or
tolerance
for
protocol
i
be
an
impatient
manager
especially
with
people
who
didn
t
perform
i
be
blunt
and
candid
and
some
thought
rude
my
language
could
be
coarse
and
impolitic
i
didn
t
like
sit
and
listen
to
can
presentation
or
reading
report
prefer
one
on
one
conversation
where
i
expect
manager
to
know
their
business
and
to
have
the
answer
i
love
constructive
conflict
and
thought
open
and
honest
debate
about
business
issue
brought
out
the
best
decision
if
an
idea
couldn
t
survive
a
no
hold
bar
discussion
the
marketplace
would
kill
it
larry
bossidy
a
good
friend
and
former
ge
vice
chairman
would
later
liken
our
staff
meeting
to
miller
lite
commercial
they
be
loud
raucous
and
animate
and
i
never
hid
my
thought
or
feeling
during
a
business
discussion
i
could
get
so
emotionally
involve
that
i
d
stammer
out
what
others
might
consider
outrageous
thing
a
couple
of
favorite
be
my
six
year
old
kid
could
do
well
than
that
or
don
t
walter
cronkite
me
that
be
understood
by
everyone
to
mean
you
report
the
bad
news
but
you
don
t
tell
me
how
you
re
go
to
fix
it
people
who
couldn
t
fit
into
this
informal
and
entrepreneurial
environment
left
or
be
ask
to
leave
i
cut
my
loss
quickly
on
bad
hire
that
didn
t
perform
people
who
be
arrogant
or
pompous
didn
t
last
very
long
those
who
deliver
take
home
outsize
salary
increase
and
bonus
just
as
i
now
do
i
kick
but
i
also
hug
these
difference
cast
me
as
a
rebel
of
sort
and
lead
to
all
kind
of
ridiculous
scuttlebutt
most
of
the
rumor
about
me
be
just
that
rumor
they
make
for
some
fun
conversation
around
the
water
cooler
but
have
little
basis
in
reality
the
gossip
claimed
that
i
d
jump
on
top
of
desk
or
conference
table
like
some
kind
of
temperamental
bully
that
be
a
crock
yet
i
kept
move
high
despite
johnson
s
reservation
i
get
the
job
as
head
of
the
chemical
and
metallurgical
division
in
and
it
brought
a
bunch
of
new
challenge
i
have
spent
year
in
ge
work
in
the
plastic
arena
now
i
have
to
figure
out
how
to
run
a
whole
portfolio
of
material
business
include
carbide
cut
tool
industrial
diamond
insulate
material
and
electro
material
product
and
do
it
all
with
very
different
people
my
first
job
be
to
get
a
close
look
at
my
team
with
a
couple
of
exception
i
found
them
want
i
m
the
first
to
admit
i
could
be
impulsive
in
remove
people
during
those
early
day
but
over
the
year
i
learn
a
lot
about
how
to
do
it
it
s
the
toughest
and
most
difficult
thing
we
ever
do
it
s
never
easy
and
it
doesn
t
ever
become
easy
if
i
learn
anything
about
make
this
easy
it
s
see
to
it
that
no
one
should
ever
be
surprised
when
they
be
ask
to
leave
by
the
time
i
met
with
manager
i
be
about
to
replace
i
would
have
have
at
least
two
or
three
conversation
to
express
my
disappointment
and
to
give
them
the
chance
to
turn
thing
around
i
would
follow
up
every
business
review
with
a
handwritten
note
some
may
not
have
appreciate
my
candor
but
they
always
knew
exactly
where
they
stood
that
first
talk
be
when
the
surprise
and
disappointment
if
any
should
occur
not
when
the
person
be
ask
to
leave
i
can
t
remember
a
single
instance
where
someone
felt
shock
or
blind
side
when
our
final
conversation
take
place
look
i
d
say
we
give
this
thing
a
good
run
we
both
know
it
s
not
work
out
it
s
time
to
wrap
it
up
inevitably
there
s
some
disappointment
more
often
than
not
there
s
relief
when
it
s
time
for
the
final
conversation
the
subject
quickly
get
to
what
s
my
deal
i
ve
be
lucky
enough
all
my
life
to
work
for
a
company
with
the
financial
resource
to
be
able
to
soften
the
blow
at
that
point
the
big
challenge
be
to
get
everyone
focus
on
the
future
assure
them
that
this
be
another
transition
in
their
life
when
they
can
make
a
new
start
just
like
the
transition
from
high
school
to
college
or
from
college
to
the
first
job
they
can
move
on
to
another
environment
where
all
past
wart
be
forgotten
i
ve
see
many
people
go
on
to
well
and
happier
life
after

be
my
finance
chief
and
later
head
of
our

the

and
overwhelmed
our

we
have
the
weak
distributor
chuck

as
strong
as
they
make
them
he
be
so
tough
we
call

chuck
always
make

but
couldn
t
do
much
to

low
margin
or
weak
competitive
position
he
and
i
try
everything
to
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
this
sow
s
ear
it
be
the
first
time
i
saw
the
sadness
in
people
grind
it
out
in
a
lousy
business
go
head
to
head
with
a
nearly
invincible
competitor
with
little
hope
of
make
it
well
until
then
i
thought
all
business
could
be
excite
i
believe
that
if
you
pour
research
and
money
into
thing
new
product
come
and
with
them
future
growth
and
success
it
be
my
first
look
at
the
real
world
of
bad
business
a
lesson
that
over
my
career
would
come
to
have
an
enormous
impact
luckily
though
our
other
business
have
pretty
good
margin
especially
plastic
the
real
driver
of
growth
i
dove
in
to
understand
the
people
in
these
new
business
in
our
metallurgical
business
in
detroit
for
example
i
ask

see
the
sale
management
team
during
an
early
human
resource
review
i
could
not
believe
the
quality
of
the
team
they
come
in
with
dull
formal
presentation
they
have
no
passion
for
their
job
and
couldn
t
answer
the
most
routine
question
i
consider
them
the
ultimate
milk
run
sale
force
salesman
who
couldn
t
find

obviously
out
of
the
ordinary
far
out
of
the

it
jolt
the
team
and
opie
use
it
to
energize
the
business
hardworking
and
totally
unselfish

i
be
different
and

interference
although
it
be
an
unlikely
job
for
a
lawyer
bob
be
sensational
in
it
he
have
a
million
idea
and
brought

you
couldn

have
found
a
more
diverse
band
of
character
some
ge
insider
and
a
pair
from
the
outside

earthy
without
pretense
or
formality
always
blunt
along
with
half
a
dozen
support
staff

into
a
square
foot
group

suite
at
the
hilton
without
a
corporate
bos
in

we
wore

back
and

the
feel
of
a
college
dorm
on
friday
night

d
often
go
to
the
hotel
s
rooftop
lounge

the
week
over
a
few
beer
we

get
up
there
about
p
m
and
our

have
nearly
exhaust
all
our
exaggerated
tale
from
the
week
listen
to
our
war
story
wasn
t
the
big
treat
for
any
of
them
but
they
be
great
sport
they
like
one
another
as
much
as
we
do
often
we
d
get
together
on
the
weekend
for
saturday
night
dinner
or
sunday
afternoon
party
many
time
with
our
kid
we
be
have
the
time
of
our
life
and
get
paid
for
it
we
spent
most
of
our
time
in
the
field
do
people
and
strategy
review
we
charter
a
citation
jet
that
get
us
around
easily
i
be
so
excite
to
have
a
plane
carolyn
saw
it
another
way
jack
you
re
such
a
fool
she
say
they
let
you
have
the
plane
so
you
can
work
yourself
to
death
she
have
a
point
but
i
love
it
anyway
often
we
d
leave
on
a
monday
morning
and
wouldn
t
return
until
friday
night
we
d
visit
fort
wayne
indiana
milwaukee
wisconsin
and
columbus
ohio
as
if
they
be
town
next
door
i
m
sure
some
of
the
manager
must
have
thought
damn
here
they
come
again
we
d
spend
hour
lock
in
a
room
peel
back
the
onion
until
all
the
issue
be
expose
while
some
enjoy
the
session
and
call
them
great
intellectual
combat
i
m
sure
others
look
forward
to
them
like
they
would
to
a
root
canal
we
have
the
best
of
both
world
we
have
the
resource
of
a
big
company
but
with
the
same
family
atmosphere
of
my
earlier
year
in
the
plastic
business
try
to
oversee
these
diverse
business
in
remote
location
i
realize
more
than
ever
before
how
much
my
success
would
depend
on
the
people
i
hire
from
my
first
day
in
plastic
i
understood
the
importance
of
get
the
right
people
it
be
clear
that
when
i
found
someone
great
it
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
learn
a
lot
of
this
the
hard
way
by
make
some
big
mistake
the
inconsistency
of
my
first
hire
be
laughable
one
of
my
most
common
error
be
to
hire
on
appearance
in
marketing
i
d
sometimes
recruit
good
look
slick
talk
package
some
of
those
be
good
and
some
be
just
empty
suit
i
make
other
beauty
i
be
when
i
begin
hire
in
asia
obviously
i
couldn
t
speak
japanese
i
have
little
feel
for
the
culture
so
i
do
the
obvious
if
a
japanese
candidate
spoke
english
well
i
usually
hire
him
it
take
me
a
while
to
find
out
that
use
language
as
a
hire
screen
be
a
marginal
idea
at
best
many
of
my
hire
mistake
reflect
my
own
silly
prejudice
probably
because
i
go
to
uma
a
former
agricultural
school
that
be
just
emerge
in
engineering
academic
pedigree
impressed
me
for
engineering
talent
i
d
try
to
hire
mit
princeton
and
cal
tech
graduate
i
should
have
remind
myself
where
i
have
come
from
often
i
found
out
that
where
they
come
from
wouldn
t
determine
how
good
they
d
be
in
the
early
day
i
fell
in
love
with
great
r
sum
s
fill
with
degree
in
different
discipline
they
could
be
bright
and
intellectually
curious
but
they
often
turn
out
to
be
unfocused
dabbler
unwilling
to
commit
lack
intensity
and
passion
for
any
one
thing
in
the
hand
of
the
inexperienced
r
sum
s
be
dangerous
weapon
eventually
i
learn
that
i
be
really
look
for
people
who
be
fill
with
passion
and
a
desire
to
get
thing
do
a
r
sum
didn
t
tell
me
much
about
that
inner
hunger
i
have
to
feel
it
in
this
new
group
job
i
discover
that
the
only
business
i
would
ever
know
in
my
blood
be
plastic
this
be
a
big
transition
in
my
think
i
could
no
longer
have
fingertip
control
of
all
the
detail
that
make
my
obsession
about
people
even
more
intense
my
hr
partner
ralph
hubregsen
and
i
begin
go
out
to
the
business
spending
a
full
day
in
a
room
first
with
the
general
manager
and
his
hr
executive
and
then
with
all
his
direct
report
after
or
hour
of
heat
discussion
i
d
come
away
with
a
pretty
good
sense
of
the
talent
we
have
at
the
top
two
or
three
level
of
the
business
the
reaction
be
total
shock
no
one
be
use
to
these
intense
personal
discussion
about
the
strength
and
weakness
of
every
individual
on
their
team
the
leader
in
the
field
who
bore
the
brunt
of

panache
there
be
a
part
of
his
bon

like
but
his
inability
to
deliver
result
which

drove
me
nut
when

try
to
stay
with

didn
t
work

have
several
discussion
about
this

major
threat
to
our
exist
x

but
it
be
a

gotten
his
start
at
ge
s
research
lab
go
right
back
to
his
scientist
friend
in
schenectady
for
help
it
be
easy
to
excite
the
lab
about
the
opportunity
since
the
emi
invention
have
capture
the
attention
of
the
scientific
world
my
only
contribution
be
to
follow
the
team
s
progress
weekly
serve
at
time
as
a
cattle
prod
and
on
other
occasion
a
cheerleader
about
people
work
round
the
clock
to
create
a
product
that
would
give
us
faster
and
well
image
than
the
emi
model
everything
about
this
have
start
up
write
over
it
researcher
practically
live
in
the
lab
eat
out
of
pizza
box
and
we
make
our
first
scanner
out
of
a
rent
grocery
store
in
milwaukee
by
early
they
be
take
order
for
the
machine
once
again
i
saw
the
benefit
of
act
like
a
small
company
give
the
project
visibility
put
great
people
on
it
and
give
them
plenty
of
money
continue
to
be
the
best
formula
for
success
the
ct
change
the
medical
business
forever
an
unprofitable
operation
with
million
in
sale
when
walt
take
it
over
be
now
in
one
of
ge
s
jewel
with
operating
profit
of
billion
on
over
billion
of
sale
i
broke
up
the
chemical
and
metallurgical
division
that
walt
have
be
run
and
spun
out
the
high
growth
plastic
business
i
put
chuck
carson
who
have
run
our
laminate
business
over
the
slow
grow
but
highly
profitable
remain
material
business
the
plastic
business
pose
something
of
a
dilemma
my
friend
tom
fitzgerald
be
now
run
silicone
and
be
the
obvious
internal
choice
for
the
plastic
job
but
he
be
my
closest
business
friend
and
as
a
result
i
saw
both
his
strength
and
his
weakness
more
than
anyone
else
i
decide
to
compare
tom
with
the
best
i
could
find
on
the
outside
i
ve
say
that
i
ve
make
my
share
of
hire
mistake
none
would
be
big
than
the
one
i
be
about
to
make
i
pass
over
tom
for
the
job
and
brought
in
an
outsider
who
have
once
run
ge
s
silicone
operation
as
a
young
manager
in
the
plastic
business
in
the
early
s
i
be
blown
away
by
the
presentation
he
give
at
divisionwide
meeting
he
be
the
most
articulate
of
all
the
leadership
his
speak
skill
be
particularly
impressive
to
me
because
i
couldn
t
deliver
a
speech
to
save
my
life
before
reading

ago
i
knew
i
have
to
make
a
change
it
be
a
real
dilemma
i
thought
i
be
a
candidate
in
the
succession
race
for
reg
s
job
by
hire
this
outsider

have
go
against
roy
johnson
the
hr
head
who
always
favor
the
inside
candidate
this
could
have
be
a
disaster
for
me
within
six
month
i
have
to
go
to
headquarters
and
tell
roy
johnson

tough
day
i
have
go
against
the
system
i
hadn
t
hire
one
of
my
friend
who
expect
and
in
retrospect
deserve
the
promotion
i
be
embarrass
for
the
person
i
have
recruit
because
it
be
so
obvious
this
be
the
wrong
job
for
him
herm
s
reaction
be
supportive
you
make
a
mistake
i
m
glad
you
move
fast
to
correct
it
reg
simply
say
okay
but
be
otherwise
guard
with
his
thought
johnson
use
it
as
another
example
of
my
immaturity
holt
and
farnsworth
be
not
only
good
guy
they
be
savvy
and
they
knew
how
the
ge
system
work
this
be
my
first
real
look
inside
the
traditional
ge
their
insight
open
my
eye
to
this
other
world
there
be
a
thousand
holt
story
but
the
one
i
like
best
involves
people
evaluation
in
fort
wayne
one
day
during
an
hr
review
fred
be
give
a
glow
appraisal
of
a
guy
i
knew
fred
how
the
hell
could
you
write
this
he
s
not
that
good
we
both
know
this
guy
be
a
turkey
this
appraisal
be
ridiculous
to
my
surprise
fred
agree
do
you
want
to
see
the
real
one
he
ask
i
can
t
send
this
to
headquarters
they
d
want
me
to
kill
this
guy
fred
wasn
t
alone
in
those
day
he
thought
he
be
be
a
nice
guy
protect
people
who
weren
t
up
to
their
job
that
s
just
the
way
it
be
no
one
want
to
deliver
bad
news
in
those
day
it
be
standard
to
fill
out
your
appraisal
form
by
write
that
your
career
objective
be
at
least
your
bos
s
job
the
bos
s
response
usually
be
fully
qualify
to
assume
next
position
even
if
they
both
knew
it
wasn
t
true
many
of
these
kind
performance
appraisal
would
come
back
to
haunt
me
in
the
early
s
when
we
have
to
downsize
the
company
that
false
kindness
only
mislead
people
and
make
their
layoff
an
even
great
shock
than
it
should
have
be
from
george
farnsworth
and
his
electronic
component
business
i
get
two
thing
one
be
my
first
hard
look
at
semiconductor
a
business
i
disliked
immediately
yes
it
have
high
growth
but
it
be
too
cyclical
for
me
and
ate
up
enormous
amount
of
capital
it
take
me
close
to
a
decade
to
get
out
of
it
the
other
thing
i
get
from
george
would
stay
with
me
for
the
next
year
the
controversy
over
pcbs
polychlorinated
biphenyls
george
manage
the
capacitor
business
in
hudson
fall
new
york
which
use
pcbs
as
electrical
insulator
it
be
my
first
experience
deal
with
the
government
from
to
my
responsibility
broaden
continually
from
run
a
million
business
to
a
million
division
and
soon
a
billion
group
i
learn
the
importance
of
people
support
the
best
and
remove
the
weak
i
learn
to
support
high
growth
business
like
medical
and
plastic
and
how
to
squeeze
everything
out
of
slow
growth
operation
it
be
a
great
set
of
experience
toward
the
end
of
i
get
a
phone
call
in
pittsfield
it
be
from
reg
in
fairfield
he
want
to
see
me
and
it
be
urgent
i
be
there
the
next
morning
i
think
highly
of
you
reg
say
but
jack
you
don
t
understand
general
electric
you
ve
only
see
percent
of
the
company
ge
s
a
lot
more
than
that
i
have
a
new
job
for
you
sector
executive
for
the
consumer
product
business
but
jack
this
job
be
in
fairfield
you
can
t
be
a
big
fish
in
a
small
pond
anymore
if
you
want
to
be
consider
for
big
thing
you
re
go
to
have
to
come
here
i
be
thrill
to
get
another
promotion
even
if
it
meant
that
i
would
finally
have
to
leave
pittsfield
carolyn
be
eager
to
move
on
she
be
look
forward
to
a
fresh
start
in
a
new
place
and
felt
the
move
would
help
our
four
kid
grow
by
now
two
of
our
four
kid
kathy
and
john
be
in
high
school

in
the
ninth
grade
and
mark
be
in
the
fifth
despite
my
crazy
work
habit
we
be
a
close
family
we
always
take
a
week
off
to
ski
in
the
winter
during
spring
break
and
never
miss
rent
a
house
on
the
cape
for
a
two
week
vacation
in
the
summer
i
admit
i
have
a
tough
time
take
a
complete
vacation
from
the
job
when
we
be
on
the
cape
i
d
often
sneak
off
the
beach
to
a
pay
phone
to
check
into
the
office
a
couple
of
time
a
day
when
we
ski
i
d
pop
into
the
lodge
to
do
the
same
nonetheless
these
vacation
give
us
lot
of
time
to
hang
out
together
we
spent
hour
play
board
game
and
sport
i
d
try
to
put
as
much
fun
and
competition
as
possible
into
the
game
by
egg
all
of
them
on
when
we
return
home
i
always
make
up
wooden
plaque
for
the
best
sport
best
miniature
golfer
or
best
krypto
player
and
hand
them
out
to

to
duplicate
my
mother

of
my
kid
be

always
easy
for
them
one
morning
my

go
straight
at
john
take
an
unexpected
swing
at
him

fight

up
quickly
but
poor
john

not
much
more
than
eight
or
nine
year
old

no
idea

i
explain
that
i
have
ask
the

yesterday
excite

the
place
just
before

some
reason

me
feel
well

brought
me
to
a
new
organizational
layer
as

sector
executive
there

a
hierarchy
at
ge
like
any
other
large
company
and
i
have
be
lucky
to

like
the
civil
service
with
all
its
level
and
dozen
of
title
and
promotion
from
a

small
step
from

me
in
the
race
for
reg
s
job
i
be
excite
by
the
possibility
but
apprehensive
about
whether
the
pittsfield
act
would
play
in
the
fairfield
bureaucracy

swim
in
a
big
pond
early
one
december
morning
in

drove
past
the
security
guard
at
the

than
three

chief
rival

t
know
many
of
the
hundred
of
people
who

in
fairfield
headquarters
reuben

one
of

he
have
be
my
only
real
link
to

that
in
his
final
day
he
have
told
reg
to
keep
his
eye
on
me
because
i
be
the
person
who
be
go
place
talk
about
lonely
forget
about
all
that
small
fish
in
big
pond
stuff
i
felt
like
a
minnow
in
an
ocean
of
course
i
have
be
here
many
time
do
various
dog
and
pony
routine
even
then
by
the
end
of
the
day
after
present
a
business
plan
or
ask
for
the
cash
to
build
a
new
plant
i
be
always
happy
to
return
to

this
time
of
course

would
be
different

be
permanent
what
a
difference
from
go

friend
by
hire
people
who
become
my
friend
and
actively
socialize
with
them
and
their
family
i
have
probably
broken
the
rule
of
corporate
behavior
but
we
get
the
job
do
and
we
enjoy
do
it
we
felt
like
a
family
instead
of
a
business
now
all
that
be
go
to
add
to
my
out
there
feel
for

next
four
month
i
live
out
of

marriott
until
carolyn
and
our
four
kid
could
move
to
our
new
home
in
connecticut
there
be
one
positive
side
effect
it
allow
me
to
bury
myself
in
my
new
job
the
move
to
fairfield
come
with
a
big
promotion
to
a
newly
create
layer
of

of
five

he

it

my

it

the

in

at

that
i
have
a

for

do
it
help
that
gault
have
run
my

the
previous

so
i
be
in
a
position
where
every
move
i
make
could
appear
to
second
guess
him
or
dance
the
other
vice

jack
parker
also
have
his
favorite
in

this
left
tom
vanderslice
and
me
as
the
odd
men
out
what
give
me
hope
be
that
the
two
vice
chairman
dance
and
parker
didn
t
have
much
of
a
relationship
with
each
other
or
with
reg
who
hadn
t
chosen
them
in
the
first
place
reg
have
inherit
both
vice
chairman
from
his
predecessor
both
have
be
rival
for
the
job
they
weren
t
bad
guy
but
they
be
disappointed
that
they
didn
t
get
reg
s
job
there
be
probably
nothing
bad
in
business
than
to
work
for
a
bos
who
doesn
t
want
you
to
win
this
can
happen
anywhere
at
any
level
and
probably
occurs
more
often
than
we
think
until
i
come
to
work
for
dance
i
have
never
have
it
happen
to
me
i
survive
the

only
by
do
what
i
thought

right
i
trust

the

to
be
fair
have
it
be
a
forever

ruin
my
career

my
sanity
by
stick
around

the

s
session
and
size
up
the

in

business
because
of
the
lack
of
support
from
my
bos
i
go
at
my
job
as
if
he
weren
t
there
the
most
difficult
issue
to
deal
with
would
be
in
the
appliance
business
change
in
direction
could
be
perceive
as
shot
at
my
predecessor
dance
and
gault
they
have
run
the
appliance
operation
for
more
than
a
decade
for
year
it
have
be
a
sweetheart
business
of
ge
dance
and
gault
have
plan
for
massive
expansion
of
our
appliance
park
in
louisville
kentucky
they
have
start
by
building
an
appliance
park
east
in
columbia
maryland
and
there
be
talk
of
an
appliance
park
west
in
salt
lake
city
utah
their
ambitious
plan
reflect
the
company
s
conventional
view
of
the
business
s
potential
it
have
be
driven
by
the
glow
of
the
postwar
era
when
a
rise
middle
class
fill
its
new
kitchen
with
new
appliance
there
be
no
question
that
the
business
would
continue
to
grow
the
real
question
however
be
how
fast
that
growth
would
be
and
how
well
position
we
be
against
our
major
u
s
and
global
competitor
my
new
associate
bob
nelson
and
dennis
dammerman
who
have
both
spent
time
in
the
appliance
business
tore
apart
the
number
and
the
conventional
assumption
our
look
say
that
growth
would
slow
the
big
expansion
plan
need
to
be
reexamine
in
fairness
i
think
dance
and
gault
be
come
to
the
same
conclusion
even
more
important
than
the
expansion
be
our
situation
in
louisville
we
have
to
improve
it
while
sale
and
profit
be
okay
productivity
be
steadily
decline
for
year
headquarters
have
be
hearing
a
fairly
optimistic
view
of
appliance
in
louisville
an
army
of
economist
strategic
planner
and
finance
people
be
believer
in
and
advocate
for
the
business
they
didn
t
want
to
admit
that
the
day
of
postwar
growth
be
rapidly
change
they
weren
t
alone
their
expansive
view
be
share
by
much
of
american
industry
in
louisville
the
leadership
team
in
appliance
have
move
out
of
our
manufacturing
and
engineering
center
to
an
office
suite
on
the
top
floor
of
a
story
high
rise
five
mile
away
this
be
symbolic
they
be
sit
in
an
ivory
tower
while
all
the
doer
be
back
at
appliance
park
make
white
appliance
box
arm
with
my
group
s
analysis
i
go
to
dance
to
recommend
a
significant
cutback
in
the
business
he
have
manage
for
so
many
year
i
be
prepared
for
dance
to
fight
but
he
didn
t
instead
i
think
he
might
have
see
my
recommendation
as
far
proof
of
my
impulsiveness
he
approve
my
plan
we
move
quickly
to
make
the
business
in
louisville
more
competitive
by
significantly
downsize
what
we
have
scrap
plan
for
building
additional
appliance
park
the
layoff
be
not
popular
in
louisville
i
be
fortunate
to
have
an
ally
in
dick
donegan
a
dance
and
gault
appointee
who
be
run
the
appliance
business
he
bought
into
the
new
plan
and
have
the
courage
to
act
on
them
in
spite
of
his
prior
relationship
though
the
painful
change
at
appliance
park
still
didn
t
solve
all
the
cost
problem
they
do
make
us
more
competitive
improve
our
profitability
and
kept
us
go
in
appliance
similar
action
have
go
on
for
more
than
year
a
business
that
employ
just
over
people
in
today
employ
less
than
half
that
total
some
salaried
and
hourly
worker
these
downsizing
be
awful
as
hardworking
people
get
hammer
by
competitive
change
in
difficult
business
these
change
never
end
i
can
t
tell
you
how
often
i
be
ask
in
the
early
s
be
it
over
now
unfortunately
it
s
never
over
a
lot
of
the
product
that
fuel
the
postwar
boom
simply
become
commodity
product
with
wafer
thin
margin
in
slow
grow
market
those
change
drove
many
competitor
out
of
the
appliance
business
from
ford
motor
s
philco
and
gm
s
frigidaire
to
westinghouse
ge
chose
to
stay
and
fight
in
a
very
tough
industry
in
order
to
stay
alive
in
the
business
however
we
have
to
manufacture
more
of
these
product
outside
the
united
state
the
price
of
a

today
be
to
down
from
an
average
of

in
the
only
good
thing
about
this
fiercely
competitive

of

most
of
our

what
we
call

until
the
late
s
that
we
start
lease
other

by
the
late

in
those
early
day
i
didn
t
understand
the
intricacy
of
finance
i
have
the
staff
prepare
a
book
that
translate
all
the
jargon
into
layman
s
term
i
call
it
finance
for
little
folk
but
it
be
just
what
i
need
i
study
it
like
i
be
back
in
grad
school
so
i
could
be
conversant
with
the
people
in
the
business
my
gut
told
me
that
compare
to
the
industrial
operation
i
do
know
this
business
seem
an
easy
way
to
make
money
you
didn
t
have
to
invest
heavily
in
r
d
build
factory
and
bend
metal
day
after
day
you
didn
t
have
to
build
scale
to
be
competitive
the
business
be
all
about
intellectual
capital
find
smart
and
creative
people
and
then
use
ge
s
strong
balance
sheet
this
thing
look
like
a
gold
mine
to
me
leverage
brainpower
be
easy
than
grind
out
product
nowhere
be
the
finance
manufacturing
comparison
more
obvious
than
in
profit
per
employee
with
few
than
employee
ge
credit
s
net
income
in
be
million
in
contrast
it
take
a
payroll
of
more
than
employee
in
appliance
to
make
million
i
m
sure
this
be
obvious
to
almost
everyone
today
but
to
me
it
be
a
big
insight
in
after
all
i
be
a
chemical
engineer
who
have
know
only
about
make
thing
ge
credit
wasn
t
do
badly
in
the
late
s
its
profit
and
business
grow
every
year
i
just
didn
t
think
it
be
grow
fast
enough
give
its
vast
opportunity
in
my
early
meeting
with
the
leader
of
the
business
in
the
spring
of
i
be
underwhelmed
by
the
people
in
the
organization
i
d
gather
them
together
in
a
room
several
layer
worth
of
management
and
grill
them
about
the
in
and
out
of
their
business
let
s
pretend
we
re
in
high
school
i
say
take
me
through
the
basic
during
one
of
the
more
memorable
instance
i
recall
ask
a
pretty
simple
question
of
one
of
our
insurance
leader
during
his
presentation
he
have
be
use
a
couple
of
term
that
i
be
unfamiliar
with
so
i
interrupt
him
to
ask
what
s
the
difference
between
facultative
and
treaty
insurance
after
fumble
through
a
long
answer
for
several
minute
an
answer
i
wasn
t
get
he
finally
blurt
out
in
exasperation
how
do
you
expect
me
to
teach
you
in
five
minute
what
it
have
take
me
year
to
learn
needle
to
say
he
didn
t
last
long
the
insurance
anecdote
wasn
t
an
isolated
incident
it
be
par
for
the
course
if
ge
credit
could
make
as
much
money
as
it
do
with
the
exist
people
i
wonder
how
much
more
potential
the
business
would
have
if
it
be
fill
with
nothing
but
a
player
we
didn
t
have
enough
star
to
capitalize
on
what
look
to
me
like
easy
picking
john
stanger
who
be
then
lead
the
business
be
a
shrewd
deal
maker
he
be
a
product
of
the
system
and
didn
t
want
to
rock
the
boat
john
have
a
tendency
to
take
what
he
be
give
in
people
and
he
hadn
t
be
expose
to
the
talent
pool
in
many
other
part
of
the
company
during
the

in
the
spring
of

challenged
all
of
the
ge

we
have
a
rough
first
day
after
the

we
invite
everyone
to
the
nearby
landmark
club
in
stamford
to
get
a
well
feel
for

any
well
after

than
they
do
during
the

we
have
to
do
be
get

once
he
get
them

over

of

of

many
come
from

down
in

one

stood
out

in

he
impressed
me
with
his
quick
wit
and
sharp
observation
that
reinforce
my
instinct
about
the
lackluster
quality
of
middle

very
good
one
for

we
already

a

one
of
the
pioneer
in

have
decide
to
exit
the

in
the

because
it
believe
the

and
i
felt
differently
we
believe

have
a
great

on
the
verge
of

clear
to
me
that
they

team
have
do
some
clever
lawyering
our
agreement
turn
out
to
be
less
a
contract
to
buy
the

more
an
option
for

to
sell
at
their
discretion
the
contract
allow
cox
an
out
perhaps
i
should
have
caught
this
but
i
didn
t
i
have
go
out
on
a
limb
to
convince

the

hundred
million

a
good
one

and
i
met
with
the
cox
people
i
be
come
to
the
conclusion
the
deal
couldn
t
get
do
at
any
price
the
cox
family
have
change
their
mind
about
sell
and
be
use
the
price
as
a
way
to
end
it
lose
this
big
deal
in
the
politically
charge
atmosphere
of

a
potential
disaster
with
all
that

rid

my
own
future
at
ge
we
want
the
deal
badly
norm
and
i
spent
hour
agonize
over
whether
they
would
ever
close
we
didn
t
want
to
give
up
norm
have
be
with
me
in
the
plastic
business
and
our
family
be
close
for
about
ten
day
we
never
stop
debate
it
in
the
office
or
at
each
other
s
home
after
all
that
soul
search
i
finally
decide
we
have
to
walk
i
inform
reg
about
my
decision
during
the
summer
of
he
agree
but
ask
me
to
explain
the
rationale
to
the
full
board
at
its
next
meeting
which
be
in
st
louis
now
i
not
only
have
to
bare
my
soul
to
reg
i
also
have
to
face
all
of
the
company
s
director
the
upcoming
board
meeting
be
the
time
of
an
annual
golf
out
of
senior
executive
and
board
member
this
only
add
to
the
drama
of
have
to
go
in
and
eat
crow
on
a
deal
i
have
be
tout
so
hard
for
over
a
year
i
didn
t
know
what
to
expect
but
i
put
my
best
face
on
what
be
a
difficult
situation
in
an
early
morning
board
session
i
make
the
case
for
not
chase
the
deal
the
director
ask
lot
of
question
include
why
not
keep
raise
the
price
have
dealt
with
the
cox
negotiator
for
the
last
six
week
i
felt
down
to
my
toe
that
the
cox
family
wasn
t
go
to
sell
to
us
no
matter
what
but
i
couldn
t
prove
it
continue
to
chase
it
wasn
t
right
for
ge
i
thought
the
meeting
go
well
i
be
hop
the
director
would
overlook
my
inability
to
close
the
deal
and
appreciate
that
i
face
a
tough
call
i
have
little
idea
what
they
really
thought
i
get
a
somewhat
positive
reaction
that
afternoon
when
i
be
play
golf
with
three
of
them
as
i
be
tee
up
my
ball
on
a
short
par
three
one
of
the
board
member
dick
baker
former
head
of
ernst
whinney
and
a
man
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
quipped
i
hope
the
fact
that
you
screw
up
today
won
t
bother
you
on
this
shot
my
seven
iron
fell
out
of
my
hand
and
i
yell
foul
the
other
two
director
in
the
foursome
broke
out
in
laughter
i
take
it
as
a
positive
sign
because
it
be
the
first
time
i
have
see
this
crowd
of
generally
serious
people
joking
around
i
didn
t
think
they
d
be
do
it
at
my
expense
if
i
weren
t
in
good
shape
later
i
found
out
that
some
director
concerned
about
my
competitiveness
like
the
fact
that
i
could
walk
away
from
a
deal

the
background
of
all
these

that
the
best
fit

i
genuinely
respect
his

his
comfort
with
himself

two
year
burlingame
hood
and
i
report
directly
to
reg
the
atmosphere
clear
and
the
politics
disappear
reg
s
airplane
interview
have
assure
him
that
the
three
of
us
could
work
well
together
as
a
team
and
we
do
toward
the
end
reg
make
one
final
request
of
all
the
candidate
he
ask
each
of
us
to
write
a
detailed
memo
that
assess
our
own
performance
as
a
vice
chairman
a
director
and
a
company
representative
he
also
ask
us
to
write
about
our
personal
growth
and
how
we
met
what
reg
call
the
test
of
stewardship
what
the
corporation
should
bring
to
society
i
be
still
worried
about
a
more
basic
concern
that
reg
and
the
board
might
pas
me
over
because
of
my
age
at
i
be
the
young
of
the
three
final
candidate
john
burlingame
be
ed
hood
be
i
consider
include
in
my
memo
a
promise
not
to
hold
the
office
for
more
than
ten
year
if
i
get
it
i
thought
a
pledge
would
offset
some
concern
about
my
age
and
the
possibility
i
would
be
in
the
job
too
long
when
i
told
my
close
friend
anthony
lofie
lofrisco
about
this
he
thought
i
be
out
of
my
mind
lofie
be
a
new
york
lawyer
i
met
at
silver
spring
country
club
shortly
after
come
to
fairfield
one
sunday
afternoon
by
the
pool
at
my
home
in
new
canaan
we
get
into
a
fierce
argument
over
my
idea
of
propose
a
term
limit
he
insist
i
would
forever
regret
do
it
once
you
get
in
that
office
you
ll
never
leave
he
say
the
only
way
they
ll
get
you
out
of
there
be
if
they
entomb
you
in
your
office
with
cinder
block
get
out
of
here
i
say
you
re
crazy
larry
bossidy
and
his
family
be
there
and
larry
end
up
on
lofrisco
s
side
ultimately
i
agree
with
them
and
drop
it
lofie
hasn
t
fail
to
remind
me
about
his
great
contribution
to
my
career
for
at
least
the
past
ten
year
i
later
discover
that
my
concern
be
real
although
not
terribly
serious
a
couple
of
director
have
be
suggest
that
reg
should
name
burlingame
the
next
chairman
for
a
short
period
of
time
as
a
bridge
before
name
me
reg
apparently
defuse
the
issue
by
tell
the
board
that
i
would
in
all
likelihood
leave
the
company
if
i
didn
t
get
the
job
he
be
right
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
craft
an
eight
page
memo
and
sent
it
to
reg
note
it
may
be
more
about
welch
than
we
both
need
or
want
to
know
the
letter
be
more
stiff
and
formal
than
what
i
would
write
today
however
it
be
something
that
at
i
felt
i
need
to
overcome
my
immature
image
still
it
contain
many
of
the
idea
i
would
in
fact
implement
over
the
next
year
in
it
i
dealt
head
on
with
the
concern
some
colleague
may
have
have
with
me
include
my
perceive
lack
of
maturity
and
sensitivity
i
argue
that
all
of
my
experience
at
ge
over
year
couple
with
my
personal
growth
have
give
me
the
necessary
maturity
for
the
job
and
the
sensitivity
need
in
the
ceo
s
stewardship
role
i
attempt
to
deal
with
my
demand
nature
by
write
while
i
have
and
will
continue
to
demand
that
people
attain
high
performance
standard
i
have
at
the
same
time
provide
numerous
leapfrog
opportunity
to
promising
employee
and
have
help
create
an
atmosphere
which
attracts
talented
and
ambitious
men
and
woman
one
line
i
like
sum
up
what
i
thought
about
leadership
the
people
with
whom
i
have
be
associate
have
work
harder
enjoy
it
more
although
not
always
initially
and
in
the
end
gain
increase
self
respect
and
self
confidence
from
accomplish
more
than
they
previously
thought
possible
i
explain
that
i
learn
something
valuable
by
my
failure
to
complete
the
cox
acquisition
i
have
discover
that
wall
street
s
reaction
to
both
the
propose
deal
and
its
cancellation
be
general
disinterest
even
though
its
cost
be
in
the
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
and
it
be
in
a
highly
attractive
and
visible
industry
because
ge
be
so
large
the
deal
s
impact
be
not
consider
significant
it
reinforces
my
view
that
what
we
have
to
sell
as
an
enterprise
to
the
equity
investor
be
consistent
above
average
earnings
growth
throughout
the
economic
cycle
i
write
our
size
may
dictate
that
as
the
only
option
the
discipline
to
balance
both
short
and
long
term
be
the
absolute
of
such
a
strategy
little
do
i
know
when
write
this
letter
how
true
this
fundamental
belief
would
turn
out
to
be
finally
i
also
put
in
a
strong
pitch
for
the
job
there
be
a
great
distance
today
i
write
reg
between
where
you
be
and
all
three
of
us
stand
however
i
feel
i
have
the
intellectual
capacity
breadth
discipline
and
most
of
all
the
leadership
to
get
there
general
electric
have
be
my
business
life
and
its
importance
to
me
have
grown
with
each
succeed
year
whether
i
can
properly
assemble
and
discharge
the
multiple
responsibility
be
for
others
to
judge
but
obviously
i
would
like
the
chance
i
be
sell
runway
the
capacity
to
grow
something
i
ve
always
look
for
in
every
appointment
i
have
make
i
always
bet
on
runway
i
felt
it
be
a
good
bet
to
put
people
in
stretch
job
early
in
their
career
far
more
often
than
not
they
brought
a
lot
more
excitement
and
passion
to
the
job
and
achieve
great
personal
growth
for
themselves
as
for
where
i
stood
i
start
get
positive
vibe
in
the
summer
of
dave
orselet
my
human
resource
staffer
and
a
real
friend

head
while
dave
report
directly
to
ted
and
be
loyal
to
him
he
couldn
t
withstand
my
relentless
pump
for
information
i
remember
one
time
during
a
party
at
my
house
i
have
poor
dave
pin
against
the
refrigerator
in
my
kitchen
drilling
him
on
how
he
thought
the
race
would
play
out
that
be
probably
my
bad
transgression
bless
his
heart
dave
would
never
tell
me
i
be
the
front
runner
but
he
reluctantly
divulge
just
enough
information
to
make
me
feel
upbeat
about
the
eventual
outcome
the
first
board
indication
that
i
might
be
the
front
runner
come
in
september
when

hardly
wait
to
get
go
section
ii
building
a
philosophy

deal
with
reality
and
superficial
congeniality
on
april
i
be
like
the
dog
who
caught
the
bus
i
finally
have
the
job
despite
all
the
experience
that
have
gotten
me
this
far
i
wasn
t
nearly
as
sure
of
myself
as
i
pretend
to
be
outwardly
i
have
a
pretty
good
dose
of
self
confidence
and
those
who
knew
me
would
have
described
me
as
self
assure
cocky
decisive
quick
and
tough
inwardly
i
still
have
plenty
of
insecurity
whenever
i
have
to
get
up
in
front
of
people
i
struggle
with
my
speech
impediment
i
fuss
with
a
comb
over
to
disguise
my
recede
hairline
and
when
someone
ask
me
how
tall
i
be
i
have
myself
believe
i
be
at
least
an
inch
and
a
half
taller
than
the
five
foot
eight
i
really
be
i
come
to
the
job
without
many
of
the
external
ceo
skill
i
have
rarely
dealt
with
anyone
in
washington
even
though
the
government
be
more
into
business
than
ever
i
have
little
experience
deal
with
the
medium
my
only
press
conference
be
the
script
session
with
reg
on
the
day
ge
announce
i
would
be
the
next
chairman

have
only
one
or
two
brief
outing
before
the
wall
street
analyst
who
follow
ge
and
our
plus
shareholder
have
no
idea
who
jack
welch
be
and
whether
he
would
be
able
to
fill
the
shoe
of
the
most
admire
businessman
in
america
but
i
do
know
what
i
want
the
company
to
feel
like
i
wasn
t
call
it
culture
in
those
day
but
that
s
what
it
be
i
knew
it
have
to
change
the
company
have
many
strength
it
be
a
billion
corporation
earn
billion
a
year
with
employee
it
have
a
triple
a
balance
sheet
and
its
product
and
service
permeate
almost
every
part
of
the
gnp
from
toaster
to
power
plant
some
employee
proudly
described
the
company
as
a
supertanker
strong
and
steady
in
the
water
i
respect
that
but
want
the
company
to
be
more
like
a
speedboat
fast
and
agile
able
to
turn
on
a
dime
i
want
ge
to
run
more
like
the
informal
plastic
business
i
come
from
a
company
fill
with
self
confident
entrepreneur
who
would
face
reality
every
day
every
milestone
could
trigger
a
celebration
that
would
make
business
fun
with
a
few
notable
exception
fun
be
not
the
norm
at
the
time
i
knew
the
benefit
of
stay
small
even
as
ge
be
get
big
the
good
business
have
to
be
sort
out
from

their
market
we
have
to
act
faster
and
get
the
damn
bureaucracy
out
of
the
way
the
reality
be
that
at
the
end
of
ge
be
like
much
of
american
industry
a
formal
and
massive
bureaucracy

hierarchy
with
as
many
as

as
large
we
have
roughly
percent
more

value
of

in
the
head
and
heart
of

come
into
fairfield

want
to
drill
down
to
get
beyond
the
binder
and
into
the
think
that
go
into
them
i
need
to
see
the
business

and
the
passion

into
their
argument
there
be
too
many
passive
review
one
annual
ritual
be
the
spring
trip
to
the
appliance
product
review
in
louisville
a
team
of
designer
and
engineer
haul
out
cardboard
and
plastic
mock
ups
here
we
be
from
fairfield
be
ask
for
our
opinion
on
futuristic
refrigerator
stove
and
dishwasher
model
i
ll
never
know
how
many
of
these
model
ever
make
it
to
the
dealer
s
sell
floor
i
do
know
that
some
of
the
mock
ups
have
to
have
the
dust
brush
off
them
because
they
have
be
parade
out
in
prior
review
for
year
i
also
knew
that
the
comment
from
the
fairfield
contingent
include
myself
be
of
little
value
this
ritual
be
a
waste
of
everyone
s
time
i
want
to
break
the
cycle
of
these
dog
and
pony
show
hierarchy
s
role
to
passively
review
and
approve
have
to
go
after
the
planning
session
my
first
summer
i
try
to
create
the
environment
i
be
look
for
with
my
own
staff
i
thought
a
good
way
to
break
the
ice
be
to
take
everyone
off
site
for
a
couple
of
day
in
my
earlier
job
we
always
found
a
way
to
make
sure
we
get
a
dose
of
golf
mixed
with
the
business
at
first
class
golf
course
place
like
harbor
town
at
hilton
head
and
the
cascade
at
the
homestead
i
have
just
become
a
member
of
laurel
valley
a
wonderful
golf
club
just
outside
pittsburgh
so
in
the
fall
of
i
invite
about
executive
to
laurel
for
the
two
day
retreat
the
group
include
all
the
functional
staff
head
and
our
seven
sector
executive
it
be
my
first
real
attempt
at
create
a
collegial
group
at
the
top
what
we
would
later
call
the
cec
or
corporate
executive
council
among
the
executive
a
core
group
of
at
least
seven
or
eight
advocate
sign
up
for
the
new
agenda
reg
be
right
when
he
picked
john
burlingame
and
ed
hood
as
vice
chair
they
be
supportive
and
never
undermined
my
effort
despite
the
fact
that
they
may
have
have
some
reservation
about
the
pace
of
change
together
in
fact
they
serve
as
a
moderate
force
larry
bossidy
the
guy
i
have
discover
over
a
ping
pong
table
have
come
to
fairfield
as
a
sector
executive
in
and
have
become
a
business
soul
mate
we
both
share
a
hatred
of
bureaucracy
i
have
strong
support
from
two
of
my
most
senior
staff
guy
chief
financial
officer
tom
thorsen
and
human
resource
chief

an
old
associate
from
pittsfield
he
have
be
tapped
a
few
year
earlier
by
reg
to
come
to
fairfield
as
cfo
he
understood
what
we
want
to
do
while
he
thought
it
be
a
sport
to
take
shot
at
me
i
still
love
him
for
his
candor
and
his
smart
levino
represent
the
bridge
between
the
old
and
the
new
ge
his
support
for
many
of
the
early
initiative
be
vital
if
i
didn
t
have
all
of
our
top
executive
completely
behind
me
at
this
moment
i
knew
i
have
enough
to
start
the
process
the
first
morning
at
laurel
valley
i
fill
a
conference
room
with
blank
easel
anxious
to
capture
everyone
s
thought
i
get
up
in
front
of
the
crowd
and
start
ask
what
they
thought
about
our
no
or
no
strategy
what
they
like
and
disliked
about
ge
and
what
thing
we
ought
to
change
quickly
we
spent
time
discuss
the
just
conclude
planning
session
and
how
they
could
be
improve
create
an
open
dialogue
be
difficult
only
those
i
work
closely
with
be
willing
to
let
it
rip
most
of
the
guy
didn
t
want
to
stick
their
neck
out
we
get
through
the
morning
with
only
half
the
group
engage
after
a
fun
afternoon
of
golf
and
a
few
drink
over
dinner
thing
loosen
up
a
little
bit
and
a
few
more
get
involve
the
second
day
be
more
of
the
same
perhaps
it
be
too
early
many
of
them
weren
t
sure
where
they
stood
or
what
they
be
deal
with
the
two
day
out
fail
to
build
any
kind
of
consensus
for
change
i
thought
we
need
a
revolution
it
be
obvious
we
weren
t
go
to
get
one
with
this
team
ge
s
culture
have
be
built
for
a
different
time
when
a
command
and
control
structure
make
sense
have
be
in
the
field
i
have
a
strong
prejudice
against
most
of
the
headquarters
staff
i
felt
they
practice
what
could
be
call
superficial
congeniality
pleasant
on
the
surface
with
distrust
and
savagery
roil
beneath
it
the
phrase
seem
to
sum
up
how
bureaucrat
typically
behave
smile
in
front
of
you
but
always
look
for
a
gotcha
behind
your
back
organizational
layer
be
another
residue
of
size
i
use
the
analogy
of
put
on
too
many
sweater
sweater
be
like
layer
they
be
insulator
when
you
go
outside
and
you
wear
four
sweater
it
s
difficult
to
know
how
cold
it
be
on
one
early
plant
tour
in
a
lynn
massachusetts
jet
engine
factory
i
end
up
in
the
boiler
room
with
a
group
of
employee
who
knew
many
of
the
guy
i
grow
up
with
in
salem
during
a
casual
conversation
about
old
time
i
happen
to
learn
that
they
have
four
layer
of
management
supervise
the
boiler
operation
i
couldn
t
believe
it
it
be
a
funny
way
to
find
out
about
layer
i
use
that
story
at
every
opportunity
another
effective
analogy
be
compare
an
organization
to
a
house
floor
represent
layer
and
the
wall
functional
barrier
to
get
the
best
out
of
an
organization
these
floor
and
wall
must
be
blown
away
create
an
open
space
where
idea
flow
freely
independent
of
rank
or
function
in
the
s
and
s
big
business
have
too
many
layer
too
many
sweater
too
many
floor
and
wall
the
impact
of
these
layer
be
see
most
easily
in
the
capital
appropriation
request
process
when
i
first
become
ceo
almost
every
request
for
a
significant
capital
expenditure
would
come
to
me
for
approval
a
package
of
paper
would
arrive
on
my
desk
for
a
signature
to
buy
something
like
a
million
mainframe
computer
in
some
case
other
people
have
already
sign
it
and
my
signature
be
the
last
one
require
what
value
be
i
add
i
do
away
with
that
process
and
haven
t
sign
an
appropriation
approval
in
at
least
year
each
business
leader
have
the
same
delegation
of
authority
that
the
board
give
me
at
the
begin
of
every
year
the
business
make
the
case
for
the
capital
it
need
we
allocate
the
dollar
range
from
million
to
several
hundred
million
they
own
it
and
decide
how
far
to
delegate
the
spending
authority
the
people
closest
to
the
work
know
the
work
best
they
become
more
accountable
they
take
their
recommendation
more
seriously
if
they
know
a
bunch
of
signature
aren
t
pile
on
top
of
them
in
those
day
i
be
throw
hand
grenade
try
to
blow
up
tradition
and
ritual
that
i
felt
held
us
back
in
the
fall
of
i
toss
one
in
the
middle
of
the
elfun

that
its

for

into

i
didn
t
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
what
elfun
be
do
i
thought
it
represent
the
height
of
superficial
congeniality
it
evolve
into
an
elitist
group
for
those

no
real

d
like
to
be
candid
and
i
ll
start
by
let
you
reflect
on
the
fact
that
i
have
serious
reservation
about
your
organization
i
described
elfun
as
an
institution
pursue
yesterday

agenda
i
told
them
i
never
could
identify
with
their
recent

i
can
t
find
any
value
to
what
you
re

hierarchical
social

make
sense
for
you
and

there
be

silence
when
i
end

blow
by
milling
around

hour

about

as

solely
by
the
desire

back
some

later
the

i
almost
turn
my
back
on
have
become
one
of
the
best
thing
about

i
love
the

what
it
stand
for
and
what
it
have
do

self
engineer
turnaround
become
a
very
important
symbol
it
be
just
what
i
be
look
for
not
everything
i
want
to
change
be
at
headquarters
some
of
the
real
eye
opener
be
far
from
my
office
i
spent
most
of
with
a
team
in
the
field
review
business
just
as
i
have
do
for
ten
year
i
have
a
good
feel
for
about
a
third
of
the
company
and
want
to
dig
into
the
rest
i
quickly
found
that
the
bureaucracy
i
saw
when
manage
appliance
and
light
be
nothing
compare
to
what
i
would
see
in
some
of
ge
s
other
operation
the
big
the
business
the
less
engage
people
seem
to
be
from
the
forklift
driver
in
a
factory
to
the
engineer
packed
in
cubicle
too
many
people
be
just
go
through
the
motion
passion
be
hard
to
find
schenectady
the
home
of
our
power
turbine
business
be
particularly
frustrate
it
have
be
our
flagship
business
for
ge
for
a
long
time
replace
light
our
first
business
as
the
core
of
the
company
it
have
great
technology
and
its
gas
turbine
be
the
envy
of
the
world
with
billion
in
sale
and
employee
more
than
in
schenectady
it
be
important
and
it
act
important
despite
only
make
million
of
net
income
power
represent
much
of
what
have
to
change
not
the
technology
and
product
but
the
attitude
too
many
manager
consider
their
position
as
reward
for
service
to
the
company
a
career
capstone
rather
than
a
fresh
opportunity
there
be
an
attitude
that
customer
be
fortunate
to
place
order
for
their
wonderful
machine
the
long
cycle
nature
of
the
business
with
product
life
cycle
and
order
backlog
measure
in
year
only
compound
the
lack
of
pace
excitement
and
energy
little
do
i
know
that
out
of
all
of
these
field
visit
i
d
stumble
upon
a
relatively
small
and
troubled
business
that
would
prove
to
be
a
big
help
it
be
our
nuclear
reactor
business
in
san
jose
california
nuclear
power
be
one
of
ge
s
three
big
s
venture
along
with
computer
and
aircraft
engine
our
engine
business
be
go
strong
but
computer
have
already
be
sell
and
our
nuclear
business
be
fill
primarily
with
hope
no
business
be
undergo
more
change
than
the
nuclear
power
industry
at
that
moment
only
two
year
earlier
in
the
three
mile
island
reactor
accident
in
pennsylvania
put
an
end
to
what
little
public
support
remain
for
nuclear
energy
utility
and
government
be
reevaluate
their
investment
plan
for
a
nuclear
future
ironically
this
once
promising
ge
business
would
become
the
perfect
role
model
for
my
reality
theme
the
people
who
work
in
san
jose
be
among
the
best
and
brightest
of
their
time
come
out
of
graduate
school
in
the
s
and
s
they
have
invest
their
life
in
the
promise
of
nuclear
energy
they
be
the
bill
gates
of
their
generation
expect
to
change
the
way
we
live
and
work
in
the
spring
of
i
visit
this
billion
dollar
business
during
my
two
day
review
the
leadership
team
present
a
rosy
plan
assume
three
new
order
for
nuclear
reactor
a
year
they
have
a
terrific
track
record
in
the
early
s
sell
three
to
four
reactor
each
year
the
business
saw
the
three
mile
island
disaster
as
little
more
than
a
blip
their
view
be
completely
at
odds
with
reality
they
have
receive
no
new
order
in
the
last
two
year
and
have
suffer
a
million
loss
in
though
they
would
turn
a
small
profit
in
the
reactor
side
of
the
business
by
itself
be
on
its
way
to
a
million
loss
i
listen
for
a
while
before
interrupt
with
what
they
saw
as
a
bombshell
guy
you
re
not
go
to
get
three
order
a
year
i
say
in
my
opinion
you
ll
never
get
another
order
for
a
nuclear
reactor
in
the
u
s
they
be
shock
they
argue
with
the
not
so
subtle
implication
be
jack
you
really
don
t
understand
this
business
that
be
probably
true
but
i
have
the
benefit
of
a
pair
of
fresh
eye
i
hadn
t
invest
my
life
in
this
business
i
love
their
passion
even
though
i
felt
it
be
misdirect
their
argument
contain
a
lot
of
emotion
but
few
fact
i
ask
them
to
redo
the
plan
on
the
assumption
they
d
never
get
another
u
s
order
for
a
reactor
you
figure
out
how
to
make
a
business
out
of
sell
just
fuel
and
nuclear
service
to
the
instal
base
i
say
at
the
time
ge
have
active
reactor
in
service
safety
be
the
principal
preoccupation
of
both
utility
manager
and
government
regulator
we
have
an
obligation
and
an
opportunity
to
keep
those
reactor
up
and
run
safely
obviously
our
review
didn
t
go
well
i
have
thrown
a
bucket
of
cold
water
on
their
dream
toward
the
end
of
our
meeting
they
resort
in
frustration
to
one
of
the
favorite
when
all
else
fails
argument
heard
in
business
if
we
take
the
order
out
of
the
plan
you
ll
kill
morale
and
you
ll
never
be
able
to
mobilize
the
business
when
the
order
come
back
that
wasn
t
the
first
or
the
last
time
i
heard
desperate
business
team
use
the
argument
that
reason
fall
into
the
same
category
as
the
other
plea
i
often
heard
during
tough
time
you
ve
cut
all
the
fat
out
now
you
re
into
bone
and
you
ll
ruin
the
business
if
we
cut
more
both
argument
don
t
make
it
they
re
both
weak
management
always
have
a
tendency
to
take
the
small
bite
of
the
cost
apple
inevitably
manager
have
to
keep
go
back
again
and
again
to
cut
more
as
market
deteriorate
all
this
do
be
create
more
uncertainty
for
employee
i
ve
never
see
a
business
ruin
because
it
reduce
its
cost
too
much
too
fast
when
good
time
come
again
i
ve
always
see
business
team
mobilize
quickly
and
take
advantage
of
the
situation
fortunately
the
leader
of
this
business
dr
roy
beaton
be
the
most
realistic
ge
trooper
in
the
room
he
reluctantly
accepted
the
challenge
i
left
not
know
what
i
d
get
during
the
summer
we
have
a
few
more
heat
exchange
when
the
team
plead
its
case
to
put
one
or
two
reactor
in
the
plan
instead
of
three
i
remain
stubbornly
commit
to
zero
and
the
full
development
of
a
fuel
and
service
business
to
their
credit
by
the
fall
of
the
team
now
head
by
warren
bruggeman
who
succeed
the
retire
beaton
have
a
plan
and
be
prepared
to
implement
it
they
reduce
the
size
of
the
salaried
employee
in
the
reactor
business
from
in
to
by
they
eliminate
most
of
the
reactor
infrastructure
and
focus
only
on
research
for
advanced
reactor
in
the
event
the
day
would
come
when
the
world
s
view
of
nuclear
change
the
service
business
become
very
successful
and
be
an
early
indicator
that
service
could
play
a
huge
role
in
ge
s
future
with
its
success
nuclear
s
overall
net
earnings
grow
from
million
in
to
million
in
and
to
million
in
some
year
after
that
first
meeting
the
business
have
gotten
order
for
only
four
of
their
technologically
advanced
reactor
not
one
of
them
have
come
from
the
united
state
the
team
built
a
profitable
fuel
and
service
business
that
have
make
money
every
year
the
nuclear
business
kept
ge
s
obligation
to
the
utility
instal
base
and
invest
consistently
to
support
advanced
reactor
research
their
story
of
success
be
one
of
the
thrill
of
my
early
day
as
ceo
it
have
little
to
do
with
economics
but
a
lot
to
do
with
the
company
feel
i
be
look
for
the
people
who
engineer
the
transformation
at
our
nuclear
business
be
not
typical
jack
welch
type
they
weren
t
young
loud
or
confrontational
they
didn
t
see
the
bureaucracy
as
the
enemy
they
be
ge
careerist
and
mainstreamers
the
opportunity
to
make
hero
out
of
people
who
be
not
obvious
welch
disciple
be
a
breakthrough
it
sent
a
clear
message
you
didn
t
have
to
fit
a
certain
stereotype
to
be
successful
in
the
new
ge
you
could
be
a
hero
no
matter
what
you
look
like
or
how
you
act
all
you
have
to
do
be
face
reality
and
perform
that
message
be
a
big
deal
at
a
time
when
some
ge
people
be
unsure
where
they
stood
or
whether
or
not
they
have
some
kind
of
nut
run
the
company
i
use
this
nuclear
story
over
and
over
again
in
the
first
few
year
as
ceo
to
pound
home
the
need
for
a
reality
check
i
shout
it
out
from
every
rooftop
face
reality
sound
simple
but
it
isn
t
i
found
it
hard
to
get
people
to
see
a
situation
for
what
it
be
and
not
for
what
it
be
or
what
they
hop
it
would
be
don
t
kid
yourself
it
be
the
way
it
be
my
mother
s
admonition
to
me
many
year
ago
be
just
as
important
for
ge
in
a
business
plan
there
s
little
percentage
in
bet
on
hope
self
delusion
can
grip
an
entire
organization
and
lead
the
people
in
it
to
ridiculous
conclusion
whether
it
be
appliance
in
the
late
s
nuclear
in
the
early
s
or
dot
coms
at
the
turn
of
the
century
get
people
to
face
reality
be
the
first
step
toward
an
eventual
solution
when
i
become
ceo
i
inherit
a
lot
of
great
thing
but
face
reality
be
not
one
of
the
company
s
strong
point
its
superficial
congeniality
make
candor
extremely
difficult
to
come
by
i
get
lucky
the
change
at
our
nuclear
reactor
business
and
at
elfun
give
me
important
weapon
to
demonstrate
what
i
want
ge
to
feel
like
i
told
their
story
again
and
again
to
every
ge
audience
at
every
opportunity
for
the
next
year
i
use
that
same
storytelling
technique
to
get
idea
transfer
across
the
company
slowly
people
start
listen

the
vision
thing
my
first
time
in
front
of
wall
street
s
analyst
as
chairman
be
a
bomb
i
have
be
in
the
job
for
eight
month
when
i
go
to
new
york
city
on
december
to
deliver
my
big
message
on
the
new
ge
i
have
work
on
the
speech
rewrite
it
rehearse
it
and
desperately
want
it
to
be
a
smash
hit
it
be
after
all
my
first
public
statement
on
where
i
want
to
take
ge
you
know
the
vision
thing
however
the
analyst
arrive
that
day
expect
to
hear
the
financial
result
and
the
success
achieve
by
the
company
during
the
year
they
expect
a
detailed
breakdown
of
the
financial
number
they
could
then
plug
those
number
into
their
model
and
crank
out
estimate
of
our
earnings
by
business
segment
they
love
this
exercise
over
a
minute
speech
i
give
them
little
of
what
they
want
and
quickly
launch
into
a
qualitative
discussion
around
my
vision
for
the
company
the
set
for
this
event
be
the
ornate
ballroom
of
the
pierre
hotel
on
fifth
avenue
the
ge
stagehand
have
be
there
for
a
full
day
of
advance
work
i
rehearse
my
remark
behind
a
podium
hour
before
the
analyst
arrive
today
it
s
hard
to
imagine
the
formality
of
it
all
my
big
message
see
appendix
that
day
be
intend
to
describe
the
winner
of
the
future
they
would
be
company
that
search
out
and
participate
in
the
real
growth
industry
and
insist
upon
be
number
one
or
number
two
in
every
business
they
be
in
the
number
one
or
number
two
lean
low
cost
worldwide
producer
of
quality
good
and
service
the
management
and
company
in
the
eighty
that
don
t
do
this
that
hang
on
to
loser
for
whatever
reason
tradition
sentiment
their
own
management
weakness
won
t
be
around
in
be
no
or
no
wasn
t
merely
an
objective
it
be
a
requirement
if
we
met
it
we
be
certain
that
by
the
end
of
the
decade
this
central
idea
would
give
us
a
set
of
business
unique
in
the
world
that
be
the
hard
message
of
the
day
as
i
move
into
soft
issue
like
reality
quality
excellence
and
would
you
believe
the
human
element
i
could
tell
i
be
lose
them
to
be
a
winner
we
have
to
couple
the
hard
central
idea
of
be
no
or
no
in
growth
market
with
intangible
soft
value
to
get
the
feel
that
would
define
our
new
culture
about
halfway
through
i
have
the
impression
i
would
have
gotten
as
much
interest
if
i
d
talk
about
my
ph
d
thesis
on
drop
wise
condensation
i
press
on
not
let
their
blank
stare
discourage
me
today
some
of
this
might
sound
like
corporate
clich
in
fact
look
back
on
that
speech
year
later
i
can
t
believe
how
formal
it
be
we
have
to
permeate
every
mind
in
this
company
with
an
attitude
with
an
atmosphere
that
allows
people
in
fact
encourages
people
to
see
thing
as
they
be
to
deal
with
the
way
it
be
not
the
way
they
wish
it
would
be
i
say
establish
throughout
the
organization
this
concept
of
reality
be
a
prerequisite
to
execute
the
central
idea
the
necessity
of
be
number
one
or
number
two
in
everything
we
do
or
do
something
about
it
i
go
on
to
say
that
quality
and
excellence
would
create
an
atmosphere
where
all
our
employee
would
feel
comfortable
stretch
beyond
their
limit
to
be
well
than
we
ever
thought
we
could
be
this
human
element
would
foster
an
environment
where
people
would
dare
to
try
new
thing
where
they
would
feel
assure
in
know
that
only
the
limit
of
their
creativity
and
drive
would
be
the
ceiling
on
how
far
and
how
fast
they
would
move
by
do
all
that
meld
these
hard
and
soft
message
ge
would
become
a
place
that
be
more
high
spirit
more
adaptable
and
more
agile
than
other
company
a
fraction
of
our
size
we
wouldn
t
merely
grow
with
the
gnp
gross
national
product
an
objective
of
many
big
company
at
that
time
instead
ge
would
be
the
locomotive
pull
the
gnp
not
the
caboose
follow
it
at
the
end
the
reaction
in
the
room
make
it
clear
that
this
crowd
thought
they
be
get
more
hot
air
than
substance
one
of
our
staffer
overheard

moan
we
don

know
what
the
hell
he

talk
about
i
left

to
be

i
be
probably
lucky
it
didn
t
drop
i
be
sure
the
idea
be
right
i
just
hadn
t
brought
them
to
life
they
be
just
word
read
on
stage
by
a
new
face
the
highly
structure
formality
of
ge
s
analyst
meeting
didn
t
help
my
cause
every
detail
be

even
the

arrangement
the
analyst
sat
politely
in
their
seat
ge
staffer
stroll
up
and
down
the
aisle
collect
card
that
the
analyst
have
scribble
question
on
the
card
be
brought
to
three
other
ge
people
include
the
chief
financial
officer
who
sat
behind
a
long
table
at
the
side
of
the
room
their
job
be
to
weed
out
the
potentially
embarrass
controversial
or
tough
question
they
felt
the
chairman
wouldn
t
or
couldn
t
answer
the
lay
ups
be
deliver
to
me
what
a
difference
between
that
day
and
ge
analyst
meeting
now
today
there
be
no
script
chart
be
use
and
you
can
t
get
through
two
of
them
without
a
question
or
a
challenge
we
have
intellectual
food
fight
now
just
like
the
review
inside
ge
we
come
away
a
lot
smarter
about
what
s
on
the
mind
of
investor
and
the
analyst
be
well
inform
about
ge
s
outlook
and
strategic
direction
my
first
meeting
be
a
flop
but
everything
we
do
over
the
next
year
stumble
two
step
forward
one
back
be
toward
the
vision
that
i
laid
out
that
day
we
live
that
hard
reality
of
no
or
no
and
fought
like
mad
to
get
that
soft
feel
into
the
company
the
central
idea
come
from
my
earlier
experience
with
good
and
bad
business
and
be
support
by
the
think
of
peter
drucker
i
begin
reading
peter
s
work
in
the
late
s
and
reg
introduce
us
during
my
transition
to
ceo
if
there
be
ever
a
genuine
management
sage
it
be
peter
he
always
drop
a
few
unique
pearl
into
his
many
management
book
the
clarity
of
no
or
no

from
a
pair
of
very
tough
question
drucker
pose
if
you
weren
t
already
in
the
business
would
you
enter
it
today
and
if
the
answer
be
no
what
be
you
go
to
do
about
it
simple
question
but
like
much
that
be
simple
they
be
also
profound
those
be
especially
good
question
to
ask
at
ge
we
be
in
so
many
different
business
in
those
day
if
you
be
in
a
business
that
be
profitable
that
be
enough
reason
to
stay
in
it
change
the
game
get
out
of
low
margin
low
growth
business
and
move
into
high
margin
high
growth
global
business
be
not
a
priority
at
that
time
no
one
in
or
outside
the
company
perceive
a
crisis
ge
be
an
american
icon
the
tenth
large
corporation
by
size
and
market
capitalization
the
asian
assault
have
be
come
for
many
year
swamp
one
industry
after
another
radio
camera
television
steel
ship
and
finally
auto
we
saw
it
in
our
television
manufacturing
business
as
global
competition
particularly
from
the
japanese
begin
eat
up
profit
we
have
several
vulnerable
business
include
housewares
and
consumer
electronics
yet
if
you
be
in
our
housewares
business
back
then
plug
along
make
toaster
and
iron
and
if
that
s
all
you
knew
and
it
be
profitable
that
be
enough
even
today
we
ll
have
these
crazy
conversation
where
people
will
say
well
you
re
make
a
profit
what
s
wrong
well
in
some
case
there
s
a
lot
wrong
if
it
s
a
business
without
a
long
range
competitive
solution
it
s
just
a
matter
of
time
before
it
s
over
the
no
or
no
fix
sell
or
close
strategy
pass
the
simplicity
test
people
discuss
it
and
understood
it
and
most
agree
to
it
intellectually
when
it
come
time
to
implement
it
the
emotional
connection
be
more
difficult
for
people
to
make
those
work
in
a
clear
no
business
have
no
trouble
in
business
that
weren
t
leader
people
felt
tremendous
pressure
they
have
to
face
the
reality
that
their
business
have
to
do
something
fast
or
that
new
guy
in
fairfield
might
sell
it
on
them
like
every
goal
and
initiative
we
ve
ever
launch
i
repeat
the
no
or
no
message
over
and
over
again
until
i
nearly
gag
on
the
word
i
try
to
sell
both
the
intellectual
and
emotional
case
for
do
it
the
organization
have
to
see
every
management
action
align
with
the
vision
like
most
vision
the
no
and
no
strategy
have
limit
obviously
some
business
have
become
so
commoditized
that
leadership
position
give
you
little
or
no
competitive
advantage
it
make
little
difference
if
we
be
no
in
electric
toaster
or
iron
for
instance
where
we
have
no
pricing
power
and
be
face
low
cost
import
there
be
other
multitrillion
dollar
market
like
financial
service
that
cover
the
ocean
in
those
case
not
be
no
or
no
be
less
critical
as
long
as
you
be
strong
in
your
niche
product
or
region
the
vision
be
simple
but
i
be
still
have
a
helluva
time
communicate
it
across
ge
s
strategic
business
unit
i
have
be
think
about
how
to
do
it
well
for
a
long
time
oddly
enough
i
found
an
answer
on
a
cocktail
napkin
in
january
of
i
often
drive
people
crazy
by
sketch
my
thought
out
on
paper
anytime
anyplace
this
time
while
try
to
explain
the
vision
to
my
wife
carolyn
at
gate
restaurant
in
new
canaan
i
pull
out
a
black
felt
tip
pen
and
begin
draw
on
the
napkin
that
have
be
under
my
drink
i
drew
three
circle
and
divide
our
business
into
one
of
three
category
core
manufacturing
technology
and
service
inside
the
core
circle
for
example
i
put
light
major
appliance
motor
turbine
transportation
and
contractor
equipment
any
business
outside
the
circle
i
told
carolyn
we
would
fix
sell
or
close
these
business
be
the
marginal
performer
or
be
in
low
growth
market
or
just
have
a
poor
strategic
fit
i
like
the
three
circle
concept
over
the
next
couple
of
week
i
expand
it
fill
in
more
detail
with
my
team
see
below
the
chart
really
hit
home
it
be
the
simple
conceptual
tool
i
need
to
communicate
and
implement
the
no
or
no
vision
i
begin
use
it
everywhere
and
forbes
magazine
eventually
feature
it
in
a
cover
story
on
ge
in
march
of
for
people
who
work
in
business
inside
the
circle
it
create
a
certain
sense
of
security
and
pride
but
it
raise
all
kind
of
hell
within
organization
place
outside
the
circle
particularly
in
operation
that
be
the
heart
of
the
old
ge
include
central
air
conditioning
housewares
television
manufacturing
audio
product
and
semiconductor
the
people
in
these
fix
sell
or
close
business
be
naturally
upset
they
felt
angry
and
betrayed
some
ask
be
i
in
a
leper
colony
that
s
not
what
i
join
ge
to
become
union
leader
and
city
father
complain
this
turn
out
to
be
a
big
issue
than
i
anticipate
i
knew
it
be
something
i
have
to
come
to
grip
with
in
the
first
two
year
the
no
or
no
strategy
generate
a
lot
of
action
most
of
it
small
we
sell
business
and
product
line
receive
a
little
over
million
for
them
we
complete
other
deal
include
acquisition
joint
venture
and
minority
investment
spending
over
billion
these
be
peanut
but
the
cultural
significance
of
this
churn
be
felt
throughout
the
company
especially
the
sale
of
our
central
air
conditioning
business
with
three
plant
and
employee
it
be
not
one
of
ge
s
large
business
and
it
wasn
t
very
profitable
its
sale
to
trane
co
in
mid
for
million
in
cash
raise
eyebrow
because
air
conditioning
be
right
in
the
belly
of
our
company
it
be
a
division
in
our
major
appliance
operation
in
louisville
yet
its
market
share
of
percent
pal
in
comparison
with
the
other
ge
appliance
business
i
disliked
the
business
the
first
time
i
be
expose
to
it
as
a
sector
executive
i
felt
it
have
no
control
of
its
destiny
you
sell
the
ge
brand
product
to
a
local
distributor
like
ace
plumbing
they
instal
it
with
their
hammer
and
screwdriver
and
drove
away
leave
the
ge
brand
air
conditioner
behind
how
ace
instal
our
product
and
how
it
service
its
customer
reflect
directly
back
on
ge
we
be
frequently
get
customer
complaint
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
we
be
be
tar
by
something
we
have
no
control
over
because
of
our
low
market
share
our
competitor
have
the
best
distributor
and
independent
contractor
for
ge
this
be
a
flaw
business
you
never
would
have
know
it
by
the
reaction
we
get
when
it
be
sell
it
really
shook
up
louisville
the
air
conditioning
sale
to
trane
reinforce
my
think
that
put
a
weak
operation
into
a
strong
business
be
a
true
win
win
for
everyone
trane
be
a
market
leader
with
the
sale
our
air
conditioning
people
become
part
of
a
win
team
a
month
after
the
sale
a
phone
call
confirm
my
think
i
call
the
general
manager
of
our
former
business
stan
gorski
who
have
join
trane
with
the
divestiture
stan

the
morning
and

air
conditioning
he
think

wonderful
every
time
i
talk
to
you
on

phone

be
about
some
customer
complaint
or
my
margin
you

conditioning
jack
today
we
re
all
winner
and
we
all
feel
it
in
louisville
i
be
the
orphan
stan
you
ve
make
my
day
i
say
before
hang
up
through
the
onslaught
of
criticism
to
come
stan
s
comment
help
to
fortify
my
resolve
to
carry
out
the
no
or
no
strategy
no
matter
what
the
air
conditioning
deal
also
establish
another
basic
principle
we
use
the
million
from
its
sale
to
help
pay
to
restructure
other
business
every
business
we
sell
be
treat
the
same
way
we
never
put
those
gain
into
net
income
instead
we
use
them
to
improve
the
company
s
competitiveness
in
year
we
never
permit
ourselves
or
any
of
our
business
to
use
one
time
restructuring
charge
as
an
excuse
for
miss
an
earnings
commitment
we
paid
our
own
way
from
the
day
i
write
reg
about
my
qualification
for
the
ceo
job
i
adopt
consistent
earnings
growth
as
a
theme
of
mine
fortunately
we
have
a
number
of
strong
and
diverse
business
that
could
deliver
on
that
pledge
we
manage
business
not
earnings
when
we
sell
a
business
like
air
conditioning
and
realize
an
accounting
gain
as
well
as
cash
this
give
us
the
flexibility
to
reinvest
in
or
fix
up
another
business
that
s
what
shareowner
expect
from
us
and
paid
us
to
do
i
liken
our
treatment
of
these
gain
to
fix
up
a
house
when
you
don
t
have
the
money
to
repair
the
ceiling
you
put
a
bucket
underneath
the
leak
to
catch
the
drip
when
you
find
money
in
the
budget
you
fix
the
leak
that
s
what
we
do
at
ge
with
much
of
the
cash
from
a
divestiture
we
take
action
to
strengthen
our
business
for
the
long
haul
every
now
and
then
we
d
get
a
critic
challenge
how
we
achieve
our
consistent
earnings
growth
one
reporter
even
suggest
that
if
we
take
a
charge
to
close
a
business
in
one
quarter
and
take
a
gain
to
sell
another
business
in
the
follow
quarter
our
earnings
would
not
have
be
consistent
duh
our
job
be
to
fix
the
leak
when
we
get
the
cash
if
you
didn
t
do
that
you
d
be
manage
nothing
if
you
follow
the
cash
and
in
this
case
ge
s
cash
you
see
what
s
really
happen
in
a
company
accounting
doesn
t
generate
cash
manage
business
do
get
out
of
the
air
conditioning
business
spark
a
firestorm
but
it
be
principally
contain
in
louisville
the
next
sale
of
utah
international
be
a
much
more
difficult
situation
for
me
reg
jones
have
purchase
the
business
for
billion
in
at
the
time
it
be
the
large
acquisition
ever
for
reg
for
ge
and
for
all
of
corporate
america
utah
be
a
highly
profitable
first
class
company
that
derive
its
income
largely
from
sell
metallurgical
coal
to
the
japanese
steel
industry
it
also
have
a
small
u
s
oil
and
gas
company
and
large
proven
but
undeveloped
copper
reserve
in
chile
reg
purchase
the
company
as
a
hedge
against
the
wild
inflation
of
the
s
to
me
with
inflation
abate
it
didn
t
fit
the
objective
of
consistent
income
growth
its
lumpy
earnings
clashed
with
my
goal
to
have
everyone
feel
their
individual
contribution
count
ge
make
its
money
every
quarter
by
bring
in
cash
from
every
corner
of
the
world
nickel
by
nickel
every
day
everyone
s
contribution
count
as
a
sector
executive
and
vice
chairman
i
have
sat
in
meeting
with
my
peer
listen
as
we
all
told
how
valiantly
we
have
work
to
make
the
quarter
s
or
the
year
s
number
then
the
executive
in
charge
of
utah
would
stand
up
and
unknowingly
overwhelm
those
contribution
one
way
or
another
we
have
a
strike
at
the
coal
mine
he
d
say
so
we
re
go
to
miss
our
profit
projection
by
million
all
of
us
would
stare
in
disbelief
at
the
size
of
the
number
or
he
could
just
as
easily
come
to
the
meeting
and
say
the
price
of
coal
go
up
ten
buck
so
i
have
an
extra
million
to
toss
into
the
pot
either
way
utah
tend
to
make
our
nickel
by
nickel
contribution
seem
fruitless
i
felt
the
cyclical
nature
of
utah
s
business
make
our
goal
of
consistent
earnings
impossible
i
didn
t
like
the
natural
resource
business
where
i
felt
event
be
often
beyond
your
control
or
in
the
case
of
oil
the
behavior
of
a
cartel
diminish
the
ingenuity
of
the
individual
as
an
aside
i
believe
dupont
s
acquisition
of
conoco
in
have
some
of
the
same
impact
conoco
be
also
purchase
as
a

i
have
enjoy
incredible
board
support
from
the
first
day
in
the
job
and
it
would
turn
out
to
be
need
on
more
than
this
occasion
after
christmas
the
burlingame
doyle
fresco
team
go
back
to

on
the

financial
constraint
by
offering
to
take
business
out
of
utah
include
u
s
oil
and
gas
producer
ladd
petroleum
this
make
the
deal
acceptable
to
broken
hill
and
the
company
bought
the
remainder
of
our
utah
subsidiary
for
billion
in
cash
before
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
of
it
take
another
year
to
get
all
the
necessary
government
approval
six
year
later
in
we
sell
the
last
piece
ladd
for
million
with
the
divestiture
of
air
conditioning
and
now
utah
i
be
feel
pretty
good
about
our
strategy
and
its
implementation
probably
a
bit
too
good
the
air
conditioning
deal
have
upset
only
people
in
the
major
appliance
business
where
it
reside
utah
didn
t
cause
even
the
slightest
blip
we
have
held
the
company
only
a
short
time
and
it
have
never
really
become
part
of
ge
the
next
move
our
sale
of
ge
housewares
would
prove
to
be
a
lot
different
i
have
overseen
our
housewares
operation
for
almost
six
year
and
thought
it
be
a
terrible
business
steam
iron
toaster
hair
dryer
and
blender
aren
t
very
excite
product
i
recall
a
breakthrough
be
the
electric
peel
wand
a
device
to
make
potato
peel
a
lot
easy
not
the
type
of
hot
technology
we
need
these
product
weren
t
for
the

nothing

this
would
put
another
stake
in
the
ground
for
our
no

some
might
call
nonproductive
thing
i
be
building
a
fitness
center
guesthouse
and
conference
center
at
headquarters
and
lay
plan
for
a
major
upgrade
of
crotonville
our
management
development
center
my
take
on
this
be
that
all
these
investment
at
a
cost
of
nearly
million
be
consistent
with
the
soft
value
of
excellence
i
have
outline
at
the
pierre
hotel
but
people
weren
t
buying
it
for
them
it
be
a
total
disconnect
it
didn
t
matter
that
the
money
i
be
invest
in
treadmill
conference
hall
and
bedroom
be
pocket
change
to
a
company
that
be
spending
billion
over
the
same
period
on
new
plant
and
equipment
that
billion
spread
across
factory
around
the
world
be
invisible
and
consider
routine
the
symbolism
of
the
million
be
too
much
for
people
to
handle
i
could
understand
why
it
be
difficult
for
many
ge
employee
to
get
it
but
i
be
sure
in
my
gut
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
a
key
supporter
during
this
period
of
spending
while
downsize
be
human
resource
chief
ted
levino
he
be
the
rock
a
link
to
the
past
an
up
from
the
rank
ge
veteran
who
have
the
respect
of
everyone
in
the
system
his
motif
and
integrity
be
unquestionable
i
know
many
shaken
executive
sat
on
ted
s
couch
fresh
from
one
of
their
early
encounter
with
me
ted
counsel
many
of
the
senior
people
who
have
to
go
he
have
back
me
during
the
selection
process
and
more
important
knew
what
he
be
get
and
believe
ge
need
it
ted
s
support
be
important
because
people
be
out
of
their
mind
over
these
investment
nothing
i
could
say
or
do
would
ever
completely
satisfy
the
detractor
or
fully
calm
the
organization
s
jitter
i
wasn
t
go
to
hide
i
use
every
opportunity
to
reach
out
in
early
i
begin
hold
roundtable
discussion
every
other
week
with
group
of
or
so
employee
over
coffee
whether
administrative
assistant
or
manager
be
in
the
room
the
question
never
varied
one
question
inevitably
dominate
those
session
how
can
you
justify
spending
money
on
treadmill
bedroom
and
conference
center
when
you
re
closing
down
plant
and
lay
off
staff
i
enjoy
the
debate
i
wasn
t
necessarily
win
the
argument
but
i
knew
i
have
to
try
to
win
people
over
one
by
one
i
d
argue
that
the
spending
and
the
cut
be
consistent
with
where
we
need
to
go
i
want
to
change
the
rule
of
engagement
ask
for
more
from
few
i
be
insist
that
we
have
to
have
only
the
best
people
i
d
argue
that
our
best
couldn
t
be
ask
to
spend
four
week
away
for
training
in
cinder
block
cell
at
a
worn
out
development
center
guest
shouldn
t
have
to
come
to
headquarters
and
stay
at
a
third
class
motel
if
you
want
excellence
at
a
minimum
the
ambience
have
to
reflect
excellence
at
these
roundtable
i
d
explain
the
fitness
center
be
as
much
about
get
people
together
as
it
be
about
health
a
headquarters
building
be
fill
with
specialist
who
make
nothing
and
sell
nothing
work
there
be
so
different
from
work
in
the
field
where
everyone
in
a
business
can
focus
on
and
be
excite
by
land
a
new
order
or
launch
a
new
product
at
ge
headquarters
you
d
park
your
car
in
an
underground
garage
take
an
elevator
to
your
floor
and
generally
work
in
a
corner
of
the
building
until
the
end
of
the
day
the
cafeteria
be
a
common
meeting
place
but
most
table
be
occupy
by
the
people
who
work
together
i
thought
a
gym
would
provide
an
informal
place
to
bring
together
all
shape
size
layer
and
function
if
you
will
it
could
be
that
back
room
of
a
store
where
people
take
their
break
if
invest
a
little
over
million
could
make
that
happen
it
be
worth
it
despite
my
good
intention
with
the
fitness
center
people
have
trouble
see
the
benefit
in
the
face
of
layoff
some
of
the
same
logic
go
into
the
decision
to
put
up
a
million
guesthouse
and
conference
center
at
headquarters
which
be
an
island
unto
itself
it
be
in
the
country
some
sixty
mile
north
of
new
york
city
off
the
merritt
parkway
there
be
no
natural
place
to
congregate
after
work
fairfield
and
the
surround
area
lack
a
decent
hotel
to
put
up
employee
and
guest
who
come
from
all
over
the
world
i
want
to
create
a
first
class
place
where
people
could
stay
work
and
interact
the
facility
feature
fireplace
in
the
lounge
and
a
stand
up
bar
in
the
pub
where
everyone
could
mingle
the
traditionalist
be
shock
i
persevere
because
i
want
to
create
a
first
rate
informal
family
atmosphere
and
need
this
ambience
to
get
it
everywhere
i
go
i
be
preach
the
need
for
excellence
in
everything
we
do
my
action
have
to
demonstrate
it
the
story
of
crotonville
be
no
different
our
corporate
education
center
be
already
a
quarter
of
a
century
old
and
unfortunately
look
it
manager
be
be
house
in
barren
quarter
four
to
a
suite
the
bedroom
have
the
feel
of
a
roadside
motel
we
need
to
make
our
own
people
and
our
customer
who
come
to
crotonville
feel
that
they
be
work
for
and
deal
with
a
world
class
company
nonetheless
some
critic
begin
call
it
jack
s
cathedral
my
answer
to
the
complaint
during
the
early
s
be
that
business
be
in
fact
a
series
of
paradox
spending
million
on
building
that
make
nothing
while
closing
down
uncompetitive
factory
that
produce
good
these
goal
be
consistent
with
become
a
world
class
competitor
you
couldn
t
hire
and
retain
the
best
people
and
at
the
same
time
become
the
low
cost
provider
of
good
and
service
without
do
both
pay
the
high
wage
while
have
the
low
wage
cost
we
have
to
get
the
best
people
in
the
world
and
have
to
pay
them
that
way
but
we
couldn
t
carry
along
people
we
didn
t
need
we
need
to
have
well
people
if
we
be
to
get
more
productivity
from
few
of
them
manage
long
term
while
eat
short
term
i
always
thought
any
fool
could
do
one
or
the
other
squeeze
cost
out
at
the
expense
of
the
future
could
deliver
a
quarter
a
year
maybe
even
two
year
and
it
s
not
hard
to
do
dream
about
the
future
and
not
deliver
in
the
short
term
be
the
easy
of
all
the
test
of
a
leader
be
balance
the
two
a
favorite
retort
for
at
least
the
first
ten
year
be
ge
and
you
be
too
focus
on
the
short
term
that
s
just
another
clich
d
excuse
to
do
nothing
need
to
be
hard
in
order
to
be
soft
make
tough
mind
decision
about
people
and
plant
be
a
prerequisite
to
earn
the
right
to
talk
about
soft
value
like
excellence
or
the
learn
organization
soft
stuff
won
t
work
if
it
doesn
t
follow
demonstrate
toughness
it
work
only
in
a
performance
base
culture
think
of
those
dichotomy
those
paradox
i
be
try
to
get
across
we
need
to
produce
more
output
with
less
input
we
need
to
expand
some
business
while
shrink
or
sell
others
we
need
to
function
as
one
company
but
our
diversity
demand
different
style
and
yes
we
need
to
treat
people
in
a
first
class
way
if
we
want
to
attract
and
keep
the
best
the
logic
behind
these
paradox
didn
t
go
far
in
an
environment
overcome
with
so
much
uncertainty
in
fact
the
internal
upheaval
be
so
great
it
begin
spill
outside
the
company
by
mid
newsweek
magazine
be
the
first
publication
to
pick
up
the
moniker
neutron
jack
the
guy
who
remove
the
people
but
left
the
building
stand
i
hat
it
and
it
hurt
but
i
hat
bureaucracy
and
waste
even
more
the
data
obsess
headquarters
and
the
low
margin
in
turbine
be
equally
offensive
to
me
soon
neutron
begin
crop
up
almost
everywhere
in
the
medium
it
be
as
if
reporter
couldn
t
write
a
ge
story
without
use
the
tag
it
be
a
painful
new
image
twist
for
me
for
year
people
thought
i
be
too
wild
that
i
be
too
growth
focus
hire
too
many
people
and
built
too
many
facility
in
plastic
medical
and
ge
credit
now
i
be
neutron
i
guess
that
be
a
paradox
too
i
didn
t
like
it
but
i
come
to
understand
it
truth
be
we
be
the
first
big
healthy
and
profitable
company
in
the
mainstream
that
take
the
action
to
get
more
competitive
chrysler
do
it
a
few
year
earlier
but
the
stage
be
set
for
their
action
by
a
government
bailout
and
their
widely
publicize
struggle
to
avoid
bankruptcy
there
be
no
stage
set
for
us
we
look
too
good
too
strong
too
profitable
to
be
restructuring
our
billion
in
net
income
and
billion
of
sale
in
make
ge
the
ninth
most
profitable
company
in
the
fortune
and
the
tenth
large
however
we
be
face
our
own
reality
in
the
u
s
economy
be
in
a
recession
inflation
be
rampant
oil
sell
for
a
barrel
and
some
predict
it
would
go
to
if
we
could
even
get
it
and
the
japanese
benefiting
from
a
weak
yen
and
good
technology
be
increase
their
export
into
many
of
our
mainstream
business
from
car
to
consumer
electronics
i
want
to
face
these
reality
by
get
more
cost
competitive
and
that
s
what
we
be
do
i
also
saw
firsthand
the
impact
of
this
change
environment
on
many
of
the
ceo
in
the
new
york
new
jersey
connecticut
tri
state
area
i
serve
as
a
corporate
chairman
for
the
united
way
campaign
in
the
early
s
time
after
time
as
i
visit
with
ceo
to
strong
arm
them
for
contribution
i
d
hear
them
say
we
d
like
to
give
it
to
you
but
we
can
t
or
we
can
t
give
as
much
as
we
do
in
the
past
thing
be
too
tough
this
experience
bolster
my
notion
that
only
healthy
grow
vibrant
company
can
carry
out
their
responsibility
to
people
and
their
community
the
cost
of
fix
a
troubled
company
after
the
fact
be
enormous
and
even
more
painful
we
be
fortunate
our
predecessor
left
us
a
good
balance
sheet
we
could
be
humane
and
generous
to
the
people
we
have
to
let
go
although
most
probably
didn
t
feel
we
be
at
the
time
we
give
our
employee
significant
notice
and
good
severance
pay
and
our
good
reputation
help
many
find
new
job
by
move
early
more
job
be
available
for
them
it
s
still
true
in
if
you
be
the
first
dot
com
to
cut
the
payroll
each
of
your
employee
have
many
job
offer
if
you
be
the
last
your
people
could
be
in
the
unemployment
line
but
that
s
not
what
some
thought
when
a
healthy
old
line
company
like
ours
be
closing
a
steam
iron
plant
in
ontario
california
in
we
learn
that
minute
be
send
mike
wallace
and
a
film
crew
to
cover
it
have
minute
call
to
talk
about
a
plant
closing
be
not
likely
to
be
a
pleasant
event
and
it
end
up
not
be
a
pretty
sight
wallace
report
that
we
laid
off
people
simply
because
we
weren
t
make
enough
profit
and
want
to
move
those
job
outside
the
united
state
to
mexico
singapore
and
brazil
he
interviewed
former
employee
who
say
they
felt
betrayed
and
a
religious
leader
who
condemn
the
plant
s
closure
as
immoral
that
view
be
understandable
then
but
the
fact
be
somewhat
different
the
plant
make
metal
iron
when
consumer
already
overwhelmingly
favor
plastic
model
we
have
four
plant
include
one
in
north
carolina
make
plastic
iron
ontario
s
product
line
have
to
be
discontinue
closing
the
plant
be
uncomfortable
for
everyone
but
it
be
the
high
cost
plant
in
our
system
and
we
be
go
to
be
competitive
in
fairness
to
minute
the
program
do
point
out
that
we
have
give
our
employee
six
month
advance
notice
when
the
average
then
be
only
one
week
wallace
also
report
that
we
help
to
fund

we
also
found
a

that
would
eventually
rehire
many
former

i
have

than
a

when
in

of

ahead
of

some
critic
use
us
as
a
counterpoint
to
such
company
as
ibm
which
at
that
time
still
promote
the
concept
of
lifetime
employment
in
fact
ibm
itself
launch
an
advertising
campaign
tout
its
nonlayoff
policy
in

people
shouldn
t
several
ge
manager
brought
the
ad
to
our
crotonville
class
and
pointedly
ask
what
s
your
reaction
to
this
at
a
time
when
i
be
be
routinely
assault
with
the
neutron
tag
those
ad
really
piss
me
off
sadly
for
the
ibm
people
their
day
would
come
as
the
company
lose
competitiveness
any
organization
that
think
it
can
guarantee
job
security
be
go
down
a
dead
end
only
satisfied
customer
can
give
people
job
security
not
company
that
reality
put
an
end
to
the
implicit
contract
that
corporation
once
have
with
their
employee
those
contract
be
base
on
perceive
lifetime
employment
and
produce
a
paternal
feudal
fuzzy
kind
of
loyalty
if
you
put
in
your
time
and
work
hard
the
perception
be
that
the
company
take
care
of
you
for
life
as
the
game
change
people
have
to
be

on
the
competitive
world
where
no
business
be
a
safe
haven
for
employment
unless
it
be
win
in
the
marketplace
the
psychological
contract
have
to
change
i
want
to
create
a
new
contract
make
ge
job
the
best
in
the
world
for
people
willing
to
compete
if
they
sign
up
we
d
give
them
the

training
and
development
and
an
environment
that
provide
plenty
of
opportunity
for

we
d
do
everything
to

them
the
skill
to
have
lifetime
employability
even
if
we
couldn
t
guarantee
them
lifetime
employment
remove
people
will
always
be
the
hardest
decision
a
leader
face
anyone
who
enjoys
do
it
shouldn
t
be
on
the
payroll
and
neither
should
anyone
who
can
t
do
it
i
never
underestimated
the
human
cost
of
those
layoff
or
the
hardship
they
might
cause
people
and
community
to
me
every
action
have
to
pas
a
simple
screen
would
we
like
to
be
treat
that
way
be
we
fair
and
equitable
can
you
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
every
day
and
say
yes
to
those
question
as
a
company
we
could
look
at
ourselves
in
the
mirror
when
it
come
to
soften
the
rough
edge
of
radical
change
the
speech
i
have
to
give
time
be
we
didn
t
fire
the
people
we
fire
the
position
and
the
people
have
to
go
we
never
resort
to
across
the
board
cutback
or
pay
freeze
two
old
management
favorite
to
reduce
cost
carry
out
under
the
guise
of
share
the
pain
both
action
be
example
of
people
not
want
to
face
reality
and
differentiation
that
s
not
manage
or
lead
edict
to
impose
a
uniform
percent
layoff
policy
or
a

undermine
the

spring
of

meanwhile
some

fast
enough
unfortunately
in
the

downward
we
go
from

what

for
everyone
in

what
i
have

still
the
pressure
to
avoid
some
of
these
tough
decision
be
considerable
the
lobbying
wasn
t
only
internal
the
call

in
from

have
distinguish
themselves
once
again

chain
to
reject
our
new
national
labor
agreement
governor
i
say
i
have
to
tell
you
lynn
be
the
last
place
on
earth
i
would
ever
put
any
more
work
dukakis

aide
be
shock
there
be
a
long
silence
in
the
room
everyone
be
expect
me
to
make
some
reassure
comment
about
our
commitment
to
employment
and
possible
expansion
in
massachusetts
you
re
a
politician
and
you
know
how
to
count
vote
you
don
t
put
new
road
in
district
that
don
t
vote
for
you
what

the
only
local
in
all
of
ge
that
have
reject
our
national
union
contract
they
seem
to
do
this
as
a
ritual
over
the
year
why
should
i
put
work
and
money
where
there
be
trouble
when
i
can
put
up
plant
where
people
want
them
and
deserve
them
governor
dukakis
chuckle
he
instantly
understood
the
point
and
sent
his
labor
representative
to
lynn
to
improve
thing
progress
have
be
slow
to
say
the
least
but
lynn
do
vote
for
the
national
contract
in
i
take
another
solid
hit
in
early
august
of
when
fortune
magazine
put
me
at
the
top
of
its
list
of
the
ten
toughest
boss
in
america
this
be
a
case
where
be
no
or
no
wasn
t
something
you
be
look
for
fortunately
the
article
have
some
good
thing
to
say
as
well
one
former
employee
told
the
magazine
that
he
have
never
met
someone
with
so
many
creative
business
idea
i
ve
never
felt
that
anybody
be
tap
my
brain
so
well
another
actually
credit
me
with
bring
to
ge
the
passion
and
dedication
that
characterize
the
best
silicon
valley
start
ups
i
like
all
that
but
the
positive
reaction
be
overshadow
by
comment
from
anonymous
former
employee
who
say
i
be
very
abrasive
and
didn
t
tolerate
i
think
answer
work
for
him
be
like
a
war
claimed
another
unidentified
person
a
lot
of
people
get
shot
up
the
survivor
go
on
to
the
next
battle
the
article
claimed
that
i
attack
people
almost
physically
with
question
in
the
word
of
the
writer
criticize
demean
ridicule
humiliate
in
truth
the
meeting
be
different
from
what
people
be
use
to
they
be
candid
challenge
and
demand
if
former
manager
want
a
reason
why
they
didn
t
cut
it
there
be
plenty
of
way
to
spin
the
story
i
get
the
article
as
i
be
leave
the
office
for
california
to
spend
a
weekend
at
the
bohemian
grove
as
the
guest
of
director
ed
littlefield
i
share
the
story
with
ed
who
shrug
it
off
i
couldn
t
get
it
out
of
my
mind
the
story
make
it
a
long
weekend
the
net
effect
of
all
this
publicity
be
that
the
neutron
jack
and
toughest
bos
in
america
label
would
stick
for
some
time
the
ironic
thing
be
that
i
didn
t
go
far
enough
or
move
fast
enough
when
mba
at
the
harvard
business
school
in
the
mid
s
ask
me
what
i
regret
most
in
my
first
year
as
ceo
i
say
i
take
too
long
to
act
the
class
burst
out
laugh
but
it
be
true
the
fact
be
that
i
be
just
too
hesitant
to
break
the
glass
i
wait
too
long
to
close
uncompetitive
facility
i
take
too
long
to
take
apart
the
corporate
staff
keep
on
economist
marketing
consultant
strategic
planner
and
outright
bureaucrat
much
longer
than
i
need
to
i
didn
t
blow
up
our
sector
structure
until
it
be
just
another
insulate
layer
of
management
and
should
have
be
cut
the
moment
the
succession
race
be
decide
the
seven
executive
in
these
sector
job
be
the
best
people
we
have
they
should
have
be
run
our
business
i
be
waste
them
in
these
oversight
position
we
promote
our
best
executive
to
those
job
and
in
turn
those
job
make
some
of
our
best
people
look
bad
once
we
blew
it
up
we
quickly
discover
something
else
without
the
sector
layer
we
get
a
much
well
look
at
the
people
really
run
the
business
it
change
the
game
within
month
we
could
see
clearly
who
have
it
and
who
didn
t
four
senior
vice
president
left
the
company
in
mid
it
be
a
huge
breakthrough
while
the
medium
focus
on
the
layoff
we
focus
on
the
keeper
i
could
talk
my
face
blue
about
face
reality
or
be
no
or
no
in
every
business
or
create
an
organization
that
thrive
on
change
but
until
we
get
the
right
horse
in
place
we
didn
t
get
the
traction
we
need
to
truly
change
the
company
i
shouldn
t
have
waste
so
much
time
on
the
resister
hop
they
d
buy
in
when
we
finally
get
the
right
people
in
all
the
key
place
the
game
change
quickly
let
me
illustrate
what
put
the
right
person
at
the
top
can
do
i
can
t
think
of
a
well
example
than
our
appointment
of
dennis
dammerman
as
chief
financial
officer
in
march
of
if
you
have
ask
thousand
of
employee
at
that
time
to
come
up
with
a
list
of
five
folk
who
would
succeed
tom
thorsen
as
cfo
none
would
have
name
dennis
because
he
be
so
far
down
in
the
financial
hierarchy
tom
and
i
always
have
a
complex
relationship
i
love
his
brain
his
cockiness
and
his
companionship
in
spite
of
his
outwardly
flamboyant
manner
and
his
great
support
for
where
we
be
go
he
saw
himself
as
the
protector
of
the
strong
functional
organization
in
the
company
ironically
he
be
also
the
sharpest
critic
in
the
company
tough
and
decisive
about
everything
and
everyone

just
as
important
he
didn
t
carry
any

on
the
more
typical
list
of

would
have
have
i
give

a
drink
for
myself
and
get
right
to
the
point
dennis
i
say
i
d
like
to
go
to
the

this
week
and
appoint
you

be
just
what
i
want
dennis

i
add
more
heat
to

situation
by
write
dennis
a
three
page
critique
of
his

it
with
his
team
in
a
may
letter
i
write
the
first
thing
i

like
to
do
be
make
it
clear
that
i
don
t
hate
the

i
think
its
strength
have
make
it
the
best
single
functional
organization
in
the
company
it
have
be
some
of
the
glue
that
s
kept
the

that
be
the
past
what
work
before
control
be
not
enough
for
tomorrow
everything
do
in
the
past
be
open
for
question
question
not
criticism
from
the
financial
management
program
its
input
size
and
the
training
it
provide
to
the

size
and
role
change
doesn
t
come
from
a
slogan
or
a

it
happens
because
you
put
the
right
people
in

to
make
it
happen

everything
else
next

almost
everything

shipping
label
and
get
it

more
people
to
get

in
milwaukee
one
of
ge
s
best

the
incredible
efficiency
of
the
japanese
be
both
awesome
and
frighten
what
i
saw
in
japan
be
occur
in
many
of
our
market
the
japanese
be
tear
apart
the
cost
structure
in
industry
after
industry
television
set
automobile
and
copying
machine
be
be
hammer
i
be
look
for
a
business
that
would
give
us
a
place
to
hide
in
the
early
s
three
business
seem
to
ring
the
bell
food
pharmaceutical
and
television
broadcasting
everyone
need
to
eat
and
the
united
state
have
a
strong
agricultural
position
in
the
world
we
evaluate
several
food
company
include
general
food
but
couldn
t
make
the
number
work
at
the
time
their
price
earnings
ratio
be
much
high
than
ge
s
as
for
pharmaceutical
the
number
weren
t
even
close
the
government
s
foreign
ownership
restriction
make
tv
attractive
like
the
food
industry
it
have
strong
cash
flow
that
could
strengthen
and
expand
our
business
the
japanese
threat
would
lead
to
a
deal
that
would
really
change
ge
the
billion
acquisition
of

in
at
the
time
it

always
fascinate

wyman
fend
off
ted
s
threat
and
we
weren
t
need
the
cbs
deal
evaporate
but
my
secret
meeting
with
wyman
hadn
t
escape
attention

be
no
secret
on

t
do
an

with
him
i
be
a
big
admirer
of
felix

heard
about
my
interest
in

and
knew
of
my
earlier
effort
to

after
a
successful
run
as
the
president
of

he
be
quiet
self
efface
and
incredibly
wise
i
felt
very
good
about
him
right
away
brad
have
do
a
good
job
and
be
particularly
successful
with
nbc
by
entice
tv
producer
grant
tinker
to
head
up
the
network
from
the
start
brad
have
no
intention
of
stay
all
that
long
ironically
he
found
his
replacement
in
bob
frederick
who
have
be
one
of
the
ge
executive
in
the
race
for

have
join
rca
three

earlier
as

operating

and
president
he
be
make
ceo
in
brad
remain
as
chairman
but
be
have
all
kind
of
second
thought
about
whether
rca
could
make
it
on
its
own
out
of
the
blue
i
get
a
call
from
felix
who
ask
me
if

in

new
york
apartment
for
drink
brad
show
up
dress
in
a
tux
so
he
could
skip
out
for
a
formal
dinner
it
be
quickly
clear
that
like
me
bradshaw
be
worried
about
asian
competition
he
be
as
focus
on
be
no
or
no
as
i
be
we
never
talk
about
a
specific
deal
that
night
but
we
found
out
we
like
each
other
felix
have
be
a
good
matchmaker
brad
and
i
be
comfortable
with
each
other
and
share
a
common
understand
for
the
strategic
rationale
behind
a
combination
ours
be
a
short
meeting
a
little
less
than
an
hour
when
i
left
felix
s
apartment
we
hadn
t
schedule
a
second
meeting
at
this
point
we
be
just
date
but
i
felt
that
there
be
a
real
shot
at
marriage
the
next
day
i
put
together
a
team
include
dennis
dammerman
our
chief
financial
officer
and
mike
carpenter
our
head
of
business
development
to
dig
through
rca
we
work
on
the
project
under
the
code
name
island
the
day
before
thanksgiving
our
team
get
together
to
decide
whether
to
take
the
next
step
for
more
than
four
hour
larry
bossidy
the
island
team
and
i
wallowed
through
all
the
pro
and
con
of
the
acquisition
for
me
wallow
have
always
be
a
key
part
of
how
we
ran
ge
get
a
group
of
people
around
a
table
regardless
of
their
rank
to
wrestle
with
a
particularly
tough
issue
stew
on
it
from
every
angle
flush
out
everyone
s
think
but
don
t
come
to
an
immediate
conclusion
with
rca
we
wallowed
to
the
point
of
see
that
there
be
a
lot
more
than
just
a
broadcast
network
we
have
a
small
semiconductor
business
so
do
rca
we
have
an
aerospace
division
so
do
rca
we
both
be
in
the
tv
set
business
combine
operation
in
these
business
would
make
each
one
of
them
a
lot
strong
we
have
be
in
the
tv
station
business
for
year
and
our
short
courtship
with
cbs
give
us
enough
understand
to
become
reasonably
comfortable
with
the
network
we
put
a
billion
valuation
on
the
broadcast
business
if
we
could
stomach
pay
about
billion
for
everything
else
then
the
deal
could
be
a
home
run
our
major
concern
be
the
valuation
of
nbc
though
its
rating
be
strong
in
cable
television
have
start
to
eat
into
its
network
audience
we
make
some
very
aggressive
assumption
on
cable
penetration
and
still
decide
that
the
deal
be
right
i
kept
ask
ten
year
from
now
would
you
rather
be
in
appliance
or
in
network
television
we
all
agree
to
go
away
and
think
it
over
during
the
long
thanksgiving
day
weekend
we
met
again
first
thing
monday
morning
all
of
us
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
the
number
work
and
beyond
the
network
we
saw
that
most
of
rca
s
other
business
be
a
great
fit
with
ours
it
be
a
go
i
let
felix
know
that
at
the
right
price
we
be
interested
he
set
up
another
meeting
between
brad
and
me

perfect
fit

him

well

a
price

the
a
share
range
more
than
high
than
rca

trading
at
that
time
he
pause
and
in
his
professorial
way
let
me
know
it
wasn
t
quite
enough
by
the
time
i
left
we
agree
to
pursue
the
deal
and
to
disagree
on
a
final
price

little
hairy

more

in

our
lifestyle
have
substantially
diverge
and
despite
a
split
that
unfortunately
become
very
public
we
knew
we
have
to
move
on
back
at
work
the
first
chip
that
we
played
in
the
rca
deal
be
the
tv
manufacturing
business
in
june
paolo
fresco
and
i
be
in
paris
at
the
french
open
entertain
customer
at
this
nbc
telecast
event
alain
gomez
the
chairman
of
thomson
france
s
government
own
electronics
company
stop
by
our
hospitality
suite
he
be
a
fun
and
gutsy
guy
we
already
have
plan
to
see
him
at
his
office
the
follow
day
when
we
get
together
it
be
not
unlike
my
first
meeting
with
bradshaw
both
our
company
have
business
that
need
help
thomson
have
a
very
weak
no
or
no
medical
image
business
call
cgr
that
i
want
we
have
a
no
u
s
position
in
medical
equipment
from
x
ray
device
ct
scanner
and
magnetic
resonance
image
machine
we
have
no
meaningful
position
in
france
because
the
government
s
ownership
of
thomson
essentially
close
the
country
to
us
alain
gomez
make
it
clear
he
have
no
interest
in
sell
his
medical
business
outright
paolo
and
i
decide
to
see
if
he
might
be
interested
in
a
trade
we
always
knew
what
business
in
our
portfolio
we
didn
t
like
i
jumped
up
and
go
to
an
easel
in
thomson
s
conference
room
grabbed
a
magic
marker
and
begin
to
write
down
business
we
could
swap
for
their
medical
operation
my
first
try
be
our
semiconductor
business
that
didn
t
fly
then
i
try
the
tv
manufacturing
business
he
like
that
idea
immediately
his
tv
business
be
subscale
and
strictly
european
base
alain
saw
the
trade
as
a
way
to
unload
his
lose
medical
business
and
overnight
become
the
no
producer
of
television
set
in
the
world
the
three
of
us
get
excite
about
this
deal
we
decide
that
paolo
fresco
would
meet
with
one
of
alain
s
people
to
get
the
discussion
start
within
a
week
alain
take
us
down
the
elevator
to
our
car
wait
outside
his
office
as
the
car
pull
away
from
the
sidewalk
i
grabbed
paolo
by
the
arm
holy
s
i
say
i
think
he
really
want
to
do
this
we
be
both
giddy
i
m
sure
alain
go
back
upstairs
feel
the
exact
same
way
alain
knew
that
his
tv
set
business
be
too
small
to
compete
against
the
japanese
the
deal
give
him
the
economy
of
scale
and
market
position
to
mount
a
strong
challenge
our
domestic
consumer
electronics
business
have
billion
in
annual
sale
and
employee
thomson
s
medical
equipment
business
have
million
in
annual
revenue
the
trade
would
triple
our
market
share
in
europe
to
over
percent
give
us
a
presence
against
our
big
competitor
siemens
within
six
week
the
deal
be
do
and
announce
in
july
besides
the
swap
thomson
give
us
billion
in
cash
and
a
patent
portfolio
that
for
year
threw
off
million
annually
in
after
tax
dollar
meanwhile
thomson
become
the
large
tv
set
producer
in
the
world
our
move
out
of
tv
however
be
a
tough
nut
for
many
to
swallow
medium
critic
claimed
we
be
bow
to
japanese
competition
by
sell
out
some
attack
the
deal
as
un
american
i
even
get
call
a
chicken
for
run
away
from
a
fight
the
criticism
be
medium
nonsense
at
its
best
we
end
up
with
a
more
global
high
tech
medical
business
and
a
lot
of
cash
one
year
of
the
patent
stream
income
be
more
than
we
have
make
in
the
previous
decade
in
the
tv
set
business
we
both
struggle
in
the
short
term
we
lose
money
in
medical
in
europe
for
almost
a
decade
thomson
do
the
same
with
the
consumer
electronics
business
we
both
stayed
with
it
and
ultimately
make
each
business
successful
within
two
year
we
found
the
solution
for
our
semiconductor
business
harris
corp
like
us
have
a
subscale
chip
business
in
july
i
get
a
call
from
harris
chairman
jack
hartley
who
want
to
come
to
fairfield
to
feel
me
out
on
buying
the
business
harris
be
primarily
a
defense
electronics
contractor
with
a
small
semiconductor
operation
that
mainly
support
its
military
sale
hartley
didn
t
think
the
company
could
survive
in
semiconductor
if
it
didn
t
bulk
up
and
gain
volume
from
the
industrial
side
i
never
like
semiconductor
the
chart
i
drew
for
our
board
capture
my
feeling
see
page
below
the
business
be
capital
intensive
and
cyclical
it
have
short
product
life
cycle
and
the
return
for
most
player
be
historically
low
get
out
of
it
would
let
us
use
our
capital
for
other
thing
like
jet
engine
medical
equipment
and
power
turbine
that
have
well
return
fortunately
our
major
global
competitor
stayed
with
semiconductor
that
business
use
large
amount
of
their
capital
and
divert
a
lot
of
their
management
attention
my
desire
to
get
out
make
a
deal
with
harris
pretty
easy
i
wasn
t
ask
for
much
just
a
graceful
exit
over
lunch
hartley
and
i
outline
the
deal
we
put
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
six
major
deal
point
and
give
them
to
our
financial
team
two
month
later

and
service
while
we
have
a

with

and
clear
cut
agenda

by
no

static
other
than
the

carefully
prepared

s
nothing
neat
and
pretty
about
the
way
the
people
review
process
play
out
no
matter
what
we
put
in
our
book
and
we
put
everything
in
them
it
s
not
simply
the
binder
that
count
what
count
be
the
passion
and
intensity
everyone
brings
to
the
table
when
manager
put
their
neck
on
the
line
for
their
direct
report
you
learn
as
much
about
them
as
the
people
you
re
discuss
sometimes
we
can
debate
for
an
hour
over
one
page
why
be
these
session
so
intense
one
word
differentiation
in
manufacturing
we
try
to
stamp
out
variance
with
people
variance
be
everything
differentiation
isn
t
easy
find
a
way
to
differentiate
people
across
a
large
company
have
be
one
of
the
hardest
thing
to
do
over
the
year
we
ve
use
all
kind
of
bell
curve
and
block
chart
to
differentiate
talent
these
be
all
grid
that
attempt
to
rank
performance
and
potential
high
medium
low
we
ve
also
lead
the
charge
into
degree
evaluation
which
take
into
account
the
view
of
peer
and
subordinate
we
love
that
idea
for
the
first
few
year
it
help
us
locate
the
horse
ass
who
kiss
up
and
kick
down
like
anything
driven
by
peer
input
the
system
be
capable
of
be
game
over
the
long
haul
people
begin
say
nice
thing
about
one
another
so
they
all
would
come
out
with
good
rating
the
s
be
now
only
use
in
special
situation
we
be
always
grope
for
a
well
way
to
evaluate
the
organization
we
eventually
found
one
we
really
like
we
call
it
the
vitality
curve
every
year
we
d
ask
each
of
ge
s
business
to
rank
all
of
their
top
executive
the
basic
concept
be
we
force
our
business
leader
to
differentiate
their
leadership
they
have
to
identify
the
people
in
their
organization
that
they
consider
in
the
top
percent
the
vital
middle
and
finally
the
bottom
percent
if
there
be
people
on
the
management
staff
we
want
to
know
the
four
in
the
top
and
the
two
in
the
bottom
by
name
position
and
compensation
the
underperformer
generally
have
to
go
make
these
judgment
be
not
easy
and
they
be
not
always
precise
yes
you
ll
miss
a
few
star
and
a
few
late
bloomer
but
your
chance
of
building
an
all
star
team
be
improve
dramatically
this
be
how
great
organization
be
built
year
after
year
differentiation
raise
the
bar
high
and
high
and
increase
the
overall
caliber
of
the
organization
this
be
a
dynamic
process
and
no
one
be
assure
of
stay
in
the
top
group
forever
they
have
to
constantly
demonstrate
that
they
deserve
to
be
there
differentiation
come
down
to
sort
out
the
a
b
and
c
player
the
as

who

ahead

not
only
themselves

everyone
who
come
in

with
them
they
make
business
productive
and
fun
at
the
same
time
they
have
what
we
call
the
four
e
of
ge
leadership
very
high
energy
level
the
ability
to
energize
others
around
common
goal
the
edge
to
make
tough
yes
and
no
decision
and
finally
the
ability
to
consistently
execute
and
deliver
on
their
promise
we
actually
start
with
three
e
energy
energize
and
edge
when
we
do
our
first
session
c
appraise
people
base
on
these
e
we
saw
several
manager
with
plenty
of
energy
the
ability
to
energize
their
team
and
a
lot
of
edge
as
we
go
from
business
to
business
we
kept
run
into
one
or
two
who
met
the
three
e
criterion
but
didn
t
look
very
good
to
us
before
we
get
home
we
decide
we
be
miss
something
what
these
manager
be
lack
be
the
ability
to
deliver
the
number
so
we
add
the
fourth
e
execute
that
do
it
in
my
mind
the
four
e
be
connect
by
one
p
passion
it
s
this
passion
probably
more
than
anything
else

the
heart
of

be
critical
to
its
operational
success
we
devote
lot
of
energy
toward
improve
b
we
want
them
to
search
every
day
for
what
they
re
miss
to
become

the

likely
to

rather

they
procrastinate
rather
than

waste
time
on
them

we
do

in

i

struggle
with

hit
home
later
when
a

up
with

he

it
isn

it

just
the

false
kindness
be
keep
people
around
who
aren

there
s
no
cruelty
like

tell
people
late
in
their
career
that
they
don
t
belong
just
when
their

the
characterization
of
a
vitality

as
cruel
stem
from
false
logic
and
be
an
outgrowth
of
a
culture
that
practice
false
kindness
why
should
anyone
stop
measure
performance
when
people
leave

there
s
differentiation
for
all
of
us
in
our
first
year
why
should
it
stop
in
the
workplace
where
most
of
our
wake
hour
be
spent
our
vitality

work
because
we
spent
over
a
decade
building
a
performance
culture
with
candid
feedback
at
every
level
candor
and
openness
be
the
foundation
of
such
a
culture
i
wouldn

want
to
inject
a
vitality
curve
cold
turkey
into
an
organization
without
a
performance
culture
already
in
place
what
s
a
typical
session
c
like
a
month
before
we
go
out
into
the
field
the
corporate
executive
office
and
bill
conaty
our
head
of
human

put
together
an
agenda

the

for
our
session

in

then
shift
to
the

which
now
have
to

the

may
seem
formidable
but
the
meeting
themselves
be
built
around
informality
trust
emotion
and
humor
nonetheless
there
be
a
lot
at
stake
this
review
be
our
most
important
meeting
of
the
year
a
review
break
down
this
way
in
the
morning
we
talk
about
the
organization
and
the
people
in
it
at
lunch
we
focus
on
diversity
in
the
afternoon
we
review
the
game
change
initiative
and
the
people
who
be
lead
them
the
morning
be
where
most
of
the
heat
be
generate
we
re
talk
about
career
promotion
vitality
curve
the
strength
and
weakness
of
individual
it
s
a
rule
of
the
game
that
every
person
have
plus
and
minus
strength
and
development
need
we
spend
most
of
our
time
on
those
need
and
whether
in
fact
these
manager
be
fixable
the
strength
of
a
manufacturing
leader
we
recently
review
be
in
deliver
the
result
great
productivity
terrific
yield
improvement
strong
six
sigma
but
there
be
glare
weakness
too
tough
on
people
and
not
open
to
idea
from
others
after
a
long
debate
over
these
plus
and
minus
we
all
conclude
that
this
guy
ought
to
get
a
warn
notice
he
have
to
change
he
be
run
the
risk
of
become
a
c
not
be
an
open
thinker
would
be
a
killer
of
course
we
have
our
lighter
moment
i
challenged
nearly
everyone
and
often
in
outrageous
way
the
session
c
binder
include
photograph
and
miniature
biography
of
every
executive
when
a
photo
might
reveal
slump
shoulder
droop
eyelid
or
a
hang
head
i
wouldn
t
hesitate
to
point
him
out
and
say
this
guy
look
half
dead
he
can
t
be
any
good
he
s
in
the
job
for
six
or
seven
year
and
he
hasn
t
go
anywhere
what
the
hell
be
go
on
why
haven
t
you
move
on
him
obviously
every
picture
of
an
expressionless
person
doesn
t
tell
the
story
what
i
want
be
a
lively
discussion
i
expect
to
hear
a
business
leader
fight
for
his
or
her
people
everyone
have
to
come
out
of
a
session
c
know
that
people
be
the
whole
ball
game
the
player
the
national
anthem
the
hot
dog
the
seventh
inning
stretch
the
whole
game
in
march
of
i
be
in
pittsfield
again
for
a
session
c
review
accompany
by
our
new
ceo
jeff
immelt
go
through
a
binder
i
spot
a
funny
picture
of
one
of
ge
plastic
high
potential
manager
if
this
guy
be
that
good
you
well
get
him
a
new
picture
i
joked
someone
will
get
the
wrong
impression
later
that
day
i
met
the
employee
and
tease
him
geez
i
say
you
don
t
act
anything
like
your
picture
the
great
job
you
re
do
doesn
t
go
with
that
photo
i
think
he
get
a
kick
out
of
it
and
probably
a
new
picture
each
of
these
picture
be
always
accompany
by
a
nine
square
grid
like
a
tick
tac
toe
box
in
which
one
x
have
be
fill
in
to
show
the
manager
s
potential
and
performance
the
best
rating
be
the
upper
left
hand
square
the
criterion
use
to
place
that
x
rely
heavily
on
our
corporate
objective
the
four
e
as
well
as
our
critical
initiative

focus
e

and
six
sigma
under
each
picture
some
quick
capsule
comment
highlight
a
manager
s
plus
and
minus
most
of
these
capsule
be
plus
but
our
rule
of
engagement
require
that
there
be
at
least
one
negative
that
require
improvement
we
don
t
allow
a
total
whitewash
one
executive
have

such
as
financial
pit
bull
foot

the
negative

we
never
like
people
more

on
the
next
job
than
the
one
they
be
do
this
could

bright
driven
and
ramp
up
on
the
minus
side
execution
be
still
a
question
failure
to
deliver
on
commitment
be
in
the
end
unacceptable
behind
these
summary
be
the
backup
detail
of
accomplishment
and
development
need
each
employee
also
do
his

assessment
which

on
the

as
their

or
find
new
one
at
lunch
we
have
candid
conversation
about
the
program
s
progress
both
the
mentor
and
mentees
bought
into
the
very
tough
ground
rule
in
our
performance
culture
both
understood
that
each
have
a
responsibility
to
deliver
a
superior
product
and
would
be
measure
that
way
the
senior
leadership
be
be
held
accountable
it
s
work
over
percent
of
the
mentees
have
be
promote
after
lunch
the
session
be
devote
to
the
initiative
we
want
to
see
who
be
lead
them
and
who
be
on
each
team
we
get
presentation
from
the
team
on
their
result
against
their
yearly
target
we
picked
up
best
practice
from
each
business
to
take
to
the
next
and
most
important
we
get
a
great
assessment
of
just
how
much
horsepower
be
drive
each
initiative
we
d
leave
each
meeting
with
a
clear
cut
to
do
list
which
we
d
share
with
the
business
two
month
later
in
july
we
d
revisit
these
priority
with
a
two
hour
videoconference
to
check
the
progress
that
same
list
would
serve
as
the
agenda
for
the
session
ii
meeting
in
november
to
close
the
loop
despite
the
rigor
of
this
process
i
be
surprised
by
what
employee
told
us
in
our
annual
attitude
survey
out
of
question
we
always
get
the
low
mark
on
this
statement
this
company
deal
decisively
with
people
who
don
t
perform
satisfactorily
in
only
percent
of
ge
professional
agree
with
the
statement
and
that
response
be
an
improvement
over
when
just
over
percent
agree
the
level
of
satisfaction
on
that
issue
contrast
sharply
with
exceptionally
good
score
across
the
rest
of
the
survey
when
ask
if
an
employee
s
career
with
ge
have
have
a
favorable
impact
on
me
and
my
family
more
than
percent
of
the
response
be
favorable
the
result
vividly
illustrate
how
important
differentiation
be
at
all
level
of
the
company
and
how
much
our
employee
want
an
even
more
aggressive
and
candid
approach
during
session
c
at
major
location
we
spent
at
least
an
hour
meeting
with
local
union
leader
we
want
the
local
union
leader
to
know
us
and
we
want
to
know
them
and
their
concern
our
mutual
respect
for
union
leadership
at
every
level
be
real
and
ran
deep
at
the
national
level
we
fought
like
hell
with
bill
bywater
for
year
and
his
successor
ed
fire
president
of
the
international
union
of
electrical
worker
iue
once
or
twice
a
year
first
frank
doyle
and
for
the
last
seven
year
bill
conaty
our
hr
head
and
i
would
sit
down
with
them
over
dinner
and
argue
over
pay
benefit
and
the
other
typical
issue
the
big
philosophical
difference
between
us
be
my
feel
that
if
we
be
do
our
job
right
our
employee
didn
t
need
an
organization
to
represent
their
interest
my
position
always
drew
a
heat
response
from
bill
and
ed
who
object
to
our
resistance
to
their
organize
effort
our
difference
be
always
in
the
open
there
be
no
hidden
agenda
between
us
and
ge
never
have
a
major
strike
in
more
than
year
on
the
broader
labor
front
my
predecessor
reg
jones
have
lead
a
labor
management
group
of
about
ten
labor
leader
and
ten
ceo
that
be
active
with
george
meany
and
lane
kirkland
of
the
afl
cio
in
the
s
i
like
the
idea
a
lot
and
share
the
leadership
of
this
group
first
with
lane
kirkland
and
then
john
sweeney
john
and
i
can
both
be
thick
head
irishman
but
i
always
felt
we
share
a
genuine
respect
for
each
other
we
ve
try
to
get
agreement
on
subject
like
health
care
trade
and
education
while
the
group
have
be
only
marginally
successful
on
policy
over
our
many
meeting
we
ve
benefit
from
a
well
understand
of
one
another
s
position
our
approach
to
deal
with
labor
union
be
no
different
from
the
way
we
felt
about
all
our
employee
many
outsider
often
ask
me
how
can
the
ge
culture
possibly
work
in
various
culture
across
the
world
the
answer
to
that
question
be
always
the
same
treat
people
with
dignity
and
give
them
voice
that
s
a
message
that
translates
around
the
globe
there
weren
t
enough
hour
in
a
day
or
a
year
to
spend
on
people
this
meant
everything
to
me
i
d
always
try
to
remind
manager
at
every
level
that
they
have
to
share
my
passion
while
i
might
be
the
big
shot
stand
in
front
of
them
today
they
be
in
fact
the
big
shot
to
the
people
in
their
business
they
have
to
transmit
the
same
energy
commitment
and
accountability
to
their
people
to
whom
jack
welch
didn
t
mean
a
thing
my
ex
wife
carolyn
always
remind
me
that
i
work
in
the
company
ten
year
before
i
ever
knew
who
be

the
important
thing
i
urge
every
ge
manager
to
remember
be
that
they
be
the
ceo
as
far
as
their
people

eight
year

each
other
all
the
time

down
a
path
where
i
make
four
incredibly
bad
decision
i
know
he
would
fire
me
he
d
hug

maybe
you
won
t
want
to

and
the
quality
of

varied
widely
much
of
the

future
leadership
wasn
t
bother
to
attend
only
two
of
the
seven
contender
for

s
job
have
take
the
multiweek
general
management
course
i
wasn
t
one
of
them
although
i
remember
take
a
one
week
marketing
class
in
the
late
s
i
like
the
course
but
didn
t
particularly
like
the
accommodation
by
crotonville
be
tire
real
tire
i
want
to
bring
the
place
to
life
and
need
this
former
harvard
professor
to
lead
the
effort
i
saw
crotonville
as
a
place
to
spread
idea
in
an
open
give
and
take
environment
it
could
be
the
perfect
place
to
break
through
the
hierarchy
i
need
to
connect
with
manager
deep
in
the
organization
without
my
message
be
interpret
by
layer
of
boss
but
if
crotonville
be
to
do
all
this
it
would
have
to
change
within
a
few
week
of
meeting
jim
baughman
in
florida
we
be
sit
together
in
fairfield
over
a
three
hour
lunch
wrestling
with
the
center
s
future
i
want
to
change
everything
the
student
the
faculty
the
content
and
the
physical
appearance
of
the
facility
i
want
it
focus
on
leadership
development
not
specific
functional
training
i
want
it
to
be
the
place
to
reach
the
heart
and
mind
of
the
company
s
best
people
the
inspirational
glue
that
held
thing
together
as
we
change
i
don
t
want
anyone
to
go
there
who
doesn
t
have
great
potential
i
told
jim
i
want
the
good
one
come
up
not
the
tire
one
look
for
a
last
reward
if
we
be
go
to
ask
only
the
best
to
go
we
have
to
make
crotonville
a
world
class
center
we
have
to
reinvest
in
facility
when
we
be
in
the
middle
of
gut
wrench
change
the
restructuring
of
our
portfolio
and
downsize
we
renovate
the
pit
the
main
multilevel
classroom
right
away
and
begin
building
a
helipad
so
our
leadership
team
could
get
there
and
back
faster
it
be
an
hour
s
drive
each
way
by
car
from
fairfield
i
ask
jim
to
pitch
our
case
to
the
board
he
do
that
in
june
and
include
a
request
for
million
to
build
a
new
residence
center
there
jim
recall
that
when
i
review
his
presentation
i
cross
out
the
payback
analysis
on
his
last
chart
i
drew
an
x
over
the
transparency
and
scrawl
the
word
infinite
to
make
the
point
that
the
return
on
our
investment
would
last
forever
i
meant
it
it
be
slow

first
session

on
my
favorite
theme
our
no

and
my
desire
to
change
the
feel
of
the
company
after
discuss
where
i
want
to
take
ge
i
open
it
up
for
question
there
be
a
few
but
no
one
in
the
room
want
to
challenge
any
of
my
thought
at
least
percent
of
the
people
in
the
auditorium
have
that
skeptical
look
you
know
the
look
i
mean
when
people
aren
t
with
you
to
be
fair
i
m
sure
i
intimidate
the
hell
out
of
them

be
pace
back
and
forth
in

of

the
very
business

work
in
while

to
be
pretty
nerve
rack
only
the
few
manager
frustrate
with
the
bureaucracy
like
it
i
understood
the
confusion
and
fear
in
the
room

those
manager
sign
up
for
a
different
more
traditional
ge
i
be
struggle
to
find
the
right
word
and
be
blurring
the
impact
of
my
message
the
theme
of
excellence
quality
entrepreneurship
ownership
face
reality

dramatically
after

out

to
a
large
number
of

in
i
begin
the
entry
class
ask
how
many
of
you
have
receive
grant
at
first
less
than
half
would
usually
raise
their
hand
well
i
have
good
news
for
everybody
for
those
who
get
option
congratulation
you
wouldn
t
have
them
if
you
weren
t
a
player
the
stock
have
be
strong
and
with
continued
strong
performance
you
should
look
forward
to
make

by
this

the
rest
of
the
crowd
none
of
whom
have
ever
see
a
stock
option
be
wonder
what
be
go
to
come
next
and
it
s
good
news
for
those
of
you
who
haven
t
receive
a

i
say
now
you
know
that
your
bos
isn
t
leveling
with
you
if
your
bos
told
you
that
you
re
a
star
something
s
wrong
because
all
our
star
be
get
option
you
should
go
back
and
talk
to
your
manager
and
ask
why
you
re
not
get
them
surprisingly
many
didn
t
because
they
knew
in
their
gut
where
they
stood
during
the
s
crotonville
s
leadership
be
pass
to
steve
kerr
steve
be
low
key
very
bright
forward
think
and
a
real
team
player
just
what
we
need
to
bring
the
center
to
its
next
level
he
not
only
developed
the
curriculum
for
our
own
people
but
be
fantastic
in
bring
customer
into
crotonville
to
share
best
practice
with
them
he
be
a
great
ambassador
in
we
decide
that
no
one
could
attend
crotonville
s
top
program
if
they
didn
t
receive
a

all
the
a

should
get

all
should
gain
the

i
like
the

that
every
member
of
our
leadership
team
should
teach
a
session
before
our
senior
staff
and
business

have
do
it
only
on
a

close
look
at
our
most
successful
role

it
give
our

extraordinary
amount
of
my
time

time
over

up
i
would
sometimes
send
ahead

handwritten
memo
of

i
expect
to
cover
during
a
session
for

about
their
late
concession
yet
there

no
way
i
could
let
them
know
of
my
conversation
with
phil
so
they

and
give
finally

to
the
last
day
and
we

one
more
squeeze

couldn
t
take
it
anymore
i
picked
up
the
phone
and
call
phil
phil
i
m
choke
i
can
t
sit
here
any
longer
i
ve
get
to
break
this
commitment
you
ve
go
far
enough
he
reply
tell
your
team
to
say
no
they
ve
get
the
deal
another
dilemma
i
d
share
be
the
decision
to
move
the
production
of
our
refrigerator
from
louisville
kentucky
to
mexico
in
the
late
s
the
economics
clearly
favor
the
decision
on
the
other
hand
the
union
have
be
incredibly
helpful
at
the
local
and
national
level
in
try
to
make
our
u
s
facility
more
competitive
from
a
pure
business
case
the
number
dictate
the
move
we
have
other
operation
in
louisville
and
a
national
union
leadership
that
be
try
hard
to
work
with
us
in
the
end
we
make
the
call
to
keep
manufacturing
a
line
of
refrigerator
there
save
roughly
job
in
louisville
i
told
the
class
that
the
goodwill
we
gain
from
this
decision
would
help
us
become
more
competitive
in
louisville
still
it
be
a
real
dilemma
to
go
against
the
number
i
d
tell
those
story
and
others
like
them
involve
everyone
in
the
class
in
my
ethical
and
leadership
quandary
then
i
d
call
on
someone
i
knew
have
just
be
in
a
tight
spot
to
discus
their
dilemma
the
floodgate
would
open
these
personal
discussion
be
some
of
the
richest
moment
we
have
at
crotonville
everyone
in
the
room
left
know
they
weren
t
alone
in
face
a
tough
call
in
the
first
level
course
i
d
start
off
by
ask
each
student
to
introduce
him
or
herself
i
d
spend
the
first
of
four
hour
just
do
this
i
try
to
strike
a
personal
connection
and
get
them
talk
for
a
minute
then
i
d
listen
to
presentation
on
their
like
and
dislike
about
the
company
and
what
they
would
change
if
they
be
in
my
shoe
crotonville
also
become
an
invaluable
place
to
clarify
any
confusion
our
initiative
be
create
in
the
organization
during
our
early
globalization
effort
people
be
ask
do
i
have
to
have
a
global
assignment
to
get
ahead
in
ge
of
course
not
i
d
say
but
your
chance
be
well
if
you
have
one
it
s
a
growth
experience
for
you
and
your
family
when
i
be
try
to
drive
our
shift
toward
service
class
participant
inevitably
ask
be
we
get
out
of
product
you
can
t
have
service
if
you
don
t
have
great
product
during
the
early
phase
of
our
six
sigma
quality
program
people
begin
ask
do
everybody
have
to
have
six
sigma
black
belt
training
to
get
ahead
in
ge
it
would
sure
help
i
reply
it
s
another
way
to
get
out
of
the
pile
and
when
we
launch
our
e
business
initiative
in
people
ask
whether
they
need
to
have
black
belt
anymore
some
of
them
be
so
eager
to
get
into
our
digitization
effort
that
they
didn
t
want
to
invest
two
year
in
six
sigma
training
i
d
reply
six
sigma
be
fundamental
education
another
differentiator
for
you
like
get
your
undergraduate
or
graduate
degree
digitization
be
just
one
tool
like
reading
or
write
everyone
will
have
it
after
every
class
i
usually
join
the
group
for
a
drink
in
our
recreation
center
before
take
off
for
headquarters
three
day
later
i
d
get
a
response
on
what
the
class
thought
on
three
question
what
do
you
find
about
the
presentation
that
be
constructive
and
clarify
what
do
you
find
confuse
and
troublesome
what
do
you
regard
as
your
most
important
take
away
the
comment
be
helpful
in
the
early
s
many
manager
left
confuse
and
troubled
i
take
all
the
review
seriously
try
to
bring
what
i
learn
from
their
response
into
the
next
class
i
read
every
comment
religiously
if
someone
sign
their
name
to
the
comment
i
d
sometimes
drop
them
a
quick
note
especially
if
i
d
create
a
misunderstand
by
the
mid
s
the
response
be
show
more
buy
in
after
hearing
the
strategy
and
the
vision
they
say
they
understood
it
well
what
they
heard
me
say
however
often
didn
t
jibe
with
what
their
boss
told
them
back
home
some
of
their
manager
have
be
prepping
them
for
the
session
by
say
that
what
they
would
hear
be
nonsense
deep
in
the
organization
pocket
of
resistance
be
still
alive
and
well
by
some
ge
employee
be
go
to
crotonville
for
various
course
every
year
yet
i
be
still
get
the
same
question
and
comment
over
and
over
again
people
be
say
that
the
message
and
vision
make
sense
but
they
often
add
that
s
not
the
way
it
be
back
home
damn
it
after
all
this
effort
the
message
still
wasn
t
get
all
the
way
through
one
afternoon
in
september
of
i
left
crotonville
frustrate
as
hell
i
have
just
about
have
it
that
day
have
produce
a
particularly
good
session
the
people
in
class
pour
out
their
frustration
about
try
to
change
their
business
i
knew
we
have
to
get
the
candor
and
passion
out
of
the
classroom
and
back
into
the
workplace
on
the
helicopter
ride
back
to
fairfield
jim
baughman
have
to
listen
to
me
vent
my
frustration
why
can
t
we
get
the
crotonville
openness
everywhere
i
didn
t
let
him
answer
the
question
i
knew
what
we
have
to
do
we
have
to
re
create
the
crotonville
pit
all
over
the
company
by
the
time
we
land
in
fairfield
we
have
the
answer
we
have
sketch
out
an
idea
that
when
fully
developed
over
the
next
few
week
would
become
a
ge
game
changer
call
work
out
the
crotonville
pit
be
work
because
people
felt
free
to
speak
while
i
be
technically
their
bos
i
have
little
or
no
impact
on
their
personal
career
especially
in
the
low
level
class
we
have
to
create
an
atmosphere
like
this
in
all
the
business
obviously
we
couldn
t
have
the
business
leader
run
these
session
because
they
would
know
everyone
in
the
room
the
dynamic
would
change
and
openness
would
be
more
difficult
we
come
up
with
the
idea
of
bring
in
train
facilitator
from
the
outside
mainly
university
professor
who
have
no
ax
to
grind
work
out
be
pattern
after
the
traditional
new
england
town
meeting
group
of
to
employee
be
invite
to
share
their
view
on
the
business
and
the
bureaucracy
that
get
in
their
way
particularly
approval
report
meeting
and
measurement
work
out
meant
just
what
the
word
imply
take
unnecessary
work
out
of
the
system
toward
this
end
we
expect
every
business
to
hold
hundred
of
work
out
this
be
go
to
be
a
massive
program
a
typical
work
out
last
two
to
three
day
it
start
with
a
presentation
by
the
manager
who
might
issue
a
challenge
or
outline
a
broad
agenda
and
then
leave
without
the
bos
present
and
with
a
facilitator
to
grease
the
discussion
employee
be
ask
to
list
problem
debate
solution
and
be
prepared
to
sell
their
idea
when
the
bos
return
the
neutral
outside
facilitator

of
two
dozen
academic
draft
by
jim
baughman
make
the
exchange
between
the
employee
and
the
manager
go
a
lot
easy
the
real
novelty
here
be
that
we
insist
manager
make
on
the
spot
decision
on
each
proposal
they
be
expect
to
give
a
yes
or
no
decision
on
at
least
percent
of
the
idea
if
a
decision
couldn
t
be
make
on
the
spot
there
be
an
agree
upon
date
for
a
decision
no
one
could
bury
the
proposal
as
people
saw
their
idea
get
instantly
implement
it
become
a
true
bureaucracy
buster
i
ll
never

attend
one
of

a
part
of
the
process
that
occur
on
the
second
floor
of
the
assembly
line
suddenly
the
chief
steward
of
the
plant
jumped
up
to
interrupt
him
that
s
b
he

magic
marker
and
begin
scribble
on
the
easel
in
the
front
of
the
room
before
you

up
everywhere
hundred
of
story
like
this
one
spread
throughout
the
organization
by
mid
more
than
ge
employee
have
be
involve
in
work
out
the
rationale
for
the
program
could
be
sum
up
by
the
comment
make
by
a
middle
age
appliance
worker
for
year
he
say
you
ve
paid
for
my
hand
when
you
could
have
have
my
brain
as
well
for
nothing
work
out
confirm
what
we
already
knew
that
the
people
closest
to
the
work
know
it
best
almost
every
good
thing
that
have
happen
in
the
company
can
be
trace
to
the
liberation
of
some
business
some
team
or
an
individual
work
out
liberate
many
of
them
from
a
simple
idea
hatch
at
crotonville
work
out
help
us
to
create
a
culture
where
everyone
begin
play
a
part
where
everyone
s
idea
begin
to
count
and
where
leader
lead
rather
than
control
they
coached
rather
than
preach
and
they
get
well
result
ultimately
crotonville
become
a
boil
pot
for
learn
our
most
valuable
teacher
there
become
the
student
themselves
through
their
classwork
and
field
study
they
taught
the
company
s
leader
and
one
another
that
there
often
be
a
well
way
crotonville
become
in
fact
our
most
important
factory
and
soon
we
would
make
it
even
more
productive
with
an
idea
that
would
change
the
organization
forever

a
great
place
i
d
never
experienced
a
caribbean
christmas
it
be
different
see
santa
claus
pop
out
of
a
submarine
while
i
be
lie
on
the
beach
may
have
be
just
the
jolt
i
need
that
day
i
get
the
idea
that
would
ob
me
for
the
next
decade
poor
jane
i
be
on
a
roll
i
kept
talk
about
all
the
boundary
that
work
out
be
break
down
suddenly
the
word
boundaryless
popped
into
my
head
it
really
sum
up
my
dream
for
the
company
i
couldn
t
get
the
word
out
of
my
mind
silly
as
it
sound
it
felt
like
a
scientific
breakthrough
a
week
later
all
wound
up
with
my
new
obsession
i
go
directly
from
barbados
to
our
operating
manager
meeting
in
boca
raton
boca
be
the
two
day
session
that
i
always
close
by
outline
our
challenge
for
the
come
year
this
time
the
last
five
page
of
scribble
be
all
about
boundaryless
behavior
i
think
the
remark
sound
well
than
they
be
jot
down
see
page
below
as
usual
i
be
a
bit
over
the
top
i
have
learn
that
for
any
big
idea
you
have
to
sell
sell
and
sell
to
move
the
needle
at
all
in
my
closing
remark
i
call
boundaryless
the
idea
that
will
make
the
difference
between
ge
and
the
rest
of
world
business
in
the
s
i
be
not
bashful
about
this
vision
the
boundaryless
company
i
saw
would
remove
all
the
barrier
among
the
function
engineering
manufacturing
marketing
and
the
rest
it
would
recognize
no
distinction
between
domestic
and
foreign
operation
it
meant
we
d
be
as
comfortable
do
business
in
budapest
and
seoul
as
we
be
in
louisville
and
schenectady
a
boundaryless
company
would
knock
down
external
wall
make
supplier
and
customer
part
of
a
single
process
it
would
eliminate
the
less
visible
wall
of
race
and
gender
it
would
put
the
team
ahead
of
individual
ego
for
our
entire
history
we
have
reward
the
inventor
or
the
person
who
come
up
with
a
good
idea
boundaryless
would
make
hero
out
of
people
who
recognize
and
developed
a
good
idea
not
just
those
who
come
up
with
one
as
a
result
leader
be
encourage
to
share
the
credit
for
idea
with
their
team
rather
than
take
full
credit
themselves
it
make
a
huge
difference
in
how
we
all
related
to
one
another
boundaryless
would
also
open
us
up
to
the
best
idea
and
practice
from
other
company
we
have
already
make
a
dent
in
kill
nih
not
invent
here
by
use
idea
like
kanban
manufacturing
from
japan
a
precursor
to
just
in
time
inventory
boundaryless
be
much
broader
it
would
make
each
of
us
wake
up
with
the
goal
of
find
a
well
way
every
day
it
be
a
phrase
that
become
a
slogan
put
up
on
the
wall
of
ge
factory
and
office
around
the
world
the
idea
give
new
momentum
to
the
learn
culture
work
out
have
start
by
we
be
already
get
some
share
across
business
boundaryless
just
give
us
a
word
to
express
it
and
make
it
part
of
our
everyday
life
we
rant
about
it
at
every
meeting
we
d
use
it
to
lightheartedly
embarrass
someone
who
wasn
t
share
an
idea
or
a
manager
who
wouldn
t
give
up
a
good
employee
to
another
business
someone
would
joke
that
s
real
boundaryless
behavior
they
get
the
message
by
in
our
session
c
human
resource
review
we
begin
grade
manager
on
their
degree
of
boundaryless
behavior
every
manager
in
the
company
be
rat
high
medium
or
low
base
on
their
peer
evaluation
and
later
the
view
of
their
supervisor
an
empty
circle
next
to
a
person
s
name
meant
they
have
to
change
fast
or
leave
everyone
get
feedback
on
where
they
stood
on
this
value
and
soon
everyone
knew
how
important
this
value
have
become
in
at
boca
again
i
do
something
that
make
our
value
include
be
boundaryless
really
come
to
life
we
discuss
the
different
kind
of
manager
base
on
their
ability
to
deliver
number
while
maintain
ge
value
i
described
four
type
of
manager
the
type
manager
delivers
on
commitment
financial
or
otherwise
and
share
the
value
his
or
her
future
be
an
easy
call
type
be
one
who
doesn
t
meet
commitment
and
doesn
t
share
our
value
not
as
pleasant
a
call
but
just
as
easy
as
type
type
miss
commitment
but
share
all
our
value
we
believe
in
give
them
a
second
or
perhaps
third
chance
preferably
in
a
different
environment
i
ve
see
some
real
comeback
type
be
the
most
difficult
for
all
of
us
to
deal
with
that
s
the
person
who
delivers
on
all
the
commitment
make
the
number
but
doesn
t
share
the
value
the
manager
who
typically
force
performance
out
of
people
rather
than
inspires
it
the
autocrat
the
tyrant
too
often
we
ve
all
look
the
other
way
at
these
bully
i
know
i
have
maybe
in
other
time
this
be
okay
but
in
an
organization
where
boundaryless
behavior
be
to
become
a
define
value
we
could
not
afford
the
type
manager
in
front
of
people
at
boca
without
use
name
i
explain
why
four
corporate
officer
be
ask
to
leave
during
the
prior
year
even
though
they
deliver
good
financial
performance
when
i
want
to
make
a
point
i
d
never
use
the
traditional
left
for
personal
reason
excuse
look
around
you
i
say
there
be
five
few
officer
here
than
there
be
last
year
one
be
remove
for
the
number
and
four
be
ask
to
go
because
they
didn
t
practice
our
value
i
explain
that
one
officer
be
remove
because
he
wasn
t
a
believer
in
work
out
or
idea
share
he
didn
t
get
what
boundaryless
meant
another
couldn
t
build
a
strong
team
while
a
third
officer
wouldn
t
empower
the
team
he
have
and
the
fourth
never
get
the
idea
of
globalization
the
reason
for
take
so
much
time
on
this
be
that
it
s
important
we
can
t
be
talk
about
reality
candor
globalization
boundaryless
speed
and
empowerment
and
have
people
who
don
t
embrace
these
value
every
one
of
us
must
walk
the
talk
you
could
hear
a
pin
drop
when
i
use
the
lack
of
boundaryless
behavior
as
one
of
the
principal
reason
for
a
manager
s
leave
the
idea
really
hit
home
you
could
feel
the
audience
think
this
be
for
real
they
mean
it
suddenly
find
a
well
way
every
day
wasn
t
just
a
slogan
it
be
the
essence
of
boundaryless
behavior
and
it
define
our
expectation
after
year
of
work
on
the
hardware
of
ge
the
restructuring
acquisition
and
disposition
boundaryless
be
at
the
heart
of
develop
what
we
would
later
call
the
social
architecture
of
the
company
these
be
the
core
value
of
ge
that
would
set
us
apart
we
have
to
insist
on
excellence
and
be
intolerant
of
bureaucracy
we
have
to
search
for
and
apply
the
best
idea
regardless
of
their
source
we
have
to
prize
global
intellectual
capital
and
the
people
who
provide
it
we
have
to
be
passionately
focus
on
drive
customer
success
at
the
same
time
over
employee
work
at
crotonville
over
a
three
year
period
to
hammer
out
a
value
statement
we
consider
those
value
so
important
that
we
put
them
on
laminate
card
that
we
all
carry
in
short
we
want
to
create
a
learn
culture
that
would
make
ge
much
more
than
the
sum
of
its
part
so
much
more
than
a
conglomerate
from
my
first
day
as
ceo
i
knew
we
be
more
than
a
portfolio
of
disconnect
business
early
on
i
come
up
with
a
term
integrate
diversity
in
an
effort
to
communicate
the
advantage
ge
get
from
share
idea
across
business
that
term
didn
t
work
it
be
businessese
it
wasn
t
personal
or
human
enough
amaze
what
a
couple
of
word
can
or
can
t
do
of
course
a
word
or
a
phrase
wasn
t
enough
we
have
to
back
it
up
with
a
system
that
would
make
it
happen
primarily
we
have
to
change
how
we
paid
our
best
the
prior
system
make
the
annual
bonus
the
big
reward
it
be
base
on
how
your
individual
business
perform
if
you
do
well
even
if
the
overall
company
do
poorly
you
get
yours
i
couldn
t
stand
the
idea
of
the
company
sinking
and
some
business
make
it
to
shore
the
compensation
system
didn
t
support
the
behavior
i
want
if
we
want
every
business
to
be
a
laboratory
for
idea
we
need
to
pay
people
in
a
way
that
would
reinforce
the
concept
our
compensation
system
be
work
against
us
the
day
i
be
announce
as
chairman
in
i
have
option
on
share
of
ge
stock
and
have
realize
gain
of
less
than
after
year
of
get
option
grant
imagine
how
little
the
other
officer
have
if
someone
be
make
in
salary
then
and
their
business
unit
have
a
great
year
their
bonus
could
be
percent
of
their
base
pay
or
the
individual
bonus
far
outweigh
the
value
of
the
stock
option
grant
i
want
the
overall
company
s
result
and
stock
price
to
mean
more
to
people
than
the
result
of
their
individual
business
i
go
to
the
board
in
september
and
get
support
to
make
a
change
we
increase
the
size
and
frequency
of
option
grant
when
the
stock
market
cooperate
in
the
early
s
people
saw
their
gain
from
the
company
s
performance
overwhelm
anything
they
ever
get
from
their
business
that
reinforce
idea
share
among
the
top
people
i
should
have
do
more
faster
it
take
me
until
to
broaden
the
plan
in
that
year
instead

our
best

change
in
the
option

and
a
healthy

and
the
compensation

give
us
momentum
for
the
launch
of

still
it
be
only
one
piece
of
the
puzzle
we
need
more
we
need
a
way
to
surface
the
best
idea
and
move
them
quickly
through
the
organization
that
s
what
our
operating
system
come
to
be
like
all

we
always
have
a
series
of
plan
meeting
and
review
throughout
the
year
what
boundaryless
do
be
link
the
meeting
to
create
an
operating
system
that
be
built
on
continuous
idea
flow
i
saw
every
meeting
as
a
building
block
for
idea
each
one
built
upon
the
other
until
the
idea
become
big
and
well

when
santa
popped
out
of
the
sub
in
barbados
only
four
month
after
my
boca
speech
i
be
in
a
session
c
review
with
lloyd
trotter
then
a
vp
of
manufacturing
for
our
electrical
product
business
lloyd
told
us
about
a
matrix
he
have
create
that
help
to
capture
the
best
practice
from
each
of
his
factory
lloyd
first
come
up
with
measurement
and
process
common
to
all
the
plant
then
he
ask
the
manager
of
each
factory
to
rate
themselves
on
each
one
from
inventory
turn
to
order
fulfillment
on
one
axis
of
the
matrix
be
their
evaluation
a
score
of
with
be
best
on
the
other
axis
be
the
process
or
procedure
when
he
gather
his
plant
manager
together
for
a
staff
meeting
he
ask
everyone
who
rat
themselves
best
to
explain
how
they
get
there
when
the
s
be
give
somewhat
lame
explanation
as
to
why
they
have
rat
themselves
so
highly
it
become
pretty
clear
to
lloyd
that
his
first
try
at
best
practice
wasn
t
take
very
seriously
there
be
a
lot
of
embarrass
people
it
be
during
the
next
go
round
that
the
real
learn
begin
for
instance
a
salisbury
north
carolina
plant
have
inventory
turn
of
more
than
per
year
the
average
for
the
rest
of
the
plant
be
it
didn
t
take
long
for
everyone
to
go
to
salisbury
to
find
out
what
they
be
do
right
the
self
evaluation
quickly
give
way
to
quantitative
measurement
lloyd
have
a
habit
of
draw
circle
around
the
best
practice
and
rectangle
around
the
bad
quickly
these
mark
be
call
halo
and
coffin
appropriate
recognition
for
their
status
in
lloyd
s
mind
lloyd
s
highly
visible
matrix
get
everyone
s
attention
no
one
want
to
be
last
so
people
scramble
to
visit
the
best
plant
to
learn
how
to
make
theirs
well
how
do
we
know
it
work
well
in
a
slow
growth
market
lloyd
s
operating
margin
go
from
percent
in
to
percent
in
in
they
hit
percent
i
talk
up
lloyd
s
matrix
everywhere
we
go
and
anywhere
we
have
common
activity
the
trotter
matrix
become
a
hot
tool
all
around
ge
i
ve
never
see
a
case
from
a
comparison
of
sale
region
to
an
analysis
of
business
by
business
source
saving
when
the
matrix
fail
to
generate
a
significant
improvement
in
performance
sound
obvious
but
i
found
it
wasn
t
be
do
everywhere
whenever
we
do
an
acquisition
we
would
often
see
people
operating
in
silo
in
during
a
honeywell
integration
meeting
we
met
the
manager
of
a
sensor
plant
in
freeport
illinois
operating
at
a
seven
sigma
quality
level
frankly
i
be
blown
away
i
d
never
see
a
plant
operating
with
that
kind
of
efficiency
the
plant
didn
t
have
a
single
defect
in
any
of
the
million
component
it
ship
in
i
ask
the
honeywell
people
in
the
room
how
many
of
them
have
visit
that
factory
not
one
person
raise
a
hand
in
ge
that
poor
plant
manager
would
have
be
inundate
with
ge
visitor
like
lloyd
in
he
would
have
be
on
the
boca
agenda
every
time
we
get
an
idea
we
flog
it
some
we
parade
out
too
early
a
couple
didn
t
pan
out
but
when
we
saw
an
idea
we
like
it
go
on
stage
at
boca
i
sometimes
fell
in
love
too
fast
but
if
the
idea
weren
t
work
i
could
fall
out
of
love
just
as
fast
in
the
early
s
the
idea
be
come
fast
and
furious
from
everywhere
include
from
outside
the
company
i
picked
up
a
good
one
in
a
visit
with
sam
walton
the
founder
of
wal
mart
in
october
sam
ask
me
to

stage
with

manager
i
first
met
sam
in

of
his
regional
manager
meeting
when
he
agree
to
link
his
cash
register
data
with
our
light
business
a
perfect
example
of
boundaryless
that
way
we
could
replace
the
light
bulb
on
wal
mart
shelf
rapidly
without
a
lot
of
paperwork
in
i
flew
down
to
arkansas
and
sam
met
me
at
the

be
visibly
ill
with
an
iv
bag

chemotherapy
drug
before
his
management
group
sam
have
me
go
through
my
tale
on
how
tough
it
be
to
get
bureaucracy
out
of
a
company
and
then
he
take
over
he
challenged
his
manager
to
never
let
bureaucracy
creep
into
and
take
over
wal
mart
we
spent
a
couple
of
hour
have
a
ball
exchange
idea
with
his
team
about
the
evil
of
bureaucracy
on
the
way
back
to
the
airport
sam
take
me
to
a
wal
mart
store
we
be

there
be
no
taker
sadly
only
six
month
later
sam
die
care
to
the
end
about
the
company
he
built
during
the
visit
i
learn
about
a
wal
mart
idea
that
i
really
like
every
monday
wal
mart

regional
manager
in
bentonville
would
fly

regional
manager
found
a
store
or
region
sell
out
of
a
hot
sell
product
headquarters
would
shift
inventory
from
other
store
to
fill
the
gap
it
be
a
weekly
pulse
of
the
customer
at
the
most
basic
level
the
aisle
of

sophisticated
computer
and
inventory
control
system
at

would
sit
in
the
front
of
the
room
one
by

they
d
relate
their
experience
in
the
field
the
high
tech
team
responsible
for
the
information
system
would
be
there
to
respond
immediately
to
the
need
of
the
regional

the

i
be

they
have
an
excess
of
antifreeze
in
one
region
and
a
shortage
in
another
they
fix
it
on
the
spot
this
match
of
high
touch
from
the
field
and
high
tech
at
headquarters
be
one
of
the
thing
that
sam
and
president
david
glass
use
to
keep
wal
mart
s
small
company
responsiveness
as
it
grow
by
leap
and
bound
i
come
back
from
bentonville
excite
about
how
we
could
use
this
system
sam
let
me
send
several
ge
business
team
to
his
place
so
they
could
sit
in

the
friday
session
once
our
people
saw
it
they
love
it
the
business
leader
grabbed
the
idea
and
adapt
it
to
the
ge
culture
they
begin
hold
weekly
telephone
call
with
their
sale
team
in
the
field
besides
the
ceo
the
business
s
top
marketing
sale
and
manufacturing
manager
would
be
on
the
call
so
that
they
could
respond
immediately
to
an
issue
whether
it
be
delivery
price
or
product
quality
we
call
it
quick
market
intelligence
qmi
and
follow
its
progress
at
every
quarterly
cec
meeting
it
be
a
big
hit
it
brought
all
our
leadership
closer
to
the
customer
on
the
spot
we
be
solve
product
availability
issue
and
find
quality
problem
that
might
not
have
show
up
until
much
later
our
business
leader
also
brought
their
own
great
idea
to
the
cec
in
bob
nardelli
ceo
of
ge
transportation
described
a
new
source
of
great
talent
with
its
headquarters
in
erie
pennsylvania
the
transportation
business
have
struggle
for
year
to
attract
the
best
people
bob
say
he
found
an
endless
supply
of
talent
in
junior
military
officer
jmos
most
be
graduate
of
u
s
military
academy
who
have
put
in

of
military
time
they
be
hardworking
smart
and
intense
have
leadership
experience
and
be
surprisingly
flexible
because
they
have
serve
time
in
some
of
the
toughest
place
in
the
world
nardelli
s
idea
spread
like
wildfire
after
we
have
former
jmos
on
staff
we
ask
them
to
come
to
fairfield
for
a
day
we
be
all
so
impressed
with
the
quality
of
what
we
saw
that
we
put
a
plan
in
place
to
hire
of
them
every
year
we
use
our
session
c
to
measure
the
success
each

hire
and
promote
ex

than

i
know
this
sound
like
no
good

unpunished
you
re
the
guy
who
get
everybody
start
you
re

you
have
the
low

a
week
later
after

with
his
peer
he
sent
me
an
e

with
a
new

he
should
be
able
to
beat
it
he
do
the
first
person
with
the
new
idea
have
a
pretty
easy
time
that
person
s
goal
set
the
bar
for
the
next
and
the
cycle
begin
again
gary

down
percent
a
year
while
our
cost
for
purchase
good
be
still
rise
he
illustrate
the
trend
in
a
simple
view
graph
call
the
monster
chart
it
be
a
monster
because
the
gap
between
our
sell
price
and
purchase
cost
be
narrow
so
be
profit
if
we
didn
t
do
something
about
the
monster
it
would
eat
us
alive
gary

analysis
with

for

meeting
to
share
their
best
idea
with
a
vice
chairman
or
me
business

they
have
to
send
their
very
best
people
if
they
didn
t
we
d
see
new
face
the
next
time
once
we
have
well
people
we
have
well
idea
this
focus
kill
the
monster
and
the
chart
of
all
the
idea
that
have
be
driven
through
the
operating
system
over
the
year
however
one
of
the
best
come
from
a
crotonville
business
management
course
bmc
it
s
a
great
example
of
how
we
directly
link
crotonville
to
all
the
company
s
learn
in
bob
nelson
and
his
financial
team
come
up
with
an
analysis
that
show
what
ge
have
to
do
to
become
a
billion
company
with
billion
in
profit
before
the
end
of

at
the
time
ge
s
sale
be
billion
with
billion
in
after
tax
earnings
i
like
the
goal
and
in
february
challenged
a
management
class
at
crotonville
to
give
us
some
new
idea
on
how
to
reach
the
billion
target
part
of
the
class
assess
what
ge
do
well
by
interview
the
senior
leader
at
of
our
business
another
group
visit
key
customer
to
hear
what
they
thought
of
our
growth
prospect
a
third
team
visit
executive
of
high
growth
company
to
see
what
we
could
learn
from
them
ironically
though
the
single
best
idea
didn
t
come
from
a
company
at
all
it
come
from
the
u
s
army
war
college
in
carlisle
pennsylvania
tim
richards
who
ran
the
four
week
bmc
class
for
us
at
crotonville
draft
the
plan
to
merge
our
class
with
a
war
college
class
of
colonel
he
read
that
the
army
be
try
to
radically
change
its
mission
from
a
cold
war
model
to
one
that
give
it
the
flexibility
to
mount
dozen
of
small
remote
battle
around
the
world
tim
thought
there
might
be
a
fit
it
be
one
of
those
harebrained
idea
that
happen
to
work
he
say
during
the
four
day
visit
an
army
colonel
told
the
class
that
our
strategy
of
be
no
or
no
in
a
marketplace
might
be
hold
us
back
and
stifle
growth
opportunity
he
say
ge
have
plenty
of
intelligent
leader
who
would
always
be
clever
enough
to
define
their
market
so
narrowly
that
they
could
safely
remain
no
or
no
ordinarily
this
class
would
have
report
its
finding
in
crotonville
to
our
executive
council
at
its
june
meeting
i
be
recover
from
open
heart
surgery
at
the
time
so
i
didn
t
hear
the
presentation
until
late
september
when
seven
member
of
the
class
come
to
fairfield
the
colonel
s
insight
about
how
to
redefine
market
share
come
in
one
of
eight
chart
on
it
the
team
recommend
a
mind
set
change
they
say
we
need
to
redefine
all
our
current
market
so
that
no
business
would
have
more
than
a
percent
market
share
that
would
force
everyone
to
think
differently
about
their
business
this
be
the
ultimate
mind
expand
exercise
as
well
as
a
market
expand
breakthrough
for
nearly
year
i
have
be
hammer
away
on
the
need
to
be
no
or
no
in
every
market
now
this
class
be
tell
me
that
one
of
my
most
fundamental
idea
be
hold
us
back
i
told
them
i
love
your
idea
frankly
i
also
love
the
self
confidence
they
show
in
shove
it
in
my
face
this
be
boundaryless
behavior
at
its
best
have
a
high
share
of
a
narrowly
define
market
may
have
felt
good
and
look
great
on
a
chart
but
the
class
be
right
we
be
get
boxed
in
with
the
exist
strategy
which
prove
that
any
bureaucracy
would
beat
anything
you
put
in
i
take
their
idea
and
put
it
into
my
closing
remark
a
couple
of
week
later
at
our
annual
officer
meeting
in
early
october
see
page
below
do
this
have
to
open
your
eye
to
growth
opportunity
perhaps
our
stress
on
no
and
no
or
fix
sell
or
close
now
limit
our
think
and
hurt
our
growth
mind
set
i
ask
each
of
the
business
to
redefine
its
market
and
give
us
a
page
or
two
of
fresh
think
on
this
during
the
s
ii
operating
plan
in
november
use
this
wider
vision
of
our
market
change
our
growth
rate
it
reinforce
our
resolve
to
aggressively
expand
into
service
ge
go
from
a
market
definition
of
about
billion
in
to
well
over
trillion
today
provide
plenty
of
room
for
growth
in
medical
system
for
example
we
go
from
measure
our
share
of
the
diagnostic
image
market
to
measure
all
of
medical
diagnostics
include
all
equipment
service
radiological
technology
and
hospital
information
system
power
system
saw
its
service
business
mainly
in
supply
spare
and
do
repair
on
ge
technology
define
that
way
we
have
a
percent
share
of
a
billion
market
that
look
pretty
good
damn
good
by
redefine
the
market
to
include
total
power
plant
maintenance
power
system
have
only
a
percent
share
of
a
billion
market
if
you
continued
to
broaden
the
market
definition
to
include
fuel
power
inventory
asset
management
and
financial
service
you
could
play
in
a
marketplace
potentially
as
big
as
billion
our
share
of
that
be
just
to
percent
once
again
the
exercise
open
our
eye
and
fuel
our
ambition
over
the
next
five
year
we
double
our
top
line
growth
rate
at
ge
with
the
same
yet
newly
energize
portfolio
of
business
we
go
from
billion
in
revenue
in
to
billion
in
a
lot
of
thing
make
this
happen
but
this
new
mind
set
played
a
big
role
i
love
the
fact
that
we
give
a
crotonville
class
a
challenge
and
it
go
out
and
found
a
great
idea
in
the
head
of
an
army
colonel
in
pennsylvania
this
be
boundaryless
behavior
at
its
best
our
people
really
be
find
a
well
way
and
it
be
make
the
difference
between
ge
and
the
rest
of
the
business
world
you
could
measure
it
by
the
result
our
operating
margin
go
from
percent
in
to
a
record
percent
in
in
our
industrial
business
our
work
capital
turn
jumped
from
to
a
record
in
our
revenue
hit
billion
with
nearly
billion
of
net
income
boundaryless
be
help
a
lot
of
us
ordinary
people
do
some
extraordinary
thing

deep
dive
there
be
advantage
to
be
the
chairman
one
of
my
favorite
perk
be
pick
out
an
issue
and
do
what
i
call
a
deep
dive
it
s
spot
a
challenge
where
you
think
you
can
make
a
difference
one
that
look
like
it
would
be
fun
and
then
throw
the
weight
of
your
position
behind
it
some
might
justifiably
call
it
meddling
i
ve
often

about
everywhere

shot

bangladesh
native
and
a
guy
you
could
feel
have
ultrasound
run
through
his
vein
he
have
work
for
a

of
the
total
business
i
become
his
big
cheerleader
he

great
people
many
from
the
industry
and
the
rest

and
i
get
as

fun
out
of
his
success
as
he
do
another
deep
dive
in
medical

to
do
with

loudly
about
our

less
than
half
of
what
compete
tube
be
get
our
ct
system
be
so
good
it
obscure
what
could
become
the
achilles
heel
of
the
business
the

i
go
to
milwaukee

originally
plan
for
a
breakthrough
in
a
multibillion
dollar
industry

we
be
have
increase
success
but

a
long
way
to
go
finally
it
dawn
on
me
one
of
our
best
opportunity
to
differentiate
ge
from
japanese
company
be
to
focus
on
woman
woman
be
not
the
prefer

away
with

fine
though
the
illegal
trading
occur
before
ge
acquire
kidder
as
the
new
owner
we
get
saddle
with
the
legal
responsibility
after
the

we
begin
an
investigation
cooperate
fully
with
the

giuliani
it
show
that
there
be
lot
of

control
system
kidder
chairman
ralph
denunzio
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
scandal
but
it
be
clear
siegel
have
be
give
great
latitude
siegel
have
complete
run
of
the
equity
trading
floor
and
when
he
ask
the
risk
arb
to
make
a
trade
there
be
few
question
he
also
have
a
strange
habit
that
would
prove
to
be
part
of
his
downfall
he
kept
file
drawer
full
of
every
pink
telephone
message
slip
he
have
ever
receive
with
those
slip
and
kidder
s
detailed
phone
record
it
wasn
t
hard
to
establish
a
pattern
to
siegel
s
trading
giuliani
who
could
have
gotten
kidder
s
license
suspend
and
put
it
out
of
business
want
us
to
dismiss
much
of
the
senior
management
larry
bossidy
then
a
ge
vice
chairman
spent
a
couple
of
saturday
morning
with

negotiate
a
settlement
we
end
up
pay
fine
of

shut
down
kidder
s
risk
arbitrage
department
and
agree
to
put
in
well
control
and
procedure
while
all
that
be
go
on
ralph
denunzio
and
several
of
his
key
people
decide
to
leave
as
far
as
senior
management
be
concerned
this
left
us
with
little
more
than
the
furniture
wriston
warn
us
about
we
have
to
go
out
and
find
someone
who
could
build
back
the
trust
in
the
company
i
thought
si
cathcart
be
the
perfect
choice
he
be
savvy
honest
and
someone
i
trust
completely
si
have
be
on
the
ge
board
for
year
and
have
be
chairman
of
illinois
tool
work
when
i
call
him
in
chicago
and
told
him
about
my
idea
for
him
to
run
kidder
his
first
reaction
be
not
exactly
encourage
be
you
out
of
your
cotton
pickin
mind
he
ask
si
just
listen
i
ll
come
out
there
or
you
come
to
new
york
and
we
ll
have
a
good
discussion
about
it
a
few
day
later
in
march
larry
bossidy
and
i
met
him
in
a
small
italian
restaurant
in
new
york
si
show
up
with
a
sheet
of
yellow
legal
paper
with
reason
why
it
be
a
bad
idea
he
have
the
name
of
half
a
dozen
people
he
thought
would
be
well
for
the
job
i
look
over
his
note
and
crumple
them
up
si
we
ve
get
a
real
problem
and
you
re
the
only
guy
who
can
help
us
i
say
we
have
to
stabilize
thing
and
get
kidder
back
on
a
recovery
path
the
job
won
t
last
much
more
than
a
couple
of
year
you
and
corky
will
have
a
great
experience
in
new
york
you
re
too
young
to
retire
i
probably
say
a
lot
more
larry
and
i
really
need
him
si
finally
agree
to
go
home
and
talk
it
over
with
his
wife
corky
fortunately
she
be
excite
about
come
to
new
york
and
si
want
to
help
us
he
call
back
in
a
couple
of
day
and
agree
to
accept
the
job
on
may
the
day
after

one
of
the
problem

that
marty

another

who
take
the
money
and
cause
the

he
have
go
for

he
get
involve
with

be
beyond
anyone
s
comprehension
many
of
kidder

live
off

lose
it
sank
the
morale
in
the
rest
of
the
firm
as
si
dug
into
thing
he
found
that
it
wasn
t
very
pretty
when
he
ask
about
purchasing
a
question
someone
from
manufacturing
might
ask
no
one
knew
who
ran
the
department
or
where
it
be
the
bonus
system
be
ad
hoc
ralph
would
sit
down
with
the
top
people
in
the
firm
and
negotiate
one
by
one
their
year
end
bonus
frankly
the
bonus
number
knock
most
of
us
off
our
pin
when
we
saw
them
at
the
time
ge
s
total
bonus
pool
be
just
under
million
a
year
for
a

actually
high
at

for
a
company
that
be

only
one

of
our

si
remembers
that
on
the
day

would
clear
out
in
an

you
could
shoot

off
without

anyone
he
told
me
most
of
them
live
a
lifestyle
dependent
on
those
annual

it
be
a
different
world
from
what
si
or
i
knew
when
si
go
through
his
first
bonus
exercise
he
d
ask
everyone
at
kidder
to
give
him
a
list
of
his

her
accomplishment
for
the

inevitably
he
d
have
six
people
claim
credit
for

on
the
same
deal
every
one
of
them
believe
they
make
the
deal
happen
the
attitude
be
symbolic
of
the
problem
an
entitlement
culture
where
every
player
overvalue
themselves
where
god
parachute
us
be
a

the

down
the

just
get
thank
you
be
a
rare
expression
at
kidder
the
outrageous
pay
in
a
good
year
be
bad
enough
it
really
drove
me
nut
in
a
bad
year
that
s
when
the
argument
would
go
something
like
this
yeah
we
have
a
tough
year
but
you
ve
get
to
give
them
at
least
as
much
as
they
make
last
year
or
they
ll
go
across
the
street
this
place
have
the
perfect
we
win
you
lose
game
wall
street
have
to
have
be
well
when
the
company
be
private
and
the
partner
be
play
with
their
own
money
rather
than
other
people
s
money
the
concept
of
idea
share
and
team
play
be
completely
foreign
if
you
be
in
investment
banking
or
trading
and
your
group
have
a
good
year
it
didn
t
matter
what
happen
to
the
firm
overall
they
want
theirs
it
s
a
place
where
the
lifeboat
carry
millionaire
be
always
go
to
make
it
to
shore
while
the
titanic
sank
si
s
stay
at
kidder
be
tough
he
put
in
well
control
and
hire
some
good
people
five
month
into
the
job
in
october
the
stock
market
crashed
kidder
s
trading
profit
disappear
kidder
loss
hit
million
that
year
and
we
have
to
lay
off
about
of
the
people
on
the
payroll
it
be
obvious
to
all
of
us
that
the
cultural
difference
between
kidder
and
ge
be
so
great
that
i
should
have
listen
to
the
dissenter
on

apart
over

a
general
agreement
on
friday
of

over
a
weekend
if

up
with

it
didn
t
work
out
that
way
by
the
time

obvious
that
we
weren
t
go
to
get

deal
we
start
with
sandy
have
do
one
of
the
great
job
in
american
business
by
building
an
enterprise
through
great
acquisition
i
m
one
of
his
big
fan
but
it
be
a
challenge
negotiate
with
him
by
monday
the
deal
that
be
go
to
get
us
out
whole
have
be
scratch
clawed
and
picked
at
so
that
it
be
unrecognizable

spent
a
few
hour
that
even
try
to
get
it
back
to
where
it
have
be
after
a
couple
of
try
i
saw
it
be
hopeless
and
walk
down
the
hall
and
told
sandy
this
deal
be
not
for
us
he
smile
we
shook
hand
and
have
remain
friend
after
the
primerica

and
we
stayed
out
of

spotlight
profit

thing
appear
to
have
stabilize
or
at
least
i
thought

be
get

long
weekend
on
thursday

million
hole
in
a
trader

account
that
we
can
t
identify
and
he
s
disappear
i
didn
t
yet
know
who
joseph
jett
be
but
over
the
next
few
day
i
would
learn
more
than
i
care
to
about
him
carpenter
told
me
that
jett
who
ran
the
firm
s
government
bond
desk
have
make
a
series
of
fictitious
trade
to
inflate
his
own
bonus
the
phony
trade
artificially
boost
kidder
s
report
income
to
clean
up
the
mess
we
would
have
to
take
what
look
like
a
million
charge
against
our
first
quarter
earnings
the
news
from
mike
make
me
sick
million
i
couldn
t
believe
it
it
be
overwhelm
i
rush
to
the
bathroom
and
my
stomach
empty
in
awful
spasm
i
call
jane
who
be
already
wait
for
me
at
the
airport
told
her
what
i
knew
and
ask
her
to
come
home
instead
that
even
i
call
dennis
dammerman
who
be
teach
at
crotonville
when
he
come
to
the
phone
i
told
him
it
s
your
bad
nightmare
actually
it
be
my
own
bad
nightmare
i
have
make
a
terrible
mistake
in
buying
kidder
in
the
first
place
it
have
be
nothing
but
a
headache
and
an
embarrassment
from
the
start
and
now
this
dennis
go
down
to
kidder
s
office
with
a
team
of
eight
others
and
begin
work
around
the
clock
throughout
the
weekend
i
couldn
t
do
much
because
they
be
do
gritty
audit
work
check
account
balance
i
sat
by
the
phone
wait
for
update
from
dennis
if
i
have
go
down
there
i
probably
would
have
driven
them
nut
by
sunday
afternoon
i
have
to
see
it
for
myself
when
i
do
dennis
and
mike
say
they
be
sure
the
paper
entry
report
as
earnings
be
bogus
we
didn
t
have
all
the
fact
but
with
our
first
quarter
earnings
release
two
day
away
they
be
convince
we
have
a
million
noncash
write
off
to
deal
with
i
spent
hour
try
to
figure
out
exactly
how
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
could
disappear
overnight
it
didn
t
seem
possible
we
obviously
didn
t
know
enough
about
the
business
we
d
later
discover
that
jett
have
take
advantage
of
a
flaw
in
kidder
s
computer
system
that
sunday
even
i
call
of
ge
s
business
leader
to
deliver
the
bad
news
and
apologize
to
each
of
them
for
what
have
happen
i
felt
terrible
because
this
surprise
would
hit
the
stock
and
hurt
every
ge
employee
i
blame
myself
for
the
disaster
the
previous
year
when
jett
s
phantom
trade
account
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
profit
make
by
kidder
s
fix
income
group
jett
have
be
name
kidder
s
man
of
the
year
we
have
approve
mike
s
request
to
give
jett
a
million
cash
bonus
a
huge
award
even
for
kidder
normally
i
would
have
be
all
over
this
i
would
have
dug
into
how
one
person
could
be
so
successful
and
i
would
have
insist
on
meeting
him
i
didn
t
it
be
my
fault
because
i
didn
t
ask
the
why
question
i
normally
do
it
turn
out
that
kidder
be
as
culturally
distant
from
us
as
ge
appear
to
the
kidder
employee
the
response
of
our
business
leader
to
the
crisis
be
typical
of
the
ge
culture
even
though
the
book
have
close
on
the
quarter
many
immediately
offer
to
pitch
in
to
cover
the
kidder
gap
some
say
they
could
find
an
extra
million
million
and
even
million
from
their
business
to
offset
the
surprise
though
it
be
too
late
their
willingness
to
help
be
a
dramatic
contrast
to
the
excuse
i
have
be
hearing
from
the
kidder
people
instead
of
pitch
in
they
complain
about
how
this
disaster
be
go
to
affect
their
income
this
be
go
to
ruin
everything
one
say
our
bonus
be
down
the
toilet
how
will
we
keep
anyone
the
two
culture
and
their
difference
never
stood
out
so
clearly
in
my
mind
all
i
heard
be
i
didn
t
do
it
i
never
saw
it
i
never
met
with
him
i
didn
t
talk
to
him
no
one
seem
to
know
anyone
or
work
for
anyone
it
be
disgust
we
fire
jett
and
reassign
six
other
employee
that
night
when
i
get
home
later
i
told
jane
to
hunker
down
we
be
go
to
go
through
a
very
long
and
very
tough
ride

to
come
after

just
hang
on
the
coverage
be
brutal
again
i
go
from
prince
to
pig
in
the
space
of
a
year
we
end
up
in
the
right

of
the

a
new
moniker
for

that
you
can
hear
the
sound
of
the
pedestal
crack
a
cover
story
in
fortune
on
the
disaster
jumped
to
the
ridiculous
conclusion
that
the
scandal
at
kidder
be
brought
on
by
poor
ge
management
it
be
b
the
problem
at

of
what
go
wrong
at

be
now
with
davis

wardwell
with
enormous
help
from

he
found
that

of
jett
s
trade
be
a
big
part
of
the
problem

about

more
than

in
total
when
they
spoke

and
few
question
the
basis
for
their
success
we
weren
t
the
first
on
wall
street
to
learn
this
lesson
michael
milken
and
drexel
burnham

with
the
dominance
of

there

another
chance
at
the

the
point
that
at
ge
there
be
only
one
currency
ge
stock
below
there
be
different
amount
of
it

of
performance
but
everyone

be
tie
to
the
same
boat
one
culture
one
set
of
value
one

t
mean
however
one
style
every
ge

have
its

personality
for
the

pass
up

to
acquire
high

company
in
silicon

that
appear
to
be
a
good
strategic
fit
i
didn
t
want
to
pollute

with
the

that
be
develop
there
in
the
late

and

too
much
there
s
only
a
razor
s
edge
between
self
confidence
and
hubris
this
time
hubris
won
and
taught
me
a
lesson
i
d
never
forget

ge

of
the

me
as
one
of

told
her

look
at
and
torn
apart
literally

of

decision
although
all
the
proposal
have
be
rigorously
prescreened
before

hit
the
board
and
percent
of
the

we
still
send

for
another
look
when

make
us
the
owner
of
one
of
every
nine
car
in
thailand
to
pull
it
off
we
d
have
to
hire
extra
employee
in
the
country
to
underwrite
the
loan
collect
the
payment
and
manage
the
disposition
of
any
repossess
car
if
our
bid
be
accepted
we
d
take

for
percent
of
their

the
idea
have
come
from

business
in
thailand
the
next
morning
i

hardly
wait
to
get
to
that
one
when
i
turn
the
page
to
mark

proposal
i
frown
and
shook
my
head
how
could
we
possibly
hire
and
train
those
people
within
a
few
month

he
told
us
that
a
car
be
among
the
most
prize
possession
in
thailand
people
would
give
up
almost
everything
else
would
even
sleep
in
their
car
before
lose
them
for
nonpayment
of
a
loan
after
a
bit
of
banter
and
a
passionate
pitch
from
mark
we
bought
it
talk
about
change
your
mind
on
something
because
of
a
good
presentation
and
a
lot
of
passion
that
be
as
good
an
example
as
i
could
remember
i
walk
into
that
meeting
think
this
guy
s
outta
here
and
i
walk

over
the
next
three
year

do
well
and
the
company
built
an
ongoing
and
profitable
auto
business
in
thailand
the
transaction
lead
to
several
other
troubled
asset
purchase
in
asia
all
of
which
pan
out
well
for
ge
and
the
local
economy
mark
do
okay
too
he
become
president
of
ge
japan
the
small
thai
deal
be
one
of
thousand
that
show
how
ge
capital
once
a
popcorn
stand
have
become
one
of
the
most
valuable
part
of
ge
when
i
get
my
first
look
at
the
business
as
a
sector
executive
in
ge
capital
earn
million
on
billion
in
asset
in
ge
capital
make
billion
percent
of
ge
s
total
income
on
more
than
billion
in
asset
the
story
of
that
phenomenal
growth
have
be
told
many
time
and
in
many
way
what
most
people
outside
ge
don
t
know
be
the
incredible
intensity
ingenuity
and
entrepreneurship
that
go
on
behind
that
success
what
i
saw
in
be
immense
opportunity
not
just
the
benefit
you
get
on
a
balance
sheet
but
the
additional
leverage
you
get
by
put
together
two
raw
material
money
and
brain
since
i
have
be
involve
in
make
thing
all
my
life
pound
and
grind
it
out
to
make
a
nickel
i
couldn
t
believe
how
easy
this
appear
to
be
the
business
already
demonstrate
there
be
terrific
deal
with
good
collateral
that
could
produce
remarkable
return
on
equity
one
example
leveraged
lease
on
aircraft
could
earn
percent
or
well
return
i
fell
in
love
with
the
idea
of
meld
the
discipline
and
the
cash
flow
from
manufacturing
with
financial
ingenuity
to
build
a
great
business
of
course
we
need
the
right
people
to
make
this
happen
dennis
dammerman
would
always
remind
me
of
ben
franklin
s
old
adage
you
don
t
earn
interest
unless
you
collect
the
principal
fortunately
ge
capital
already
have
a
culture
that
insist
the
people
make
the
deal
stayed
with
them
from
womb
to
tomb
if
you
pitch
a
deal
you
d
well
make
damn
sure
it
be
go
to
work
or
else
you
d
well
be
able
to
take
over
the
asset
and
make
it
work
yourself
i
be
sure
the
opportunity
be
enormous
all
we
have
to
do
be
take
the
business
from
the
back
of
the
boat
to
the
front
well
people
and
a
great
financial
commitment
could
lead
to
huge
profit
happily
i
found
larry
bossidy
play
ping
pong
larry
along
with
ge
capital
ceo
john
stanger
be
the
guy
who
shook
the
place
up
from
our
game
in
hawaii
i
understood
his
frustration
in
ge
credit
be
an
orphan
business
outside
the
mainstream
of
the
company
plastic
too
have
be
an
orphan
business
during
my
earlier
day
there
larry
want
to
put

up
on
center
stage
a
former
auditor
he
come
from
deep
inside
ge
capital
and
he
knew
what
have
to
be
do
the
first
big
move
i
make
at
ge
capital
be
to
get
reg
s
approval
to
make
larry
chief
operating
officer
in

like
me

perfect
ge
executive
no
model
of
sartorial
splendor
larry
could
always
be
recognize
from
the
back
because
his
shirttail
flew
in
the
wind
his
idea
of
a
summer
suit
be
to
take
his
winter
suit
and
dress
it
up
with
a
white

and

one
of
our
top
ge
business
larry
and
i
thought
along
the
same
line
on
a
lot
of
thing
nowhere
more
so
than
on
the
people
front
not
only
do
we
have
session
c
to
look
closely
at
people
but
we
have
the
monthly
board
review
where
we
held
their
foot
to
the
flame
we
saw
people
under
real
fire
pitch
deal
every
month
and
in
some
case
explain
later
how
they
d
work
their
way
out
of
trouble
over
my
year
involvement
with
ge
capital
i
saw
the
growth
develop
in
four
distinct
stage
from
to
ceo
john
stanger
and
larry
bossidy
lure
some
of
the
best
people
we
have
into
ge
capital
in
the
second
half
of
the
s

by
then
a

that
global

and
bring
to

the
rigor
of
six
sigma
and
digitization
look
back
over
the
year
of
uninterrupted
double
digit
growth
it
almost
seem
surreal
i
can
still
remember
when
i
stew
and
stew
over
a
million
ge
capital
deal
compare
to
those
thai
auto
loan
and
the
billion
of
dollar
we
might
commit
in
a
board
meeting
today
this
be
insignificant
but
not
back
in
that
s
when
larry
bossidy
dennis
dammerman
and
i
be
at
a
ge
capital
management
meeting
in
puerto
rico
debate
whether
we
should
acquire
american
mortgage
insurance
from
baldwin
united
we
be
just
about
die
over
the
deal
then
ge
capital
s
large
ever
mull
over
how
much
to
bid
and
worry
about
every
potential
complication
it
s
a
matter
of
perspective
before
we
decide
to
buy
american
mortgage
in
dennis
be
literally
signing
every
insurance
policy
we
issue
because
his
insurance
business
be
so
small
that
he
couldn
t
justify
the
purchase
of
a
signature
machine
after
the
deal
we
not
only
could
buy
the
machine
we
become
a
major
player
in
the
business
a
year
later
in
we
topped
the
little
million
deal
with
our
billion
acquisition
of
employer
reinsurance
corp
erc
john
stanger
and
dennis
dammerman
first
look
at
erc
one
of
the
three
large
property
and
casualty
reinsurance
company
in
the
united
state
in
the
insurer
ask
us
to
be
a
white
knight
to
fend
off
an
unwanted
bid
from
connecticut
general
insurance
at
the
time
our
insurance
asset
be
pretty
small
erc
prefer
us
as
a
parent
over
connecticut
general
which
obviously
be
a
big
player
in
the
industry
but
erc
go
with
their
definition
of
a
perfect
white
knight
a
company
that
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
insurance
getty
oil
in
one
of
the
most
notorious
deal
of
the
decade
getty
be
eventually
acquire
by
texaco
which
have
little
use
for
a
reinsurance
company
with
the
background
work
do
year
earlier
we
be
able
to
move
quickly
to
bring
erc
into
the
fold
i
negotiate
the
final
detail
of
the
billion
deal
with
texaco
ceo
john
mckinley
we
be
still
puny
operator
in
those
day
when
the
erc
team
come
to
fairfield
for
sunday
night
dinner
after
the
deal

go
to
fall
short
of
the
annual
earnings
forecast
assume
in
the
transaction
i
immediately
want
a
discount
on
the
price
my
friend
john
weinberg
of
goldman
sachs
have
represent
us
in
the
acquisition
i
phone
him
at
augusta
pull
him
off
the
golf
course
and
rant
about
the
earnings
shortfall
i
told
him
to
call
mckinley
to
get
an
adjustment
on
the
price
fortunately
mckinley
be
a
gentleman
accepted
the
new
number
and
give
us
a
million
discount
we
end
up
pay
billion
it
make
me
feel
a
little
embarrass
today
to
have
do
that
but
i
be
relatively
new
in
the
job
and
probably
a
bit
too
competitive
for
my
own
good
the
erc
acquisition
be
a
big
leap
forward
we
have
a
great
run
in

grow
net
income
from
million
in
to
a
peak
of
million
in
until
tough

one
we

but
i
also
knew
he
be
one
of
the
savviest
investor
around
i
should
have
follow
my
instinct
and
walk
away
when
billboard
use
hit
bottom
in
the
late
s
we
take
ownership
of
the

a
modest
gain
on
its

valiant
effort
of
a
new

go
through
hell

some
upside
if
we
hit
certain
earnings
target
to
get
the

fancy
artwork
if
lake
could
raise
more
cash
from
the

have

always
thought
of
mike

with
a
financial
background
a
former
sale

in

have
to
learn
the
business
and
he
have
mike

great
strength
be
the

jim
parke
have
be
chief
financial
officer
since
and
a
key
part
of

great
judgment
and
know
the
business
backward
and
forward
dennis

who
have
be
in
or
out
of
the
business
three
time
during
his
career
give
us
all
comfort
that
we
have
the
bridge
of
expertise
to
the
next
generation
of
leadership
at
ge
capital
with
this
succession
team
in
place
gary
and
i
conclude
that
he
didn
t
want
to
work
for
the
next
ceo
at
ge
he
have
earn
and
deserve
great
treatment
and
his
severance
package
reflect
that
we
also
get
a
noncompete
in
june
conseco
the
insurance
and
financial
service
company
be

deep
yogurt
their

have
plunge
percent
in
and

the
principal
conseco

irwin
jacob
and
thomas
lee
associate
want
gary
to
bail
them
out
in
fact
gary
be
the
perfect
guy
for
this
turnaround
assignment
he
could
finally
be
his
own
bos
one
of
my
more
enjoyable
negotiation
be

from
our

my
first
call
from
jacob
to
ask
how
much
i
would
want
to
let
gary
out
irwin
you
must
think
i
have
hay
between
my
teeth

want
me
to
negotiate
against
myself
irwin
ask
if
million
would
do
it
forget
it
i
m
not
let
him
out
he
s
too
smart
and
too
valuable
irwin
call
several
time
and
suggest
high
price
but
nothing
close
to
what
gary
be
worth
not
long
afterward
i
get
another
call
from
david
harkins

conseco
board
member
and

david
be
very
pleasant
try
to
mollify
me
into
a
deal
each
time
modestly
up
the
ante
after
several
more
phone
call
over
two
day
we
work
out
an
agreement
i
agree
to
cancel
the
noncompete
in
exchange
for
conseco
buying
out
all
of
ge
s
obligation
to
gary
and
issue
million
warrant
for
ge
to
buy
conseco
stock
at
a
share
the
market
price
at
the
time
of
the
agreement
the
nice
thing
about
this
deal
be
that
everybody
won
gary
found
his
ideal
spot
a
place
where
he
s
the
bos
and
his
brain
will
work
wonder
conseco
get
the
turnaround
in
stock
price
that

any
of
these
reality
we

tackle
the
loss
in

again
to

a
nice
even
there
be
only
one
problem
it
be
the
night
of
the
sixth
game
of
the
world
series
with
my
red
sox
play
the
new
york
mets
i
have
live
and
die
with
the
sox
since
i
be
six
year
old
this
be
the
night
they
could
finally
win
their
first
world
series
in
my
lifetime
nbc
be
televise
the
game
i
doubt
larry
even
knew
it
be
world
series
time
it
turn
out
to
be
the
saddest
night
in
red
sox
history
when
bill
buckner
let
a
ball
dribble
between
his
leg
and
the
red
sox
eventually
lose
in
the
tenth
inning
i
be
shock
by
larry
s
insensitivity
to
the
game
s
importance
but
he
might
have
felt
equally
upset
that
such
a
trivial
thing
could
consume
me
it
be
an
odd
night
but
it
wouldn
t
be
the
last
awkward
experience
between
us
despite
our
demand
on
nbc
news
to
cut
loss
larry
stun
me
in
november
when

ii
budget
review
propose
an
increase
in
spending
larry
hat
this
kind
of

he
thought
it
be
demean
to
talk
about
cost
with
some
business
suit
he
operate
under
the
theory
that
network
should
lose
money
while
cover
news
in
the
name
of
journalistic
integrity
his
dismissive
attitude
only
add
to
the
friction
i
be
ripped
after
the
meeting
i
stew
on
it
overnight
in
the
morning
i
decide
to
confront
the
issue
and
ask
bob

make
it
even
more
difficult

my
thought
at

march
management

bonaventure
hotel
in

lauderdale
it
be
a
little
bit
like
the
first
elfun
meeting
in
westport
six
year
earlier
not
everyone
be
pleased
i
spoke
before
dinner
to
bob
s
top
executive
and
told
them
nbc
have
to
change
and
adapt
to
a
new
world
cable
be
come
and
it
s
go
to
change
your
life
too
many
people
in
this
room
be
living
in
the
past
there
be
too
many
staff

be
marginal
at
best
less
than
percent

the

in
bob
name
brandon
s
deputy
warren
littlefield
as
president
of
entertainment
warren
inherit
a
difficult
situation
we
didn
t
have
any
new
show
and
the
tv
advertising
market
fell
into
its
bad
slump
in
two
decade
nbc
s
profit
fell
from
a
peak
of
million
in
to
million
in
that
year
we
have
to
make
a
difficult
decision
we
be
in
boca
in
at
the
time
of
the
decision
on
who
should
take
over
the
tonight
show
from
johnny
carson
this
be
a
terrible
dilemma
because
both
jay
leno
and
david
letterman
be
on
our
network
at
the
time
close
to
midnight
cfo
dennis
dammerman
and
i
walk
into
a
conference
room
in
the
middle
of
a
hot
discussion
most
of
the
east
coast
guy
want
letterman
the
west
coast
guy
hooked
up
by
videoconference
favor
leno
bob
want
to
keep
both
of
them
he
fear
that
pick
one
would
risk
a
defection
by
the
other
to
cbs
which
have
nothing
go
for
it
on
late
night
dennis
and
i
sat
in
the
back
of
the
room
listen
to
the
debate
when
bob
turn
to
us
what
do
you
guy
think
you
know
i
m
not
qualify
to
pick
either
one
i
say
but
if
i
be
you
i
would
do
this
i
d
go
for
ge
value
you
like
leno
s
value
he
s
good
for
the
affiliate
he
s
a
good
human
be
the
american
public
will
find
out
that
s
true
we
get
beat
up
over
the
leno
decision
letterman
left
us
for
cbs
and
pull
ahead
in
the
early
go
the
critic
be
everywhere
and
they
be
join
by
grant
tinker
i
like
grant
and
thought
i
have
a
good
relationship
with
him
in
he
come
out
with
a
book
that
blame
bob
and
me
for
the
decline
he
call
my
decision
to
appoint
bob
head
of
the
network
a
kamikaze
assignment
he
say
our
decision
to
replace
johnny
carson
with
jay
leno
be
dead
wrong
he
claimed
we
overpaid
for
fnn
and
he
place
cnbc
in
the
dead
air
category
other
than
its
stock
ticker
cnbc
have
fail
to
develop
any
discernible
persona
write
tinker
in
his
book
i
ve
wonder
whether
jack
ever
watch
it
and
what
he
think
of
it
the
venom
in
grant
s
comment
surprised
me
until
i
notice
that
his
book
be
co
author
by
bud
rukeyser
bud
be
a
former
public
relation
head
of
nbc
who
have
left
on
less
than
amicable
term
in
the
spring
of
in
the
middle
of
the
slump
we
add
to
our
problem
we
partner
with
chuck
dolan
to
do
a
cable
triplecast
of
the
summer
olympics
in
barcelona
for
an
extra
cable
subscriber
could
have
three
channel
to
watch
over
hour
of
live
and
taped
coverage
without
commercial
it
be
a
flop
we
have
hop
to
sign
up
as
many
as
million
of
the
million
home
that
could
receive
the
offer
instead
we
drew
about
viewer
we
take
a
real
beating
in
the
medium
and
financially
we
be
look
at
a
million
loss
on
the
triplecast
alone
while
bob
be
confident
chuck
would
honor
his
commitment
our
accountant
worried
that
we
d
get
stuck
for
the
majority
of
it
even
though
dolan
be
our
partner
chuck
be
as
tough
a
negotiator
as
they
come
he
be
also
as
honorable
a
guy
as
you
ll
meet
in
november
we
receive
a
check
from
him
for
million
to
cover
his
share
of
the
triplecast
loss
triplecast
be
just
another
problem
in
a
troubled
time
from
until
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
struggle
with
all
these
issue
and
be
search
for
a
solution
that
lead
to
talk
with
lot
of
player
include
paramount
disney
time
warner
viacom
and
sony
we
weren
t
look
for
cash
we
be
try
to
put
thing
together
to
make
nbc
a
big
and
strong
player
we
come
closest
with
disney
and
paramount
dennis
dammerman
our
adviser
and
i
have
a
dinner
meeting
with
disney
ceo
michael
eisner
and
a
team
from
disney
one
even
during
the
summer
of
we
come
to
a
tentative
understand
that
disney
would
buy
percent
of
nbc
but
would
have
operating
control
while
we
retain
majority
ownership
my
main
condition
be
that
bob
wright
would
be
the
ceo
of
the
combine
disney
tv
production
studio
and
nbc
s
operation
michael
like
it
and
dennis
and
i
be
thrill
by
morning
though
michael
have
change
his
mind
and
didn
t
want
to
do
the
deal
we
have
several
other
serious
discussion
include
some
with
marty
davis
of
paramount
that
end
up
the
same
way
with
all
these
discussion
go
on
the
press
naturally
get
hold
of
it
speculation
about
ge
s
plan
for
nbc
ran
rampant
throughout
bob
nelson
dennis
and
i
prepared
an
analysis
on
why
we
thought
stay
in
the
network
business
make
sense
long
term
the
value
of
the
property
at
the
time
be
somewhere
in
the
billion
to
billion
range
we
be
confident
we
could
create
a
far
more
valuable
asset
with
very
limited
downside
i
take
the
analysis
to
the
board
in
october
recommend
that
we
stay
in
the
business
it
be
the
only
time
i
ever
poll
every
board
member
one
by
one
for
a
show
of
support
for
a
decision
they
agree
unanimously
to
stick
with
nbc
and
we
go
public
with
our
commitment
to
the
network
meanwhile
warren
littlefield
be
have
success
develop
new

bob
decide
to
give
warren
more
support
and
hire
as
head
of
west
coast
operation
don
ohlmeyer
the
old
friend
who
have
tipped
me
off
to
tartikoff

suggestion
that
we
give

the
second
hour
of
the

affiliate
because
the

tie
up
we

always
want
to
develop
a
cable
news
channel
but
it
be
very
expensive
to
do
from
scratch
at
an
nbc
strategy
review
session
in
october
bob
described
his
ongoing

we
be
have
trouble
figure
out
the

relationship
with

one
possibility
be
a
licensing
arrangement
i
jumped
up
and
go
to
an
easel
and
lead
a
discussion
of
all
the
alternative
eventually
draw
on
a
flip
chart
a
partnership
structure
similar
to
that
of
many
previous
ge
deal
in
this
structure
we
d
have
a
couple
of

one
on

another
on
the

side
with
microsoft
in
control
tom
rogers
and
bob
then
begin
negotiate
this
concept
with
the
microsoft
team
microsoft
be
primarily
interested
in
use
our
news
gathering
operation
and
develop
an
online
news
channel
cable
be
secondary
which
make
the
negotiation
more
difficult
the
even
before
a
december
press
conference
to
announce
the
partnership
there
be
still
a
number
of
stick
point
tom
and
his

have
be
up
all
night
try
to

about

i
call
him

concerned
that
he
could
get

with
major
loss
in
cable
jack
bill
ask
do
you
believe
the
cable
forecast
i
think
cable
s
a
no
brainer
i
reply
you
re
the
guy
who
have
the
tough
job
with
the
online
part
i
don
t
have
any
doubt
we
ll
make
cable
work
i
give
bill
some
guarantee
on
cable
performance
to
protect
microsoft
from
major
loss
if
we
couldn
t
get
the
channel
into
more
home
that
s
enough
for
me
he
reply
about
minute
before
the
press
conference
bill
gate
and
i
agree
msnbc
turn
into
the
black
in
and
msn
become
the
no
news
internet
site
msnbc
also
give
nbc
the
chance
to
showcase
brian
williams
brian
have
join
the
network
in
and
be
backing
up
tom
brokaw
on
nightly
news
and
do
weekend
anchor
andy
lack
give
him
his
own
show
the
news
with
brian
williams
while
you
don
t
see
it
much
on
the
air
brian
can
be
one
of
the
funniest
guy
you
d
ever
meet
i
actually
think
he
s
so
talented
that
if
he
wasn
t
already
commit
as
a
news
anchor
he
could
have
his
own
late
night
show
bob
and
tom
rogers
continued
look
for
internet
opportunity
and
make
a
number
of
dot
com
investment
later
merge
most
of
them
into
a
new
public
company
call
nbci
like
so
many
other
dot
coms
at
the
time
nbci
focus
too
much
on
advertising
revenue
when
the
internet
ad
market
fell
apart
in
early
its
business
model
couldn
t
make
it
in
we
repurchase
nbci
and
begin
use
it
as
a
portal
to
promote
the
rest
of
nbc
toward
the
end
of
bob
and
i

play
dumb
as
a
fox
as
well
as

could
get
a
laugh
we

only

left
while

for
us
i
respect
his
choice
he

to
go
out
on

and
he
do
we
not
only
lose
jerry
we
also
lose
the
nfl
after
televise
pro
football
since
we
lose
the
broadcast
right
to
the
national
football
league
in
early
passing
on
this
be
an
easy
decision
there
be
no
one
at
nbc
even
in
sport
who
want
to
touch
the
number
need
to
get
the
right
of
course
my
favorite
paper
the
new
york
post
always
have
great
fun
with
thing
like
this
they
put
a
mug
shot
on
the
front
page
show
me
drop
the
ball
yet
this
wasn
t
a
fumble
we
pass
on
that
billion
eight
year
deal
because
the
number
be
nut
lose
the
nfl
lead
to
our
effort
to
launch
in
a
new
football
league
the
xfl
for
extreme
football
with
vince
mcmahon
head
of
the
world
wrestling
federation
it
turn
out
to
be
a
bomb
and
i
be
right
in
the
middle
of
it
if
you
screw
up
in
another
business
you
can
generally
hide
it
but
not
on
tv
everybody
s
always
watch
especially
the
critic
i
be
as
big
a
supporter
of
the
xfl
as
anyone
in
the
company
we
have
nothing
go
on
saturday
night
vince
mcmahon
have
flair
and
make
a
big
success
with
the
wwf
minnesota
governor
jesse
ventura
add
drama
as
an
announcer
we
launch
the
new
league
with
eight
team
in
some
key
market
our
problem
be
we
could
never
decide
whether
the
xfl
be
entertainment
or
football
the
dilemma
begin
when
they
brought
the
vega
bookie
to
the
training
camp
the
bookie
didn
t
want
the
crazy
rule
the
xfl
have
propose
because
that
make
it
more
difficult
to
put
odds
on
the
game
our
sport
division
thought
we
need
the
credibility
and
publicity
the
bet
line
would
provide
that
close
the
door
to
do
some
thing
that
might
have
make
the
xfl
far
more
entertain
the
first
game
get
off
to
a
big
rating
start
but
even
then
we
lose
audience
during
the
long
game
the
sportswriter
tore
us
apart
the
only
coverage
the
league
get
be
opinion
piece
on
how
the
xfl
threaten
the
sanctity
of
professional
football
the
fan
didn
t
like
either
the
entertainment
or
the
football
the
death
watch
begin
nobody
watch
the
game
everyone
watch
our
failure
after
a
single
week
season
we
call
it
quits
the
xfl
turn
out
to
be
a
rock
it
cost
us
million
the
equivalent
of
a
couple
of
fail
sitcom
and
eight
out
of
ten
of
those
don

of

size
you
don

have
to
connect
all
the

when
to
fight
when
to
fold
one
of
my
strong
childhood
memory
be
of
climb
the
stair
to
my
parent
second
floor
flat
in
salem
massachusetts
and
hearing
my
mother
cry
i
be
only
nine
year
old
in
i
have
never
heard
my
mother
cry
before
when
i
walk
through
the
doorway
she
be
stand
over
an
iron
board
in
the
kitchen
press
my
father
s
shirt
tear
be
stream
down
her
face
oh
god
she
say
franklin
roosevelt
have
die
i
be
stun
i
didn
t
know
why
the
president
s
death
would
cause
my
mother
such
heartache
i
didn
t
understand
it
at
all
yet
i
felt
some
of
the
same
feeling
when
john
kennedy
be
assassinate
year
later
and
i
be
glue
to
the
tv
set
my
mother
s
reaction
to
roosevelt
s
death
come
from
her
heartfelt
belief
that
he
have
save
our
country
and
our
democracy
she
put
her
faith
in
him
and
our
government
so
do
my
father
both
of
them
believe
that
the
government
serve
the
will
of
the
people
protect
its
citizen
and
always
do
what
be
right
for
many
year
i
share
my
parent
faith
but
that
faith
have
be
severely
test
on
a
number
of
occasion
i
ve
see
government
up
close
both
right
and
wrong
both
good
and
almost
evil
from
honest
hardworking
public
servant
to
politically
motivate
devious
self
promoter
i
d
see
many
small
instance
of
bad
government
in
action
but
my
first
big
case
didn
t
come
until
i
be
in
the
middle
of
a
board
meeting
in

south
carolina
when
our

our
vice
president
of

relation
i
knew

truth
for
one
thing
glen

head
of
ge
plastic
have
impeccable
integrity
for
another
russell
have
be
fire
for
performance
reason
i
knew
because
at
one
crucial
point
i
have
write
his
direct
bos
tell
him
russell
have
to
go
something
that
even
russell
didn
t
know
i
have
met
him
shortly
after
he
join
ge
in
as
a
strategic
planner
he
move
up
through
our
light
business
and
in
become
general
manager
of
ge
superabrasives
the
name
of
our
industrial
diamond
business
i
knew
that
business
well
because
i
oversaw
it
from
pittsfield
in
the
early
s
at
first
russell
do
well
in
the
job
increase
revenue
and
profit
nicely
but
in
he
hit
a
wall
profit
drop
to
million
from
million
the
year
before
over
the
course
of
russell
s
problem
continued
his
number
didn
t
improve
and
he
have
difficulty
explain
the
situation
in
a
series
of
review
with
his
bos
glen
hiner
the
head
of
our
plastic
business
i
be
troubled
by
it
i
have
be
a
supporter
of
russell
s
for
many
year
and
approve
his
promotion
to
general
manager
of
superabrasives
in
the
first
place
however
in
september
hiner
and
i
have
what
would
be
our
last
review
with
russell
in
pittsfield
he
be
totally
unable
to
answer
my
question
at
one
point
he
say
he
wasn
t
prepared
to
discus
some
straightforward
issue
in
his
business
because
he
didn
t
think
that
be
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
my
financial
analyst
bob
nelson
be
in
the
session
with
me
and
felt
as
surprised
as
i
be
by
russell
s
response
the
next
day
i
scribble
a
note
to
glen
hiner
summarize
the
meeting
in
it
i
include
the
observation
that
russell
make
a
fool
of
himself
in
july
and
yesterday
he
appear
totally
out
of
it
bottom
line
russell
have
to
go
see
below
the
next
month
hiner
call
him
back
to
pittsfield
and
on
november
fire
him
now
russell
have
file
a
lawsuit
make
all
kind
of
crazy
claim
accuse
hiner
of
wrongdoing
before

a
response
to
it
i
remember
the
note
i
have
sent
hiner
and
have
it
faxed
to
me
in
florence
luckily
my
note
make
clear
that
russell
be
fire
for
performance
reason
and
that
i
do
it
not
hiner
who
be
the
target
of
russell
s
make
up
charge
ben
joyce
and
i
draft
a
statement
for
the
journal
and
other
reporter
we
make
it
clear
that
russell
be
remove
for
performance
shortcoming
and
that
he
have
many
conversation
with
ge
people
try
to
get
a
well
severance
package
russell
never
brought
up
any
antitrust
issue
in
those
talk
he
be
a
bitter
employee
who
have
be
can
the
next
day
s
story
contain
even
bad
news
russell
have
gotten
the
justice
department
to
open
a
criminal
investigation
into
his
price
fix
allegation
when
a
journal
reporter
ask
me
about
it
after
the
meeting
i
call
it
pure
nonsense
we
begin
our
own
investigation
we
call
in
lawyer
from
arnold
porter
and
dan
webb
a
litigator
with
winston
strawn
to
look
into
the
charge
it
didn
t
take
much
longer
than
six
week
for
the
outside
lawyer
to
conclude
that
russell
wasn
t
tell
the
truth
now
we
have
to
convince
the
justice
department
we
share
with
them
the
result
of
the
investigation
and
put
together
a
white
paper
that
document
outright
misrepresentation
russell
have
told
in
his
deposition
in
the
case
it
fell
on
deaf
ear
in
february
ben
heineman
and
i
go
to
washington
to
meet
with
an
assistant
attorney
general
to
make
our
case
she
couldn
t
have
care
less
about
our
argument
she
be
out
to
get
an
indictment
and
nothing
be
go
to
get
in
her
way
to
avoid
an
indictment
for
price
fix
she
ask
us
to
plead
guilty
to
a
felony
and
pay
a
fine
there
be
no
way
i
be
go
to
do
that
we
hadn
t
do
anything
wrong
the
government
s
case
be
built
on
a
bunch
of
lie
we
have
to
fight
this
all
the
way
a
grand
jury
indictment
be
usually
routine
when
the
government
request
it
three
day
after
our
meeting
in
washington
she
get
her
indictment
against
us
and
de
beer
for
allegedly
conspire
to
fix
price
she
didn
t
trust
her
own
lieutenant
so
she
hire
an
outside
lawyer
at
the
government
s
expense
eight
month
later
on
october

ge
s
inside
litigation
chief
the

do
such
a
good
job
destroy
the
government
s
case
that
we
never
have
to
present
our
evidence
on
december
after
listen
to
all
the
government
s
evidence
judge
george
smith
threw
out
the
entire
case
the
government
s
conspiracy
theory
fall
apart
completely
he
say
the
government
s
argument
be
without
merit
even
when
the
evidence
be
view
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government
no
rational
trier
of
fact
could
find
ge
guilty
the
clear
victory
in
the
russell
case
justified
fight
for
what
we
knew
be
right
the
government
have
no
case
just
a
knee
jerk
dislike
of
a
big
company
judge
almost
never
dismiss
a
criminal
antitrust
case
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
before
a
defendant
have
even
present
its
side
but
that
s
what
happen
here
the
fight
take
us
three
year
three
year
of
bad
press
every
time
it
be

its
bad
they
get
the
fbi

wire
a
dismiss
employee
and
get
nothing
they
spent
a
great
amount
of
time
chase
nothing
they
hire
an
expensive
outside
gun
to
try
the
case
all
so
some
government
type
could
make
name
for
themselves
of
course
we
re
not
perfect
in
a
completely

be
understandable
with

while

know
that
if
an

occur
on
their
watch
it
be
their
responsibility
that

indifferent
to

be
a
huge
event
in
ge
in
many
way
it
be
a
big
learn
experience
for
me
both
internally
in
term
of
discipline
and
externally
with
washington
and
the
medium
outside
ge
the
idea
begin
to
surface
that
it
be
the
pressure
of
competition
and
the
drive
for
profit
that
make
people
cheat
some
didn
t
want
to
see
it
for
what
it
be
an
isolated
violation
in
a
company
with
hot
line
ombudsman
voluntary
disclosure
policy
and
constant
leadership
emphasis
on
integrity
i
go
to
washington
in
july
to
testify
before
a
house
subcommittee
chair
by
u
s
representative
john
dingell
i
found
dingle
tough
but
honest
and
fair
it
be
all
i
could
ask
for
we
have
settle
with
the
justice
department
agree
to
pay
million
a
week
before
my
appearance
on
the
hill
testify
be
not
the
most
pleasant
thing
i
ever
do
but
i
felt
strongly
about
my
message
and
i
want
to
deliver
it
in
person
i
told
the
committee
excellence
and
competitiveness
aren
t
incompatible
with
honesty
and
integrity
i
add
mr
chairman
we
have
an
employee
population
that
would
rank
with
st
paul
or
tampa
if
it
be
an
american
city
we
have
no
police
force
no
jail
we
must
rely
on
the
integrity
of
our
people
as
our
first
defense
unfortunately
that
system
wasn
t
good
enough
in
this
case
but
i
take
great
pride
that
percent
of
our
people
get
up
every
morning
all
over
the
world
and
compete
like
hell
with
absolute
integrity
they
don
t
need
a
policeman
or
a
judge
they
only
need
their
conscience
as
they
face
the
mirror
each
morning
they
see
no
conflict
between
take
on
the
world
s
best
every
day
all
over
the
globe
give
percent
and
more
to
compete
and
win
and
grow
and
at
the
same
time
maintain
an
instinctive
unbendable
commitment
to
absolute
integrity
in
everything
we
do
i
get
a
fair
hearing
that
day
despite
the
ugliness
of
why
i
be
there
i
felt
very
good
about
make
the
point
and
i
feel
even
more
strongly
today
that
integrity
must
be
the
foundation
for
competitiveness
one
of
the
most
frustrate

why
we

be
so
adamant
about
the
pcb
issue
for
me
the
pcb
story
start
accidentally
a
couple
of
week
before
christmas
when
i
be
a
group
executive
in
pittsfield
i
be
visit
a
semiconductor
plant
in

one
day
when
the

happen
to

casually
that

conservation
dec
be
go
to

focus
on

his
capacitor
plant
in
upstate
new

that
be
discharge
pcbs
into
the
hudson
river
i
have
never
dealt
with
pcbs
before
but
be
a
chemical
engineer
i
be
familiar
with
plant
discharge
and
i
be
curious
about
this
hearing
a
couple
of
day
later
i
be
in
my
pittsfield
office
and
have
a
slow
day
i
decide
to
drive
over
the

to
albany
to
find
out
what
be
go
on
i
sat
in
the
back
of
the
hearing
room
and
no
one
knew
i
be
there
that
day
ge
s
expert
witness
be
testify
a
biologist
and
vice
president
of
a
laboratory
hire
by
us

claimed
his

show
negligible
level
of

from
the
hudson
our
expert
didn
t
look
or
sound
like
one
he
seem
unsure
of
his
own
work
he
have
trouble
give
a
straight
answer
the
more
i
listen
the
more
uncomfortable
i
get
i
knew
if
he
couldn
t
convince
me

enough
that

expert
to
come
to
my

him
until
a
m
we
be
convince
that
he
hadn
t
do
a
thorough
job
we
felt
we
could
not
use
his
data
or
allow
the
hearing
officer
to
use
it
either
i
could
have
strangle
him
the
next
day
i
told
our
outside

not
to
rely
on

then
the
department
will
use
its
best
effort
to
obtain
additional
fund
from
source
other
than
general
electric
that
be
necessary
to
assure
such
protection
these
best
effort
will
include
preparation
by
the
department
of
a
plan
of
action
to
obtain
such
fund
include
specify
application
will
be
make
to
federal
agency
and
or
other
source
of
fund
in
as
expeditious
a
manner
as
possible
but
it
didn
t
end
there
the
settlement
have
be
make
on
the
basis
of
animal
study
i
want
to
know
if
pcbs
cause
cancer
in
human
and
whether
our
worker
be
at
risk
i
knew
that
if
a
company
fund
study
be
go
to
have
any
credibility
i
have
to
get
the
most
widely
respect
scientist
i
could
find
so
i
go
down
to
see
dr
irwin
selikoff
then
head
of
mount
sinai
s
environmental
school
of
medicine
selikoff
have
become
something
of
an
environmental
icon
after
find
that
exposure
to
asbestos
could
cause
lung
cancer
he
listen
carefully
to
my
request
i
ask
him
if
he
would
go
to
our
plant
to
study
ge
employee
who
have
the
great
exposure
to
pcbs
for
year
those
employee
have
work
in
it
up
to
their
elbow
i
give
selikoff
total
access
to
our
employee
he
put
a
research
team
together
and
set
up
a
lab
at
our
fort
edward
plant
selikoff
first
examine
over
volunteer
from
the
two
ge
factory
his
study
finally
publish
in
be
what
convince
me
more
than
anything
else
that
pcbs
didn
t
cause
cancer
selikoff
s
mortality
study
found
there
be
no
cancer
death
or
other
serious
side
effect
among
worker
year
after
they
be
first
expose
normally
in
a
population
of
the
size
he
study
without
any
major
pcb
exposure
at
least
eight
cancer
death
would
have
be
expect
other
scientist
study
utility
worker
and
westinghouse
employee
who
have
be
heavily
expose
to
pcbs
alexander
smith
of
the
government
s
national
institute
for
occupational
safety
and
health
niosh
give
the
most
succinct
summary
of
this
work
in
he
write
one
would
expect
that
adverse
human
health
effect
from
exposure
to
pcbs
if
they
exist
would
most
readily
be
identify
in
group
with
the
great
exposure
none
of
the
publish
occupational
or
epidemiological
study
include
ours
however
have
show
that
occupational
exposure
to
pcbs
be
associate
with
any
adverse
health
outcome
the
pcb
issue
have
be
raise
much
earlier
when
two
major
false
alarm
be
sound
the
first
be
in
the
s
when
a
chemical
mixture
contain
pcbs
know
as
halowax
lead
to
a
serious
acnelike
condition
and
in
a
few
case
death
due
to
liver
disease
a
harvard
scientist
study
the
incident
first
report
that
pcbs
be
the
most
toxic
component
of
the
mixture
after
study
this
far
however
he
correct
himself
in
by
state
that
pcbs
be
almost
non
toxic
unfortunately
his
correction
get
little
or
no
recognition
almost
year
later
in
a
government
report
by
niosh
state
that
the
halowax
experience
have
continued
to
be
erroneously
cite
even
today
it
s
not
unusual
to
get
a
call
from
a
reporter
think
he
have
discover
some
new
explosive
evidence
in
these
old
halowax
incident
discredit
by
both
scientist
and
the
government
another
false
alarm
the
yusho
incident
be
sound
in
japan
in
about
people
use
a
type
of
vegetable
oil
from
rice
hull
in
cooking
developed
severe
acne
and
other
symptom
when
pcbs
be
detect
in
the
oil
the
incident
become
know
as
the
pcb
oil
disease
however
later
analysis
by
japanese
scientist
found
that
the
oil
also
contain
high
level
of
two
other
chlorinate
chemical
both
high
temperature
by
product
of
pcbs
they
also
examine
japanese
electrical
worker
and
found
they
have
high
level
of
pcbs
in
their
blood
than
the
yusho
patient
but
the
worker
weren
t
sick
when
scientist
dose
monkey
with
pcbs
and
these
different
chemical
they
conclude
that
it
be
these
other
chemical
and
not
pcbs
that
cause
the
yusho
incident
it
be
those
false
alarm
that
prompt
an
american
researcher
dr
renate
kimbrough
to
do
one
of
the
first
rat
study
for
the
u
s
government
on
pcbs
dr
kimbrough
found
that
rat
fed
large
dos
of
pcbs
have
increase
tumor
in
their
liver
she
be
heavily
involve
in
this
work
in
the
mid
s
when
she
be
at
the
center
for
disease
control
and
prevention
and
later
at
the
epa
just
as
i
have
in
with
dr
selikoff
i
want
a
recognize
scientist
with
unassailable
integrity
and
credential
to
look
at
pcbs
again
this
time
in
april
we
ask
dr
kimbrough
to
take
on
the
assignment
internally
our
pcb
effort
be
lead
by
steve
ramsey
former
head
of
the
justice
department
s
environmental
enforcement
who
now
lead
ge
s
environmental
and
safety
operation
he
and
a
ge
scientist
dr
steve
hamilton
knew
critic
would
still
be
skeptical
of
ge
fund
research
they
establish
an
advisory
panel
to
peer
review
the
kimbrough
and
other

the

be
make

researcher
lead
by
the
former

dr

study
virtually
everyone
who
ever
work
at
those
two
ge

fort
edward
between

to
track
down
some
of
them
through
payroll

and
old
telephone
directory
death
certificate

examine
some
current
and
former
employee
be
involve
in
the
research
in
dr
kimbrough
issue
a
strike
report
the
death
rate
due
to
all
type
of

for
employee
at
our

be
at
or
significantly
below
the
general

regional
population
rate
as
part
of
its
review
of
the
kimbrough
work
before
their
final
decision
the
epa
ask
an
epidemiologist
at
the
university
of
southern
california
s
norris
comprehensive
cancer
center
for
his
opinion
in
a
letter
to
the
chief
of
the
epa
s
risk
method
group
dr
thomas
mack
have
this
to
say
i
found
the
kimbrough
paper
to
be
well
design
appropriately
analyze
and
fairly
interpret
the
follow
up
be
complete
my
bottom
line
be
that
the
summary
statement
in
the
paper
be
appropriate
i
think
it
be
appropriate
to
downgrade
the
priority
give
to
pcbs
we
know
about
dr
mack
s
opinion
only
because
we
get
it
from
epa
file
after
a
freedom
of
information
request
his
final
sentence
be
tell
i
m
sure
this
have
not
be
particularly
useful
for
you
but
it
s
the
best
i
can
do
i
doubt
this
would
have
see
the
light
of
day
if
we
hadn
t
use
the
law
to
dig
it
out
of
the
epa
through
this
long
drawn
out
controversy
ge
have
be
portrayed
as
an
uncaring
big
business
that
dumped
pcbs
from
plant
in
hudson
fall
and
fort
edward
new
york
the
truth
be
we
never
dumped
pcbs
and
we
never
make
them
their
use
be
dictate
by
fire
and
building
code
because
they
solve
a
long
stand
problem
in
electrical
equipment
the
prior
insulate
material
caught
fire
and
could
explode
pcbs
be
view
as
a
lifesaving
chemical
new
york
state
approve
our
discharge
and
issue
permit
to
us
for
it
what
do
our
critic
use
pcbs
as
the
foil
say
about
us
first
they
say
ge
have
more
superfund
site
than
any
other
company
in
congress
pass
a
law
to
address
the
cleanup
of
site
where
waste
have
be
dispose
in
the
past
this
law
be
know
as
the
superfund
act
the
implication
be
that
we
do
something
wrong
we
do
have
a
large
number
of
these
site
to
be
exact
but
the
number
have
everything
to
do
with
our
longevity
and
our
size
ge
be
found
in
and
have
have
more
factory
in
more
town
than
any
other
company
in
the
world
like
most
other
company
we
dispose
of
our
waste
legally
under
government
permit
when
require
at
the
majority
of
the
superfund
site
ge
have
less
than
percent
of
the
liability
for
what
be
put
there
the
remain
liability
be
share
by
dozen
of
other
party
include
municipality
other
company
and
waste
hauler
ge
have
take
its
responsibility
for
these
site
seriously
we
ve
spent
almost
billion
in
the
last
decade
on
their
cleanup
criticize
us
for
have
these
site
be
like
criticize
someone
for
have
gray
hair
it
say
nothing
about
character
and
everything
about
age
another
common
complaint
be
that
we
re
challenge
the
superfund
law
so
we
can
get
off
the
hook
for
our
cleanup
obligation
yes
we
have
challenged
a
portion
of
the
law
american
be
use
to
get
their
day
in
court
this
be
true
for
everything
from
traffic
offense
to
murder
this
isn
t
the
case
when
the
epa
issue
a
superfund
order
you
really
have
only
one
choice
under
the
law
do
what
the
agency
tell
you
or
else
otherwise
you
face
treble
damage
and
daily
fine
the
law
give
the
epa
power
to
issue
order
of
unlimited
scope
you
get
no
hearing
before
be
order
to
do
the
work
you
get
no
hearing
until
many
year
later
and
then
only
when
the
epa
chooses
to
tell
you
the
work
be
do
it
s
a
shoot
first
ask
question
later
law
we
believe
that
s
wrong
i
m
a
chemical
engineer
and
not
a
constitutional
lawyer
but
i
can
t
understand
why
in
god
s
name
this
make
any
sense
under
our
constitution
it
denies
you
the
basic
right
of
due
process
the
epa
be
use
this
law
in
their
dredge
proposal
today
the
epa
say
the
hudson
be
safe
for
swim
boat
wad
and
use
as
a
source
of
drinking
water
bald
eagle
and
other
wildlife
be
flourish
in
the
hudson
valley
the
government
s
proposal
to
dredge
be
base
on
a
wild
risk
assessment
if
a
person
eats
half
a
pound
of
fish
every
week
for
year
the
epa
contends
that
the
person
s
risk
of
cancer
may
increase
by
one
in
in
other
word
you
ve
get
to
eat
meal
a
year
for
four
decade
before
the
increase
might
go
up
by
one
in
a
thousand
why
doesn
t
a
rational
mind
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
risk
be
practically
low
than
breathing
never
mind
that
eat
fish
from
the
river
have
be
ban
for
two
decade
or
that
pcb
level
in
the
water
and
fish
have
fall
percent
since
more
than
study
most
completely
independent
of
ge
show
no
link
between
pcbs
and
cancer
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
happens
in
rat
do
not
happen
in
human
when
both
be
expose
to
pcbs
level
in
fish
be
now
down
to
between
three
to
eight
part
per
million
two
be
the
level
the
fda
say
be
safe
for
sale
at
the
fish
market
think
about
the
magnitude
of
what
the
epa
s
proposal
would
do
the
agency
proposes
remove
billion
pound
of
sediment
from
the
hudson
to
get
at
probably
pound
of
pcbs
it
would
take
hour
of
dredge
a
day
six
day
a
week
for
six
month
each
year
some
boat
and
barge
would
have
to
be
in
the
river
full
time
along
with
mile
of
pipeline
to
carry
pcbs
the
epa
proposes
building
plant
along
the
river
to
dry
the
mud
that
would
be
carry
away
in
ten
of
thousand
of
truck
or
railcar
after
the
epa
get
the
sediment
out
they
re
propose
to
add
billion
pound
of
sand
and
gravel
back
into
the
river
diver
would
also
have
to
replace
million
aquatic
plant
destroyed
by
dredge
after
do
all
this
dredge
won
t
get
pcbs
out
of
the
hudson
it
will
cause
resuspension
of
bury
pcbs
that
will
flow
downriver
imagine
if
someone
come
along
with
a
commercial
proposition
to
dredge
anything
out
of
the
hudson
river
tear
up
the
bank
destroy
the
ecosystem
knock
the
tree
down
to
widen
the
road
through
farmland
and
backyard
to
remove
whatever
they
be
after
it
would
be
an
environmental
disaster
why
would
anyone
rip
up
the
hudson
the
epa
itself
reject
dredge
in
say
it
could
be
devastate
to
the
ecosystem
nothing
have
change
since
then
except
the
politics
and
pcb
level
in
fish
have
be
reduce
by
percent
ge
have
spent
more
than
million
on
research
investigation
and
cleanup
we
ve
reduce
the
pcbs
come
out
of
the
bedrock
under
our
old
facility
from
five
pound
per
day
to
three

we
think
we
now
have
the
technology
to
reduce
the
daily
seepage
to
zero
source
control
couple
with
the
natural
sedimentation
in
the
river
would
reduce
pcbs
in
fish
to
the
same
level
as
dredge
might
without
resuspension
and
without
destroy
the
river
one
of
the
puzzle
thing
about
the
epa
s
proposal
be
that
it
fail
to
analyze
whether
there
be
less
destructive
and
less
disruptive
alternative
this
isn
t
about
money
we
ll
spend
whatever
it
take
to
do
the
job
right
to
tell
this
story
to
the
people
in
the
upper
hudson
and
explain
why
we
oppose
dredge
we
ve
spent
over
million
on
an
information
campaign
that
cause
a
controversy
as
well
there
be
little
argument
over
the
information
in
the
campaign
activist
think
we
should
be
quiet
and
do
what
we
re
told
we
make
some
progress
in
get
the
fact
out
poll
show
that
by
more
than
three
to
one
the
people
in
the
upper
hudson
from
washington
to
dutch
county
be
against
the
epa
dredge
proposal
more
than
upper
hudson
river
local
government
and
organization
oppose
dredge
the
epa
s
final
decision
should
take
into
account
the
view
of
those
most
affected
by
their
proposal
unfortunately
this
issue
be
no
longer
about
pcbs
human
health
and
science
this
isn
t
about
what
s
best
for
the
hudson
river
it
s
about
politics
and
punish
a
successful
company
do
you
for
a
minute
believe
that
if
we
thought
pcbs
be
harm
anyone
i
or
my
associate
would
be
take
these
position
there
s
just
no
way
nothing
be
more
important
than
a
company
s
integrity
it
be
the
first
and
most
important
value
in
any
organization
it
not
only
mean
that
people
must
abide
by
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
law
it
also
mean
do
the
right
thing
and
fight
for
what
you
believe
be
right
on
pcbs
we
ve
assure
ourselves
that
they
be
not
harmful
to
our
employee
or
our
neighbor
we
ve
spent
hundred
of

use
the
best
science
to
clean
up
our
site
and
the
hudson
in
the
most
ecologically
sensitive
way

we
will
continue
to

it

about

i
blurt

oh
my

there
s
a

i
grabbed
the
document
back
and
pull
out
of
my
briefcase
the
letter
of
intent
that
would
end
the
deal
they
sign
it
and
we
be
free
to
look
for
a
new
partner
in
japan
tom
must
have
told
that
story
a
thousand
time
to
show
what
a
dope
his
bos
be
we
also
get
out
of
the
aku
deal
without
my
screw
it
up
this
time
aku
have
built
a
pilot
plant
to
produce
ppo
and
have
spent
million
to
million
on
the
project
their
principal
interest
in
ppo
be
as
a
fiber
when
the
polymer
turn
out
not
to
be
useful
for
that
purpose
they
lose
interest
however
their
vice
chairman
met
with
me
at
his
office
in
arnhem
and
want
a
couple
of
million
dollar
to
end
the
venture
in
order
to
offset
some
of
the
loss
they
have
incur
i
told
him
it
would
take
me
month
to
get
through
the
ge
bureaucracy
and
even
then
i
have
no
idea
if
i
could
get
approval
i
say
i
have
the
authority
to
spend
up
to
however
and
i
could
give
him
the
money
on
the
spot
he
accepted
it
and
we
set
up
our
own
wholly
own
company
in
europe
in
japan
we
knew
we
need
distribution
and
we
want
a
relatively
small
partner
we
look
at
several
and
picked
nagase
co
which
at
that
time
be
principally
a
kodak
film
distributor
i
make
the
deal
with
the
head
of
the
nagase
family
we
brought
the
product
and
technology
to
the
partnership
they
brought
their
knowledge
of
japan
s
complex
distribution
market
together
we
invest
in
local
plant
to
compound
plastic
for
the
japanese
market
today
it
s
the
heart
of
our
asian
plastic
business
we
use
the
same
model
for
a
deal
we
do
for
medical
system
in
the
late
s
with
shozo
yokogawa
of
yokogawa
an
instrumentation
company
those
relationship
and
the
deal
behind
them
have
endure
for
more
than
year
and
have
thrive
even
as
they
have
change
ge
may
appear
big
but
it
be
make
up
of
lot
of
small
piece
the
success
of
our
deal
with
nagase
and
yokogawa
reinforce
the
idea
that
our
most
successful
partnership
be
with
small
company
that
feel
the
project
be
critical
to
their
operation
whenever
there
be
an
issue
to
work
out
our
people
could
get
to
the
top
and
not
have
to
work
through
a
massive
bureaucracy
i
remember
be
frustrate
by
how
long
the
japanese
take
to
make
a
decision
but
when
they
make
one
you
could
bet
your
house
on
it
in
over
year
almost
every
business
relationship
i
have
in
japan
turn
into
an
endure
personal
friendship
when
i
become
ceo
i
spent
the
first
several
year
do
only
an
isolated
deal
or
two
outside
the
united
state
visit
europe
and
asia
once
a
year
to
review
current
operation
one
of
the
early
deal
a
joint
venture
in
with
fanuc
of
japan
bore
a
large
resemblance
to
the
yokogawa
and
nagase
partnership
i
have
always
admire
fanuc
and

about
the
large
firework
display
i
ever
saw
be
put
on
in
our
honor
we
walk
up
long
wind
passageway
to
the
roof
where
we
sat
on
huge
pillow
and
beautiful
old
carpet
this
be
pinch
me
stuff
this
be
literally
the
royal
treatment
they
really
want
ge
to
love
and
invest
in
india
and
be
pull
out
all
the
stop
the
next
day
i
be
struck
by
the
contrast
animal
fill
the
dirt
street
as
our
car
wend
its
way
to
the
taj
mahal
the
taj
exceed
my
expectation
in
every
way
it
be
a
magnificent
structure
glisten
in
the
sun
which
give
it
an
almost
pinkish
tint
behind
this
beautiful
creation
sit
across
the
river
be
an
enormous
satellite
communication
dish
a
picture
of
the
old
and
the
new
in
one
glimpse
the
effort
of
k
p
and
his
friend
work
they
show
us
an
india
and
a
people
that
we
love
we
saw
all
kind
of
opportunity
there
after
that
trip
i
become
the
champion
for
india
at
our
annual
officer
meeting
the
next
month
i
portrayed
the
country
as
a
great
place
to
make
a
bet
i
want
to
gamble
on
india
because
it
have
a
strong
legal
system
a
potential
market
and
an
enormous
number
of
people
with
great
technical
skill
i
saw
india
as
a
huge
market
with
a
rapidly
grow
middle
class
of
plus
million
people
out
of
an
million
population
the
indian
people
be
highly
educate
they
spoke
english
and
the
country
have
lot
of
entrepreneur
try
to
break
the
shackle
of
heavy
government
bureaucracy
highly
developed
from
an
intellectual
standpoint
india
be
an
underdeveloped
country
from
an
infrastructure
perspective
i
thought
the
bureaucracy
would
fix
the
infrastructure
problem
and
loosen
some
of
the
red
tape
i
be
dead
wrong
we
try
to
build
light
and
appliance
company
there
they
go
nowhere
power
generation
have
be
a
series
of
start
and
stop
financial
service
and
plastic
have
have
modest
success
only
medical
system
have
flourish
i
be
also
dead
right
the
real
benefit
of
india
turn
out
to
be
its
vast
intellectual
capability
and
the
enthusiasm
of
its
people
we
found
terrific
scientific
engineering
and
administrative
talent
that
today
serf
almost
every
business
at
ge
in
the
early
s
we
kept
push
our
global
growth
by
acquisition
and
alliance
and
by
move
our
best
people
into
global
assignment
in
late
we
make
two
important
move
we
appoint
jim
mcnerney
one
of
our
best
business
ceo
to
a
newly
create
position
as
president
of
ge
asia
jim
didn
t
go
out
there
to
run
any
business
but
to
promote
the
region
and
demonstrate
to
the
business
leader
the
region
s
potential
his
job
be
all
about
look
for
deal
building
business
contact
and
be
a
champion
for
asia
he
be
a
helluva
persuasive
guy
and
have
a
huge
impact
eight
month
after
jim
s
move
to
asia
we
sent
del
williamson
from
our
power
generation
business
in
schenectady
where
he
be
head
of
sale
and
marketing
to
hong
kong
as
head
of
worldwide
sale
move
the
center
of
gravity
there
be
logical
because
no
one
be
buying
power
plant
in
the
united
state
the
business
opportunity
be
in
asia
psychologically
the
impact
on
the
organization
of
see
a
senior
guy
like
del
manage
the
top
line
away
from
mother
schenectady
be
enormous
the
symbolism
of
these
move
shock
the
system
suddenly
we
heard
people
say
they
really
mean
it
globalization
be
for
real
the
number
would
prove
it
our
global
sale
go
from
billion
in
or
percent
of
total
revenue
when
paolo
be
name
a
senior
vp
to
billion
or
more
than
percent
of
our
total
revenue
today
another
key
part
of
our
strategy
be
take
a
contrarian
view
of
globalize
we
focus
most
of
our
attention
on
area
of
the
world
that
be
either
in
transition
or
out
of
favor
we
thought
the
best
risk
reward
activity
be
there
in
the
early
to
mid
s
when
europe
be
slump
we
saw
many
opportunity
particularly
for
financial
service
in
the
mid
s
when
mexico
devalue
the
peso
and
the
economy
be
in
turmoil
we
make
over
acquisition
and
joint
venture
and
significantly
increase
our
production
base
in
the
late
s
our
financial
service
business
move
into
japan
which
have
long
exclude
foreign
investment
these
be
opportunistic
move
but
not
in
the
traditional
sense
we
be
there
to
build
business
for
the
long
haul
our
acquisition
of
cgr
in
france
tungsram
in
hungary
and
nuovo
pignone
in
italy
in
involve
take
over
either
unprofitable
or
barely
profitable
operation
that
have
be
state
run
they
give
us
new
distribution
or
good
technology
that
help
to
globalize
our
medical
light
and
power
system
business
ge
capital
begin
its
global
expansion
in
the
early
s
mainly
in
europe
by
acquire
insurance
and
finance
company
the
activity
picked
up
when
gary
wendt
hire
christopher
mackenzie
in
london
in
with
great
support
from
gary
christopher
spearhead
a
massive
european
expansion
gary
lead
the
way
on
a
similar
effort
in
japan
in
the
late
s
from
until
billion
of
the
billion
in
asset
bought
by
ge
capital
be
outside
the
united
state
ge
capital
service
take
a
while
to
globalize
but
when
they
do
they
really
go
after
it
there
be
no
overnight
success
it
take
at
least
a
decade
to
make
the
thomson
medical
deal
work
the
same
be
true
of
our
acquisition
of
tungsram
yet
one
of
our
most
satisfy
accomplishment
be
take
over
three
government
own
company
cgr
nuovo
pignone
and
communist
control
tungsram
and
transform
them
into
highly
energize
organization
and
profitable
company
some
idea
didn
t
pan
out
when
we
picked
a
business
to
crack
the
chinese
market
we
start
first
with
light
we
thought
that
our
typical
global
competitor
would
be
the
player
in
china
instead
it
turn
out
that
almost
every
local
mayor
be
put
up
light
bulb
facility
today
there
be
more
than
light
bulb
manufacturer
in
china
not
all
the
global
deal
we
try
to
do
get
off
the
ground
and
some
experience
left
a
bitter
taste
i
can
only
think
of
one
maybe
two
time
when
trust
and
integrity
broke
down
the
bad
example
of
that
be
in
when
paolo
and
i
go
to
eindhoven
in
the
netherlands
for
a
meeting
with
the
ceo
of
philip
n
v
we
have
heard
that
he
be
interested
in
sell
the
company
s
appliance
business
that
deal
would
have
give
us
a
strong
position
in
the
european
appliance
market
he
have
become
ceo
of
philip
in
the
mid
s
and
have
some
bold
idea
on
how
to
change
his
company
over
a
dinner
discussion
at
philip
house
he
told
us
that
he
want
to
sell
his
major
appliance
business
where
philip
be
the
second
large
european
player
and
would
consider
sell
philip
s
medical
business
he
wasn
t
even
sure
about
stay
in
light
even
though
the
dutch
company
be
our
big
competitor
in
light
bulb
he
like
semiconductor
and
consumer
electronics
after
the
dinner
we
be

and
literally
thousand
of
acquisition
partnership
and
deal
this
happen
rarely
and
only
once
as
blatantly
as
that
time
in
eindhoven
like
our
other
initiative
the
seed
bloom
into
a
garden
we
move
from
think
of
globalization
in
term
of
market
to
think
of
it
in
term
of
source
product
and
component
and
finally
tap
the
intellectual
capital
of
country
take
india
i
be
optimistic
about
the
country
s
brainpower
but
our
use
of
it
have
far
outpace
my
wild
dream
the
scientific
and
technical
talent
in
india
to
do
software
development
design
work
and
basic
research

open
a
central
million
r
d

in
have
go
to
the
second
phase
and
will
more
than
triple
our
investment
when
it
s
complete
in
it
will
be
the
large
multidisciplinary
research
facility
in
ge
worldwide
eventually
employ
more
than
engineer
and
scientist
today
we
have
over

have
well
quality
low

buy

brazilian

shop
which
would
give
us
the

the
engine
service
business
have

up
from

have
bought
out

out
what
it
would
take
to
buy
greenwich
bill
be
digest
celma
and
thought
we
have
enough
facility
and
could
grow
the
business
on
our
own
but
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
frantic
i
become
i
didn
t
want
to
take
the
chance
that
one
of
our
competitor
would
buy
greenwich
before
us
i
urge
gene
and
bill
to
think
about
it
overnight

the
engineering

set
away
from

point
at
a
m
in
the
hospital
i
turn

go
right
i
be
lucky
to
have
a
great
surgeon
cary
perform
a
quintuple
bypass
in
three
hour
since
then
he
and
i
have
become
very
good
friend
we
see
each
other
once
or
twice
a
year
outside
the
hospital
bypass
surgery
knock
you
for
a
loop
at
first
every
part
of
you
hurt
like
hell
fortunately
you
feel
a
lot
well
every
day
i
return
to
the
office
on
july
and
i
be
back
on
the
golf
course
by
the
end
of
the
month
in
mid
august
i
won
my
first
three
match
but
lose
in
the
hole
final
of
the
sankaty
head
club
championship
in
nantucket
when
i
be
home
recuperate
from
the
surgery
larry
bossidy
call
and
suggest
that
he
withdraw
from
the
cec
meeting
in
june
he
be
concerned
it
might
look
like
he
be
come
back
to
ge
with
me
on
the
sideline
i
appreciate
his
sensitivity
and
told
him
not
to
worry
go
give
them
everything
you
ve
get
on
six
sigma
i
sense
we
might
be
at
an
important
moment
i
knew
larry
be
the
perfect
person
to
help
for
year
as
colleague
neither
of
us
have
be
fan
of
the
quality
movement
we
both
felt
that
the
earlier
quality
program
be
too
heavy
on
slogan
and
light
on
result
in
the
early
s
we
flirt
with
a
deming
program
in
our
aircraft
engine
business
i
didn
t
buy
it
as
a
companywide
initiative
because
i
thought
it
be
too
theoretical
the
rumbling
within
ge
be
unmistakable
in
our
april
employee
survey
quality
emerge
as
a
concern
of
many
employee
the
new
larry
have
become
fervent
about
six
sigma
he
say
for
most
company
the
average
be
defect
per
million
operation
get
to
a
six
sigma
quality
level
mean
that
you
have
few
than
defect
per
million
operation
in
a
manufacturing
or
service
process
that
s
percent
of
perfection
in
industry
thing
generally
go
right
about
time
out
of
that
s
between
three
and
four
sigma
for
example
quality
like
this
mean
incorrect
surgical
operation
per
week
lose
article
of
mail
per
hour
and
hundred
of
thousand
of
wrong
drug
prescription
fill
per
year
not
much
fun
to
think
about
by
all
account
larry
make
a
great
pitch
to
our
troop
he
demonstrate
that
allied
get
real
cost
saving
not
just
feel
good
benefit
our
team
love
what
he
say
and
i
receive
positive
phone
call
from
several
attendee
i
come
back
to
work
and
conclude
larry
really
love
six
sigma
the
team
thought
it
be
right
and
i
have
the
survey
which
say
quality
be
a
problem
at
ge
once
everything
come
together
i
go
nut
about
six
sigma
and
launch
it
we
put
two
key
guy
on
it
gary
reiner
head
of
corporate
initiative
and
bob
nelson
my
longtime
financial
analyst
ran
a
cost
benefit
analysis
they
show
that
if
ge
be
run
at
three
to
four
sigma
the
cost
save
opportunity
of
raise
this
quality
to
six
sigma
be
somewhere
between
billion
and
billion
this
amount
to
a
huge
number
percent
to
percent
of
sale
with
that
opportunity
it
wasn
t
rocket
science
for
us
to
decide
to
take
a
big
swing
at
six
sigma
as
with
each
of
our
major
initiative
when
we
decide
to
go
forward
we
do
so
with
a
vengeance
the
first
thing
we
do
be
appoint
gary
reiner
as
permanent
head
of
six
sigma
with
his
clear
think
and
relentless
focus
he
be
the
perfect
bridge
to
transmit
our
passion
into
the
program
we
then
brought
in
mikel
harry
a
former
motorola
manager
who
be
run
the
six
sigma
academy
in
scottsdale
arizona
if
there
be
a
six
sigma
zealot
harry
s
the
guy
we
invite
him
to
our
annual
officer
meeting
in
crotonville
in
october
i
cancel
our
usual
golf
out
a
symbolic
gesture
if
there
ever
be
one
so
that
of
us
could
listen
to
harry
talk
about
his
program
for
four
solid
hour
he
jumped
excitedly
from
one
easel
to
another
write
down
all
kind
of
statistical
formula
i
couldn
t
tell
if
he
be
a
madman
or
a
visionary
most
of
the
crowd
include
me
didn
t
understand
much
of
the
statistical
language
nonetheless
harry
s
presentation
succeed
in
capture
our
imagination
he
have
give
us
enough
practical
example
to
show
there
be
something
to
this
most
left
the
session
that
day
somewhat
frustrate
with
our
lack
of
statistical
comprehension
but
excite
about
the
program
s
possibility
the
discipline
from
the
approach
be
particularly
appeal
to
the
engineer
in
the
room
i
sense
it
be
a
lot
more
than
statistic
for
engineer
but
i
didn
t
have
any
idea
just
how
much
more
it
would
become
the
big
myth
be
that
six
sigma
be
about
quality
control
and
statistic
it
be
that
but
it
s
a
helluva
lot
more
ultimately
it
drive
leadership
to
be
well
by
provide
tool
to
think
through
tough
issue
at
six
sigma
s
core
be
an
idea
that
can
turn
a
company
inside
out
focus
the
organization
outward
on
the
customer
we
roll
out
the
six
sigma
program
at
boca
in
january
we
can
wait
no
longer
i
say
everyone
in
this
room
must
lead
the
quality
charge
there
can
be
no
spectator
on
this
what
take
motorola
ten
year
we
must
do
in
five
not
through
shortcut
but
in
learn
from
others
i
thought
the
short
range
financial
impact
alone
would
justify
the
program
longer
range
i
thought
it
could
be
even
big
in
my
boca
close
i
call
six
sigma
the
most
ambitious
undertaking
the
company
have
ever
take
on
quality
can
truly
change
ge
from
one
of
the
great
company
to
absolutely
the
great
company
in
world
business
once
again
i
be
go
over
the
top
we
left
boca
that
year
really
psyched
to
make
six
sigma
a
big
hit
we
told
the
business
ceo
to
make
their
best
people
six
sigma
leader
that
meant
take
our
people
off
their
exist
job
and
give
them
two
year
project
assignment
to
qualify
them
for
what
be
call
black
belt
in
six
sigma
terminology
the
first
four
month
of
the
assignment
would
be
take
up
with
classroom
training
and
application
of
the
tool
every
assign
project
have
to
tie
into
the
business
objective
and
the
bottom
line
black
belt
project
sprang
up
in
every
business
improve
call
center
response
rate
increase
factory
capacity
and
reduce
billing
error
and
inventory
a
fundamental
requirement
in
our
six
sigma
program
be
that
we
measure
it
we
have
a
financial
analyst
certify
the
result
of
every
project
we
also
train
thousand
as
six
sigma
green
belt
green
belt
underwent
a
ten
day
training
period
to
learn
six
sigma
concept
and
enough
tool
to
solve
problem
in
their
everyday
work
environment
they
didn
t
leave
their
current
job
instead
they
gain
a
methodology
to
improve
everyday
performance
in
the
top
management
class
which
i
call
six
sigma
for
little
folk
we
do
all
kind
of
experiment
to
capture
the
concept
we
make
paper
airplane
flung
them
across
the
room
and
measure
where
they
land
i
say
to
the
black
belt
teacher
that
i
hop
our
employee
weren
t
look
in
the
window
to
see
us
play
with
paper
airplane
watch
them
land
all
over
the
room
be
our
introduction
to
variance
as
with
every
initiative
we
back
it
up
with
our
reward
system
we
change
our
incentive
compensation
plan
for
the
entire
company
so
that
percent
of
the
bonus
be
base
on
financials
and
percent
on
six
sigma
result
in
february
we
focus
our
stock
option
grant
on
employee
who
be
in
black
belt
training
these
be
suppose
to
be
our
best
when
the
request
for
option
recommendation
go
out
in
february
the
phone
call
start
come
in
a
typical
phone
call
go
something
like
this
jack
i
don
t
have
enough
option
we
didn
t
get
enough
for
the
business
what
do
you
mean
you
get
enough
option
to
make
sure
all
the
black
belt
be
cover
yeah
but
we
couldn
t
give
option
exclusively
to
our
black
belt
we
have
to
take
care
of
a
lot
of
other
people
why
i
thought
the
black
belt
be
your
best
people
they
re
the
one
that
should
be
get
the
option
well
they
aren
t
all
our
best
they
d
say
my
reply
be
get
only
your
best
people
in
the
six
sigma
program
and
give
them
the
option
we
don
t
have
any
more
to
give
you
i
always
want
the
reward
system
to
make
sure
we
be
get
the
best
people
into
every
initiative
no
one
want
to
give
up
their
best
talent
on
a
full
time
basis
they
ve
get
high
target
to
reach
and
need
their
best
manager
to
make
them
we
get
push
back
on
the
six
sigma
initiative
at
first
only
a
quarter
or
perhaps
half
of
the
black
belt
candidate
be
the
best
and
brightest
they
fake
the
rest
one
of
the
more
notable
experience
come
in
an
s
i
strategy
review
with
ge
capital
s
commercial
finance
business
head
by
mike
gaudino
this
be
a
transaction
business
that
deal
mostly
with
non
investment
grade
company
find
a
six
sigma
leader
among
these
deal
maker
wasn
t
easy
this
become
apparent
at
the
s
i
in
we
ask
all
the
ceo
to
bring
in
their
six
sigma
leader
to
show
their
progress
on
the
initiative
mike
have
found
someone
to
fill
the
job
now
he
have
to
sit
through
and
watch
his
guy
give
an
air
ball
presentation
it
be
clear
to
everyone
in
the
room
that
six
sigma
wasn
t
go
anywhere
in
this
business
the
standard
joke
be
that
the
six
sigma
leader
decide
to
leave
before
the
elevator
reach
the
ground
floor
at
headquarters
the
next
time
mike
wasn
t
go
to
take
any
chance
he
put
in
one
of
his
star
as
a
replacement
steve
sargent
take
over
and
do
a
great
job
later
become
ge
capital
s
six

leader
in
he
be
promote
again
to
be

of
our
european
equipment
finance
business
the
s
i
review
process
work
mike
get
a
well
quality
program
and
five
year
later
ge
have
a
new
ceo
for
one
of
its
business
we
also
use
the
stock
option
program
for
black
belt
to
smoke
out
the
weak
link
if
this
or
any
initiative
be
go
to
be
successful
it
have
to
start
with
the
best
i
become
a
fanatic
about
it
insist
that
no
one
would
be
consider
for
a
management
job
without
at
least
green
belt
training
by
the
end
of
even
with
my
constant
cheerlead
and
a
lot
of
pound
in
session
c
and
everywhere
else
it
take
us
three
year
to
get
all
the
best
people
into
six
sigma
at
one
review
the
nuclear
business
give
us
the
name
of
a
candidate
mark
savoff
to
head
up
the
service
side
their
recommendation
didn
t
make
his
six
sigma
credential
clear
bill
conaty
our
human
resource
head
phone
out
to
california
and
say
we
d
like
to
have
him
come
in
and
talk
to
us
about
his
six
sigma
qualification
mark
flew
from
san
jose
to
fairfield
and
convince
us
that
he
be
deeply
commit
to
six

he
get
the
job
and
have
since
be
promote
to
run
the
total
ge
nuclear
business
today
the
six
sigma
qualification
be
make
clear
before
anybody
be
recommend
for
anything
in
the
first
full
year
we
train
employee
spent
about
million
on
the
training
and
get
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of

in

we
have
some
good

about

get
all
the
sony
business
and
we
be
out
in
the
cold
a
black
belt
team
solve
the
problem
and
design
a
change
in
the

we
go
from

sony

in
the

we
use

all
over
the
company
to
attack
cost
improve
productivity
and
fix
broken
process
one
business
admittedly
an
extreme
found
that
by
use
six
sigma
it
could
increase
the
capacity
of
their
factory
eliminate
the
need
for
any
capacity
investment
for
a
decade
the
next
phase
be
to
use
six
sigma
s
statistical
tool
to
fix
and
design
new
product
nowhere
do
this
prove
to
be
more
important
than
in
power
system
in
the
mid
s
when
demand
for
power
plant
be
modest
we
be
have
force
outage
in
our
newly
design
gas
turbine
power
plant
rotor
be
crack
due
to
high
vibration
a
third
of
the
operating
unit
in
the
instal
base
have
to
be
remove
in
use
six
sigma
process
we
reduce
the
vibration
by
percent
and
fix
the
problem
in
late
since
then
with
a
fleet
of
more
than
unit
today
we
haven
t
have
a
single
unplanned
removal
well
than
six
sigma
solve
this
problem
put
us
in
the
lead
of
the
new
technology
gas
turbine
market
just
in
time
for
the
power
surge
that
would
come
in
the
late
s
it
give
ge
the
major
share
of
the
global
market
for
new
power
plant
in
new
product
design
our
medical
system
business
take
the
lead
the
first
major
six
sigma
design
product
to
hit
the
market
be
a
new
ct
scanner
call
the
lightspeed
which
come
out
in
a
chest
scan
that
take
a
conventional
scanner
three
minute
to
perform
take
only
second
with
this
new
product
even
well
i
get
a
letter
from
a
radiologist
who
write
that
he
be
amaze
that
a
million
machine
could
be
take
out
of
a
box
plug
into
a
wall
and
it
would
work
immediately
that
be
six
sigma
at
its
best
in
the
last
three
year
medical
launch
new
six
sigma
design
product
in
percent
of
medical
s
overall
revenue
will
come
from
six
sigma
design
and
every
new
product
that
hit
the
market
have
it
today
all
our
business
be
aim
to
do
this
we
go
from
six
sigma
project
in
to
in
when
we
achieve
million
in
productivity
gain
and
profit
more
than
double
our
original
goal
of
million
the
benefit
be
show
up
in
our
financial
result
by
we
have
generate
million
in
six
sigma
saving
over
and
above
our
investment
and
would
get
billion
in
saving
the
next
year
our
operating
margin
go
from
percent
in
to
percent
in
six
sigma
be
work
we
like
the
result
but
too
often
we
be
hearing
that
our
customer
weren
t
feel
the
difference
in
quality
we
thought
the
problem
be
that
many
of
the
product
in
the
field
have
be
in
development
for
year
before
six
sigma
be
start
it
take
a
trip
to
spain
to
find
a
solution
in
june
i
be
think
of
hire
a
full
time
vice
president
of
six
sigma
the
first
and
only
new
staff
job
i
create
as
ceo
i
be
visit
our
new
plastic
facility
in
cartagena
spain
for
a
project
review
with
piet
van
abeelen
and
his
team
piet
be
global
manager
of
manufacturing
for
plastic
and
have
demonstrate
the
power
of
six
sigma
in
one
of
his
factory
in
bergen
op
zoom
on
the
coast
of
the
netherlands
use
six
sigma
piet
and
his
team
double
lexan
output
from
ton
per
week
to
ton
without
add
significant
investment
piet
have
the
best
practical
handle
on
just
what
six
sigma
could
do
and
the
skill
to
explain
it
in
the
simplest
term
we
be
have
lunch
on
the
back
porch
of
a
hacienda
on
our
cartagena
site
i
ask
piet
if
he
would
be
interested
in
come
to
fairfield
to
take
a
new
staff
job
i
be
think
about
create
i
told
piet
he
would
have
a
very
small
group
two
to
three
people
establish
to
teach
and
transfer
six
sigma
learn
across
the
company
the
teacher
in
him
and
there
be
a
lot
of
it
found
the
job
appeal
despite
the
fact
that
he
be
currently
run
a
huge
global
manufacturing
operation
with
thousand
of
employee
fortunately
he
sign
on
it
be
piet
who
come
up
with
the
answer
to
why
our
customer
weren
t
feel
our
six
sigma
improvement
piet
s
reason
be
simple
he
get
all
of
us
to
understand
that
six
sigma
be
about
one
thing
variation
we
have
all
study
it
include
me
in
the
class
with
the
paper
airplane
but
we
never
saw
it
the
way
piet
laid
it
out
he
make
the
connection
between
average
and
variation
it
be
a
breakthrough
we
get
away
from
average
and
focus
on
variation
by
tighten
what
we
call
span
we
want
the
customer
to
get
what
they
want
when
they
want
it
span
measure
the
variance
from
the
exact
date
the
customer
want
the
product
either
day
early
or
day
late
get
span
to
zero
mean
the
customer
always
get
the
product
when
they
ask
for
them
internally
our
problem
be
that
we
be
measure
improvement
base
on
an
average
a
figure
that
calculate
only
our
manufacturing
or
service
cycle
without
regard
to
the
customer
if
we
reduce
product
delivery
time
from
an
average
of
day
to
day
for
example
we
saw
it
as
a
percent
improvement
see
opposite
foolishly
we
be
celebrate
our
customer
however
felt
nothing
except
variance
and
unpredictability
some
customer
get
their
order
day
late
while
others
get
them
day
early
we
use
six
sigma
and
a
customer
orient
perspective
involve
span
to
guide
us
that
reduce
the
delivery
span
from
day
to
now
customer
really
felt
the
improvement
because
order
arrive
closer
to

ve
always
have
great
functional

give

just
the

at
my
crotonville
session
in
the
last
couple
of

i
use
to
joke
that
the
reason
i
be
so
slow
on
the
uptake
for
e
business
be
that
we
be
perfect
six
sigma
first
when
i
eventually
write
my
book
i
told
the
class
i
ll
write
that
we
knew
we
have
to
adopt
the
six
sigma
initiative
at
ge
before
we
tackle
e
business
e
business
rely
on
speed
and
accurate

six
sigma
give
us
that
the
class
would
roar
with
laughter
they
be
young
and
wiser
and
knew
i
have
be
slow
to
understand
the
impact
of
the
internet
that
transformation
be
next

e
business
the
internet
revolution
nearly
pass
me
by
until
jane
make
me
comfortable
with
it
she
have
be
use
the
net
for
year
to
keep
up
with
friend
many
night
i
d
be
go
through
my
work
paper
while
she
would
sit
across
from
me
plug
in
and
type
away
jane
start
buying
and
sell
stock
online
in
keep
track
of
her
portfolio
on
the
internet
she
be
do
so
well
that
i
ask
her
to
watch
over
mine
wherever
we
go
jane
s
laptop
come
along
with
us
whenever
she
try
to
convince
me
to
use
a
laptop
on
my
own
i
resist
think
my
inability
to
type
hardly
make
it
worth
it
jack
she
protest
you
can
teach
a
monkey
to
type
in
late
however
i
begin
to
hear
about
people
at
work
do
their
christmas
shopping
online
finally
i
take
it
seriously
and
developed
my
boca
remark
over
the
christmas
holiday
around
the
importance
of
the
internet
those
be
word
that
would
get
us
go
but
the
internet
would
really
get
into
my
blood
three
month
later
jane
and
i
be
at
a
resort
in
mexico
in
april
of
to
celebrate
our
tenth
wedding
anniversary
this
time
she
wasn
t
any
more
romantic
than
i
be
in
barbados
jane
be
absorbed
by
her
laptop
one
afternoon
she
told
me
that
people
online
be
talk
about
the
possibility
of
a
ge
stock
split
and
my
succession
plan
she
call
me
over
to
look
at
the
ge
message
board
on
yahoo
and
i
be
take
in
by
what
people
be
say
about
the
company
it
s
okay
to
look
jane
say
laugh
but
you
can
never
answer
she
coaxed
me
into
write
a
few
e
mail
and
take
me
through
a
few
site
as
our
vacation
continued
i
begin
to
get
the
urge
to
go
online
to
check
the
news
and
late
comment
about
ge
once
i
even
skip
out
on
jane
at
poolside
return
to
our
room
and
flip
on
the
computer
she
walk
in
minute
later
only
to
find
me
hunch
over
her
laptop
she
knew
i
be
hooked
it
be
barbados
all
over
again
i
come
to
the
e
party
late
but
when
it
hit
me
it
hit
me
hard
i
finally
saw
what
impact
this
new
technology
could
have
on
ge
i
be
not
exactly
sure
what
when
and
how
i
only
knew
we
have
to
dive
in
with
a
vengeance
in
the
dot
com
atmosphere
of
the
late
s
everyone
be
quick
to
write
off
the
big
old
company
everything
be
focus
on
anyone
start
a
new
internet
business
one
thing
i
never
fell
for
be
the
popular
line
old
versus
new
economy
people
be
only
buying
and
sell
good
over
the
internet
just
as
they
do
a
hundred
year
ago
from
a
wagon
the
only
difference
be
the
technology
yes
this
new
buying
and
sell
be
faster
and
more
global
and
it
have
profound
ramification
on
business
the
big
insight
for
us
come
when
we
realize
create
business
site
on
the
internet
be
not
nobel
prize
work
we
saw
this
when
transportation
show
everyone
how
easily
and
inexpensively
an
auction
site
could
be
developed
once
we
knew
digitize
be
easy
it
become
obvious
that
big
company
that
get
the
message
have
little
to
be
afraid
of
and
in
fact
have
nothing
but
upside
i
drew
a
chart
that
help
me
understand
the

its

for

the

use
the

all
over
the

and
with
the

community
it
generate
a
lot
of

be
helpful
to
calm
any

who
thought
they
might
be

the

six

be
in

to

be
the

if
there
be
any

a
whole
new
lemon
a

and
perhaps
even
a
watermelon
all
on
a

we
saw
the

opportunity
in
three
piece

what
we
as

even
get
a

would
bring
us
significant

initially
we
be
hearing
about
saving
of
between
percent

on
nearly
everything
we
bought
by
the
time
it
drop

the

the

turn
out
to
be

hockey
without
the
goalie
at
ge
we
be
learn
a
lot
but
there
still
be
tremendous
pressure
on
us
to
mimic
the
dot
com
buy
and
sell
model
and
jump
into
thing
that
could
be
counterproductive
a
good
example
be
the
third
party
electronic
exchange
we
like
others
almost
forgot
a
cardinal
rule
of
business
never
allow
anyone
to
get
between
you
and
your
customer
or
your
supplier
those
relationship
take
too
long
to
develop
and
be
too
valuable
to
lose
a
good
example
of
what
we
avoid
be
plasticsnet
an
online
aggregator
in
the
plastic
business
it
have
no
product
other
than
what
they
could
source
and
be
take
a
cut
of
everything
they
sell
become
a
middleman
at
a
time
when
the
net
be
suppose
to
get
rid
of
people
who
stood
between
the
maker
and
the
buyer
on
our
side
we
have
polymerland
com
gary
rogers
then
ceo
of

be
elect
vice
chairman
in
june
of
be
on
the
lead
edge
of
e
business
in
the
company
unlike
plasticsnet
he
knew
we
have
the
product
to
sell
and
the
information
to
sell
it
at
the
time
polymerland
be
do
less
than
a
week
in
online
sale
not
much
to
speak
of
but
more
than
plasticsnet
be
do
to
build
this
business
plastic
change
their
incentive
sale
plan
to
encourage
online
sale
and
put
full
time
e
business
specialist
in
the
region
to
get
customer
comfortable
buying
online
i

a
fanatic
about
the
plastic
model

the
management
team
with
phone
call
and
e
mail
i
d
get
their
number
daily
it
be
a
great
learn
experience
and
lot
of
fun
everyone
get
tire
of
hearing
me
talk
about
the
plastic
site
and
start
swarm
all
over
the
polymerland
people
the
learn

spread
we
originally
thought
plastic
might
reach
million
in
online
sale
in
the
business
hit
billion
we
underestimated
the
opportunity
we
hadn
t
dream
big
enough
because
we
have
thought
it
be
brain
surgery
it
wasn
t
today
polymerland
sell
million
a
week
and
will
reach
billion
in
annual
sale
in
plastic
wasn
t
alone
in
we
do
billion
in
online
sale
across
the
company
while
most
of
these
revenue
be
from
exist
customer
who
move
online
we
also
gain
new
customer
and
increase
share
from
exist
customer
another
folly
of
ours
during
the
height
of
the
dot

frenzy
be
our
desire
to
build
site
any

it
be
a
reflection
of
our
enthusiasm
and
energy

by

be
create
to
look
pretty
but
never

that
if
you
couldn
t
monetize
the

either
directly
with

indirectly
with

t
have
built
it
our

when

lesson
come
from
john

he
urge
us
to
shut
down
the
parallel
path
of

off

until
we
do
that
people
would
still
rely
on

and
wouldn
t
really
use

today
it
s
not
uncommon
to
have
ge
business
leader
say
that
no
paper
be
allow
in
their

it
be
a
great
mind
set

to
an

from
our

their
business
leader
outline
a
strategy
to
remove
from

what
he
call
touchpoints
the
step
of
the
approval
process
where
paper
have
to
be
handle
by
an
employee
if
they
could
do
it
they
estimate
that
as
much
as
percent
of
their

cost
would
come
out
of
the

it
be
the
begin
of
our
e
make

we
figure
out
that

saving

total
overhead

stagger
we
always
fought
to
be
more
efficient
in

reduction

the

this
more
efficiently
we
re
increase
the

on

hop
to
gain
final
approval
from
the
european
commission
for
ge
s
billion
acquisition
of
honeywell
international
honeywell
chairman
mike
bonsignore
and
i
have
announce
the
deal
eight
long
month
earlier
at
nbc
s
saturday
night
live
studio
in
new
york
since
then
thousand
of
people
from
both
company
have
work
feverishly
to
put
the
merger
plan
in
place
when
mike
smith
honeywell
s
head
of
avionics
and
i
board
the
plane
in
new
york
our
team
in
brussels
have
already
take
an
important
step
toward
resolve
issue
raise
by
the
european
merger
task
force
earlier
in
the
week
we
d
offer
to
divest
about
million
in
honeywell
s
aerospace
sale
one
of
the
large
divestiture
propose
to
secure
approval
of
a
merger
by
the
european
commission
those
concession
include
the
divestiture
of
honeywell
s
new
aircraft
engine
for
regional
jet
and
honeywell
s
engine
starter
whose
customer
include
ge
and
our
large
engine
rival
roll
royce
and
pratt
whitney
we
felt
the
concession
be
meaningful
and
sufficient
since
antitrust
official
in
the
united
state
and
other
country
have
already
consider
both
divestiture
unnecessary
i
have
be
surprised
the
night
before
we
left
when
competition
commissioner
mario
monti
s
office
call
while
i
be
in
boston
speak
at
a
harvard
business
school
class
day
to
cancel
a
face
to
face
meeting
schedule
for
that
friday
this
obviously
wasn
t
a
good
sign
nevertheless
as
we
be
fly
toward
brussels
our
team
remain
at
the
negotiate
table
assess
the
task
force
s
reaction
to
what
we
have
propose
these
negotiation
be
difficult
because
the
task
force
asks
you
to
keep
come
up
with
solution
in
effect
you
re
negotiate
against
yourself
despite
the
obstacle
i
be
hop
to
finish
the
negotiation
and
close
the
deal
on
the
plane
i
be
go
through
a
briefing
book
with
mike
smith
in
the
likely
event
the
commission
would
demand
more
than
our
earlier
offer
mike
be
help
me
understand
the
strategic
implication
of
each
piece
of
his
avionics
business
i
be
try
to
find
some
million
to
million
sweetener
that
might
satisfy
the
demand
of
the
commission
it
be
a
painful
process
mike
and
his
team
have
built
many
of
these
business
from
scratch
as
we
be
talk
about
possible
product
line
divestiture
i
felt
like
i
be
take
his
child
away
if
some
bos
have
sell
a
piece
of
my
plastic
business
it
would
have
torn
out
a
part
of
my
stomach
all
of
a
sudden
i
get
a
telephone
call
on
the
plane
from
dennis
dammerman
and
ben
heineman
in
brussels
the
task
force
be
ask
for
billion
not
million
more
in
additional
concession
mike
and
i
close
our
briefing
book
tweak
weren
t
go
to
get
this
deal
do
the
deal
the
medium
call
the
big
industrial
acquisition
in
history
start
off
innocently
enough
on

india
be
in
town
to
celebrate
the
listing
of

along
to

off
to
a
fast
start
after

m
we
go
on
the

turn
and
stuck
a
microphone
in
my
face
the
journalist
bob
pisani
ask
what
i
thought
of
a
break
report
that
united
technology
might
buy
honeywell
it
s
an
interest
idea
i
manage
to
say
what
be
you
go
to
do
about
it
he
ask
we
ll
have
to
go
back
and
think
about
it

share
the
news
from
bob
pisani
come
as
a
complete
surprise
and
it
really
grabbed
me
we
have
look
at
honeywell
earlier
in
the
year
i
thought
it
might
be
a
good
fit
with
ge
honeywell
s
business
be
complementary
to
our
own
in
three
key
area
aircraft
engine
industrial
system
and
plastic
at
the
product
level
there
be
no
direct
overlap
honeywell
for
example
be
a
leader
in
the
small
business
jet
engine
field
ge
be
the
leader
in
large
jet
engine
in
total
the
deal
would
add
billion
in
revenue
and
employee
to
ge
in
early
february
of
after
our
staff
take
a
close
look
at
the
financial
picture
no
one
like
it
at
the
price
we
then
thought
would
be
necessary
to
acquire
honeywell
the
stock
be
then
trading
in
the
to
range
since

in
early
i

final
candidate
to
bring
them
up
to
speed
on
what
we
might
do
all
of
them
want
to
go
for
it
especially
jim
mcnerney
ceo
of
our
aircraft
engine
business
in
the
past
few
week
in
fact
mcnerney
and
dave
calhoun
his
chief
operating
officer
have
be
work
with
a
team
of
outside
banker
look
at
a
possible
honeywell
deal
they
be
propose
we
do
the
acquisition
i
also
knew
that
lloyd
trotter
ceo
of
ge
industrial
system
like
honeywell
s
industrial
business
even
before
honeywell
s
merger
with
alliedsignal
lloyd
have
look
at
it
favorably
the
next
morning
on
friday
team
of
ge
people
pile
into
a
couple
of
helicopter
in
fairfield
load
with
data
from
the
previous
internal
review
and
come
to
new
york
i
call
bill
harrison
chairman
of
chase
manhattan
and
ask
if
his
vice
chairman
and
head
of
investment
banking
geoff
boisi
would
be
available
as
an
adviser
he
be
and
soon
rush
over
to
ge
s
office
in
rockefeller
center
to
go
over
the
number
with
our
team
we
brought
jim
mcnerney
and
dave
calhoun
into
the
discussion
by
videoconference
they
believe
the
high
tech
avionics
piece
of
honeywell
fit
perfectly
with
our
aircraft
engine
business
with
no
overlap
at
all
honeywell
s
small
engine
business
put
us
into
a
market
where
we
have
no
offering
to
compete
with
either
roll
or
pratt
lloyd
trotter
s
analysis
on
the
industrial
side
show
the
same
thing
virtually
no
overlap
with
ge
s
product
toward
the
end
of
our
videoconference
we
conclude
that
we
could
make
a
modest
increase
in
the
offer
and
make
a
more
compelling
case
for
honeywell
than
ut
the
united
technology
deal
have
great
product
overlap
and
more
potential
for
antitrust
issue
we
realize
we
have
to
act
fast
we
heard
that
the
board
of
both
company
be
meeting
to
give
their
final
approval
to
the
merger
we
have
one
advantage
in
make
a
counteroffer
the
term
of
the
ut
acquisition
have
be
leak
we
knew
what
we
be
up
against
ut
plan
to
buy
honeywell
use
its
stock
the
transaction
value
honeywell
at
a
little
over
a
share
or
billion
in
total
i
thought
united
technology
be
get
a
good
deal
and
i
knew
we
could
offer
more
dennis
and
i
discuss
the
impact
the
deal
might
have
on
my
retirement
i
have
plan
to
leave
on
april
five
month
after
my
th
birthday
if
we
do
the
deal
i
d
have
to
stay
a
little
longer
to
see
it
through
i
couldn
t
throw
an
acquisition
like
this
on
top
of
a
guy
in
a
brand
new
job
on
the
other
hand
i
couldn
t
sit
on
my

let
the
big
deal
in
ge
history
go
by
if
we
get
honeywell
i
d
stay
a
while
but
we
wouldn
t
delay
our
decision
on
who
would
replace
me
that
person
would
be
chairman
elect
several

to
our

our

sunday
the
lawyer
and
investment
banker
be
work
to
finish
up
the
term
to
an
outsider
this
might
have
look
like
a
deal
that
turn
on
a
dime
in
truth
over
the
last
three
year
we
have
look
at
honeywell
when
alliedsignal
be
still
an
independent
company
jim
s
aircraft
team
have
study
the
number
when
honeywell
be
on
its
own
lloyd
s
industrial
team
have
look
at
it
once
allied
and
honeywell
merge
and
the
stock
drop
an
opening
occur
united
technology
bid
make
our
own
offer
appear
spontaneous
this
felt
a
lot
like
the
rca
deal
here
the
strategic
centerpiece
be
aircraft
acquire
honeywell
would
double
the
size
of
our
aircraft
business
give
us
a
broader
range
of
engine
and
something
we
didn
t
have
at
all
the
high
tech
avionics
the
brain
of
the
aircraft
the
acquisition
would
also
double
our
industrial
business
it
give
us
some
new
product
line
in
chemical
and
add
nylon
to
our
plastic
business
like
the
rca
deal
it
also
offer
some
niche
business
like
turbochargers
that
we
could
use
as
chip
go
forward
there
be
one
notable
difference
in
the
rca
deal
we
paid
percent
of
ge
s
market
value
to
get
percent
of
earnings
in
honeywell
we
be
pay
percent
of
our
market
value
to
get
percent
of
earnings
i
felt
we
could
do
so
much
more
with
honeywell
s
asset
by
do
what
we
ve
do
with
ge
push
more
aggressively
into
service
and
add
six
sigma
and
e
business
initiative
to
honeywell
s
operation
we
figure
on
billion
in
saving
from
these
initiative
and
other
productivity
measure
moreover
we
be
do
the
deal
at
a
time
of
great
strength
we
d
finish
the
year
with
record
earnings
of
billion
up
percent
and
record
revenue
of
billion
we
have
enjoy
five
straight
year
of
double
digit
growth
on
the
top
and
bottom
line
throughout
sunday
work
with
beth
comstock
head
of
public
relation
for
ge
we
flesh
out
the
detail
of
how
to
disclose
the
news
of
the
deal
to
both
wall
street
analyst
and
the
news
medium
beth
be
a
star
i
found
her
at
nbc
where
she
first
head
up
public
relation
for
news
and
then
serve
as
pr
head
of
the

she
be
by
far
the
high
ranked
talent
that
come
to
ge
from
nbc
as
more
detail
leak
beth
field
the
rush
of
telephone
call
from
reporter
on
sunday
morning
and
make
all
the
plan
for
the
press
conference
to
announce
the
deal
i
knew
the
medium
would
make
a
big
deal
out
of
my
stay
as
ceo
i
didn
t
want
this
to
be
a
story
about
me
hang
on
to
my
job
the
easy
thing
in
the
world
would
have
be
to
walk
out
with
a
drum
roll
at
one
point
i
suggest
to
beth
that
at
our
press
conference
we
show
a
slide
of
a
guy
hold
on
for
dear
life
by
his
fingertip
i
thought
we
might
as
well
poke
fun
at
that
news
angle
it
turn
out
we
couldn
t
get
the
slide
together
quickly
enough
in
any
event
we
have
all
the
paper
sign
late
sunday
night
the
next
morning
mike
bonsignore
and
i
have
a
quick
breakfast
together
then
we
do
four
solid
hour
of
medium
and
analyst
interview
it
start
with
a
a
m
press
conference
before
a
packed
house
in
nbc
studio
h
where
saturday
night
live
be
broadcast
mike
and
i
sat
on
stage
in
director
chair
fielding
the
question
i
d
like
you
to
meet
my
date
for
the
last
hour
he
s
right
mike
say
i
ve
spent
more
time
with
jack
than
i
ve
be
with
my
wife
in
the
past
hour
we
laid
out
the
rationale
for
the
deal
i
try
to
lay
to
rest
any
notion
that
we
do
the
acquisition
so
i
could
stay
in
the
job
longer
this
be
not
a
story
of
the
old
fool
who
can
t
leave
his
seat
i
say
don
t
worry
i
m
not
go
to
do
another
billion
deal
to
hang
around
another
six
month
when
someone
ask
about
get
approval
from
the
regulatory
agency
i
say
there
should
be
no
problem
at
all
i
predict
the
deal
would
close
sometime
in
february
this
be
the
cleanest
deal
you
ll
ever
see
i
still
believe
that
and
so
do
just
about
everybody
except
the
european
commission
that
night
i
be
feel
pretty
good
about
myself
the
day
have
go
well
from
our
medium
interview
to
our
session
with
wall
street
analyst
it
be
a
long
day
so
i
stayed
in
new
york
rather
than
return
home
to
fairfield
while
take
my
contact
lens
out
i
scratch
the
cornea
of
one
eye
i
be
in
bed
try
to
get
to
sleep
but
the
pain
be
overwhelm
i
call
my
doctor
who
suggest
that
i
immediately
go
to
new
york
hospital
as
luck
would
have
it
i
get
a
taxi
driver
who
couldn
t
speak
english
he
end
up
take
me
first
to
the
wrong
address
when
i
finally
reach
the
hospital
s
emergency
room
after
midnight
it
be
crammed
with
people
it
take
me
two
hour
to
get
in
to
see
a
doctor
who
relieve
the
pain
quickly
i
go
back
out
on
first
avenue
try
to
get
a
taxi
it
take
a
little
while
to
get
one
i
didn
t
hit
the
sack
until
after
a
m
talk
about
be
brought
up
short
my
escapade
in
the
middle
of
the
night
brought
me
back
to
reality
fast
in
retrospect
it
might
have
be
a
bad
omen
the
last
thing
i
ever
expect
be
a
long
antitrust
review
by
the
european
commission
the
commission
s
approval
of
the
alliedsignal
and
honeywell
merger
in
the
last
year
give
me
confidence
that
we
wouldn
t
have
a
problem
honeywell
only
have
to
make
a
few
behavioral
remedy
and
a
minor
roughly
million
concession
to
thales
a
french
electronics
company
to
get
approval
it
s
true
the
european
commission
have
derail
a
big
telecommunication
merger
between
worldcom
and
sprint
along
with
a
merger
between
time
warner
and
emi
those
deal
have
product
overlap
the
first
inkling
of
trouble
for
us
come
in
january
we
begin
hearing
that
thales
be
back
again
lobbying
the
commission
to
press
for
all
kind
of
honeywell
divestiture
i
flew
to
brussels
on
january
for
a
get
acquaint
meeting
with
commissioner
monti
and
his
staff
john
vassallo
ge
s
liaison
for
the
european
union
and
our
outside
lawyer
join
me
for
this
session
i
be
ask
the
commission
to
give
us
what
they
call
a
phase
decision
by
march
if
they
didn
t
a
lengthy
phase
proceed
would
take
us
into
july
commissioner
monti
open
the
meeting
make
the
point
that
the
cooperation
between
the
staff
be
excellent
and
highly
appreciate
after
some
discussion
of
the
procedure
i
emphasize
the
urgency
for
a
phase
approval
acknowledge
that
every
company
that
show
up
there
do
the
same
in
this
case
we
have
a
strong
reason
to
get
phase
approval
honeywell
and
alliedsignal
have
be
together
only
a
year
and
they
hadn
t
be
fully
integrate
any
undue
delay
would
far
exacerbate
their
problem
i
say
i
would
do
everything
i
could
to
be
sure
that
we
would
respond
quickly
to
commission
concern
i
told
the
commission
i
be
hearing
that
some
competitor
be
view
the
european
review
process
as
a
way
to
extort
a
goodie
bag
of
honeywell
asset
we
knew
their
mouth
be
water
to
get
these
business
commissioner
monti
respond
that
our
rival
wouldn
t
affect
the
deal
i
assure
you
that
extortionist
aspect
will
remain
outside
this
investigation
he
say
when
i
later
ask
if
he
would
give
the
same
weight
to
the
comment
of
customer
and
competitor
commissioner
monti
and
enrique
gonzalez
diaz
the
head
of
the
commission
s
merger
case
team
say
both
source
be
important
and
necessary
to
the
process
gonzalez
diaz
say
competitor
be
a
good
source
of
factual
information
and
he
have
to
listen
to
their
concern
but
he
add
i
take
these
most
often
with
a
pinch
of
salt
i
d
learn
the
full
meaning
of
that
phrase
later
do
any
of
you
think
i
should
be
do
anything
differently
i
ask
i
have
not
be
personally
through
this
type
of
process
before
i
think
you
be
do
everything
that
be
expect
commissioner
monti
reply
we
will
be
very
frank
and
look
for
all
way
to
improve
and
to
speed
up
the
process
i
guarantee
that
after
the
meeting
i
have
a
private
two
and
one
half
hour
lunch
with
commissioner
monti
i
found
him
gracious
smart
but
somewhat
formal
we
have
a
broad
range
conversation
and
i
felt
good
chemistry
between
us
nevertheless
he
insist
that
he
call
me
mr
welch
mr
monti
please
call
me
jack
i
say
i
ll
only
call
you
jack
when
the
deal
be
over
he
reply
nevertheless
i
left
our
lunch
optimistic
about
get
an
early
decision
however
by
mid
february
we
be
get
bad
vibe
it
look
like
the
task
force
be
go
to
launch
a
more
extensive
investigation
of
the
deal
something
that
would
take
up
to
four
more
month
i
decide
to
fly
back
to
brussels
hop
to
prevent
any
far
delay
i
left
my
home
in
florida
on
a
sunny
sunday
afternoon
february
and
flew
straight
to
brussels
we
touch
down
early
on
monday
morning
in
a
light
snow
ben
heineman
and
a
team
of
lawyer
come
aboard
for
a
strategy
session
before
all
of
us
drove
over
to
the
headquarters
of
the
european
commission
right
off
the
bat
commissioner
monti
read
from
note
and
appear
to
have
make
up
his
mind
to
push
the
deadline
back
to
july
i
argue
my
case
for
an
hour
and
thought
i
be
make
some
progress
i
built
the
argument
around
ge
s
european
performance
its
remarkable
success
energize
former
state
own
company
its
strong
european
presence
with
employee
and
the
lack
of
any
overlap
between
honeywell
and
ge
we
offer
nondivestiture
remedy
like
those
make
earlier
by
honeywell
alliedsignal
to
address
any
problem
again
i
emphasize
the
importance
of
a
quick
decision
commissioner
monti
seem
move
by
these
argument
and
suggest
we
go
back
to
our
hotel
while
he
and
his
staff
met
to
consider
the
point
i
have
make
we
get
a
call
to
return
about
p
m
only
to
learn
they
hadn
t
change
their
view
and
be
go
to
phase
more
troublesome
they
raise
some
unusual
objection
to
the
deal
that
go
far
beyond
traditional
antitrust
concern
they
want
to
study
the
range
effect
of
combine
ge
s
and
honeywell
s
overall
presence
in
the
aircraft
industry
i
found
commissioner
monti
pleasant
but
i
couldn
t
move
him
it
be
disappoint
but
i
guess
it
could
be
expect
there
be
nothing
in
it
for
the
commissoner
to
approve
the
deal
quickly
some
of
the
loud
complaint
be
come
from
his
european
constituent
particularly
roll
royce
and
thales
and
they
weren
t
alone
our
u
s
competitor
among
them
united
technology
and
rockwell
collins
be
also
a
loud
part
of
a
negative
chorus
i
be
still
optimistic
that
it
would
work
out
despite
the
regulatory
hurdle
in
get
the

complete
thousand
of

work
to
make
sure

of
objection
it
be
similar
to
what
they
d
say

justify
a
phase
look
but
in
much
more
detail
the

in
and
out
of
the
hearing
sometimes
for

share
of
ge
for

honeywell
share
to

of

it
be
unacceptable
jeff
immelt
who
have
be
involve
in
every
honeywell
decision
since
become
chairman
elect
in
december
agree
with
me
and
our
vice
chairman
that
the
proposal
didn
t
make
sense
we
all
felt
terrible
for
the
people
in
both
company
who
have
devote
month
to
the
deal
work
on
the
detail
of
the
integration
plan
but
we
couldn
t
go
along
with
honeywell
s
proposal
i
then
call
the
ge
board
explain
our
position
and
get
its
approval
to
turn
down
honeywell
s
propose
revision
of
the
merger
agreement
this
be
not
a
hard
decision
the
commission
have
destroyed
the
strategic
reason
for
do
the
deal
what
the
commission
be
seek
cut
the
heart
out
of
the
strategic
rationale
of
our
deal
i
write
in
a
letter
to
mike
the
new
deal
you
propose
in
response
to
the
commission
make
no
sense
for
our
shareowner
for
the
same
strategic
reason
the
commission
s
rejection
of
the
honeywell
acquisition
be
unfortunate
for
both
partner
it
make
so
much
sense
all
of
us
try
very
hard
to
make
the
deal
work
for
me
if
this
deal
have
come
along
in
the
middle
of
my
career
it
would
have
be
another
swing
and
miss
come
at
the
very
end
after
i
have
postpone
my
retirement
the
loss
of
ge
s
big
deal
seem
to
loom
large
it
be
never
a
personal
battle
between
commissioner
monti
and
myself
he
and
i
always
have
cordial
dealing
and
our
team
make
many
effort
to
overcome
our
difference
unfortunately
we
be
operating
under
a
set
of
rule
that
allow
the
commission
to
function
as
both
the
oppose
team
and
the
umpire
once
the
merger
task
force
struck
at
the
strategic
rationale
for
the
deal
it
wasn
t
in
the
interest
of
our
shareowner
this
wasn
t
about
me
it
be
about
them
and
our
employee
be
our
large
shareowner
over
the
weekend
i
be
have
cocktail
at
a
postwedding
reception
on
the
porch
of
the
country
club
of
fairfield
look
out
over
the

course
and
long
island
sound
this
be
a
gorgeous
piece
of
property
surround
by
water
my
friend
be
ask
me
what
happen
to
the
honeywell
deal
i
point
out
to
the
ground
and
say
just
imagine
if
you
bought
this
beautiful
golf
course
and
in
order
to
close
the
purchase
the
city
official
demand
that
hole
two
three
four
five
and
eight
the
best
hole
along
the
water
must
be
give
to
another
golf
course
in
the
area
and
then
they
ask
you
to
give
up
part
of
your
own
house
understand
that
help
them
understand
my
brussels
experience
in
today
s
highly
regulate
and
litigious
world
where
corporation
be
easy
target
the
danger
of
unchecked
bureaucracy
be
a
constant
thorn
in
the
ceo
s
side
in
our
case
we
ve
have
two
instance
where
we
ve
be
deny
any
kind
of
reasonable
due
process
with
the
epa
s
use
of
the
superfund
law
the
rule
be
you
either
do
the
cleanup
they
demand
or
face
treble
damage
and
a
a

penalty
your
right
of
appeal
only
kick
in
after
all
the
work
be
complete
year
later
that
lack
of
due
process
be
why
we
ve
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
this
law
in
federal
court
with
the
european
commission
s
rejection
of
the
honeywell
acquisition
again
there
be
no
viable
review
process
the
bureaucrat
can
take
the
most
extreme
position
and
not
have
any

for
the
five
hour
meeting
jeff

the
lead
here
and
i
try
with
some
success
to
restrain
myself
during
our
field
visit
we
often
discover
three
or
four
star
in
every
business
and
excitedly
think
up
new
opportunity
for
them
when
we
finally
get
to
this
wrap
up
meeting
we
inevitably
find
that
we
ve
slot
each
new
star
in
at
least
three
to
five
different
job
so
among
other
thing
this
session
help
us
sort
through
what
we
promise
in
the
field
and
lead
to
an
intense
discussion
about
just
which
executive
we
ll
shift
from
one
business
to
another
we
go
over
the
leadership
succession

each
of
ge
s
business
and
discuss
plan
for
executive
ranked
in
the
bottom
percent
sometimes
the
bottom
in
one
business
be
well
than
some
of
the
people
ranked
in
the
middle
of
another
business
this
always
creates
a
lot
of
heat
this
time

review
the
honeywell
integration
include
the
new
organization

for

signal
to
every
one
of

in
the
last
half
hour
of
the
meeting
we
review
the
two
or
three
best
practice
in
each
initiative
found
during
the
field
visit
that
jeff
would
highlight
at
our
cec
meeting
in
june
the
meeting
didn
t
end
until
after
p
m
and
the
last
thing
i
be
think
about
be
go
back
to
the
damn
book
every
day
of
course
wasn
t
this
hectic
there
s
no
pat
formula
to
this
ceo
thing
everyone
do
it
differently
and
there
s
no
right
or
wrong
way
to
go
about
it
i
certainly
don
t
have
a
magic
formula
but
since
i
be
presumptuous
enough
to
write
this
book
i
ll
take
a
shot
at
share
some
of
the
idea
that
work
for
me
i
hope
some
might
be
helpful
pick
and
choose
among
them
or
just
toss
them
all
integrity
a

everything
i
do
through

and
bad
time
people
may
not
have
agree
with
me
on
every
issue
and
i
may
not
have
be
right
all
the
time
but
they
always
knew
they
be
get
it
straight
and
honest
it
help
to
build
well
relationship
with
customer
supplier
analyst
competitor
and
government
it
set
the
tone
in
the
organization
i
never
have
two
agenda
there
be
only
one
way
the
straight
way
the
corporation
and
the
community
everybody
have
a
view
about
a
corporation
s
role
in
society
i
do
too
i
believe
social
responsibility
begin
with
a
strong
competitive
company
only
a
healthy
enterprise
can
improve
and
enrich
the
life
of
people
and
their
community
when
a
company
be
strong
it
not
only
pay
tax
that
provide
for
important
service
it
also
build
world
class
facility
that
meet
or
exceed
safety
and
environmental
standard
strong
company
reinvest
in
their
people
and
their
facility
healthy
company
provide
good
and
secure
job
that
give
their
employee
the
time
the
spirit
and
the
resource
to
give
back
to
their
community
a
thousandfold
weak
and
struggle
company
on
the
other
hand
be
often
community
liability
they
have
little
or
no
profit
and
pay
few
if
any
tax
they
re
tempt
to
take
shortcut
to
save
a
buck
invest
little
in
the
development
of
their
employee
and
workplace
the
constant
threat
of
layoff
breed
insecurity
and
fear
in
employee
whose
worry
about
their
own
future
affect
their
ability
to
volunteer
time
and
money
to
help
others
i
saw
this
first
hand
in
pittsfield
massachusetts
where
i
spent
almost
all
of
my
first
year
in

in
pittsfield
i
saw
two
type
of
business
one
healthy
and
one
fail

have
a
vibrant
grow
plastic
business

be
hire
great
people
and
building
new
central
laboratory
we
have
an
engage
workforce
that
could
give
back
to
the
community
down
the
street
ge
s
transformer
business
have
struggle
lose
more
and
more
money
every
year
for
over
a
decade
the
business
have
become
noncompetitive
and
we
have
to
close
the
plant
in
the
s
that
money
lose
business
could
provide
no

be
angry
when

this
be
never
about

or
like
one

be
all
about
the
health
of
a
business
and
the
implication
its
sickness
have
on
the
community
that
s
why
a
ceo

primary
social
responsibility
be
to
assure

financial
success
of
the

to
get
into
the

this
truth
apply
to
all
kind
of
business
i
sat
in
room
for
year
look
at
promising
strategy
that
never
deliver
result
we
have
great
plan
for
ultrasound
but
we
could
never
make
them
happen
until
we
found
the
perfect
person
with
ultrasound
in
his
vein
we
have
service
strategy
in
aircraft
engine
power
and
transportation
for
year
service
be
always
a
second
class
citizen
until
we
put
leader
in
place
who
have
the
courage
to
kick
as
and
break
glass
we
learn
the
hard
way
that
we
could
have
the
great
strategy
in
the
world
without
the
right
leader
develop
and
own
them
we
d
get
good
look
presentation
and
so
so
result
informality
bureaucracy
strangles
informality
liberates
create
an
informal
atmosphere
be
a
competitive
advantage
bureaucracy
can
be
the
ultimate
insulator
informality
isn
t
about

it
s
so
much
deeper

legitimate

the

a
pretty
good
understand
of

we

helluva
lot
well
than
we
ever
thought
we

do
and
more
than
wall
street
expect
a
stretch
mentality
isn
t
easy
to
get
and
by
no
mean
do
ge
have
it
throughout
the
company
sometimes
we
found
case
where
manager
at
low
level
take
stretch
number
and
call
them
budget
punish
those
who
miss
i
don
t
think
it
happens
much
anymore
but
i
wouldn

bet
on
it
nevertheless
we
ll
never
stop
stretch
celebration
business
have
to
be
fun
for
too
many
people
it
s
just
a
job
i
always
found
celebration
be
a
great
way
to
energize
an
organization
from
my
first
day
in
plastic
i
be
always
look
for
way
to
celebrate
even
the
small
victory
at
crotonville
i
d
often
get
frustrate
by
the
answer
to
the
simple
question
be
you
celebrate
enough
the
student
turn
silent
or
would
murmur
no
i
love
to
push
back
on
this
one
don
t
look
at
me
i
can
t
celebrate
for
you
we
re
not
go
to
have
a
vice
president
of
celebration
at
ge
you
have
to
consider
yourself
the
manager
of
celebration
you
ve
get
the
authority
go
back
and
make
it
happen
you
don
t
have
to
hand
out
a
new
mercedes
it
can
be
a
keg
of
beer
or
a
dinner
for
two
your
job
be
to
make
sure
your
team
be
have
fun
while
they
re
be
productive
align
reward
with
measurement
you
have
to
get
this
one
right
one
time
i
be
surprised
to
see
a
great
fourth
quarter
revenue
line
and
no
income
to
go
with
it
i
ask
what
the
hell
happen
here
well
we
have
a
fourth
quarter
sale
contest
and
everyone
do
a
great
job
where
s
the
margin
we
didn
t
ask
for
margin
that
s
the
simplest
example
of
a
universal
problem
what
you
measure
be
what
you
get
what
you
reward
be
what
you
get
static
measurement
get
stale
market
condition
change
new
business
develop
new
competitor
show
up
i
always
pound
home
the
question
be
we
measure
and
reward
the
specific
behavior
we
want
by
not
align
measurement
and
reward
you
often
get
what
you
re
not
look
for
differentiation
develops
great
organization
no
one
like
to
play
god
and
rank
people
especially
the
bottom
percent
differentiation
be
as
tough
an
issue
as
any
manager
face
i
thought
it
be
my
job
to
talk
about
it
to
force
it
every
day
to
demand
it
from
everyone
from
my
first
day
i
thought
it
be
the
key
to
building
a
great
organization
for
us

to
a

to
me
over
the

all
the
data
crunch
in

five
simple
question
brought
strategic
think
to
life
for
me
what
be
the
detailed
global
position
of
your
business
and
that
of
your

by

today
what

have
your

have
you
do
in

to
alter
that

what

you
most
afraid
your

might
do
in
the
next
two
year

change
the

what

two
truth
i
ve
learn
to
challenge
over
time
dealt
with
competition
one
old
chestnut
be
we
re
lose
market
share
because
our
competitor
be
crazy
and
they
re
give
the
product
away
i
heard
that
more
than
a
hundred
time
in
my
career
usually
it
turn
out
to
be
b
the
real
truth
be
that
a
competitor
have
a
well
cost
position
or
a
strategic
rationale
for
what
it
do
it
take
me
a
while
to
figure
out
that
i
should
have
be
ask
what
be
wrong
with
us
not
them
the
other
beauty
go
something
like
this
a
team
come
in
with
a
proposal
to
leapfrog
the
current
position
of
its
lead
competitor
the
implicit
assumption
be
the
competition
will
be
sleep
while
we
re
develop
the
new
product
doesn
t
usually
happen
that
way
take
our
effort
to
build
the
ge
aircraft
engine
the
engineer
convince
me
that
if
we
developed
this
brand
new
engine
for
boeing
s
new
short
to
medium
range
jet
we
d
meet
their
requirement
for
a
pound
thrust
engine
they
say
pratt
whitney
and
roll
royce
couldn
t
stretch
their
exist
technology
to
get
to
didn
t
happen
pratt
and
roll
found
way
to
get
their
engine
to
deliver
as
much
as
pound
of
thrust
fortunately
the
project
have
a
happy
end
our
new
engine
be
capable
of
get
to
pound
which
be
what
boeing
need
when
it
later
come
out
with
a
long
range
version
of
the
our
engine
get
us
a
major
contract
on

it

we

know
when
to
meddle
and
when
to
let
go
be
a
pure
gut
decision
although
i
dove
into
the
tube
problem
at
medical
system
i
have
no
involvement
in

of
this
be
pure
instinct
i
manage
tight
when
i
sense
i
could
make
a
difference
i
manage
loose
when
i
knew
i
have
little
if
anything
to

you
choose

i
love
to
go
on
the
field
when
i
thought
i
could
play
and
i
love
cheer
from
the
sideline
when
i
didn
t
think
i

a
complex
problem
to
a

the
hell
out
of
me
for
every

sit
for
hour
with
my
finance
and
investor
relation

tear
up

after

i
love
do
chart
and
get
so
much
out

the
crazy

one
ever

two
kid
and
want
to
settle
down
in
fairfield
without
heavy

we
need
only
two
people
to
tell
the

than
we
have
year
ago
and
now

them
wallow
let
s
wallow
in
this
be
a
phrase
i
often
use
it
meant
get
people
together
often
spontaneously
to
wrestle
through
a
complex
issue
the
sole
ticket
for
admission

know
how
not

we
wallowed
in
public
relation
problem
environmental
issue
boca
agenda
and
big
m
a
deal
the
idea
be
to
get
fresh
think
without
paper
and
memo
then
sit
on
the
conclusion
for
a
night
wallow
some
more
from
wallow
come
some
of
our
best
decision
it
be
all
about
break
down
the
concept
of
hierarchy
everyone
knew
they
be
equal
partner
at
the
table
where
their
idea
could
be
thrown
out
with
informality
and
candor
your
back
room
be
somebody
else
s
front
room
peter
drucker
get
credit
for
this
one
we
practice
it
don
t
own
a
cafeteria
let
a
food
company
do
it
don
t
run
a
print
shop
let
a
printing
company
do
that
it
s
understand
where
your
real
value
add
be
and
put
your
best
people
and
resource
behind
that
back
room
by
definition
will
never
be
able
to
attract
your
best
we
convert
ours
into
someone
else
s
front
room
and
insist
on
get
their
best
that
work
for
us
so
many
time
this
be
what
outsource
be
all
about
it
s
also
what
many
of
our
layoff
be
about
in
the
early
s
as
these
job
migrate
elsewhere
it
always
make
me
mad
when
some
politician
and
economist
claimed
that
all
the
job
creation
in
america
be
come
from
small
entrepreneurial
company
much
of
that
in
fact
be
the
conscious
transfer
of
work
out
of
big
business
speed
at
crotonville
a
frequent
complaint
even
in
my
final
day
as
ceo
be
that
we
weren
t
fast
enough
i
learn
in
a
hundred
way
that
i
rarely
regret
act
but
often
regret
not
act
fast
enough
i
could
scarcely
remember
a
time
when
i
say
i
wish
i
d
take
six
more
month
to
study
something
before
make
a
decision
i
think
act
decisively
on
people
plant
and
investment
be
one
of
the
reason
i
get
out
of
the
pile
very
early
at
ge
yet
year
later
when
i
retire
one
of
my
great
regret
be
that
i
didn
t
act
fast
enough
on
many
occasion
when
i
ask
myself
how
many
time
should
i
have
held
off
on
a
decision
versus
how
many
time
do
i
wish
i
d
make
that
move
faster
i
inevitably
found
that
the
latter
won
almost
every
time
forget
the
zero
in
a
big
company
what
s
small
tends
to
get
lose
as
business
and
company
grow
their
size
can
become
an
inhibitor
rather
than
an
enabler
the
disadvantage
of
size
the
difficult
communication
the
layer
and
the
lack
of
informality
all
work
against
the
creation
of
an
energize
atmosphere
the
entrepreneurial
benefit
of
be
small
agility
speed
and
ease
of
communication
be
often
lose
in
a
big
company
plastic
taught
me
the
value
of
be
small
of
feel
like
you
own
it
i
come
to
the
ceo
job
know
that
isolate
small
project
and
keep
them
out
of
the
mainstream
be
the
way
to
grow
we
ve
have
many
great
success
by
break
these
project
out
and
focus
on
them
as
separate
small
business
in
large
entity
we
do
this
everywhere
noryl
in
plastic
ct
scanner
and
ultrasound
in
medical
and
vendor
financing
and
commercial
finance
in
ge
capital
it
didn
t
always
work
but
in
every
case
one
thing
be
clear
break
out
business
create
people
who
be
high
spirit
energize
and
back
by
the
right
resource
the
small
venture
get
high
visibility
and
create
hero
celebrate
both
those
who
won
and
those
who
miss
and
drive
home
the
value
of
take
risk
we
be
aware
of
what
size
meant
the
bad
thing
a
company
can
do
with
size
be
to
focus
on
manage
it
size
either
liberates
or
paralyzes
we
try
every
day
to
remember
that
the
benefit
of
size
be
that
it
allow
us
to
take
more
swing
just
some
thought
thing
that
work
for
me
along
with
a
lot
of
luck
for
the
past
twenty
four
year
i

have
a
lucky

reflection
on

be
the
great
thrill
of
my
life
if
i

another
preference
i
would
ve
love
to
have
be
a
professional
golfer
ever
since
i
picked
up
the
game
as
a
caddy
at
the
kernwood
country
club
in
salem
it
s
be
one
of
the
true
passion
of
my
life
my
father
who
get
me
start
on
the
game
be
right
unlike
the
hockey
or
football
i
played
as
a
kid
golf
be
a
game
i
would
have
all
my
life
it
be
a
sport
that
combine
what
i
love
people
and
competition
the
most
endure
friendship
of
my
life
have
be
form
on
and
around
the
golf
course
every
golfer
who
s
ever
hit
a
solid
tee
shot
or
have
sunk
a
foot
putt
know
the
seductive
power
of
the
game
i
be
pretty
much
a
self
taught
player
i
start
when
i
be
nine
year
old
play
with
the
other
old
caddy
at
kernwood
with
a
bag
fill
with
half
a
dozen
taped
up
club
i
be
lucky
to
shoot
below

i
want
more
play
time
beyond
a
few
hour
on
monday
morning

time
i
have
to
sneak
onto
the
course
in

seem
to
happen
backward

would
have
give
my
right
arm
for
five
good

back
then
now
people
send
me
free
set

i
ve
be
lucky
enough
to
play
on
some
of
the
great
course
in
the
world
i
guess
i
never
lose
my
touch
for
caddy
in
the
summer
of
i
found
myself
lug
a
bag
all
over
again
at
the
age
of
for
my
seven
year
old

without
much
style
and
with
the
wrong
grip
i
d
just
sort
of
hockey
the
ball
around
i
never
practice
much
and
just

to
go
out
and

in
that
my
game
go
to
a
different
level
i
be
up
to
about
a
handicap
then
but
in
the
process
of
teach
her
the
game
i
make
myself
a
whole
lot
well
at
one
point
i
get
down
to
a
two
or
three
handicap
and
won
two
club
championship
at
sankaty
head
before
meeting
jane
i
d
get
knock
out
in
the
first
or
second
round
i
wasn
t
aware
of
it
but
when
i
begin
teach
her
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
actually
slow
myself
down
and
analyze
my
own
swing
when
i
be
tell
jane
to
take
a
longer
back
swing
i
realize
that
i
have
to
do
the
same
myself
so
i
work
on
get
it
back
farther
and
i
work
on
learn
how
to
finish
until
then
i
never
finish
off
my
swing
now
i
keep
say
to
myself
fred
couple
fred
couple
fred
couple
when
i
get
ready
to
take
a
whack
at
the
ball
i
thought
couple
have
a
great
finish
and
i
always
try
to
picture
that
swing
in
my
head
when
i
m
follow
through
teach
jane
help
me
to
break
down
each
element
and
focus
on
the
mechanic
by
be
more
aware
of
the
technical
stuff
i
found
that
i
stop
choke
late
in
the
round
i
start
to
play
well
and
begin
to
like
the
game
even
more
in
i
played
hole
a
day
for
straight
day
at

i
work
my
handicap
down
to
a
to
win

two
year
later
i
manage
to
win
again

right
down
to
the

we
ve
played
to
round
a
year
together
he
can
beat
me
time
out
of
fortunately
for
me
my
one
in
chance
occur
in
the
club
championship
i
won
in
sudden
death
drop

someone
very
special
after

to
me
he
spent
day
carve
a
wooden
sankaty
lighthouse
and
give
it
to
me
as
a
memento
of

most
celebrate
game
i

of
at
the
floridian
wayne
huizenga
s

in
florida
matt
lauer
co
host
of
the
today
show
knew
golf
pro
greg
norman
and
ask
him
to
join
us
it
be
a
friendly
match
and
greg
be
a
great
sport
play
with
a
bunch
of
average
player
greg
just
fooling
around
shot
under
par
matt
have
a
i
actually
have
a
low
score
than
greg
from
the
back
tee
versus
his
from
the
pro
tip
it
be
an
excite
day
for
me
i
think
i
told
everyone
in
the
world
fax
the
scorecard
to
anyone
i
knew
at
the
business
council
meeting
a
week
later
whenever
anyone
ask
me
about
my
golf
game
i
say
wait
a
minute
and
pull
the
scorecard
out
of
my
pocket
greg
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
it
himself
he
sign
my
scorecard
and
allow
me
to
show
off
even
though
it
be
only
a
casual
game
i
told
him
that
by
the
time
i
get
through
tell
this
story
he
will
have
played
the
lady
tee
and
i
will
have
played
the
tip
i
might
have
be
take
it
a
little
too
far
especially
after
my
victory
show
up
in
magazine
and
newspaper
and
even
don
imu
begin
talk
about
it
on
the
radio
at
one
point
greg
call
and
ask
jokingly
jack
have
you
told
everybody
in
the
world
have
you
found
anyone
i
haven
t
told
i
say
laugh
if
so
send
me
their
address

new
guy
to
keep
him
anonymous
ng
be
what
we
call
him
it
be
our
code
for
the
new
guy
keep
the
choice
of
my
successor
a
secret
be
the
easy
part
but
that
be
the
only
easy
thing
about
it
make
the
pick
be
not
only
the
most
important
decision
of
my
career
it
be
the
most
difficult
and
agonize
one
i
ever
have
to
make
it
damn
near
drove
me
crazy
cause
many
sleepless
night
for
at
least
a
year
it
be
often
the
first
thing
i
thought
about
each
morning
and
the
last
thing
on
my
mind
at
night
what
make
it
so
hard
be
that
we
have
three
sensational
final
candidate
jeff
immelt
who
lead
our
medical
system
business
bob
nardelli
who
ran
power
system
and
jim
mcnerney
in
aircraft
engine
all
three
exceed
every
expectation
we
set
for
them
their
performance
be
off
the
chart
any
one
of
the
three
could
have
run
ge
not
only
be
they
great
leader
they
be
my
good
friend
and
i
knew
i
have
to
disappoint
two
of
them
i
knew
it
be
go
to
be
one
of
the
hardest
thing
i
ever
have
to
do
the
decision
end
a
long
and
obsessive
process
have
go
through
this
myself
year
ago
i
knew
what
i
like
and
didn
t
like
about
it
if
i
have
run
a
succession
process
a
few
year
after
get
the
job
it
probably
would
have
be
identical
to
what
reg
do
to
pick
me
his
succession
be
thorough
and
thoughtful
and
it
get
praise
from
the
academic
over
year
the
company
have
change
so
dramatically
that
i
could
do
it
a
little
differently
from
the
business
centric
model
of
year
ago
ge
have
evolve
into
an
informal
and
more
tightly
integrate
organization
support
by
strong
value
and
reward
the
candidate
be
all
product
of
this
social
architecture
they
thrive
on
change
and
have
self
confidence
to
spare
and
our
process
from
the
quarterly
cec
meeting
to
the
day
long
session
c
review
brought
us
together
much
more
often
and
in
much
great
depth
i
approach
the
whole
process
with
these
thought
one
i
want
my
successor
to
be
ge
s
unquestioned
leader
i
be
concerned
about
stick
him
with
disappointed
guy
who
could
screw
up
the
spirit
and
value
we
work
so
hard
to
create
two
i
want
to
take
the
politics
out
of
the
process
leadership
transition
be
an
enormous
distraction
to
organization
that
need
to
focus
outward
not
inward
when
i
go
through
the
last
succession
thing
become
highly
political
and
divisive
reg
didn
t
intentionally
cause
the
politics
it
be
the
process
by
bring
all
the
candidate
to
headquarters
he
get
a
closer
look
at
everyone
in
the
race
tough
politics
be
a
heavy
price
for
that
look
three
i
want
to
be
sure
the
board
be
deeply
involve
in
the
decision
go
forward
our
director
need
to
be
united
behind
one
person
i
have
that
support
in
my
critical
early
year
it
be
a
godsend
the
board
s
coach
and
support
during
my
down
period
when
i
be
call
neutron
jack
and
when
i
struggle
with
our
problem
at
kidder
peabody
be
incredibly
valuable
to
me
and
four
i
want
to
pick
someone
young
enough
to
be
in
the
job
for
at
least
a
decade
while
a
ceo
can
have
an
immediate
impact
i
always
felt
people
should
live
with
their
decision
and
especially
with
their
mistake
i
certainly
have
someone
with
less
time
might
be
tempt
to
make
some
crazy
move
to
put
his
stamp
on
the
company
i
ve
see
too
many
example
of
that
some
company
have
run
through
five
or
six
different
ceo
during
my
year
as
chairman
i
didn
t
want
that
to
happen
at
ge
that
s
what
i
be
think
about
when
we
start
on
this
road
in
the
spring
of
i
be
then
with

associate
after
each
trip
si
would
drop
me
a
note
with
the
committee
s
impression
four
year
after
the
first
list
after
retirement
departure
and
people
who
fell
out
the
original
have
be
narrow
to
eight
serious
candidate
we
be
still
play
around
with
that
ideal
ceo
list
add
and
drop
thing
but
it
still
have
a
superman
feel
to
it
much
more
helpful
to
me
be
a
list
of
eight
basic
objective
bill
chuck
and
i
put
together
in
pick
the
strong
leader
look
for
the
best
complementary
mix
of
corporate
executive
officer
skill
retain
all
contender
through
transition
and
into
the
next
administration
minimize
dysfunctional
competition
create
opportunity
for
up
close
and
personal
view
of
the
contender
before
the
final
decision
provide
the
necessary
transition
time
give
the
company
s
breadth
and
complexity
anticipate
back
fill
requirement
for
concurrent
selection
announcement
keep
option
open
as
long
as
possible
consistent
with
the
fourth
and
fifth
objective
this
be
a
wish
list
but
it
be
a
pretty
good
one
we
wouldn
t
meet
all
these
objective
i
become
convince
number
three
be
unrealistic
we
weren
t
go
to
retain
all
the
candidate
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
we
shouldn
t
four
and
five
turn
out
to
be
in
conflict
with
each
other
get
an
up
close
view
by
bring
them
to
fairfield
would
risk
dysfunctional
competition
the
other
objective
held
up
the
most
important
lesson
i
take
from
my
own
succession
be
the
need
to
take
out
all
the
internal
politics
this
may
be
hard
to
believe
but
that
s
the
way
it
turn
out
after
it
be
over
the
finalist
told
me
they
saw
it
the
same
way
our
value
have
become
so
important
that
if
any
one
of
the
candidate
played
game
their
colleague
would
have
thrown
them
out
even
when
we
settle
on
the
final
three
by
the
end
of
and
the
medium
begin
crank
up
the
pressure
not
one
of
them
do
anything
to
undermine
the
other
in
fact
if
anything
it
be
the
opposite
keep
all
three
in
the
field
in
their
current
job
bob
in
schenectady
jim
in
cincinnati
and
jeff
in
milwaukee
allow
each
to
focus
on
nothing
but
his
business
not
politics
not
second
guess
the
business
their
friend
once
ran
and
not
maneuvering
in
a
new
bureaucratic
layer
in
the
organization
the
downside
be
obvious
i
wouldn
t
get
that
one
on
one
personal
view
of
each
candidate
reg
gain
when
he
brought
us
all
to
fairfield
i
didn
t
need
a
close
up
view
i
have
be
hang
around
with
these
three
for
year
but
i
do
create
opportunity
for
a
well
look
without
bring
them
to
headquarters
in
for
instance
i
put
all
three
on
the
ge
capital
board
after
every
monthly
meeting
i
have
lunch
with
them
i
try
to
take
any
formality
out
of
these
fairfield
luncheon
we
d
fool
around
and
i
d
get
to
hear
their
opinion
on
the
deal
that
ge
capital
be
propose
this
work
for
a
while
but
as
we
grow
closer
to
the
end
it
become
too
awkward
for
everyone
so
we
stop
do
it
i
do
something
else
it
be
a
little
like
reg
s
process
but
handle
outside
the
office
i
begin
have
private
dinner
with
each
of
the
major
business
ceo
in
the
spring
of
over
a
meal
i
ask
them
for
their
opinion
about
our
business
what
we
ought
to
keep
which
one
we
should
throw
out
and
who
should
make
up
the
leadership
team
at
the
top
i
ask
them
to
pick
three
leader
not
want
to
force
anyone
into
the
box
of
pick
one
winner
these
session
be
helpful
for
put
a
team
together
but
didn
t
do
much
to
pick
a
clear
successor
i
repeat
the
process
again
in
the
spring
of
this
time
i
focus
more
on
thing
outside
their
own
business
i
want
to
know
their
thought
on
our
current
union
negotiation
and
environmental
issue
i
have
a
candid
exchange
about
what
they
thought
of
one
another
again
no
surprise
they
all
like
and
respect
one
another
i
also
ask
a
lot
of
question
about
our
process
and
value
what
they
like
about
them
and
what
they
d
jettison
one
of
the
most
important
question
i
ask
three
of
them
be
probably
the
most
challenge
to
answer
if
you
weren
t
picked
as
ceo
would
you
leave
two
of
them
one
more
directly
than
the
other
make
it
clear
they
would
leave
one
say
he
want
the
job
he
love
the
company
and
the
people
so
much
that
he
would
stay
to
see
how
it
played
out
i
discount
that
because
the
headhunter
would
have
be
all
over
him
with
the
enormous
visibility
they
all
get
that
turn
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
assumption
by
this
time
i
have
make
up
my
mind
that
it
be
unrealistic
to
think
we
could
keep
all
of
them
from
the
start
i
always
saw
the
process
as
more
than
just
name
a
ceo
i
also
want
to
create
a
broader
team
use
the
vice
chairman
position
to
help
the
new
guy
i
didn
t
want
disappointed
candidate
or
those
who
wouldn
t
be
able
to
work
with
my
successor
in
these
role
i
thought
the
perfect
choice
be
dennis
dammerman
then
ceo
of
ge
capital
and
bob
wright
at
nbc
the
two
of
them
always
come
up
as
big
player
with
everyone
in
my
dinner
conversation
dennis
be
name
a
vice
chairman
in
late
and
bob
in
july
dennis
be
involve
in
the
selection
process
almost
from
the
begin
while
bob
played
a
role
after
become
vice
chairman
as
the
medium
heat
up
in
the
uncertainty
mount
at
my
crotonville
session
class
begin
ask
how
i
would
keep
all
three
at
ge
and
who
would
replace
each
of
them
as
business
ceo
the
analyst
on
wall
street
be
ask
the
same
question
i
ve
have
plenty
of
idea
good
and
bad
but
i
get
a
really
good
one
during
a
weekend
in
june
it
come
in
the
shower
i
often
do
some
of
my
best
think
there
because
i
be
sure
two
of
the
three
would
leave
i
decide
to
lose
them
on
my
term
instead
of
wait
to
name
their
replacement
after
one
move
up
or
left
i
decide
to
put
their
successor
in
right
away
bob
jim
and
jeff
might
have
five
uncomfortable
month
left
in
their
job
but
new
leader
in
their
business
would
be
well
train
and
ready
to
go
their
organization
would
know
who
the
next
bos
be
go
to
be
and
that
would
lessen
the
rumor
and
gossip
i
also
thought
it
would
reassure
wall
street
during
our
session
c
every
business
leader
have
to
name
his
or
her
successor
it
s
often
a
rote
exercise
in
april
with
the
ceo
decision
pending
in
december
i
write
all
of
our
business
leader
and
ask
each
of
them
to
spend
at
least
an
hour
this
time
discuss
their
replacement
those
discussion
flush
out
who
the
three
candidate
in
particular
like
and
want
on
monday
morning
i
excitedly
told
bill
and
dennis
about
my
idea
developed
over
the
weekend
they
be
enthusiastic
we
could
now
put
people
in
new
chief
operating
role
who
we
knew
be
compatible
with
the
ceo
since
the
board
be
up
to
speed
on
all
the
people
it
be
easy
to
get
the
director
on
the
phone
that
week
and
take
them
through
this
new
think
they
like
it
now
i
have
to
explain
this
decision
to
bob
jeff
and
jim
i
acknowledge
that
it
might
seem
unfair
but
i
make
the
case
that
it
be
in
the
best
interest
of
their
employee
and
our
shareowner
nonetheless
it
come
as
a
surprise
to
them
well
be
you
tell
me
i
m
either
up
or
out
ask
one
yeah
that
s
it
you
threw
the
gauntlet
down
by
tell
me
you
be
go
to
leave
if
it
didn
t
work
out
i
m
say
okay
here
s
the
guy
who
be
go
to
replace
you
now
you
train
him
for
six
month
what
finality
he
reply
look
i
know
this
be
a
little
cruel
because
it
seem
so
final
but
i
have
to
make
this
call
none
of
them
thought
it
be
the
great
thing
that
ever
happen
but
they
understood
it
really
be
in
the
company
s
best
interest
if
the
people
factory
ever
need
validation
we
certainly
get
it
in
june
of
we
be
ready
with
three
great
people
as
new
chief
operating

and
then
reinsurance
he
be
bright
fun
quick
an
avid
sportsman
and
a
strong
relationship
builder
dave
be
perfect
to
be
coo
under
jim
mcnerney
at

eventually

dave
calhoun
first
as
ceo
of
ge
plastic
asia
and
then
as
ceo
of
ge

this
experience
make
him
a
natural
as
coo
under
bob
nardelli
at
power
system
joe
hogan
work
in

in
many
global

fanuc
joe
be
and
look
about
he
probably
get
card
at
every
bar
he
might
look
that
way
but
he
s
a
mature
manager
with
terrific
interpersonal
and
natural
leadership
skill
we
have
brought
him
into
medical
system
as
head
of
e
business
several
month
earlier
to
get
ready
for
his
next
job
as
coo
under
jeff
immelt
put
these
three
star
into
these
new
job
be
a
game
change
event
while
employee
include
me
still
didn
t
know
who
their
chairman
be
go
to
be
the
people
in
three
of
our
big
business
knew
exactly
who
their
new
ceo
would
be
publicly
i
say
the
change
be
a
natural
step
in
our
leadership
succession
plan
i
continued
to
turn
away
reporter
who
want
to
talk
about
these
move
or
anything
else
involve
succession
so
do
bob
jeff
and
jim
none
of
us
want
to
help
the
medium
make
a
circus
of
it
if
anything
though
i
be
naive
to
think
i
could
hold
off
the
press
completely
after
all
the
first
story
about
my
succession
have
cropped
up
as
early
as
as
we
move
into
september
two
month
before
name
my
successor
it
seem
that
all
the
medium
could
focus
on
be
the
succession
at
ge
in
the
space
of
three
or
four
day
story
cropped
up
in
business
week
the
wall
street
journal
the
financial
time
and

sunday
time
of

be
at
the

surprised
at
how
much
attention
our
succession
be
get
i
also
felt
terrible
about
it
know
how

three
of
them

everyone
in

of
conflict

that

it
this
far
and
that
only
make
it
harder
for
me

dumb
or
crazy
a
scandal

there

similar
story
i
could
tell
about

or
jim
for
me
this
be
an
emotional
decision
there
be
a
lot
of
blood
sweat
family
and
feeling
to
it
i
never
have
trouble
make
decision
this
one
be
different
at
the
july
board
meeting
we
spent
three
hour
with
the
comp
committee
wrestling
with
the
pro
and
con
of
each
candidate
it
be
a
wide
open
meeting
throughout
the
session
i
be
fight
not
to
make
up
my
mind
i
want
to
keep
my
option
open
until
the
very
end
after
the
morning
session
we
have
the
usual
golf
out

business
i
ask

hour
early
the
next
morning
after
they
have
a
chance
to
sleep
on
our
three
hour
discussion
it
wasn
t
until

visit
to
a
power
turbine
plant
this

schedule
a
year
in
advance
it
probably
wasn
t
the
smartest
move
i
ever
make
it
would
place
more
pressure
on
bob
nardelli
than
he
deserve
but
i
like
to
show
the
board
stuff
that
be
hot

to
bob

hotter
than
power
system

we
ve
come
to
a
conclusion
for
the
next
minute
or
so
i
told
the
board
why
i
thought
jeff
should
be
the
new
guy
he
have
do
great
thing
in
our
medical
business
that
would
be
a
model
for
the
future
of
ge
i
felt
jeff
have
the
perfect
blend
of
intelligence
and
edge
and
epitomize
the
trait
that
s
so
important
to
me
he
be
really
confortable
in
his
own
skin
while
it
be
obviously
close
i
thought
he
be
the
perfect
selection
dennis
dammerman
and
bob
wright
have
their
say
dennis
recall
how

focus
on
his
leadership
skill
and
customer
focus
bob
comment
on
his
runway
then
every
member
of
the
board
weigh
in
all
in
unanimous
approval
at
the
end
of
the
table
frank
rhodes
spoke
eloquently
about
jeff
s
capacity
to
learn
and
grow
in
his
mind
he
say
jeff
have
the
intellectual
bandwidth
and
be
clearly
the
right
choice
it
be
one
of
the
best
meeting
i
have
ever
be
in
everyone
want
to
say
something
we
have
all
be
carry
the
same
burden
at
least
two
director
raise
the
possibility
of
try
to
keep
at
least
one
of
the
two
other
candidate
it
kill
them
to
lose
so
much
talent
be
you
sure
you
don
t
want
to
try
to
keep
one
ask
one
board
member
i
ve
be
there
i
say
i
know
what
it
s
like
whoever
becomes

have
to
be
fill
with
self
confidence
and
full
of
enthusiasm
i
want
him
to
feel
big
than
life
i
don
t
want
him
look
over
his
shoulder
i
then
ask
bill
conaty
who
have
favor
keep
one
of
the
two
to
share
his
view
bill
say
that
he
have
initially
thought
the
experience
and
skill
of
the
other
candidate
be
so
great
that
we
should
try
to
keep
one
of
them
but
he
have
reluctantly
come
my
way
in
the
end
all
of
us
felt
that

own
show
as
ceo
i

i
have
make
a
call
i
d
like
to
come
out
and
review
the
decision
and
the
rationale
behind
it
i
wasn
t
about
to
tell
either
candidate
that
he
be
not
go
to
be
ceo
over
the
telephone
i
owe
each
one
the
opportunity
to
look
me
in
the
eye
as
i
told
him
the
news
yet
i
didn
t
want
to
falsely
raise
their
hope
i
practice
these
word
at
least
ten
time
to
get
them
right
even
go
through
the
routine
with
jane
before
make
the
call
i
reach
the
west
palm
airport
at
p
m
in
the
middle
of
a
torrential
downpour
the
thanksgiving
holiday
air
traffic
be
compound
by
severe
thunderstorm
that
rock
the
entire
eastern
half
of
the
country
many
airport
be
close
the
plane
ground
when
i
told
our
pilot
that
we
weren
t
go
to
westchester
airport
as
plan
but
rather
to
cincinnati
they
be
shock
they
have
to
change
all
the
flight
plan
in
weather
that
make
any
departure
doubtful
the
pilot
say
the
bad
weather
would
keep
us
ground
for
at
least
a
couple
of
hour
so
i
lay
on
a
couch
think
over
what
i
have
to
say
i
hat
what
i
have
to
do
it
be
like
have
to
pick
one
child
over
another
it
seem
so
unfair
they
have
all
bust
their
butt
for
the
company
they
have
never
played
unfair
with
me
or
with
each
other
they
have
give
percent
in
this
case
i
have
ask
these
three
people
to
do
this
and
they
all
do
this
and
this
and
then
this
they
have
vastly
exceed
our
expectation
now
i
have
to
give
two
of
them
the
bad
news
of
their
career
and
i
have
nothing
else
to
give
them
other
than
encouragement
that
they
would
make
great
ceo
somewhere
else
the
afternoon
grow
dark
early
we
left
palm
beach
through
black
sky
at
p
m
and
arrive
at
lunken
aviation
in
cincinnati
around
p
m
the
place
be
soak
dreary
and
dark
it
be
a
bone
chill
night
i
walk
across
the
tarmac
through
a
light
fog
toward
the
barely
lit
private
airport
hangar
i
felt
really
alone
carry
only
my
old
leather
briefcase
no

be
in
sight
when
i
reach
the
door
jim
be
already
there
i
greet
him
and
we
quickly
go
into
a
small
meeting
room
obviously
i
say
this
be
go
to
be
the
toughest
conversation
of
my
life
jim
s
disappointment
wrap
his
face
i
picked
jeff
if
there

anyone
to
be
mad
at
be
mad
at
me
put

picture
on
the
wall

throw
dart
at
it
i
can
t
even

nose
and
my
gut

more
gracious

the
job
but
i
also
want
to
tell
you

fair
because
you
played
it
straight
and

every
chance
for
the
next
minute
we
have
a
good
conversation

dad
and
his
year
at
ge
i
told
jim
that
i
have
see
tremendous
growth
in
him
since
our
first
meeting
in
i
recall
how
he
d
be
hire
out
of
the
consult
firm
of
mckinsey
by
one
of
my
old
pittsfield
associate

liemandt
from
his
first
job
in
business
development
in
our
information
service
division
to
his
last
he
have
do
great
thing
for
us
none
great
than
his
transformation
of
our
aircraft
engine
business
your
last
two
year
have
be
your
best
and

to
be
a
great
ceo

need
to
fly
to
albany

flew
through
heavy
cloud
into
a
desert
airport
in
albany
around
p
m
it
be
still
wet
and
cold
we
arrive
earlier
than
expect
because
of
heavy
tailwind
and
bob
wasn
t
there
i
actually
felt
relieve
by
his
absence
it
would
be
especially
difficult
to
tell
him
he
hadn
t
gotten
the
job
of
the
three
i
have
know
bob

long
meeting

as
a
ge
plant
manager
in
the
late
s
his
dad
have
work
a
lifetime
at

just
as
jeff
s
father
have
when

to
join
the
case
corp
in
he
be
one
of
the
few
executive
i
ever
try
to
persuade

stay
i
couldn
t
talk
him
into
stay
but
he
do
come
back
three
year
later
since
then
i
have
watch
and
admire
his
operating
performance
the
number
he
be
deliver
be
the
best
i
have
see
in
my
year
at
the
company
and
could
well
be
the
best
operating
performance
of
any
business
in
ge
history
bob
show
up
on
time
ten
minute
after
i
arrive
we
sat
together
on
a
couch
in
the
corner
of
a
large
empty
lounge
just
the
two
of
us
i
told
him
the
news
and
his
disappointment
be
visible
what
more
could
i
have
do
he
ask
bob
you
ve
do
more
than
i
ever

question
for
you
i
can
t
give
you
satisfaction
on
it
you
do
everything
and
more
that
be
ever
ask
i
believe
jeff
be
the
right
guy
for
this
company
go
forward
there
s
only
one
person
to
blame
here
it
s
me
bob
and
i
have
a
long
probe
discussion
i
wasn
t
able
to
satisfy
his
need
for
more
information
his
great
operating
result
make
the
decision
hard
for
him
to
accept
again
i
try
to
soften
his
disappointment
bob
you
re
go
to
be
an
all
star
ceo

a
big
lucky

and
hug
back
on
the
plane

a
large
vodka
on
ice
and
finally
flew
back
to
westchester
i
star
out
the
window
that
night

my
drink

in
lot
of
conflict
emotion
i
be
relieve

be
over
i
be
thrill
for
jeff
and
totally
confident
we
have
picked
the
best
candidate
i
felt
really
sad
to
disappoint
two
friend
who
have
do
so
much
for
the
company
i
vowed
to
be
their
agent
to
help
them
in
any
way
i
possibly
could
we
have
an
excite
press
conference
on
monday
i
couldn
t
have
be
more
pleased
with
jeff
s
performance
he
demonstrate
all
the
self
confidence
and
quality
that
i
knew
he
have
the
only
obvious
mistake
we
make
and
we
both
make
it
be
not
check
on
each
other
s
wardrobe
we
both
show
up
wear
blue
shirt
and
blue
blazer
the
medium
have
some
fun
with
that
after
it
be
over
i
spent
the
next
few
day
talk
to
my
friend
gerry
roche
at
heidrick
struggle
and
tom
neff
at
spencer
stuart
about
the
job
bob
and
jim
be
consider
at
one
point
tom
be
actually
lobbying
me
to
get
one
of
the
guy
to
go
to
his
client
lucent
technology
i
told
tom
i
didn
t
think

a
good
idea
within
day
jim
be
chosen
to
be
ceo
of
m
and
bob
be
picked
to
be
ceo
of

depot
one
of
our
director
ken
langone
have
a
strong
hand
in
bob
s
move
because
he
have
be
an
active
player
in
the
succession
and
couldn
t
wait
to
call
bob
and
recruit
him
to
home
depot
where
ken
be
a
founder
and
large
shareholder
nothing
say
more
about
the
ge
value
than
when
jim
and
bob
and
their
wife
join
reg
jeff
and
me
at
our
annual
christmas
party
at
the
rainbow
room
of
the
ge
building
when
i
mention
them
during
my
remark
our
director
and
executive
give
them
stand
ovation
no
one
clapped
harder
than
i
do
i
would
really
burst
with
pride
a
few
week
later
in
boca
by
that
time
i
be
look
forward
to
jeff
s
first
presentation
as
the
new
chairman

george
w
bush
however
have

number
of

meet
with
him
for
an
economic
briefing

brief
opening
at
boca
and
then
left
our
operating
manager
meeting
for
the
first
time
in
year
it
be
an
unexpected
but
lucky
break
because
it
give
jeff
the
chance
to
do
his
own
thing
without
me
sit
in
the
front
row
when
i
return
that
even
a
videotape
of
his
presentation

wait
in
my
hotel
room
see
him
take
command
of
the
company
be
exhilarate
jeff
be
witty
smart
visionary
and
incredibly
powerful
he
be
the
ceo
in
my
closing
remark
at
boca
i
told
the
crowd
that
i
watch
jeff
s
opening
on
the
tv
screen
in
my
room
and
felt
as
proud
of
him
as
a
first
time
father
his
performance
trigger
one
of
my
happiest
memory
the
day
i
walk
into
the
lab
on
plastic
avenue
in
pittsfield
year
earlier
with
a
box
of
candy
under
my
arm
to
celebrate
the
birth
of
my
first
child
katherine
at
boca
i
be
figuratively
vie
with
jeff
s
own
dad
who
have
spent
year
work
in
ge
s
aircraft
engine
business
to
see
whose
chest
could
pop
out
the
most
i
be
sure
the
new
guy
be
the
right
guy
epilogue
almost
year
ago
i
stood
behind
a
podium
at
the
pierre
hotel
in
new
york
and
give
my
vision
to
wall
street
analyst
for
what
i
want
ge
to
become
as
high
as
my
expectation
be
on
that
day
i
never
imagine
that
the
company
and
the
people
in
it
would
be
able
to
achieve
so
much
we
take
a
bureaucracy
and
we
shook
it
we
create
a
world
class
organization
whose
excellence
be
accepted
on
every
continent
i
believe
the
ge
i
m
leave
be
a
true
meritocracy
a
place
fill
with
involve
and
excite
people
with
good
value
and
high
integrity
it
s
a
company
that
life
for
great
idea
a
place
where
the
people
do
get
up
every
morning
search
for
a
well
way
the
journey
have
be
a
great
one
yet
what
ge
become
in
year
be
a
small
snapshot
of
a
company
s
lifetime
we
built
on
the
year
that
come
before
us
what
excites
me
even
more
be
what
the
organization
might
become
in
the
next
year
i
know
that
its
future
will
be
guide
by
a
spectacular
team
that
will
take
the
company
to
great
thing
at
time
the
first
ten
year
of
my
journey
felt
like
war
we
be
change
ahead
of
the
curve
and
we
take
our
lump
for
it
there
be
no
modest
revolution
there
be
no
modest
transformation
of
organization
either
contrary
to
reputation
i
ve
often
be
too
cautious
i
wait
too
long
to
get
rid
of
manager
who
weren
t
willing
or
able
to
face
reality
i
be
hesitant
with
some
acquisition
slow
to
embrace
the
internet
even
timid
about
blowing
up
all
the
ritual
and
tradition
of
what
once
have
be
a
bureaucracy
almost
everything
should
and
could
have
be
do
faster
nonetheless
ge
have
become
an
organization
that
relish
change
us
its
size
to
take
more
risk
and
be
focus
outward
on
its
customer
not
itself
i
ve
always
believe
that
when
the
rate
of
change
inside
an
institution
becomes
slow
than
the
rate
of
change
outside
the
end
be
in
sight
the
only
question
be
when
learn
to
love
change
be
an
unnatural
act
in
any
century
old
institution
but
the
ge
i
m
leave
do
just
that
our
passion
to
learn
and
share
new
idea
be
facilitate
by
an
operating
system
that
allow
diverse
business
to
grow
faster
and
perform
well
than
they
would
if
they
be
on
their
own
great
people
not
great
strategy
be
what
make
it
all
work
we
spent
extraordinary
time
recruiting
training
develop
and
reward
the
best
our
reach
and
our
success
would
have
be
limited
without
the
best
people
stretch
to
become
well
globalization
be
one
logical
outcome
of
stretch

immediate
attention
while
information
will

never
before

will
always
be
human
judgment
that
will
make
the
organization
go
one
even
just
a
few
month
before
i
left
ge
i
be
in
a
store
on
fifth
avenue
in
new
york
to
buy
a
new
sweater
when
the
salesman
help
me
go
downstairs
to
find
my
size
in
the
stockroom
the
manager
of
the
store
come
up
to
me
mr
welch
he
say
can
i
talk
to
you
he
be
a
young
african
american
who
say
he
d
see
me
be
interviewed
by
charlie
rise
on
television
the
night
before
he
say
he
have
enjoy
my
comment
but
want
to
ask
me
a
follow
up
question
during
the
rise
interview
i
have
note
how
important
it
be
for
organization
to
continually
remove
the
bottom
percent
of
their
employee
the
store
manager
brought
me
to
a
seclude
section
under
a
staircase
where
no
one
could
hear
us
he
explain
that
he
have
people
in
his
sale
force
mr
welch
he
ask
do
i
really
have
to
let
two
go
you
probably
do
if
you
want
the
best
sale
staff
on
fifth
avenue
i
have
to
laugh
over
the
fact
that
i
be
hearing
my
word
come
back
to
me
not
from
someone
inside
ge
this
time
but
from
the
floor
manager
of
a
fifth
avenue
clothing
store
i
think
he
understood
that
if
you
want
to
become
the
best
at
what
you
do
it
s
hard
really
hard
it
take
self
confidence
courage
and
a
willingness
to
take
the
heat
when
you
make
the
tough
call
on
a
lighter
note
the
hookup
between
bob
nardelli
and
ken
langone
at
home
depot
have
spark
a
lot
of
funny
banter
among
all
of
us

be
a
large

little
red

that
the
long
run
boom
economy
brought
out
terrible
excess
and
dishonest
act
be
perpetuate
by
handful
of
people
but
base
on
my
forty
year
of
experience
i
believe
most
business
people
just
like
most
people
in
general
be
good
they
know
right
from
wrong
and
try
to
do
right
they
work
hard
and
hope
for
a
fair
deal
in
life
there
have
always
be
crook
and
cheat
and
there
always
will
be
but
in
general
law
rule
and
standard
and
most
important
good
corporate
culture
keep
them
in
check
by
the
time
the
scandal
have
really
heat
up
my
speak
engagement
have
me
frequently
on
the
road
travel
across
the
country
and
around
the
world
in
almost
every
session
someone
would
mention
that
the
scandal
make
them
feel
dirty
about
work
in
business
and
they
felt
embarrass
when
they
have
to
tell
people
they
work
in
corporate
america
i
would
then
ask
people
to
raise
their
hand
if
they
believe
they
work
for
a
bad
company
or
work
with
dishonest
people
time
after
time
no
one
do
instead
they
raise
their
hand
to
say
that
they
work
for
good
trustworthy
company
and
that
their
colleague
be
honest
and
hardworking
it
be
awful
to
see
so
many
innocent
people
be
hurt
by
bad
behavior
that
be
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
carry
out
by
a
small
group
of
people
at
a
small
number
of
company
it
be
even
harder
for
me
to
watch
what
be
happen
to
ge
in
the
medium
as
i
say
i
thought
i
have
left
jeff
immelt
with
a
great
hand
a
royal
straight
flush
in
fact
i
figure
he
would
have
at
least
two
to
three
good
year
to
get
use
to
the
job
before
any
major
challenge
might
crop
up
but
event
sure
make
my
time
estimate
off
the
mark
the
challenge
that
confront
jeff

his
first
year

all
without

jeff

have
to

more
difficulty
in
reinsurance
in

to
the
impact
of
the

during
this

the
capability
to

in
such
circumstance
highlight
in
fact
one
of
the
key
advantage
of

only
they
can
make
long

investment
in
a
struggle
business
and
at
the
same
time
deliver
consistent
overall
earnings
growth
because
of
the
strength
of
the
total
portfolio
as
a
result
when
the
massive
demand
for
power
come
on
in
the
late
ninety
ge

off
rapidly
and
there
be
numerous

the
good
news

that
both

this
