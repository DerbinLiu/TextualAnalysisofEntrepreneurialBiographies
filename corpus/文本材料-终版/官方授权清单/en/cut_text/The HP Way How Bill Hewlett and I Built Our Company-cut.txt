number
of
kid
from
our
neighborhood
go
out
and
sift
through
the
mud
intrigue
with
the
possibility
of

of
value
but
i
don
t
recall
find
anything
useful

lifelong
interest

to
be
an
excellent
recreational
activity

by
the
garden
in
pueblo
colorado
early
experiment
as
a
very
young
child
i
must
have
have
some
aptitude
for
science
and
math
my
parent
do
nothing
to
discourage
me
i
spent
hour
curl
up
with
the
family
world
book
encyclopedia
study
every
entry
on
the
natural
science
i
also
conduct
my
own
experiment
i
remember
that
while
quite
young
i
get
a
thrill
from
look
at
picture
of
railroad
bridge
motor
generator
and
other
mechanical
and
electrical
equipment
i
try
to
simulate
some
of
these
device
with
small
scale
model
in
our
backyard
an
old
boy
lloyd
penrose
live
across
the
alley
behind
us
his
mother
and
sister
have
tuberculosis
and
lloyd
work
in
the
evening
at
an
amusement
park
across
town
to
help
support
them
he
also
help
me
with
my
model
and
device
and
we
become
good
friend
later
on
since
he
could
not
afford
to
go
to
college
lloyd
join
the
navy
and
we
kept
in
touch
for
many
year
i
also
be
interested
in
explosive
friend
and
i
would
make
gunpowder
use
ammonium
nitrate
instead
of
sodium
nitrate
which
be
use
in
common
gunpowder
the
ammonium
nitrate
be
more
active
we
also
make
ammonium
iodide
by
dissolve
iodine
crystal
in
ammonia
we
then
separate
out
the
ammonium
iodide
with
filter
paper
and
when
it
be
dry
it
would
explode
from
a
mere
touch
about
a
mile
from
our
house
be
a
sand
mill
where
blasting
powder
be
kept
in
five
gallon
drum
we
found
that
a
tablespoon
or
two
of
powder
be
often
left
in
the
empty
drum
which
give
us
another
source
of
explosive
powder
play
with
explosive
be
a
dangerous
pastime
as
i
learn
from
experience
once
while
i
held
a
piece
of
copper
tube
load
with
explosive
powder
in
my
left
hand
and
pound
the
tube
close
with
a
hammer
in
my
right
hand
it
explode
lloyd
be
with
me
and
we
wrap
my
bleeding
hand
in
a
sheet
of
cloth
and
go
to
the
office
of
a
dr
wise
to
have
it
sewn
up
he
be
not
a
very
good
surgeon
and
i
have
live
with
a
distort
left
thumb
ever
since
needle
to
say
this
end
my
experiment
with
explosive
radio
be
another
keen
interest
i
recall
my
first
vacuum
tube
i
connect
this
tube
with
a
variable
condenser
a
coil
a
grid
lead
an
a
battery
a
b
battery
and
a
set
of
headphone
on
our
din
room
table
there
be
great
excitement
as
my
family
and
i
take
turn
listen
to
who
in
de
moines
iowa
an
astonish
six
hundred
mile
from
pueblo
i
put
together
a
fairly
sophisticated
vacuum
tube
receiver
when
i
be
twelve
year
old
by
the
time
i
reach
centennial
high
school
i
be
a
proficient
radio
operator
and
become
secretary
of
the

in
pueblo
my
father
be
not
a
fisherman
but
i
have
a
friend
wendell
spear
whose
family
would
spend
two
week
every
summer
fishing
in
the
gunnison
river
area
they
take
me
with
them
several
time
thus
my
interest
in
trout
fishing
begin
when
i
be
about
ten
year
old
at
that
time
the
limit
on
trout
be
fifty
fish
a
day
each
of
us
have
no
difficulty
catch
the
limit
i
can
still
remember
that
it
be
very
tiresome
hike
several
mile
back
to
camp
with
a
creel
full
of
fish
the
spear
would
bring
along
several
small
wooden
keg
to
salt
the
trout
and
preserve
it
for
winter
every
night
we
would
hang
the
fish
on
a
line
to
dry
and
in
the
morning
put
them
in
a
keg
a
layer
of
fish
and
then
a
layer
of
salt
and
so
on
until
the
keg
be
full
when
the
keg
be
open
in
the
winter
one
could
hardly
tell
the
difference
between
the
fish
and
the
salt
it
would
have
be
much
well
to
smoke
the
fish
but
none
of
us
knew
how
to
do
that
when
i
be
in
high
school
several
of
my
friend
and
i
would
go
fishing
for
a
week
or
two
every
summer
but
we
give
up
salt
our
catch
when
i
be
eleven
year
old
my
father
bought
me
a
pony
name
laddie
he
be
a
fairly
large
stallion
with
lot
of
energy
i
would
saddle
him
up
in
the
morning
and
when
i
get
on
him
he
would
buck
and
rear
up
then
when
my
father
hit
him
on
his
behind
with
a
broom
he
would
go
out
the
driveway
at
a
full
gallop
and
go
north
on
twenty
ninth
street
toward
the
prairie
he
would
spot
a
patch
of
alfalfa
race
up
to
it
at
full
speed
then
plant
his
foreleg
to
stop
and
eat
i
would
go
fly
over
his
head
and
hit
the
ground
he
knew
all
the
trick
to
get
rid
of
his
rider
such
as
run
next
to
a
barbed
wire
fence
to
scrape
him
off
my
father
wouldn
t
let
me
quit
however
so
i
finally
get
so
i
could
handle
him
and
we
become
good
friend
i
would
often
ride
him
out
in
the
prairie
to
hunt
on
one
of
the
last
ride
i
remember
we
be
go
full
speed
when
he
step
in
a
prairie
dog
hole
and
we
both
roll
in
the
dust
fortunately
he
do
not
break
a
leg
nor
do
i
this
be
a
hard
way
to
learn
how
to
handle
a
horse
but
over
the
year
i
have
do
a
lot
of
rid
some
of
it
in
tough

surprise
my

be
accepted
the
tuition
be

of
a
deepen
depression
my
father
have
be
appoint
a
bankruptcy
referee
in

point
in
a

i

it
take
too
much
time
from
my
study
and
i
have
come
to

to
be
a

be
very
upset
with
my
decision
football
be

peer
pressure
be
so
strong
that
i
played
football
through
my
senior
year
that
experience
reinforce
my
idea
on
how

be
attend

i
return

contribute
to
the
cost
of

i
felt
strongly
that
i
should
and
besides

dave
packard
as
an
end

haul
the
loose
rock
out
with
a
wheelbarrow
the
miner
would
send
sample

value
never
reach
the
a
ton
that
be
require
to

the
mine
profitable
the
price
of

set
at
an
ounce
by
president
roosevelt
at
today
s
price

would
have
be
profitable
another

pay
job
at
a
brickyard
in
pueblo
the
job

noontime
the
outside
temperature
have
usually
reach
a
hundred
degree
or
more
it
be
a
tough
job
that
deserve
my
high
pay

but
it
have
the
compensation
of
an
hour
or
so
of
good
fishing
after
dinner
my
extensive
knowledge
of
this
part
of
the
state
prompt
bill
hewlett
and
me
to
take
a
long
pack
trip
up

and
my
most
important
customer
be

the
next
day
i
can
t
recall
how
much
money
i
make
that
summer
but
i
believe
i
do
pretty
well
back
at
stanford
it
be
ham
radio
that
help
set
my
future
course
the
university
have
an
amateur
radio
station
in
a
small
building
just
off
the
engineering
corner
of
the
quad
it
be
near
the
laboratory
of
a
new
young
professor
name
fred
terman
i
didn
t
know
much
about
him
at
the
time
not
even
that
his
father
be
a
famous
educator
and
inventor
of
the
well
know
stanford
binet
intelligence
test
i
would
occasionally
spend
time
at
the
radio
station
and
professor
terman
would
stop
by
from
time
to
time
to
visit
with
me
finally
on
a
spring
day
in
he
invite
me
into
his
office
and
suggest
i
take
his
graduate
course
in
radio
engineering
during
my
senior
year
that
be
the
begin
of
a
series
of
event
that
result
in
the
establishment
of
the
hewlett
packard
company
as
the
first
undergraduate
to
be
invite
into
terman
s
graduate
course
i
felt
very
honor
it
be
that
class
taught
by
a
now
legendary
teacher
that
really
spark
my
enthusiasm
for
electronics
the
syllabus
for
the
course
serve
as
the
basis
for
terman
s
famous
text
book
radio
engineering
the
most
influential
text
on
the
subject
at
that
time
professor
terman
have
the
unique
ability
to
make
a
very
complex
problem
seem
the
essence
of
simplicity
this
be
the
secret
of
his
textbook
and
the
reason
the
book
become
the
most
widely
use
text
on
the
subject
in
the
world
it
be
a
difficult
class
and
a
demand
year
especially
because
i
be
play
on
the

football
team
at
the
time
carry
a
full
undergraduate
class

give
early
evidence
of
what
become
a
prominent
trait

do
what
they
do
and

lecture
class
he
couldn
t
write
note
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with

he
learn
how
to
listen
to
file
thought

often
say
that
if
his
father
hadn
t
die
he
might
have
chosen
a
career
in
medicine
he
have
joked
that
he
chose
electrical
engineering
as
a
college
major
because
he
like
electric
train
but
certainly
in
those
early
year
his
interest
be
as
much
in
chemistry
and
mathematics
as
in
electricity
through
bill
i
become
friendly
with
ed
porter

much
about

he
partially
support
himself
at

by
repair
them
the
son
of
an
episcopal
archbishop
ed
be
a
dynamic
character
who
be
to
play
an
important
role
in
our
life
for
the
next
forty
year
his
father
be
the

and
prior
to
his
death
baptize
three
of
their

and
all
four
of
my

and
mine
there
be
also
in
terman
s
graduate
class
a
young
man
name
barney
oliver
he
have
just
transfer
to
stanford
from
cal
tech
as
a
junior
have
already
take
most
of
the
require
engineering
class
so
terman
let
him
take
the
graduate
class
on
the
stipulation
that
if
barney
didn
t
pas
the
first
midterm
examination
he
d
have
to
drop
out
in
fact
he
get
the
high
grade
not
only
on
the
midterm
but
on
every
exam
for
the
rest
of
the
year
form
a
nucleus
largely
because
of
terman
s
class
the
four
of
us
hewlett
porter
oliver
and
i
become
fast
friend
it
be
not
a
coincidence
that
a
few
year
later
this
group
would
become
the
management
team
of
hewlett
packard
porter
who
die
in
spent
thirty
year
at
the

of
the
great

century
retire
in

now
devotes
his
energy
to
such
project
as
seti
the
search
for
extraterrestrial
intelligence
bill
hewlett
s
and
my
common
interest
in
the
outdoors
first
manifest
itself
in
our
junior
year
when
one
of
our
professor
organize
a
field
trip
to
the
sierra
nevada
to
visit
a
hydroelectric
power
plant
operate
by
southern
california
edison
bill
and
i
take
that
occasion
to
go
fishing
and
have
a
wonderful
time
that
be
a
precursor
of
many
trip
to
the
mountain
include
a
two
week
pack
trip
in
colorado
shortly
after
we
graduate
in
on
that
occasion
we
plus
a
horse
we
rent
for
a
dollar
a
day
hike
up
into
the
san
juan
mountain
there
be
no
question
that
a
share
love
of
the
outdoors
strengthen
our
friendship
and
help
build
a
mutual
understand
and
respect
that
be
at
the
core
of
our
successful
business
relationship
last
more
than
a
half
century
fred
terman
s
keen
interest
in
radio
engineering
induced
him
to
become
acquaint
with
almost
all
of
the
pioneer
in
the
industry
many
of
whom
be
locate
in
the
palo
alto
area
early
wireless
work
by
stanford
graduate
cyril
f
elwell
be
organize
into
the
federal
telegraph
company
at
the
begin
of
the
century
lee
de
forest
invent
the
vacuum
tube
in
palo
alto
in
and
fritz
kolster
developed
the
radio
direction
finder
in
the
s
in
the
early
s
many
bay
area
firm
move
to
chicago
which
have
become
the
center
of
the
radio
industry
in
federal
telegraph
move
east
to
new
jersey
but
a
lot
of
people
didn
t
want
to
move
they
opt
instead
to
stay
in
the
area
and
start
their
own
technology
firm
in
the
s
terman
s
graduate
course
in
radio
engineering
include
visit
to
some
of
these
firm
i
remember
visit
kaar
engineering
in
palo
alto
eitel
mccullough
in
burlingame
and
charlie
litton
s
shop
which
would
in
time
become
litton
industry
in
redwood
city
i
also
go
to
san
francisco
to
meet
philo
farnsworth
who
be
develop
a
television
camera
tube
i
remember
terman
say
something
like
well
as
you
can
see
most
of
these
successful
radio
firm
be
built
by
people
without
much
education
add
that
business
opportunity
be
even
great
for
someone
with
a
sound
theoretical
background
in
the
field
that
get
us
think
and
in
our
senior
year
with
terman
s
encouragement
bill
hewlett
ed
porter
barney
oliver
and
i
be
make
tentative
plan
to
try
to
do
something
on
our
own
after
graduation
but
our
plan
be
set
aside
when
in
the
spring
of
i
receive
a
job
offer
from
general
electric
the
country
be
then
in
the
throe
of
the
great
depression
and
job
be
scarce
terman
encourage
me
to
take
the
ge
job
point
out
that
i
would
learn
a
great
deal
that
would
prove
useful
in
our
own
endeavor
he
also
thought
bill
would
benefit
from
some
graduate
work
so
we
agree
to
postpone
our
business
venture
still
determine
eventually
to
start
the
company
we
have
talk
about
experience
at
general
electric
since
my
job
at
general
electric
do
not
start
until
february
i
decide
to
take
some
fall
quarter
course
at
the
university
of
colorado
in
boulder
the
best
course
be
one
in
engineering
mathematics
taught
by
a
professor
hutchison
he
could
put
two
column
of
five
digit
number
of
about
twenty
line
on
the
blackboard
and
add
both
column
faster
than
anyone
in
the
class
could
add
one
i
found
his
course
to
be
one
of
the
most
interest
i
have
ever
take
in
january
i
drove
my
mother
and
sister
east
to
visit
some
friend
in
pittsburgh
then
i
drove
up
to
schenectady
to
begin
my
job
with
ge
on
my
first
day
i
met
with
a
mr
boring
who
have
interviewed
me
at
stanford
he
knew
of
my
interest
in
electronics
still
call
radio
but
told
me
there
be
no
future
for
electronics
at
general
electric
and
recommend
that
i
concentrate
my
work
and
interest
on
generator
motor
and
other
heavy
component
for
public
utility
plant
and
electrical
transmission
system
i
have
often
thought
of
the
irony
of
mr
boring
s
advice
because
our
electronics
firm
hewlett
packard
company
have
become
large
than
the
entire
general
electric
company
be
at
the
time
he
give
me
that
advice
ge
continued
its
policy
even
during
the
depression
of
hire
some
college
graduate
each
year
and
initially
put
them
to
work
in
various
test
department
my
first
assignment
be
in
refrigerator
product
test
refrigerator
for
leak
and
other
problem
it
be
on
the
swing
shift
and
be
not
very
interest
i
decide
to
look
for
another
job
on
my
own
and
found
one
first
in
the
radio
transmitter
department
test
equipment
be
built
for
the
army
that
be
not
very
challenge
either
so
i
look
around
far
and
found
a
job
in
the
vacuum
tube
engineering
department
it
be
in
the
same
building
as
ge
s
main
research
department
this
new
job
be
interest
and
i
have
a
chance
as
well
to
meet
some
bright
people
from
the
main
research
laboratory
my
initial
assignment
be
in
the
section
where
they
be
make
control
mercury
vapor
rectifier
tube
for
the
control
of
spot
and
seam
weld
the
large
tube
be
a
glass
bulb
about
the
size
of
a
gallon
jug
with
the
anode
held
by
a
seal
at
the
top
and
the
mercury
pool
connect
by
a
seal
through
the
bottom
the
control
element
be
a
point
piece
of
silicon
carbide
connect
by
a
seal
and
a
lead
on
one
side
of
the
tube
the
arc
be
start
on
each
positive
cycle
during
the
control
period
and
could
be
control
to
a
fraction
of
a
cycle
if
the
control
element
lose
control
the
tube
blew
up
the
test
facility
be
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
building
and
there
be
two
large
warehouse
door
that
be
left
open
whenever
a
test
be
under
way
the
tube
be
protect
with
a
strong
metal
mesh
shield
it
contain
the
glass
splinter
if
a
tube
explode
but
the
mercury
pool
become
a
cloud
of
mercury
vapor
that
drift
out
of
the
room
through
the
open
door
the
operator
have
to
run
through
the
door
ahead
of
the
mercury
vapor
and
wait
for
it
to
disperse
before
enter
the
room
again
these
tube
be
make
in
batch
of
twenty
and
every
tube
in
the
last
batch
have
fail
when
i
be
give
the
job
of
get
the
next
batch
through
work
together
i
learn
everything
i
could
about
possible
cause
of
failure
and
i
decide
to
spend
most
of
my
time
on
the
factory
floor
to
make
sure
every
step
be
do
properly
it
soon
become
apparent
that
the
instruction
the
engineering
department
give
the
factory
people
be
not
adequate
to
ensure
that
every
step
would
be
do
properly
i
found
the
factory
people
eager
to
do
the
job
right
we
work
together
to
conduct
test
and
identify
every
possible
cause
of
failure
and
as
a
result
every
tube
in
that
batch
of
twenty
pass
its
final
test
without
a
single
failure
that
be
a
very
important
lesson
for
me
that
personal
communication
be
often
necessary
to
back
up
write
instruction
that
be
the
genesis
of
what
become
management
by
walk
around
at
the
hewlett
packard
company
in
those
day
my
ge
friend
and
i
be
each
earn
less
than
per
month
so
five
or
six
of
us
rent
a
large
house
and
hire
a
housekeeper
since
we
could
live
on
a
dollar
per
day
we
have
quite
a
bit
left
for
everything
else
one
could
buy
a
fairly
good
suit
for
and
even
with
a
low
salary
could
actually
save
a
few
dollar
each
month
i
enjoy
my
experience
at
ge
i
be
able
to
learn
many
thing
that
later
prove
helpful
when
we
start
our
own
business
and
i
also
developed
close
friendship
with
some
individual
who
would
later
make
their
own
mark
in
electronics
one
be

be
an

i
would
call

ask
him
about

we
might
want
to
hire

have
start
with

when

behn
who
ran
federal

move
the
company
to
new
jersey
in
charlie
decide
to
set
up
his
own
manufacturing
company
he
thought
the
vacuum
tube
manufacturing
equipment
that
be
on
the
market
be
not
good
enough
so
he
decide
to
design
and
manufacture
his
own
glass
blowing
lathe
for
the
big
kilowatt
tube
that
be
use
by

no
sooner
make
his

litton
answer
the
call
most
of
the
people
around
the
country
do
vacuum
tube
work
knew
about
charlie
s
activity
and
order
his
new
design
his
most
important
contribution
be
the
design
of
a
low
vapor
pressure
oil
all
metal
vacuum
pump
up
until
then
most
of
the
vacuum
pump
have
be
mercury
vapor
pump
such
as
the
pump
i
use
at
ge
these
have
the
disadvantage
of
require
that
the
mercury
vapor
trap
be
cool
by
liquid
air
source
of
low
vapor
pressure
oil
in
the
country
be
very
limited
but
charlie
have
discover
that
by
distil
a
certain
commercial
brand
of
motor
oil
he
could
produce
his
own
low
vapor
pressure
oil
in
at
the
urge
of
physicist
albert
einstein
and
leo
szilard
president
roosevelt
establish
an
enterprise
to
produce
an
atomic
explosion
use
uranium
fission
the
people
involve
in
this
undertaking
later
know
as
the
manhattan
project
decide
to
use
a
process
require
a
large
volume
of
low
vapor
pressure
oil
and
they
decide
that
charlie
could
produce
the
oil
quicker
and
well
than
anyone
else
in
a
typically
litton
manner
he
order
the
large
redwood
water
tank
available
set
it
up
in
three
or
four
week
and
instal
the
still
the
motor
oil
be
deliver
in
railroad
tank
car
to
redwood
city
and
then
charlie
distil
it
in
his
water
tank
building
although
i
have
not
be
clear
to
know
about
the
project
i
be
work
so
closely
with
charlie
that
i
knew
all
about
it
charlie
s
talent
also
extend
to

with
a
motor
and
a
transmission
to
power
two
of
its
wheel
after

he
be
among
the
first
to
recognize
how
effective
a
jeep
could
be
in
maneuvering
in
the
sierra

that
he
decide
to
stay
in
the
valley
rather
than
join
bill
and
me
but
ed
do
ask
us
to
design
some
custom
control
equipment
for
his
air
conditioner
in
the
fall
of
we
have
not
yet
decide
on
what
product
we
should
develop
and
manufacture
and
so
we
do
a
number
of
job
that
come
to
our
attention
t
i
moseley
be
a
local
entrepreneur
and
president
of
his
own
company
dalmo
victor
he
come
to
us
with
a
number
of
idea
for
product
in
our
early
day
at
one
point
he
even
decide
to
produce
harmonica
moseley
knew
about
an
audio
oscillator
bill
have
developed
and
he
ask
us
to
produce
a
tuner
for
his
harmonica
use
this
oscillator
it
turn
out
that
the
oscillator
be
not
nearly
accurate
enough
to
do
this
i
don
t
remember
what
ever
come
of
moseley
s
harmonica
moseley
also
be
try
to
develop
an
exerciser
use
electrical
pulse
to
activate
the
muscle
he
have
an
accommodate
wife
and
we
spent
one
sunday
apply
electrical
current
of
different
frequency
to
activate
her
leg
muscle
neither
of
moseley
s
project
be
put
into
production
but
his
assignment
provide
a
little
income
for
bill
and
me
we
design
and
built
a
variable
frequency
motor
controller
for
the
lick
observatory
atop
nearby
mount
hamilton
our
controller
enable
the
telescope
to
track
accurately
we
also
invent
a
signal
device
to
indicate
a
foul
line
roll
for
a
local
bowling
alley
these
miscellaneous
job
make
us
more
sure
of
ourselves
and
our
skill
they
also
reveal
something
we
hadn
t
plan
but
that
be
of
great
benefit
to
our
partnership
namely
that
our
ability
tend
to
be
complementary
bill
be
well
train
in
circuit
technology
and
i
be
well
train
and
more
experienced
in
manufacturing
process
this
combination
of
ability
be
particularly
useful
in
design
and
manufacturing
electronic
product
from
our
effort
in
building
various
device
we
d
make
a
little
money
and
in
the
back
of
our
mind
be
grow
the
notion
that
just
maybe
one
of
these
device
could
be
developed
into
a
viable
product
in
recognition
of
our
progress
small
as
it
be
bill
and
i
begin
by
signing
a
partnership
agreement
i
don
t
remember
the
exact
term
of
the
agreement
but
i
know
it
be
pretty
informal
bill
advanced
some
money
to
buy
some
component
and
tool
and
i
contribute
the
equipment
i
brought
from
schenectady
we
flip
a
coin
to
see
whose
name
would
come
first
in
the
company
name
needle
to
say
bill
won
fred
terman
be
once
again
behind
the
next
step
back
in
a
bell
lab
scientist
name
harold
black
have
write
a
paper
about
a
new
idea
call
negative
feedback
it
be
ideal
for
telephone
repeater
or
amplifier
because
by
use
this
technique
the
gain
of
an
amplifier
could
be
make
relatively
independent
of
change
in
the
characteristic
of
the
vacuum
tube
involve
for
the
same
reason
it
become
useful
in
electronic
measure
instrument
in
the
spring
of
work
in
terman
s
laboratory
a
group
of
student
include
bill
hewlett
developed
some
laboratory
equipment
application
for
negative
feedback
bill
s
important
contribution
be
the
resistance
stabilize
audio
oscillator
terman
also
make
an
important
contribution
by
use
some
approximation
he
reduce
the
black
equation
to
a
simpler
form
that
be
much
easy
to
use
bill
s
audio
oscillator
represent
the
first
practical
low
cost
method
of
generate
high
quality

work
the
audio
oscillator
be
to
become
the
hewlett
packard
company
s
first
product
later
that
year
after
we
start
up
in
the
garage
terman
arrange
for
harold
buttner
an
engineering
graduate
of
stanford
and
international
telephone
and
telegraph
s
vice
president
of
research
and
development
to
take
a
look
at
bill
s
oscillator
buttner
be
so
impressed
that
he
offer
us
for
the
foreign
patent
right
and
help
in
get
the
u
s
patent
in
november
we
built
a
model
of
the
audio
oscillator
and
bill
take
it
up
to
portland
oregon
to
an
institute
of
radio
engineer
conference
the
response
be
positive
enough
that
we
decide
to
make
a
run
for
it
we
built
the
first
production
model
by
christmas
and
i
clearly
recall
have
this
unit
sit
on
the
mantel
above
the
fireplace
there
we
take
picture
of
it
and
produce
a
two
page
sale
brochure
that
we
sent
to
a
list
of
about
twenty
five
potential
customer
provide
by
fred
terman
we
designate
this
first
product
the
model
a
because
we
thought
the
name
would
make
us
look
like
we
d
be
around
for
a
while
we
be
afraid
that
if
people
knew
we
d
never
actually
developed
design
and
built
a
finish
product
they
d
be
scar
off
our
pricing
be
even
more
naive
we
set
it
at
not
because
of
any
cost
calculation
but
because
of
all
thing
it
remind
us
of
o
or
fight
the
slogan
use
in
the
campaign
to
establish
the
northern
border
of
the
united
state
in
the
pacific
northwest
we
soon
discover
we
couldn
t
afford
to
build
the
machine
for
that
price
luckily
our
near
competition
be
a
oscillator
from
general
radio
which
give
us
considerable
room
to
maneuver
we
weren
t
expect
much
from
our
first
mail
but
amazingly
enough
in
the
first
couple
of
week
of
january
back
come
several
order
and
some
be
accompany
by
check
charlie
litton
be
a
tremendous
help
in
get
us
start
in
production
he
give
us
access
to
his
shop
so
we
could
do
thing
we
weren
t
able
to
accomplish
in
the
garage
on
our
own
use
charlie
s
foundry
i
have
make
the
pattern
and
cast
the
aluminum
part
for
the
air
conditioning
control
device
we
supply
ed
porter
litton
also
have
an
engrave
machine
so
we
d
be
able
to
engrave
the
hotel
name
on
the
control
fabricate
instrument
panel
when
we
start
make
the
audio
oscillator
we
bought
the
cabinet
but
make
the
panel
ourselves
we
saw
them
out
of
aluminum
and
drill
the
hole
then
we
d
spraypaint
them
at
home
and
use
the
kitchen
oven
to
bake
on
the
paint
then
i
d
take
the
panel
up
to
charlie
s
and
engrave
all
the
designation
on
the
panel
through
the
paint
next
we
calibrate
the
dial
by
set
up
a
frequency
standard
then
we
marked
the
dial
with
a
pencil
and
i
d
go
back
up
to
charlie
s
and
engrave
those
pencil
line
in
the
begin
each
of
the
oscillator
be
individually
calibrate
there
be
always
a
few
trick
involve
in
use
the
engrave
equipment
and
charlie
knew
them
all
i
suppose
we
could
have
eventually
do
many
of
these
thing
on
our
own
but
have
charlie
litton
and
his
equipment
there
make
an
important
difference
during
a
period
when
time
and
money
be
very
tight
he
never
saw
us
as
competitor
but
always
as
compatriot
charlie
do
something
else
important
as
well
he
love
to
expound
and
philosophize
on
new
idea
and
whenever
he
want
to
learn
more
about
something
he
d
organize
a
seminar
at
his
shop
and
invite
me
and
a
few
other
people
usually
from
stanford
among
this
group
be
alex
poniatoff
who
later
found
ampex
corporation
the
seminar
occur
several
time
during
i
can
remember
a
number
of
discussion
about
physical
phenomenon
such
as
wave
theory
and
quantum
mechanic
we
also
talk
about
business
philosophy
charlie
be
very
conservative
in
this
regard
as
eccentric
as
he
be
he
knew
you
have
to
support
your
company
and
pay
your
bill
i
learn
a
lot
about
run
a
business
from
those
conversation
i
also
gain
a
lot
from
two
class
i
take
at
stanford
that
fall
of
business
law
and
management
accounting
i
have
sign
up
because
i
thought
they
might
be
of
some
use
in
our
new
business
look
back
they
be
among
the
most
important
course
i
ever
take
because
the
first
taught
me
enough
about
partnership
contract
and
incorporation
so
that
for
the
next
few
year
we
rarely
require
the
service
of
lawyer
and
the
second
help
me
set
up
the
book
and
with
lu
s
help
in
the
evening
and
on
sunday
keep
them
balance
the
disney
sale
myth
and
fact
when
bill
hewlett
take
the
original
model
of
the
audio
oscillator
to
the
technical
conference
in
portland
in
november
he
show
it
to
several
people
among
those
who
express
considerable
interest
in
it
be
bud
hawkins
the
chief
sound
engineer
from
walt
disney
studio
hawkins
be
develop
the
sound
equipment
for
disney
s
innovative
movie
fantasia
and
be
planning
to
buy
for
each
audio
oscillator
from
the
general
radio
company
when
bill
told
him
our
model
would
cost
less
than
hawkins
decide
to
buy
our
oscillator
instead
of
general
radio
s
in
the
end
after
hawkins
have
us
make
enough
modification
in
the
original
design
for
the
result
to
be
the
model
b
he
order
eight
unit
at
each
through
the
year
there
have
be
considerable
overstatement
about
this
sale
to
disney
contrary
to
some
view
hp
do
not
make
a
technical
contribution
to
the
production
of
fantasia
instead
we
enable
disney
to
buy
a
good
product
at
a
price
considerably
less
than
our
competitor
s
it
s
also
be
say
that
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
our
sale
to
disney
we
might
have
go
out
of
business
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
that
with
or
without
the
disney
sale
bill
and
i
be
determine
to
move
ahead
with
our
company
another
gentleman
who
take
an
early
interest
in
our
activity
and
who
be
destine
to
play
an
immensely
important
role
in
the
success
of
hewlett
packard
be
norman
neely
norm
be
a
southern
california
manufacturer
representative
handle
radio
record
and
other
electrical
equipment
he
have
heard
about
hewlett
s
oscillator
and
invite
bill
to
speak
at
the
radio
engineer
club
in
los
angeles
the
even
do
not
start
out
on
a
promising
note
for
it
begin
with
the
club
president
introduce
bill
hewlett
as
bill
packard
but
the
presentation
itself
drew
a
strong
response
none
more
so
than
the
one
from
norm
himself
shortly
thereafter
norm
visit
bill
and
me
in
our
addison
avenue
garage
we
have
already
approach
him
about
be
our
first
sale
representative
and
during
his
visit
we
reach
a
verbal
agreement
and
seal
it
with
a
handshake
that
be
the
way
we
be
to
conduct
our
business
with
norm
for
the
next
fifty
year
during
our
conversation
norm
emphasize
the
importance
of
our
offering
more
than
one
product
because
a
single
product
rarely
make
a
successful
company
the
product
that
bill
and
his
associate
have
developed
at
stanford
in
the
spring
of
include
a
number
of
instrument
design
to
make
audio
frequency
measurement
in
addition
to
bill
s
oscillator
we
decide
to
develop
a
full
line
of
audio
frequency
measure
instrument
base
on
this
work
that
meant
we
would
be
in
direct
competition
with
the
general
radio
company
at
the
end
of
our
first
full
year
in
business
our
sale
total
and
we
have
make
in
profit
we
would
show
a
profit
every
year
thereafter
chapter
gain
more
space
by
the
fall
of
our
business
have
grown
to
the
point
where
we
need
additional
space
so
we
rent
a
small
building
in
palo
alto
on
page
mill
road
near
el
camino
real
behind
the
workshop
of
john
tinker
bell
and
about
two
mile
from
the
garage
about
that
same
time
bill
hewlett
married
flora
lamson
whom
he
have
first
met
when
they
be
child
and
their
family
be
vacation
in
the
sierra
bill
be
more
than
happy
to
give
up
his
tiny
one
room
bachelor
quarter
on
addison
avenue
to
move
into
a
house
with
flora
not
far
from
our
new
shop
we
set
up
an
office
in
the
front
section
of
our
new
building
while
the
back
room
held
a
few
machine
tool
and
assembly
bench
there
be
also
facility
for
hot
dip
and
painting
it
seem
as
if
we
have
all
the
space
we
would
ever
need
not
that
our
new
location
be
without
its
problem
in
the
winter
when
it
rain
water
would
run
down
page
mill
road
and
occasionally
we
d
have
to
sandbag
the
front
door
to
keep
the
water
out
to
replace
lu
s
kitchen
oven
which
we
have
use
to
bake
paint
onto
our
cabinet
we
built
an
oven
out
of
an
old
refrigerator
and
have
it
out
back
behind
the
shop
unfortunately
we
didn
t
take
into
account
that
the
refrigerator
have
kapok
insulation
and
one
night
the
thing
caught
fire
luckily
somebody
be
drive
by
saw
the
flame
and
call

for
the
opening
of
the
winter
olympics
in
those
early
day
bill
and
i
have
to
be
versatile
we
have
to
tackle
almost
everything
ourselves
from
invent
and
building
product
to
pricing
packaging
and
shipping
them
from
deal
with
customer
and
sale
representative
to
keep
the
book
from
write
the
ad
to
sweep
up
at
the
end
of
the
day
many
of
the
thing
i
learn
in
this
process
be
invaluable
and
not
available
in
business
school
we
found
chat
part
for
our
product
be
price
on
a
two
level
structure
manufacturer
representative
sell
to
retail
dealer
at
the
factory
price
and
then
the
retail
dealer
marked
up
the
part
ten
time
for
sale
to
their
customer
we
get
acquaint
with
the
allen
bradley
representative
bill
purdy
who
set
us
up
to
buy
at
factory
price
we
later
be
able
to
work
out
the
same
arrangement
for
other
component
and
thus
could
buy
most
of
our
part
at
percent
of
the
retail
price
of
great
difficulty
be
obtain
the
cabinet
and
chassis
for
our
product
at
the
time
the
bay
area
have
few
sheet
metal
or
mechanical
part
shop
we
hire
a
man
name
al
spear
to
make
our
cabinet
it
be
customary
in
those
day
to
have
measurement
equipment
in
wooden
cabinet
most
cabinet
be
make
of
walnut
but
we
decide
to
use
oak
as
we
design
test
equipment
for
high
frequency
we
give
up
use
wood
because
it
serve
no
useful
purpose
and
add
to
the
cost
our
sheet
metal
work
be
do
by
ernie
shiller
who
have
a
one
man
shop
just
down
the
street
from
our
addison
avenue
garage
ernie
be
a
gruff
old
fellow
but
he
be
a
good
mechanic
and
a
good
craftsman
and
he
do
our
sheet
metal
work
for
a
number
of
year
a
need
for
cash
cash
flow
be
a
frequent
problem
during
those
early
day
i
recall
that
early
in
the
itt
company
have
a
contract
to
build
an
instrument
for
an
aircraft
land
system
the
system
require
a
variable
frequency
oscillator
and
a
crystal
control
fix
frequency
oscillator
general
radio
a
company
i
mention
earlier
as
a
supplier
of
audio
oscillator
have
provide
itt
with
the
variable
frequency
oscillator
but
shy
away
from
the
fix
frequency
version
we
agree
to
take
it
on
not
know
any
well
and
it
turn
out
to
be
a
great
challenge
as
we
start
work
it
become
obvious
we
didn
t
have
enough
engineering
talent
to
complete
the
job
in
the
time
require
fortunately
i
be
able
to
hire
noel
eldred
bill
doolittle
and
brunton
bauer
from
heintz
and
kaufman
all
three
become
important
member
of
our
team
we
manage
to
build
the
unit
to
the
require
specification
and
we
deliver
it
to
itt
along
with
our
invoice
for
some
time
we
didn
t
get
paid
and
it
get
to
the
point
where
unless
we
receive
payment
we
couldn
t
meet
the
next
week
s
payroll
so
i
call
harold
buttner
our
friend
at
itt
and
he
immediately
wire
the
fund
to
me
dave
packard
left
and
bill
hewlett
in
the
shop
harold
be
a
good
friend
in
a
number
of
way
and
when
he
retire
from
itt
i
immediately
ask
him
to
join
our
hp
board
he
become
one
of
our
best
director
and
because
of
his
experience
at
itt
he
knew
people
at
virtually
every
electronics
company
in
the
world
our
experience
with
the
itt
contract
convince
me
that
we
need
more
work
capital
i
conclude
that
the
thing
to
do
be
to
establish
some
credit
with
the
bank
of
america
the
large
bank
in
california
we
apply
for
a
loan
of
and
they
sent
a
man
out
to
look
us
over
he
apparently
wasn
t
very
impressed
for
the
bank
agree
to
give
us
a
loan
only
if
we
would
sign
over
to
it
our
account
receivable
that
didn
t
have
much
appeal
to
us
so
i
go
over
to
our
little
local
bank
palo
alto
national
and
introduce
myself
to
its
president
jud
crary
he
say
he
remember
me
as
an
athlete
at
stanford
i
described
our
initial
success
and
explain
that
we
now
need
a
loan
of
to
expand
our
business
crary
listen
carefully
ask
some
question
then
write
out
a
note
for
me
to
sign
we
then
walk
across
the
room
and
he
hand
me
a
deposit
slip
for
that
little
leap
of
faith
on
crary
s
part
be
the
begin
of
a
long
and
happy
relationship
between
us
and
when
we
finally
grow
to
the
point
where
our
financing
requirement
be
beyond
the
bank
s
legal
limit
we
go
to
palo
alto
national
s
associate
bank
well
fargo
the
well
fargo
bank
sent
a
retire
engineer
to
visit
us
i
spent
a
full
afternoon
with
him
and
i
have
remember
ever
since
some
advice
he
give
me
he
say
that
more
business
die
from
indigestion
than
starvation
i
have
observe
the
truth
of
that
advice
many
time
since
then
in
the
fall
of
shortly
after
we
have
move
from
the
garage
to
the
page
mill
road
building

genrad
as
it
be
now
know
have
be
establish
for
some
time
and
bill
and
i
knew
it
to
be
a
fine
company

terman
have
introduce
us
to
eastham
who
spent
an
afternoon

some
very
good
advice
on
how
to
organize
and
run
a
company
i
knew
by
then
that
eastham
realize
we
be
go
to
be
in
direct
competition
with
his
company
and
i
anticipate
that
our
meeting
with
him
would
be
uncomfortable
he
assure
us
however
that
competition
be
a
good
thing
and
it
be
well
to
have
two
company
introduce
a
new
product
especially
if
it
incorporate
new
technology
because
that
make
it
all
the
more
credible
to
the
customer

signal
corp
during
those
year
we
be
both
so
busy
that
we
have
little
contact
hp
be
not
a
defense
contractor
in
the
sense
of
design
and
building
equipment
solely
for
the
military
but
since
much
of
our
equipment
be
bought
by
the
military
service
and
by
defense
contractor
we
grow
rapidly
during
the
war
our
annual
sale
volume
move
up
to
a
million
dollar
very
quickly
and
by
the
end
of
the
war
we
employ
two
hundred
people
there
be
a
state
employment
office
in
palo
alto
and
we
get
most
of
our
people
through
this
office
i
recall
hire
a
retire
army
officer
cap
stuart
and
ask
him
to
take
over
our
payroll
accounting
and
the
distribution
of
our
payroll
expense
he
do
a
very
thorough
job
and
make
sure
that
everything
balance
down
to
the
last
penny
we
also
hire
a
retire
mechanical
engineer
rufe
kingman
who
turn
out
to
be
an
expert
machinery
designer
we
take
on
a
major
job
for
the
navy
that
require
a
servo
system
to
control
antenna
dish
rufe
knew
what
tolerance
be
require
for
the
bearing
and
he
do
an
excellent
job
design
the
gear
he
also
design
a
machine
to
make
plastic
card
to
hold
the
component
it
form
the
terminal
from
a
long
brass
strip
punch
the
hole
for
the
terminal
and
insert
and
lock
the
terminal
this
provide
an
excellent
mount
for
our
component
at
a
very
low
cost
we
use
these
terminal
card
in
all
our
design
until
we
start
use
print
circuit
board
we
also
devise
a
manual
dexterity
test
to
help
us
find
people
who
could
mount
and
solder
component
skillfully
this
be
a
relatively
simple
operation
but
if
not
do
properly
can
lead
to
product
failure
in
the
early
s
sothenes
behn
built
a
major
factory
in
new
jersey
which
be
design
to
manufacture
most
of
the
magnetron
for
the
war
effort
it
be
laid
out
with
wide
aisle
in
the
production
area
so
that
behn
could
comfortably
escort
the
big
brass
visitor
from
washington
it
have
only
one
problem
it
couldn
t
produce
even
one
good
tube
in
desperation
behn
ask
charlie
litton
to
come
back
and
make
the
factory
work
charlie
agree
a
good
administrative

jack
cope
land
be
sent
out
from
new
jersey
and
put
in
charge
of
charlie
s
operation
in
redwood
city
jack
do
not
have
any
technical
knowledge
or
experience
so
i
offer
to
help
about
a
year
later
a
major
fire
at
litton
engineering
laboratory
destroyed
much
of
their
machine
shop
by
that
time
we
at
hp
have
built
up
a
good
machine
shop
in
palo
alto
but
we
be
use
it
only
on
the
day
shift
so
i
make
hp
s
shop
available
to
jack
and
his
people
at
night
that
fit
their
schedule
and
enable
them
to
keep
go
until
they
could
rebuild
and
reequip
their
own
plant
we
begin
operating
two
shift
of
worker
during
the
war
and
in
we
built
our
first
building
at
page
mill
road
to
accommodate
our
increase
production
although
the
pressure
to
meet
production
deadline
be
enormous
there
be
also
lot
of
excitement
and
a
great
sense
of
camaraderie
we
be
one
of
only
three
california
manufacturer
to
win
the
army
navy
e
award
in
only
percent
of
all
manufacturer
in
the
united
state
be
so
honor
our
people
work
very
hard
and
we
want
to
recognize
and
encourage
their
contribution
even
before
the
war
bill
and
i
have
begin
implement
an
incentive
compensation
plan
for
all
our
people
a
plan
base
on
something
we
d
learn
from
general
radio
it
involve
a
complicate
formula
but
in
essence
it
paid
everyone
a
bonus
as
a
percentage
of
their
base
pay
should
production
exceed
certain
level
general
radio
s
plan
apply
to
engineer
only
but
bill
and
i
thought
everyone
at
hp
should
be
include
we
want
to
recognize
the
contribution
of
each
individual
not
just
a
special
group
hewlett
packard
production
line
c
the
plan
work
very
well
and
be
especially
helpful
during
the
war
wage
have
be
frozen
by
law
but
since
plan
like
this
that
have
already
be
establish
could
stay
in
effect
we
be
able
to
continue
our
program
of
pay
bonus
tie
to
production
eventually
because
of
big
gain
in
productivity
the
bonus
to
our
entire
workforce
rise
to
as
much
as
percent
of
base
wage
at
that
point
which
be
some
time
after
the
war
we
abandon
this
particular
bonus
plan
but
in
no
way
do
we
discontinue
the
practice
of
share
profit
among
all
our
people
to
this
day
hewlett
packard
have
a
profit
share
program
that
encourages
teamwork
and
maintains
that
important
link
between
employee
effort
and
corporate
success
one
day
early
in
the
war
i
come
to
the
office
to
find
two
men
from
the
local
renegotiation
board
wait
to
see
me
renegotiation
be
a
procedure
establish
by
the
federal
government
to
prevent
company
from
make
excessive
profit
from
their
war
effort
it
be
a
good
program
under
which
the
government
try
to
allow
a
reasonable
profit
for
good
performance
bill
and
i
have
decide
we
be
go
to
reinvest
our
profit
and
not
resort
to
long
term
borrowing
i
felt
very
strongly
about
this
issue
and
we
found
we
be
clearly
able
to
finance
percent
growth
per
year
by
reinvesting
our
profit
after
some
discussion
with
the
member
of
the
board
they
seem
to
be
impressed
with
what
we
be
do
but
say
they
have
a
limit
of
percent
of
profit
they
could
allow
on
equity
i
point
out
that
our
business
have
be
double
every
year
and
that
it
would
continue
to
do
so
for
several
year
i
also
told
them
that
i
have
kept
my
salary
at
a
low
level
than
it
should
have
be
because
i
do
not
think
it
be
fair
for
my
salary
to
be
high
than
bill
s
army
salary
moreover
i
point
out
that
we
have
control
our
cost
to
the
extent
that
the
government
could
not
get
well
product
from
anyone
else
at
a
low
price
for
these
reason
i
would
not
accept
percent
on
equity
they
say
i
would
have
to
take
my
case
to
washington
i
do
so
and
work
out
an
agreement
with
the
government
that
give
our
company
virtually
everything
we
ask
for
entry
into
microwave
even
though
production
continued
to
be
our
main
emphasis
we
begin
to
get
into
product
development
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
when
we
get
acquaint
with
some
people
at
the
naval
research
laboratory
we
be
interested
in
sell
them
our
standard
product
but
also
interested
in
find
out
what
other
instrument
they
might
need
in
the
course
of
this
relationship
we
become
acquaint
with
dr
andy
haeff
who
head
a
section
of
the
lab
dr
haeff
and
his
associate
have
developed
a
microwave
signal
generator
and
they
want
to
get
additional
unit
built
for
use
by
the
navy
we
have
no
previous
experience
in
the
frequency
range
but
we
agree
to
build
these
unit
we
have
to
figure
out
how
to
do
the
manufacturing
with
our
limited
machine
shop
capability
norman
shrock
be
helpful
in
this
project
and
somehow
we
get
it
do
and
deliver
some
unit
within
a
short
time
and
at
a
reasonable
cost
dr
haeff
be
impressed
and
ask
us
to
do
some
far
work
for
the
navy
we
developed
additional
instrument
and
later
on
again
work
with
dr
haeff
we
built
a
device
his
group
developed
that
be
capable
of
jamming
an
enemy
s
ship
board
radar
it
be
at
the
core
of
what
be
code
name
the
leopard
project
we
be
very
conscientious
about
meeting
our
delivery
schedule
on
this
project
work
around
the
clock
i
recall
move
a
cot
into
the
factory
and
sleep
there
many
night
this
activity
be
important
to
us
we
acquire
some
new
technical
knowledge
that
help
get
us
into
the
forefront
of
the
microwave
instrumentation
business
a
move
that
paid
handsome
dividend
for
the
company
after
the
war
as
our
company
grow
during
world
war
ii
so
do
our
line
of
product
follow
on
the
heel
of
bill
s
audio
oscillator
we
design
a
wave
analyzer
and
some
distortion
analyzer
we
then
developed
a
high
power
audio
signal
generator
this
found
a
particularly
good
market
in
the
manufacture
of
proximity
fuse
for
the
military
we
do
not
build
a
vacuum
tube
voltmeter
at
this
time
because
one
be
be
built
by
the
balantine
company
whose
product
be
handle
by
most
of
the
same
sale
representative
handle
our
product
it
turn
out
that
the
balantine
product
have
some
deficiency
and
so
later
on
we
developed
our
model
a
vacuum
tube
voltmeter
which
become
a
very
successful
product
maintain
a
focus
though
these
instrument
differ
from
one
another
all
be
design
to
measure
and
test
electronic
equipment
they
reflect
our
strategy
to
concentrate
on
building
a
group
of
complementary
product
rather
than
become
involve
in
a
lot
of
unrelated
thing
i
believe
this
decision
to
focus
our
effort
be
extremely
important
not
only
in
the
early
day
of
the
company
but
later
on
as
well
during
the
war
for
example
we
could
have
take
on
some
big
at
least
for
us
production
contract
but
that
would
have
built
the
company
to
a
level
that
probably
couldn
t
be
sustain
later
on
i
felt
that
we
should
take
on
no
more
than
we
could
reasonably
handle
building
a
solid
base
by
do
what
we
do
best
design
and
manufacturing
high
quality
instrument
of
course
several
electronics
company
in
california
be
capable
of
and
interested
in
take
on
war
related
contract
some
of
them
felt
at
least
in
the
early
day
of
the
war
that
they
be
not
get
their
fair
share
of
these
contract
their
discontent
help
fuel
the
formation
of
the
west
coast
electronics
manufacturer
association
this
association
provide
a
vehicle
for
west
coast
company
to
band
together
and
make
their
case
in
washington
originally
there
be
about
a
dozen
member
in
southern
california
organize
by
le
hoffman
of
mission
bell
radio
later
to
become
hoffman
radio
i
put
together
a
similar
group
in
the
north
include
eitel
mccullough
heintz
and
kaufman
kaar
engineering
and
hp
as
our
industry
grow
so
do
the
association
in
the
late
s
it
become
wema
represent
the
interest
and
concern
of
electronics
company
west
of
the
mississippi
in
the
name
be
change
to
the
american
electronics
association
aea
today
the
aea
be
a
national
trade
association
with
more
than
member
organization
throughout
the
country
in
after
the
war
end
bill
return
to
palo
alto
just
in
time
for
christmas
soon
he
be
back
in
stride
at
the
company
some
of
his
experience
as
a
signal
corp
officer
prove
to
be
quite
useful
involve
him
in
various
scientific
and
engineering
project
he
become
acquaint
with
a
number
of
technical
people
some
of
whom
we
later
hire
into
the
company
war
s
end
brought
some
worrisome
problem
to
most
company
and
we
be
not
immune
as
expect
there
be
a
sharp
decline
in
our
business
and
a
correspond
drop
in
employment
many
woman
who
have
join
us
as
war
production
worker
left
the
company
after
the
war
be
over
we
manage
to
retain
our
key
people
however
and
the
slowdown
give
us
the
opportunity
to
seek
out
and
attract
some
good
technical
people
to
the
company
we
be
especially
interested
in
some
of
the
engineer
who
have
work
during
the
war
with
fred
terman
at
harvard
s
radio
research
laboratory
and
at
other
war
related
research
lab
as
it
turn
out
we
be
able
to
hire
ralph
lee
bruce
wholey
art
fong
ray
demere
and
howard
zeidler
and
some
time
later
george
kan
and
horace
overacker
these
engineer
be
instrumental
in
develop
some
much
need
new
product
during
the
critical
postwar
period
and
in
the
longer
run
fill
essential
position
within
the
company
i
mention
that
some
work
we
do
for
the
navy
during
the
war
have
give
us
the
opportunity
to
build
some
microwave
signal
generator
from
that
begin
we
have
acquire
quite
a
bit
of
expertise
in
microwave
equipment
and
follow
the
war
we
decide
to
continue
in
the
field
of
microwave
it
s
interest
to
note
that
general
radio
at
that
time
the
lead
instrument
company
didn
t
think
there
be
much
future
in
microwave
test
equipment
but
it
turn
out
to
represent
an
important
and
grow
share
of
our
business
along
the
way
we
have
heard
that
varian
associate
which
have
a
small
waveguide
business
want
to
devote
its
attention
to
other
thing
and
so
in
we
purchase
varian
s
waveguide
business
and
fold
it
into
our
other
microwave
operation
if
hewlett
packard
be
grow
during
the
s
and
s
so
be
the
packard
family
our
three
daughter
nancy
susan
and
julie
be
born
in
and
respectively
to
accommodate
these
child
lucile
and
i
be
oblige
to
move
several
time
after
leave
the
house
on
addison
we
move
to
a
house
on
matadero
in
south
palo
alto
which
be
just
across
a
vacant
field
from
the
tinker
bell
shop
a
few
year
later
i
learn
about
a
partially
built
home
in
los
alto
hill
we
purchase
the
house
hire
a
contractor
to
finish
the
building
and
with
plan
drawn
up
by
the
celebrate
landscape
architect
thomas
church
i
put
in
the
tree
shrub
and
flower
bed
myself
by
we
move
again
to
a
house
we
built
high
in
the
hill
surround
by
apricot
orchard
where
i
still
live
chapter
from
partnership
to
corporation
in
we
incorporate
hewlett
packard
this
allow
for
some
tax
advantage
and
also
provide
more
continuity
to
the
business
than
a
partnership
could
by
that
time
we
have
also
put
in
place
a
good
part
of
the
top
management
team
that
be
to
guide
the
company
over
the
next
thirty
year
ed
porter
have
finally
join

on
the

noel
eldred
head
marketing
and
frank
cavier
finance
by
our
employment
have
gotten
back
up
to
its
wartime
peak
of
about
two
hundred
after
have
expand
into
a
quonset
hut
we
built
a
more
permanent
plant
adjacent
to
our
exist
facility
we
design
it
to
be
a
general
purpose
building
and
i
remember
think
that
if
we
couldn
t
keep
the
company
go
we
could
lease
out
the
building
as
a
supermarket
the
company
grow
very
rapidly
in
the
early
s
growth
that
be
stimulate
in
part
by
the
korean
war
but
we
have
also
built
a
good
foundation
on
which
to
grow
and
thanks
to
some
hard
work
we
have
undertaken
in
the
late
s
our
product
line
have
grown
to
more
than
one
hundred
item
by
we
also
have
improve
and
expand
our
manufacturing
operation
to
keep
pace
with
the
increase
number
of
product
and
under
noel
eldred
our
network
of
sale
representative
have
become
more
efficient
and
productive
between

ii
fred
terman
have
return
to
stanford
from
harvard
s
radio
research
laboratory
we
resume
our
close
relationship
with
fred
and
together
we
developed
a
fellowship
program
whereby
stanford
graduate
engineering
student
would
research
and
then
design
and
build
a
product
for
hp
one
of
these
graduate
student
who
have
do
his
undergraduate
work
at
cal
tech
be
al
bagley
we
want
to
develop
a
high
speed
counter
for
measure
nuclear
radioactivity
and
bagley
be
assign
to
this
project
it
turn
out
he
be
able
to
develop
an
electronic
counter
that
would
operate
at
a
frequency
of
up
to
ten
megacycle
this
take
the
counter
beyond
its
original
purpose
and
enable
us
to
make
a
frequency
counter
out
of
it
and
add
it
to
the
hp
product
line
this
frequency
counter
be
not
very
reliable
and
we
assign
one
of
our
engineer
marv
wilrodt
to
provide
repair
service
at
our
customer
s
location
the
counter
be
so
useful
when
it
do
work
that
our
customer
tolerate
its
unreliability
this
be
a
long
way
from
what
we
have
to
do
today
in
provide
long
term
reliability
in
our

strengthen
its

of

adjacent

in
we
begin
construction
of
our
first
two
building
in
the
park
varian
associate
have
precede
us
as
a
tenant
but
over
the
year
hp
have
become
the
large
tenant
with
facility

more
than
one
million
square

the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
nation
now
have
more
than
eighty
tenant
like
hewlett
packard
many
of
these
organization
have
close
tie
with
the
university
especially
with
the
engineering
and
business
school
in
i
become
a
rancher
for
the
first
time
bill
and
i
have
be
deer
hunt
at
a
place
name
san
felipe
just
south
of
san
francisco
bay
we
like
the
area
so
when
the
land
be
offer
for
sale
we
decide
to
begin
a
ranch
partnership
it
be
a
family
participation
arrangement
from
the
first
most
of
the
hewlett
and
packard
child
learn
to
swim
in
the
pool
at
san
felipe
the
child
rode
horse
through
the
hill
and
learn
about
the
pleasure
and
problem
of
cattle
raise
after
a
few
year
we
add
to
the
original
ranch
with
the
purchase
of
los
huecos
to
the
south
of
the
original
tract
later
we
bought
ranch
land
in
idaho
and
also
in
the
central
valley
of
california
several
year
ago
conservationist
claimed
we
have
damage
the
range
in
idaho
by
run
too
many
head
of
cattle
on
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
due
to
step
bill
and
i
have
take
to
improve
the
land
game
in
that
area
now
be
five
time
what
it
be
when
we
first
acquire
the
land
i
have
enjoy
many
pleasure
as
the
result
of
my
experience
as
a
rancher
i
ve
also
learn
a
thing
or
two
every
season
we
would
round
up
the
cattle
from
the
range
and
drive
them
to
the
corral
along
the
way
we
d
come
to
a
gate
the
trick
be
to
get
them
through
the
gate
and
not
stampede
them
i
found
after
much
trial
and
error
that
apply
steady
gentle
pressure
from
the
rear
work
best
eventually
one
would
decide
to
pas
through
the
gate
the
rest
would
soon
follow
press
them
too
hard
and
they
d
panic
scatter
in
all
direction
slack
off
entirely
and
they
d
just
head
back
to
their
old
grazing
spot
this
insight
be
useful
throughout
my
management
career

well
every

all

our

by

our

and
in

stock
be
first
offer
to
the
public
ten
percent
of
the
common
stock
bill
hewlett
and
i
own
become
available
at
per
share
the
offering
and
later
offering
broaden
the
base
of
hp
ownership
and
enable
our
employee
to
become
shareowner
it
also
facilitate
our
acquisition
of
other
company
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
another
event
that
have
significance
for
the
company
especially
for
our
business
outside
the
united
state
be
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
rome
until
then
we
have
do
relatively
little
to
develop
foreign
market
for
our
product
for
some
year
we
have
retain
an
export
agent
in
san
francisco
to
sell
hp
product
through
a
network
of
overseas
sale
representative
this
work
reasonably
well
but
by
it
be
apparent
that
we
need
to
mount
a
more
aggressive
effort
so
we
create
an
export
department
that
dealt
directly
with
the
overseas
representative
when
the
treaty
of
rome
be
sign
in
hp
export
account
for
percent
of
our
total
sale
the
importance
of
the
treaty
to
company
like
ours
be
that
it
lead
to
the
creation
of
the
european
common
market
which
in
time
become
an
immense
market
for
electronic
product
but
it
be
a
market
favor
locally
produce
product
as
oppose
to
import
from
the
united
state
thus
it
become
critical
for
u
s
company
to
establish
not
only
a
marketing
presence
within
the
european
market
but
a
manufacturing
presence
as
well
bill
hewlett
be
especially
enthusiastic
about
the
common
market
and
thoroughly
convince
of
its
promising
business
opportunity
for
hp
so
with
the
help
of
bill
doolittle
ray
demere
and
attorney
nate
finch
he
immediately
begin
to
investigate
the
pro
and
con
of
set
up
operation
in
various
country
after
weigh
his
finding
and
narrow
the
choice
he
make
trip
to
three
country
and
arrange
meeting
with
banker
local
government
official
executive
of
manufacturing
firm
and
u
s
consulate
in
april
we
open
an
office
in
geneva
switzerland
which
become
our
european
headquarters
in
july
an

under

instrument
assembly
plant
in
the
town
of
boblingen
near
stuttgart
west
germany
from
that
modest
base
we
steadily
expand
our
european
operation
in
europe
account
for
more
than
one
third
of

total

locate
in
over
country
around
the

as
i
have
say
many
time
our
success
depends
in
large
part
on
give
the
responsibility
to
the
level
where
it
can
be
exercise
effectively
usually
on
the
low
possible

near

go
back
to

very
early

our
military
capability
fast
enough
to
counter
the
rapid
buildup
in
the
soviet
union
we
want
the
committee
on
the
present
danger
to
be
nonpartisan
which
be
why
we
delayed
the
formal

chinese
in
great
haste
i
assemble
a
special
delegation

to
be
ye
zhen
hua
vice
chief
of

development
for
the

army
since
i
d
be
to
china
before
i
knew
the
activity
in
beijing
that
i
want
to
revisit
i
give
my
host
a
list
of
these
and
we
spent
the
first
week
visit
them
i
do
not
have
any
idea
about
whether
we
be
make
any
progress
they
give
us
a
free
day
on
sunday
when
our

join
us
on
the
follow
day
he
say
that
wang

and
survivor
of
the
long
march
be
hold
a
reception
for
us
at
the
great
hall
of
the
people
that
afternoon
and
he
be
also
host
a
dinner
for
us
at
the
same
location
i
immediately
knew
then
that
we
be
get
somewhere
that
even
we
laid
our
plan
for
the
week
lucile
want
to
go
to
xi
an
to
see
the
ceramic
soldier
unfortunately
we
be
told
that
xi
an
be
close
but
the
next
day
we
be
told
we
be
go
to
xi
an
today
while
lucile
examine
the
ceramic
soldier
our
host
set
up
two
very
interest
visit
for
me
in
the
area
one
to
a
factory
that
be
make
anti
aircraft
radar
use
s
technology
about
which
i
knew
a
great
deal
they
allow
me
to
examine
the
equipment
in
a
field
behind
the
plant
where
they
be
conduct
test
there
be
about
people
at
this
facility
and
we
be
the
first
american
ever
to
visit
it
be
obvious
to
me
that
what
they
be
building
would
be
entirely
useless
in
modern
day
combat
but
i
didn
t
say
anything
at
the
time
except
to
compliment
them
on
their
workmanship
the
next
day
we
visit
a
plant
make
turbine
engine
again
use
s
soviet
technology
they
have
a
test
facility
there
for
measure
the
efficiency
of
the
engine
thrust
fuel
consumption
that
sort
of
thing
i
try
to
commend
their
work
once
more
though
again
their
equipment
be
easily
twenty
five
year
out
of
date
and
i
told
my
guide
that
i
would
happily
arrange
some
meeting
in
the
united
state
so
that
they
could
learn
about
our
work
in
related
field
then
we
have
dinner
with
chi
ning
liu
s
family
include
his
brother
and
his
brother
s
wife
his
brother
have
serve
in
the
korean
war

as

we
get
there
ahead
of
our
guest
and
realize
that
we
didn
t
have
any
chopstick
in
the
house
so
i
go
out
into
the

and
they
take

in
they
invite

for
a
meeting
our
company
have
enjoy
an
extraordinary
relationship
with
china
ever
since
for
their
part
the
chinese
have
be
able
to
acquire
from
us
the
instrumentation
they
need
to
build
up
their
fledgling
electronics
manufacturing
capability
our
business
be
very
active
in
china
we
have
several
manufacturing
plant
and
we
sell
hp
product
mainly
in
the
industrial
area
along
the
east
coast
of
the
chinese
mainland
more
structure
our
rapid
growth
up
to
have
brought
to
light
some
organizational
weakness
and
with
prospect
for
continue
growth
ahead
i
thought
it
be
time
to
provide
more
structure
to
the
company
and
a
well
delineation
of
goal
and
responsibility
by
our
product
line
include
more
than
three
hundred
instrument
our
annual
sale
be
approach
million
and
we
have
ninety
engineer
engage
in
product
development
it
be
time
to
organize
these
engineer
into
small
more
efficient
group
which
we
do
by
form
four
product
development
group
each
group
concentrate
on
a
family
of
related
product
and
each
have
a
senior
engineering
head
reporting
to
dr
bernard
oliver
that
be
barney
oliver
our
old
friend
from
stanford
whom
we
manage
to
entice
from
bell
laboratory
in
we
appoint
him
vice
president
of
research
and
development
hp
s
full
product
line
in
product
one
of
the
new
division
concentrate
on
frequency
counter
and
related
instrument
another
on
microwave
equipment
a
third
on
audio
and
video
product
and
the
fourth
on
oscilloscope
there
be
an
interest
story
behind
our
work
in
oscilloscope
during
the
war
bill
hewlett
have
gotten
to
know
a
bright
young
engineer
name
howard
vollum
he
be
impressed
with
vollum
so
much
so
that
he
urge
me
to
talk
with
him
this
be
while
bill
be
still
in
the
army
i
arrange
for
vollum
to
visit
us
and
he
and
i
have
a
long
chat
he
told
me
he
be
keenly
interested
in
design
a
new
type
of
oscilloscope
which
be
a
fundamental
measure
instrument
he
want
to
design
one
with
a
trigger
sweep
a
concept
from
radar
technology
during
our
conversation
it
become
clear
to
both
of
us
that
rather
than
join
hp
vollum
really
want
to
start
his
own
company
and
we
help
him
do
just
that
we
line
him
up
with
norm
neely
and
many
of
our
other
sale
representative
firm
across
the
united
state
thus
be
born
tektronix
the
oregon
base
company
that
become
the
dominant
oscilloscope
supplier
in
the
world
as
time
go
on
it
become
quite
clear
that
if
we
be
go
to
offer
a
complete
line
of
electronic
measure
instrument
we
need
to
fill
in
the
line
with
our
own
oscilloscope
so
in
we
design
an
oscilloscope
the
model
which
we
hop
would
provide
a
strong
challenge
to
tektronix
but
as
it
turn
out
the
be
very
unreliable
and
of
course
we
have
to
do
our
best
to
improve
it
in
retrospect
we
should
have
gotten
into
the
oscilloscope
business
much
earlier
than
we
do
but
even
after
we
have
built
up
a
family
of
well
design
high
quality
oscilloscope
tektronix
have
such
a
strong
position
that
over
the
next
few
year
we
be
able
to
capture
only
about
percent
of
the
market
we
developed
an
oscilloscope
system
manage
by
a
computer
some
year
later
and
we
be
able
to
dominate
the
market
with
that
system
get
back
to
the
restructuring
of
our
product
development
staff
there
be
another
important
reason
why
we
split
it
into
division
this
allow
a
design
engineer
to
concentrate
only
on
the
division
s
product
and
to
work
closely
with
the
appropriate
field
salesperson
to
get
a
good
fix
on
customer
need
and
opinion
meeting
in
sonoma
another
significant
event
that
occur
early
in
be
the
company
s
first
off
site
meeting
of
senior
manager
this
be
a
two
day
meeting
that
take
place
at
the
sonoma
mission
inn
about
seventy
mile
north
of
san
francisco
about
twenty
people
attend
bill
hewlett
and
i
decide
to
have
the
meeting
for
at
least
three
reason
first
we
thought
it
a
good
idea
to
get
our
key
manager
together
at
least
once
a
year
to
discus
policy
and
problem
to
exchange
view
and
to
make
plan
for
the
future
second
there
be
now
more
than
people
in
the
company
make
it
increasingly
difficult
for
bill
and
me
to
know
everyone
well
and
to
have
a
personal
knowledge
of
everything
that
be
go
on
so
we
felt
it
essential
that
despite
hp
s
growth
we
try
to
maintain
a
small
company
atmosphere
and
to
have
our
key
manager
thoroughly
familiar
with
our
mangement
style
and
objective
the
third
reason
we
have
the
meeting
be
to
present
to
the
group
for
their
review
and
study
a
set
of
corporate
objective
that
i
have
previously
draft
and
discuss
with
bill
by
way
of
background
bill
and
i
often
thought
about
how
a
company
like
ours
should
be
organize
and
manage
we
thought
that
if
we
could
get
everybody
to
agree
on
what
our
objective
be
and
to
understand
what
we
be
try
to
do
then
we
could
turn
them
loose
and
they
would
move
in
a
common
direction
we
devote
a
good
part
of
the
sonoma
meeting
to
a
review
and
discussion
of
the
propose
objective
bill
and
i
felt
strongly
that
if
our
manager
and
supervisor
be
to
be
guide
by
write
objective
they
should
have
a
part
in
develop
them
we
also
point
out
that
objective
be
meant
to
be
evaluate
from
time
to
time
and
if
necessary
to
be
modify
for
the
future
benefit
of
the
company
there
be
six
original
objective
as
time
go
on
we
refine
these
objective
base
on
our
experience
with
them
and
on
change
in
the
business
environment
we
publish
a
second
version
of
the
objective
in
and
they
be
as
follow
profit
to
recognize
that
profit
be
the
best
single
measure
of
our
contribution
to
society
and
the
ultimate
source
of
our
corporate
strength
we
should
attempt
to
achieve
the
maximum
possible
profit
consistent
with
our
other
objective
customer
to
strive
for
continual
improvement
in
the
quality
usefulness
and
value
of
the
product
and
service
we
offer
our
customer
field
of
interest
to
concentrate
our
effort
continually
seek
new
opportunity
for
growth
but
limit
our
involvement
to
field
in
which
we
have
capability
and
can
make
a
contribution
growth
to
emphasize
growth
as
a
measure
of
strength

about

any

any

of

who
have
work
together
for
some
time
develops
a

a

these
in

be
unique

so
it
be
with
hewlett
packard
we
have
a
set
of
value
deeply
held
belief
that

in

our

the

as
a

to

we
employ

of

our
value
corporate

and

that
form
the

and
that
be
the
subject
of
the
chapter
that
follow
chapter
growth
from

at
hewlett
packard
and
other
company
as
well
people
material
facility
money
and
time
be
the
resource
available
to
us
for
conduct
our
business
by
apply
our
skill
we
turn
these

into
useful

and
service
if
we
do
a
good
job
customer
pay
us
more
for
our

than
the
sum
of

distribute
them
this
difference
our

represent
the

we
add
to
the

we
utilize
it
be
impossible
to
operate
a
business
for

unless
it
generates
a
profit
and
so
if
a
company
be
to
meet
any
of
its
other
objective
it
must
make
a
profit
our

to
properly
serve
our

to
finance

to

to
make

in
which
we
operate
all
depend
directly
on
our
ability
to
generate
an
adequate
profit
the
profit
we
generate
from
our
operation
be
the
ultimate
source
of
the
fund
we
need
to
prosper
and
grow
it
s
the
foundation
of
future
opportunity
and
employment
security
the
profit
that
can
reasonably
be
expect
on
each
product
varies
with
its
competitive
situation
the
unique
value
of
that
product
and
the
capital
investment
necessary
to
produce
it
therefore
the
same
profit

from
each

sixty

we
have
observe
its
devastate

on

and

who
be
close

when
i
return
to

up
the

follow
from
this
experience
i
decide
our
company
should
not
incur
any
long
term
debt
for
this
reason
bill
and
i
determine
we
would
operate
the
company
on
a
pay
as
you
go
basis
financing
our
growth
primarily
out
of
earnings
rather
than
by
borrowing
money
we
knew
self
financing
be
possible
because
general
radio
a
company
we
admire
have
be
in
business
several
year
have
be
successful
and
have
never
sought
outside
financing
our
feel
be
if
they
could
do
it
we
could
do
it
and
we
have
for
more
than
a
half
century
i
know
that
in
some
industry
particularly
those
require
large
capital
investment
the
pay
as
you
go
approach
just
isn
t
feasible
i
also
know
that
it
have
become
popular
throughout
industry
to
meet
capital
need
by
leverage
profit
with
equity
financing
and
long
term
borrowing
the
advocate
of
this
approach
say
you
can
make
your
profit
go
far
by
leverage
them
that
may
be
but
at
hp
it
be
our
firm
policy
to
pay
as
we
go
and
not
to
incur
substantial
debt
our
long
stand
policy
have
be
to
reinvest
most
of
our
profit
and
to
depend
on
this
reinvestment
plus
fund
from
employee
stock
purchase
and
other
cash
flow
item
to
finance
our
growth
the
stock
purchase
plan
allows
employee
to
apply
up
to
a
certain
percentage
of
their
salary
to
purchase
share
of
hp
stock
at
a
preferential
price
the
company
pick
up
a
portion
of
the
price
of
the
stock
the
plan
have
be
in
existence
since
and
have
provide
us
with
significant
amount
of
cash
to
help
finance
our
growth
in
set
up
the
stock
purchase
plan
we
make
one
important
mistake
we
do
not
require
our
employee
who
bought
hp
stock
at
a
preferential
price
to
keep
it
there
be
a
long
stand
truth
about
wage
and
salary
level
no
matter
what
the
pay
the
employee
think
he
or
she
need
about
percent
more
we
found
that
many
of
our
people
who
participate
in
this
preferential
stock
purchase
plan
sell
their
stock
right
away
even
our
employee
at
high
level
have
stand
order
to
sell
their
stock
as
soon
as
they
receive
it
that
situation
have
be
correct
but
it
be
ironic
that
many
of
our
employee
who
held
on
to
their
stock
and
sell
it
when
they
retire
often
have
gain
of
more
than
a
million
dollar
a
critical
test
our
policy
of
self
financing
require
not
only
a
reasonable
level
of
profit
but
also
good
management
of
asset
this
policy
underwent
a
critical
test
in
the
early
s
follow
a
period
of
worldwide
recession
and
slow
growth
the
company
face
a
rebound
market
with
limited
cash
to
work
with
it
be
give
serious
consideration
to
some
long
term
borrowing
as
much
as
million
we
have
price
some
of
our
product
too
low
our
inventory
and
account
receivable
be
at
alarmingly
high
level
and
we
be
do
a
poor
job
of
control
cost
but
i
be
convince
we
could
correct
the
problem
through
great
self
discipline
i
quickly
visit
nearly
every
one
of
our
major
division
meeting
with
a
host
of
manager
and
give
them
a
lecture
that
be
later
characterize
by
one
manager
as
dave
s
give
em
hell
talk
the
response
be
impressive
our
manager
really
knuckle
down
inventory
be
sharply
reduce
account
receivable
be
tighten
cost
come
under
well
control
we
get
the
whole
team
work
on
the
problem
and
the
company
go
on
to
experience
a
period
of
strong
profitable
growth
without
resort
to
long
term
borrowing
in
analyze
our
account
receivable
we
found
a
major
weakness
many
of
our
customer
be
buying
product
from
several
hp
entity
to
combine
into
a
system
they
be
not
pay
for
any
of
the
product
until
they
receive
the
last
one
need
we
change
this
procedure
so
that
we
be
able
to
put
the
system
together
and
check
it
out
before
it
be
deliver
this
provide
an
incentive
to
hp
entity
to
expedite
production
of
product
it
assure
that
the
system
work
properly
and
it
help
solve
the
account
receivable
problem
a
positive
fallout
from
this
entire
episode
be
the
clear
reminder
that
self
financing
require
constant
vigilance
and
self
discipline
responsibility
to
shareholder
an
important
element
of
the

way

to
do
with
the

relationship
with
its
shareholder
and
the

a
primary
objective
in
this
area
be
to
provide
consistency
in
our
corporate
performance

steady
growth
in

and

obviously
this
be
not
always
possible
even
for
the

over

at
the

in

the

hadn

yet
focus
our

on

of

what
we
do
decide
however
be
that
we
want
to
direct
our

toward

a
successful
new
instrument

to
include

be
useful
this
meant
that
the
most

be
from

opportunity
that
include

we
have
no

we
sell

be

he
developed
a

use
quartz
one
be
a

it
can
be
locate
some
distance
from

and
it
can
do
a

thermometer
can
do
our
laser
interferometer
be
another
real
break

it
us
a
two

laser
and
can
make
measurement
that
be
accurate
to
a
millionth
of

it
be
ideal
for

despite
that
fact
bill

decide
we

keep
this

go
it
make
the
pocket

calculator
possible
in
and
it
have
become
the

since
howard

described
this

in
the

have
expand

envision
at
that
time
we
have
continued
the
development
of
light

and
our
late
contribution
be
the
brightest
light

these
will
find

the
first
automobile
to
use
them
be
the

they
have
a
great
advantage
over
incandescent
light
they
never
burn
out
and
they
use
much
less

they
will
increase
the

of
an

and
thus
pay

very
quickly
it

our
objective
be
to
expand

diversify
only
when
we
can

with
the
recognition
that
we
have
the
proven
capability
to
make
a
contribution
to
meet
this
objective
it
be
important
that
we
put
maximum
effort
into
our
product
development
program
this
mean
we
must
continually
seek
new
idea
for
new
and
well
kind
of
product
a
constant
flow
of
good
new
product
be
the
lifeblood
of
hewlett
packard
and
essential
to
our
growth
early
on
we
developed
a
system
for
measure
the
flow
and
success
of

this
system
be
represent
in

that
our

well
long
after

introduce
because
new

largely
involve
software
new
software
give
our
computer
system
a
lifetime
of
several
decade
this
meant
hp
customer
could
rely
on
their
computer
for
a
long
period
and
it
help
our
distribute

gain
a
foothold
in

that

dominate
by
the

and
dec
at
hp
as
in
other
technical
company
there
be
no
shortage
of
idea
the
problem
be
to
select
those
likely
to
fill
a
real
need
in
the
marketplace
to
warrant
serious
pursuit
an
idea
must
be
both
practical
the
device
under
consideration
must
work
properly
and
useful
out
of
those
idea
that
be
practical
a
small
number
be
useful
to
be
useful
an

must
not
only
fill
a
need
it
must
be
an
economical
and
efficient
solution
to
that
need
when

be
make
primarily
test

we
have
a
built

method
for
help
us
determine
what

might
need
in
the
way
of
innovative
new

we
call
it
the
next

syndrome
if
the

for
a
new

appeal
to
the
hp
engineer
work
at
the
next

it
would
very
likely
appeal
to
our
customer
as
well
as
our
business
expand
input
from
our
non

customer
be
a
critical
factor
in
help
us
decide
what
kind
of

idea
to
pursue
we
always
ask
how
can
we
make
a
contribution
base
on
our
strength
and
our
knowledge
then
we
d
ask
who
need
it
no
company
have
unlimited
resource
so
it
be
essential
that
the
resource
available
be
apply
to
the
project
most
likely
to
be
successful
at
hp
we
often
use
to
select

on
the
basis
of
a
six

return
that
be
the
profit

expect
to
derive
over
the

be
at

unfortunately
the

not
justify

it

it

it

to

that
the
digital

have
some
promising

i
visit
them
and
discuss
the
possibility
of
their
join
us
it
appear
that
we
might
be
able
to
acquire
dec
for
about
million
but
there
be
some
complicate
factor
and
we
decide
not
to
pursue
the
matter
far
i
also
visit
wang
laboratory
which
be
design
an
electronic
calculator
but
i
decide
at
the
time
it
would
not
be
desirable
for
us
to
get
involve
in
electronic
calculator
meanwhile
two
of
our
engineer
kay
magleby
and
paul
stoft
begin
to
experiment
with
building
a

they
present
me
with
a
vision
of
a

automate
hp
instrument
that
be
connect
to
our

i
begin
to
get
excite
about
the
prospect
of
an
hp
computer
in
september
we
begin
to
develop
an
automatic
controller
for
measurement
system
with
kay
magleby
head
the
team
this
be
to
become
our
first
minicomputer
the
model
although
the
work
have
start
in
our
hewlett
packard
laboratory
we
acquire
a
small
computer
group
from
union
carbide
to
help
staff
the
effort
this
be
the
nucleus
of
our
early
computer
division
in
cupertino
not
far
from
palo
alto
we
soon
found
that
we
be
sell
more
s
as
stand
alone
minicomputer
than
as
controller
in
automatic
measurement
system
still
we
be
slow
to
get
the
message
an
example
of
our
cautious
approach
to
computer
be
the
way
we
handle
a
promising
project
code
name
omega
initiate
by
our
people
in
cupertino

what

thirty
two

the
term
thirty
two

refers
to
the

in
the
computer
data
format
and
to
the

of
the

in
the

initially
a

in
the

become
sixteen

a

would
require
more
hardware
but
would
have
be
twice

the
prospect
of
produce
such
a
fast
and
powerful
computer
have
create
tremendous
enthusiasm
among
our
cupertino
people
and
they
soon
have
omega
at
the
prototype
stage
by
that
time
however
there
have
be
increase
top
management
concern
about
the
scope
of
the

it
clearly
represent
a
departure
from
hp
s
basic
principle
it
be
expensive
we
would
have
to
take
on

to
fund
it
and
rather
than
building
on
exist
hp
strength
the
project
require
expertise
and
capability
we
do
not
have
at
the

such
as

more
important
be
the
fact
that
the
thirty
two
bit
computer
project
present
a
new
and
formidable
marketing
challenge
it
would
take
us
into
unfamiliar
commercial
market
and
into
direct
competition
with
ibm
s
mainframe
business
bill
hewlett
s
sage
advice
have
always
be
don
t
try
to
take
a
fortify
hill
especially
if
the
army
on
top
be
big
than
your
own
omega
be
a
case
in
point
the
project
be
cancel
a
decision
that
be
difficult
and
controversial
the
cancellation
of
omega
be
especially
disappoint
to
our
cupertino
people
the
fellow
who
have
be
run
the
project
left
the
division
and
soon
afterward
the
company
several
people
who
remain
take
to
wear
black
velvet
armband
in
mourn
for
the
cancel
project
cancel
it
may
have
be
but
not
abandon
it
turn
out
that
a
few
of
the
omega
enthusiast
kept
the
project
hidden
in
a
back
room
of
the
lab
and
be
still
work
on
it
at
that
point
several
key
manager
and
engineer
take
another
look
at
the
project
they
conclude
that
it
embody
some
good
idea
in
term
of
computer
architecture
and
if
we
could
scale
it
back
to
a
sixteen
bit
machine
and
simplify
the
operating
system
we
might
have
a
promising
product
so
the
omega
development
program
be
redirect
and
rename
alpha
the
result
be
a
sophisticated
low

enter

electronic

a

at
the

of
my

to

i
didn
t
think
hp
should
get
into
the

business
all
this
change
however
when
a
young

name
tom

paid
a
visit
to
hp
in
tom
have
work
across
the

at

a

a

show

to
barney
oliver
they
and
later
bill
hewlett
and
i
recognize
that
osborne
have
a
little
powerhouse
of
a
machine
that
perhaps
could
be
developed
into
a
desktop
calculator
capable
of
silently
and
swiftly
calculate
trigonometric
hyperbolic
and
logarithmic
function
and
be
programmable
as
well
it
would
make

of

a

turndown
of

always

some
year

at

devote
to

one
of
our
bright
energetic

chuck

advise
to
abandon

he
be
develop
instead
he
embark
on
a

to
california
stop
along
the

to
show
potential
customer
a

of

he
want
to
find
out
what
they
thought
specifically
what
they
want
the

and
what
its
limitation
be
their
positive
reaction
spur
him
to
continue
with
the

even
though
on
his
return
to

he
found
that
i
among
others
have
request
it
be
discontinue
he
persuade
his
r
d

later
at

with
a
medal
for
extraordinary
contempt
and
defiance
beyond
the

call
of

so
how
do
a
company
distinguish
between
insubordination
and
entrepreneurship
to
this
young
engineer
s
mind
the
difference
lay
in
the
intent
i
wasn
t

i
really
just

me
that
it

me
my

later
become
director

with
his

as
a

intact
when
one
think
of
hp

one
usually
think
of

but
it
s
important
to
point
out
that
over
the

we
have
attempt
to

we

of
our

to
the

the

translate

to
the

our

our

very
little

shortly
after
the

do
try
our

this

in

these

we
use

design

built
the

ourselves
the
hp
be
about
the
size
of
a

still
expensive
at
about

it
be
rugged

it
be
capable

very
high

and
high

it
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
it
create
constructive
tie
between
canon
and
hp
in
the
s
with
the
emergence
of
the
personal

market
a

our

work
on

well
under

at
this
point
make
us
realize
that
the
future

would
be

the

be
wide
open
for

though
it
be
traditional
for
hp
to
invent
its

canon
already
have
the
printer
engine
we
need
with
these
engine
we
saw
we
could
build
a
relatively
inexpensive
laser
printer
for
personal
computer
we
introduce
the
first
laserjet
in
march
nothing
like
it
exist
previously
it
be
small
fast
flexible
and
reliable
and
it
deliver
high
quality
printing
at
an
affordable
price
the
first
laserjet
create
a
totally
new
printer
market
similar
to
what
handheld
calculator
have
do
twelve
year
before
right
from
the
begin
we
recognize
that
the
laserjet
printer
at
be
go
to
be
extremely
popular
so
we
decide
to
distribute
it
use
the
small
hp
salesforce
that
focus
on
resellers
this
avenue
of
distribution
have
be
a
major
competitive
advantage
for
hp
during
the
past
ten
year
more
for
less
become
the
goal
for
each
new
laserjet
model
this
objective
reveals
a
lesson
learn
from
our
experience
with
calculator
for
many
year
we
continued
to
introduce
increasingly
sophisticated
calculator
with
great
capability
at
great
cost
to
consumer
meanwhile
our
competitor
be
offering
basic

at
a
low
price
for
the
mass
market
basic

be
sufficient
and
the
low

model
decrease
hp
s
calculator
market
share
the
sophisticated
hp
calculator
sell
to
customer
who
need
more
advanced
capability
but
we
lose
a
large
portion
of
the
marketplace
with
laserjet
printer
we
decide
that
each
revision
would
offer
our
customer
great
capability
at
a
low
price
than
its

what
if

finely
control
these

up
to
this
point
only
crude
printing
of
quite
large

for
industrial
purpose
be
practical
suddenly
it
look
like
this

could
be
miniaturize
and
it
have
the
advantage
of
require
very
little

and
of
be
inherently
inexpensive
to
manufacture
as
be
the
case
with

the
advent
of

only
this

there
be
no

own
product
and
process
we
therefore
have
a
strong
incentive
to
do
a
superior
job
over
the
year
we
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
look
at
how
we
could
improve
quality
one
method
we
found
very
effective
be
to
lay
out
our
production
line
so
that
the
area
devote
to
the
final
test
of
a
product
be
very
close
to
the
final
assembly
area
if
the
test
crew
detect
any
problem
in
the
finish
product
they
could
immediately
and
directly
tell
the
assembly
people
without
have
to
go
through
complicate
procedure
this
be
very
much
like
what
have
come
to
be
know
as
a
quality
circle
because
here
be
people
work
closely
together
with
effective
informal
communication
we
found
over
time
that
many
good
idea
emerge
from
this
informal
exchange
among
our
test
and
assembly
people
and
this
help
to
keep
an
emphasis
on
quality
and
productivity
today
we
be
all
familiar
with
the
accomplishment
of
japanese
industry
in
produce
quality
product
in
recent
year
japan
s
automobile
radio
television
set
record
equipment
and
many
other
product
have
earn
a
worldwide
reputation
for
quality
and
reliability
our
own
experience
with
the
japanese
have
contribute
in
important
way
to
the
high
quality
of
our
hewlett
packard
product
japanese
joint
venture
in
we
form
a
joint
venture
with
a
company
in
japan
a
company
that
have
be
involve
in
process
instrumentation
and
have
some
compatibility
with
our
product
line
when
we
be
first
consider
the
venture
which
become
know
as
yokogawa
hewlett
packard
or
yhp
and
now
be
hewlett
packard
japan
i
visit
japan
and
spent
a
couple
of
week
with
the
yokogawa
people
this
be
at
a
time
when
japan
s
manufacturing
and
managerial
skill
be
not
up
to
our
own
and
when
we
start
i
conclude
that
if
it
be
go
to
be
successful
it
need
to
be
manage
our
way
rather
than
the
yokogawa
way
the
japanese
agree
and
so
during
yhp
s
formative
year
it
be
manage
by
one
of
our
people
and
it
successfully
adopt
some
of
the
thing
that
have
work
well
for
us
in
the
united
state
at
that
time
hp
be
structure
into
many
relatively
small
division
each
year
we
get
all
the
division
manager
together
and
spent
two
or
three
day
reporting
compare
note
evaluate
performance
and
so
forth
one
of
our
session
always
have
to
do
with
quality
we
kept
a
record
on
the
failure
rate
of
every
hp
product
and
another
record
on
our
warranty
cost
during
the
first
few
year
of
our
japanese
joint
venture
the
yhp
general
manager
an
american
come
to
the
meeting
and
report
along
with
all
of
our
other
manager
yhp
s
performance
be
usually
just
about
in
the
middle
it
be
neither
at
the
top
nor
at
the
bottom
in
product
failure
rate
or
warranty
cost
after
this
have
go
on
for
some
year
a
bright
young
japanese
manager
kenzo
sasaoka
who
be
do
good
work
over
there
corner
bill
hewlett
and
me
one
day
he
say
why
don
t
you
let
me
run
yhp
you
send
an
american
manager
to
us
to
oversee
our
work
we
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
fact
waste
a
lot
of
time
talk
to
him
and
if
something
go
wrong
he
s
the
fellow
we
blame
we
really
think
we
can
do
well
so
we
say
okay
you
go
ahead
you
run
the
operation
and
we
ll
see
how
it
go
the
follow
year
yhp
grow
at
a
faster
rate
than
ever
before
and
it
show
improvement
in
the
quality
of
its
product
it
start
to
move
up
toward
the
top
of
the
hp
list
and
soon
after
the
manager
return
with
some
amaze
data
on
yhp
quality
the
failure
rate
on
the
product
it
be
building
be
well
than
those
of
any
of
our
other
division
and
a
few
year
follow
that
in
it
receive
japan
s
covet
deming
prize
for
productivity
and
quality
this
prize
the
object
of
intense
competition
among
japanese
firm
be
name
for
dr
w
edward
deming
an
american
statistician
who
help
the
japanese
improve
their
product
quality
in
the
year
follow
world
war
ii
here
be
an
example
of
what
yhp
be
able
to
do
we
have
be
make
print
circuit
board
in
various
part
of
the
company
our
best
failure
rate
be
about
four
in
a
thousand
we
thought
that
be
fairly
good
a
little
less
than
percent
and
that
be
the
rate
we
found
a
lot
of
other
company
be
achieve
our
japanese
unit
on
the
other
hand
come
in
with
a
failure
rate
on
its
print
circuit
board
of
only
ten
per
million
that
s
four
hundred
time
well
than
anything
we
have
be
able
to
do
obviously
that
shook
up
a
lot
of
people
and
change
a
lot
of
think
within
the
company
it
clearly
show
that
our
target
on
quality
just
be
nowhere
near
what
could
be
achieve
the
positive
result
be
that
the
think
and
the
work
they
be
do
at
yhp
be
soon
reflect
all
over
the
company
we
be
able
to
raise
quality
target
in
many
division
and
location
far
beyond
anything
we
thought
could
have
be
do
before
i
have
often
see
the
people
in
our
operation
at
yhp
spend
considerable
time
make
sure
that
every
adjustment
be
do
just
as
accurately
as
possible
the
same
adjustment
be
do
at
hp
in
palo
alto
just
as
quickly
as
possible
to
get
them
just
barely
within
the
limit
specify
this
come
about
because
people
in
palo
alto
be
on
profit
share
and
people
in
japan
be
not
i
point
this
out
to
kenzo
sasaoka
our
manager
in
japan
and
he
say
that
i
have
show
him
the
way
that
gain
in
quality
come
from
meticulous
attention
to
detail
and
every
step
in
the
manufacturing
process
must
be
do
as
carefully
as
possible
not
as
quickly
as
possible
this
sound
simple
but
it
be
achieve
only
if
everyone
in
the
organization
be
dedicate
to
quality
chapter
trust
in
people
if
an
organization
be
to
maximize
its
efficiency
and
success
a
number
of
requirement
must
be
met
one
be
that
the
most
capable
people
available
should
be
select
for
each
assignment
within
the
organization
especially
in
a
technical
business
where
the
rate
of
progress
be
rapid
a
continue
program
of
education
must
be
undertaken
and
maintain
technique
that
be
relevant
today
will
be
outdated
in
the
future
and
every
person
in
the
organization
must
be
continually
look
for
new
and
well
way
to
do
his
or
her
work
another
requirement
be
that
a
high
degree
of
enthusiasm
should
be
encourage
at
all
level
in
particular
the
people
in
high
management
position
must
not
only
be
enthusiastic
themselves
they
must
be
able
to
engender
enthusiasm
among
their
associate
there
can
be
no
place
for
halfhearted
interest
or
halfhearted
effort
from
the
begin
bill
hewlett
and
i
have
have
a
strong
belief
in
people
we
believe
that
people
want
to
do
a
good
job
and
that
it
be
important
for
them
to
enjoy
their
work
at
hewlett
packard
we
try
to
make
it
possible
for
our
people
to
feel
a
real
sense
of
accomplishment
in
their
work
closely
couple
with
this
be
our
strong
belief
that
individual
be
treat
with
consideration
and
respect
and
that
their
achievement
be
recognize
it
have
always
be
important
to
bill
and
me
to
create
an
environment
in
which
people
have
a
chance
to
be
their
best
to
realize
their
potential
and
to
be
recognize
for
their
achievement
each
person
in
our
company
be
important
and
every
job
be
important
in
the
highly
technical
field
in
which
we
operate
little
detail
often
make
the
difference
between
a
quality
product
and
one
that
isn
t
as
good
so
what
we
ve
try
to
engender
among
all
our
people
be
the
attitude
that
it
be
each
individual
s
business
to
do
the
best
job
he
or
she
can
i
recall
the
time
many
year
ago
when
i
be
walk
around
a
machine
shop
accompany
by
the
shop
s
manager
we
stop
briefly
to
watch
a
machinist
make
a
polished
plastic
mold
die
he
have
spent
a
long
time
polish
it
and
be
take
a
final
cut
at
it
without
think
i
reach
down
and
wipe
it
with
my
finger
the
machinist
say
get
your
finger
off
my
die
the
manager
quickly
ask
him
do
you
know
who
this
be
to
which
the
machinist
reply
i
don
t
care
he
be
right
and
i
told
him
so
he
have
an
important
job
and
be
proud
of
his
work
the
way
an
organization
be
structure
affect
individual
motivation
and
performance
there
be
military
type
organization
in
which
the
person
at
the
top
issue
an
order
and
it
be
pass
on
down
the
line
until
the
person
at
the
bottom
do
as
he
or
she
be
told
without
question
or
reason
this
be
precisely
the
type
of
organization
we
at
hp
do
not
want
and
do
not
want
we
feel
our
objective
can
best
be
achieve
by
people
who
understand
and
support
them
and
who
be
allow
flexibility
in
work
toward
common
goal
in
way
that
they
help
determine
be
best
for
their
operation
and
their
organization
the
close
relationship
among
hp
people
encourage
a
form
of
participatory
management
that
support
individual
freedom
and
initiative
while
emphasize
commonness
of
purpose
and
teamwork
in
the
early
year
we
be
all
work
on
the
same
problem
we
solicit
and
use
idea
from
wherever
we
could
get
them
the
net
result
be
that
each
employee
felt
that
he
or
she
be
a
member
of
the
team
as
the
company
grow
we
could
no
longer
take
teamwork
for
grant
we
have
to
try
to
emphasize
and
strengthen
it
that
s
one
of
the
reason
we
didn
t
single
out
division
or
group
that
be
do
particularly
well
and
why
benefit
such
as
profit
share
be
provide
not
to
select
individual
or
group
but
to
all
eligible
employee
it
s
imperative
that
there
be
a
strong
spirit
of
helpfulness
and
cooperation
among
all
element
of
the
company
and
that
this
spirit
be
recognize
and
respect
as
a
cornerstone
of
the
hp
way
when
we
be
small
and
insignificant
and
have
to
hire
the
best
people
we
could
find
we
have
to
train
them
and
then
hope
they
would
work
out
we
want
our
people
to
share
our
goal
of
make
a
profit
and
a
contribution
we
in
turn
felt
a
responsibility
to
provide
them
with
opportunity
and
job
security
to
the
best
of
our
ability
thus
we
make
an
early
and
important
decision
we
do
not
want
to
be
a
hire
and
fire
a
company
that
would
seek
large
short
term
contract
employ
a
great
many
people
for
the
duration
of
the
contract
and
at
its
completion
let
those
people
go
this
type
of
operation
be
often
the
quick
and
most
efficient
way
to
get
a
big
job
accomplish
but
bill
and
i
didn
t
want
to
operate
that
way
we
want
to
be
in
business
for
the
long
haul
to
have
a
company
built
around
a
stable
and
dedicate
workforce
we
be
very
close
to
our
employee
we
understood
their
job
and
share
much
of
their
life
with
them
we
also
be
learn
which
of
our
people
have
management
potential
although
sometimes
we
learn
the
hard
way
once
we
promote
a
man
a
good
worker
to
be
the
manager
of
our
machine
shop
a
few
day
later
he
come
to
see
me
he
say
he
be
have
a
tough
time
manage
and
want
me
to
come
out
to
the
shop
and
tell
his
people
that
he
be
their
bos
if
i
have
to
do
that
i
say
you
don
t
deserve
to
be
their
bos
another
early
experience
again
related
to
our
close
association
with
our
people
be
the
case
of
an
employee
who
contract
tuberculosis
and
be
require
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
for
two
year
this
have
a
serious
effect
on
his
family
and
although
we
be
able
to
provide
some
financial
help
we
determine
that
this
type
of
problem
should
never
be
repeat
consequently
we
establish
a
program
of
catastrophic
medical
insurance
to
protect
our

and
their

in
the
late
s
this
type
of
coverage
be
virtually
unknown
the

bill
and
i
and
our
family
have
in
the
welfare
of
hp
employee
be
reflect
in
some
early
practice
and
custom
immediately
after
world
war
ii
our
employment
drop
but
by
it
have
grown
back
up
to
about
two
hundred
at
that
time
my
wife
lucile
start
the
practice
of
buying
a
wedding
gift
for
every
employee
who
married
and
a
baby
blanket
for
every
family
have
a
baby
this
continued
for
ten
year
or
so
until
the
practice
fell
victim
to
the
company
s
rapid
growth
and
decentralization
in
fact
lucile
instigate
many
tradition
that
serve
to
enhance
the
family
atmosphere
at
hp
and
help
create
a
sense
of
belonging
in
our
young
enterprise
both
she
and
flora
hewlett
be
constantly
work
on

of
the
company
as
i
say
earlier
lucile
serve
as
our
secretary
and
bookkeeper
for
the
first
several
year
of
our
operation
she
contribute
not
only
time
and
energy
but
also
a
viewpoint
and
a
sense
of
care
that
eventually
become
a
vital
component
of
the
spirit
that
defines
everything
we
do
growth
also
affected
the
size
and
nature
of
company
picnic
bill
and
i
consider
picnic
an
important
part
of
the
hp
way
and
in
the
early
day
we
have
an
annual
picnic
in
the
palo
alto
area
for
all
our
people
and
their
family
it
be
a
big
event
one
largely
plan
and
carry
out
by
our
employee
themselves
the
menu
consist
of
new
york
steak
hamburger
mexican
bean
or
frijol
green
salad
garlic
french
bread
and
beer
the
company
bought
the
food
and
beer
it
become
customary
for
the
machine
shop
people
to
barbeque
the
steak
and
burger
with
other
department
responsible
for
other
part
of
the
menu
bill
and
i
and
other
senior
executive
serve
the
food
give
us
the
opportunity
to
meet
all
of
the
employee
and
their
family
in
the
early
s
the
company
bought
a
parcel
of
land
call
little
basin
in
the
redwood
country
about
an
hour
s
drive
from
palo
alto
we
convert
part
of
it
into
a
recreation
area
large
enough
to
have
a
picnic
with
two
thousand
people
or
more
we
also
make
it
available
year
around
for
our
employee
and
their
family
to
go
overnight
camp
this
be
such
a
popular
benefit
that
we
decide
later
on
to
duplicate
the
idea
in
other
part
of
the
world
where
we
have
concentration
of
hp
people
in
colorado
we
bought
some
land
in
the
rockies
next
to
estes
park
and
in
massachusetts
on
the
seashore
in
scotland
we
bought
a
small
lake
feature
good
fishing
and
possible
sighting
of
the
loch
ness
monster
and
in
southern
germany
we
bought
land
suitable
for
skiing
at
a
company
picnic
in
the
s
dave
packard
center
serf
steak
as
the
company
grow
each
division
would
have
its
own
picnic
bill
and
i
and
some
of
the
other
hp
executive
would
try
to
attend
as
many
of
these
as
we
could
since
they
give
us
the
opportunity
to
meet
and
chat
with
many
employee
both
in
the
united
state
and
in
europe
by
the
late
s
the
company
have
grown
so
large
and
there
be
so
many
picnic
that
it
be
difficult
to
continue
this
tradition
and
today
of
course
it
would
be
impossible
but
annual

continue
to
occur

the

have
continued
uninterrupted
since

it
in

another
example
of

though
in
a
much
different
way
occur
in
because
of
a
downturn
in
the
u
s
economy
our
incoming
order
be
run
at
a
rate
quite
a
bit
less
than
our
production
capability
we
be
face
with
the
prospect
of
a
percent
layoff
rather
than
a
layoff
however
we
try
a
different
tack
we
go
to
a
schedule
of
work
nine
day
out
of
every
two
week
a
percent
cut
in
work
schedule
with
a
correspond
percent
cut
in

this
apply
to
virtually
all
our
u
s
factory
as
well
as
to
all
executive
and
corporate
staff
at
the
end
of
a
six
month
period
the
order
rate
be
up
again
and
everyone
return
to
a
full
work
schedule
some
say
they
enjoy
the
long
weekend
even
though
they
have
to
tighten
their
belt
a
little
the
net
result
of
this
program
be
that
effectively
all
share
the
burden
of
the
recession
good
people
be
not
release
into
a
very
tough
job
market
and
we
have
our
highly
qualify
workforce
in
place
when
business
improve
i
should
point
out
that
this
program
be
in
response
to
a
temporary
situation
one
likely
to
last
for
no
more
than
a
year
or
two
it
be
a
short
term
solution
to
a
short
term
problem
and
do
not
represent
a
commitment
to
provide
absolute
tenure
status
for
our
people
since
of
course
there
have
be
other
economic
recession
in
the
united
state
and
in
most
other
country
generally
speak
we
ve
be
able
to
ride
out
these
recession
by
transfer
production
from
some
area
to
others
and
by
institute
temporary
work
reduction
program
at
a
few
location
as
we
move
into
the
early
s
however
it
become
clear
that
hp
like
almost
every
other
american
manufacturer
would
need
to
reduce
staff
downsize
be
today
s
popular
euphemism
but
in
any
event
our
need
to
cut
be
considerably
less
than
that
of
most
manufacturer
especially
those
in
the
computer
industry
we
have
already
take
step
at
hp
to
reduce
corporate
bureaucracy
and
to
emphasize
decentralization
we
accomplish
most
staff
reduction
through
early
retirement
program
and
a
program
of
voluntary
severance
offering
a
generous
financial
package
to
people
willing
to
leave
the
company
the
rapid
change
in
technology
make
educational
and
training
activity
a
necessity
for
our
people
many
of
our
corporate
sponsor
educational
program
be
on
specific
technical
subject
while
others
emphasize
more
general
skill
as
a
corporation
we
spend
about
million
each
year
in
develop
and
provide
course
for
our
employee
and
the
cost
of
allow
people
time
off
from
work
and
support
them
in
outside
job
related
course
add
another
million
or
so
part
of
that
expense
be
support
college
work
often
aim
at
an
advanced
degree
to
some
education
mean
unnecessary
sacrifice
to
others
it
mean
the
prospect
of
opportunity
for
increase
contribution
and
great
personal
satisfaction
fortunately
the
latter
view
have
prevail
at
hewlett
packard
the
vast
majority
of
our
people
have
recognize
the
value
of
education
and
self
development
not
only
in
enhance
their
career
but
also
in
make
meaningful
contribution
to
the
company
s
progress
so
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
begin
of
the
company
bill
and
i
have
place
great
faith
and
trust
in
hp
people
we
expect
them
to
be
open
and
honest
in
their
dealing
with
others
and
we
trust
they
will
readily
accept
responsibility
i
learn
early
in
my
career
of
some
of
the
problem
that
can
be
cause
by
a
company
s
lack
of
trust
in
its
people
in
the
late
s
when
i
be
work
for
general
electric
in
schenectady
the
company
be
make
a
big
thing
of
plant
security
i
m
sure
others
be
too
ge
be
especially
zealous
about
guard
its
tool
and
part
bin
to
make
sure
employee
didn
t
steal
anything
face
with
this
obvious
display
of
distrust
many
employee
set
out
to
prove
it
justified
walk
off
with
tool
or
part
whenever
they
could
eventually
ge
tool
and
part
be
scatter
all
around
town
include
the
attic
of
the
house
in
which
a
number
of
us
be
living
in
fact
we
have
so
much
equipment
up
there
that
when
we
threw
the
switch
the
light
on
the
entire
street
would
dim
the
irony
in
all
of
this
be
that
many
of
the
tool
and
part
be
be
use
by
their
ge
owner
to
work
on
either
job
related
project
or
skill
enhance
hobby
activity
that
would
likely
improve
their
performance
on
the
job
when
hp
get
under
way
the
ge
memory
be
still
strong
and
i
determine
that
our
part
bin
and
storeroom
should
always
be
open
sometimes
not
everyone
get
the
word
however
which
account
for
an
incident
that
occur
some
year
later
come
into
the
plant
one
weekend
to
do
some
work
bill
hewlett
stop
off
at
a
company
storeroom
to
pick
up
a
microscope
find
the
equipment
cage
lock
he
broke
open
the
latch
and
left
a
note
insist
that
the
room
not
be
lock
again
keep
storeroom
and
part
bin
open
be
advantageous
to
hp
in
two
important
way
from
a
practical
standpoint
the
easy
access
to
part
and
tool
help
product
designer
and
others
who
want
to
work
out
new
idea
at
home
or
on
weekend
a
second
reason
less
tangible
but
important
be
that
the
open
bin
and
storeroom
be
a
symbol
of
trust
a
trust
that
be
central
to
the
way
hp
do
business
our
policy
of
open
storeroom
continue
although
production
stock
be
restrict
lab
stock
a
relatively
small
supply
of
our
best
part
and
equipment
be
still
generally
open
flexible
hour
perhaps
the
most
widely
publicize
example
of
trust
at
hp
be
the
company
s
program
of
flexible
work
hour
it
be
initiate
at
our
plant
in
boblingen
germany
in
and
we
be
the
first
company
in
the
united
state
to
use
it
it
be
now
in
wide
use
throughout
hp
and
throughout
industry
under
the
hp
program
an
individual
may
come
to
work
very
early
in
the
morning
or
perhaps
as
late
as
a
m
then
leave
after
work
a
standard
number
of
hour
it
be
not
appropriate
for
all
job
but
certainly
for
most
to
my
mind
flextime
be
the
essence
of
respect
for
and
trust
in
people
it
say
that
we
both
appreciate
that
our
people
have
busy
personal
life
and
that
we
trust
them
to
devise
with
their
supervisor
and
work
group
a
schedule
that
be
personally
convenient
yet
fair
to
others
tolerance
for
the
differ
need
of
individual
be
another
element
of
the
hp
way
on
occasion
situation
arise
in
which
people
have
personal
problem
that
temporarily
affect
their
performance
and
attitude
and
it
be
important
that
people
in
these
circumstance
be
treat
with
sensitivity
and
understand
while
the
problem
be
be
resolve
many
company
have
a
policy
state
that
once
employee
leave
the
company
they
be
not
eligible
for
reemployment
over
the
year
we
have
have
a
number
of
people
leave
because
opportunity
seem
great
elsewhere
we
ve
always
take
the
view
that
as
long
as
they
have
not
work
for
a
direct
competitor
and
if
they
have
a
good
work
record
they
be
welcome
back
they
know
the
company
need
no
retrain
and
usually
be
happier
and
well
motivate
for
have
have
the
additional
experience
several
year
ago
one
of
our
senior
executive
left
hp
for
what
he
consider
a
great
opportunity
he
later
return
and
although
he
have
be
go
for
some
year
he
quickly
resume
his
career
with
us
and
earn
increase
management
responsibility
until
his
retirement
some
people
have
left
hp
and
have
successfully
start
their
own
company
there
be
at
least
a
dozen
of
these
entrepreneur
and
their
company
now
employ
more
than
forty
thousand
people
be
we
upset
that
they
left
us
on
the
contrary
bill
and
i
understand
and
respect
their
entrepreneurial
spirit
and
we
be
pleased
and
proud
that
they
once
work
with
us
and
have
do
so
well
we
re
also
flatter
that
in
building
their
company
they
have
adopt
many
of
the
management
principle
and
practice
embody
in
the
hp
way
chapter
grow
the
organization
an
organizational
structure
once
create
should
be
flexible
and
responsive
to
the
develop
need
of
the
organization
and
change
in
the
marketplace
in
the
case
of
hewlett
packard
we
do
not
much
concern
ourselves
with
organizational
matter
until
well
into
the
s
there
be
no
need
to
we
have
a
well
define
line
of
related
product
design
and
manufacture
in
one
location
sell
through
an
establish
network
of
sale
representative
and
have
a
highly
centralize
company
in
which
management
be
organize
on
a
fundamental
basis
with
vice
president
for
marketing
manufacturing
r
d
and
finance
as
the
company
continued
its
steady
growth
and
begin
to
diversify
bill
and
i
realize
we
would
have
to
consider
some
sort
of
decentralize
strategy
in
order
to
retain
our
emphasis
on
individual
responsibility
and
achievement
we
also
worried
that
the
personal
element
of
the
hp
way
might
disappear
divisionalization
first
occur
in
our
product
development
laboratory
where
as
i
have
mention
we
divide
our
development
activity
into
four
group
each
with
responsibility
for
its
own
family
of
product
and
each
head
by
a
manager
reporting
to
barney
oliver
vice
president
of
research
and
development
that
be
in
other
divisionalizing
step
soon
follow
spur
by
our
geographic
expansion
that
establish
manufacturing
operation
in
colorado
and
germany
and
by
our
early
acquisition
of
new
business
by
the
mid
s
we
have
more
than
a
dozen
operating
division
each
an
integrate
self
sustain
organization
responsible
for
develop
manufacturing
and
marketing
its
own
product
a
primary
goal
in
set
up
these
division
be
to
give
each
one
considerable
autonomy
create
an
environment
that
foster
individual
motivation
initiative
and
creativity
and
that
give
a
wide
latitude
of
freedom
in
work
toward
common
goal
and
objective
we
want
to
avoid
bureaucracy
and
to
be
sure
that
problem
solve
decision
be
make
as
close
as
possible
to
the
level
where
the
problem
occur
we
also
want
each
division
to
retain
and
nurture
the
kind
of
intimacy
the
care
for
people
and
the
ease
of
communication
that
be
characteristic
of
the
company
when
it
be
small
left
to
right
bill
hewlett
barney
oliver
and
lee
de
forest
the
inventor
of
the
vacuum
tube
at
hp
lab
in
over
the
year
bill
hewlett
and
i
have
speculate
many
time
about
the
optimum
size
of
a
company
we
do
not
believe
that
growth
be
important
for
its
own
sake
however
continuous
growth
be
essential
for
us
to
achieve
our
other
objective
and
to
remain
competitive
since
we
participate
in
field
of
advanced
and
rapidly
change
technology
to
remain
static
be
to
lose
ground
also
we
depend
on
attract
high
caliber
people
to
the
company
people
want
to
align
their
career
only
with
a
company
that
offer
ample
opportunity
for
personal
growth
and
progress
by
the
late
s
the
need
for
diversification
be
clear
we
be
become
the
large
supplier
in
most
of
the
major
segment
of
the
electronic
instrumentation
business
but
these
segment
in
total
be
grow
at
only
percent
per
year
whereas
we
have
be
grow
out
of
our
profit
at
percent
obviously
that
kind
of
growth
could
not
continue
without
diversification
in
we
form
an
affiliate
hp
associate
to
engage
in
solid
state
research
and
development
and
later
in
we
create
the
hp
laboratory
a
corporate
lab
engage
in
advanced
research
activity
to
help
lead
the
company
into
new
technology
and
product
diversification
growth
by
acquisition
bill
and
i
have
no
desire
to
see
hp
become
a
conglomerate
since
as
i
ve
already
point
out
more
company
die
from
indigestion
than
starvation
in
the
s
however
some
opportunity
come
along
for
us
to
acquire
company
whose
technology
and
product
complement
our
own
our
first
acquisition
the
f
l
moseley
company
have
occur
in
locate
in
pasadena
california
moseley
make
x
y
recorder
and
other
instrument
that
be
a
good
complement
to
our
own
product
line
the
company
have
be
found
by
francis
moseley
a
very
inventive
engineer
who
later
serve
as
a
value
member
of
our
board
of
director
his
management
philosophy
and
practice
be
very
similar
to
our
own
the
large
firm
we
acquire
in
the
s
be
the
sanborn
company
in
waltham
massachusetts
sanborn
which
have
employee
and
annual
sale
of
more
than
million
produce
electrocardiograph
and
other
test
and
measurement
instrument
use
by
the
medical
profession
the
acquisition
accomplish
through
an
exchange
of
stock
give
us
an
entry
into
the
medical
field
which
grow
into
a
major
market
for
hp
we
later
acquire
a
small
company
f
m
scientific
which
provide
us
with
a
similar
entry
into
the
field
of
instrumentation
for
chemical
analysis
while
acquisition
be
often
useful
in
expand
a
company
s
technology
and
gain
a
quick
entry
into
new
market
they
be
not
without
their
problem
chief
among
these
be
the
difficulty
in
blending
two
culture
operating
philosophy
and
management
style
it
be
difficult
understandably
so
for
the
management
of
the
acquire
company
to
give
up
its
independence
and
the
acquire
company
usually
find
that
the
task
of
provide
guidance
and
resource
to
its
new
addition
require
much
more
management
time
and
energy
than
it
ever
anticipate
i
remember
the
problem
one
particular
acquisition
cause
us
back
in
the
mid
s
we
acquire
a
company
call
autodynamics
headquarter
in
sacramento
california
it
specialized
in
use
ultrasonic
energy
to
detect
flaw
in
metal
this
be
before
the
use
of
ultrasound
in
medical
application
it
have
a
product
call
mustang
a
full
rack
of
electronic
equipment
in
the
center
of
the
rack
the
company
have
screw
a
metal
mustang
take
from
a
ford
mustang
which
be
new
at
the
time
i
remember
look
at
the
flashy
chrome
horse
mount
on
the
electronic
equipment
and
think
that
it
didn
t
quite
fit
hp
s
way
of
think
about
our
product
as
scientific
instrument
there
be
other
problem
as
well
the
company
have
a
contract
to
build
some
ultrasound
machine
for
test
rocket
casing
we
inherit
the
contract
and
soon
learn
that
the
machine
wouldn
t
do
what
the
company
say
it
would
do
we
rescue
that
contract
with
money
and
some
technical
expertise
from
hp
lab
but
within
eight
month
or
so
we
fold
up
the
whole
operation
change
in
sale
organization
in
the
s
we
make
still
other
organizational
change
these
related
to
our
field
sale
activity
in
the
united
state
since
the
early
day
of
the
company
sale
of
hp
product
have
be
handle
through
a
network
of
sale
representative
firm
locate
in
various
part
of
the
country
these
firm
about
ten
in
number
represent
and
sell
the
product
of
other
noncompeting
electronics
manufacturer
as
well
as
those
of
hp
though
this
arrangement
have
work
very
well
some
problem
have
begin
to
arise
in
the
early
s
most
of
them
stem
from
hp
s
rapid
growth
sale
of
our
product
represent
an
increase
share
in
some
case
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
sale
representative
business
there
be
also
the
potential
with
the
grow
diversification
of
product
line
of
competitive
conflict
arise
among
product
sell
by
a
single
representative
it
be
in
short
time
to
establish
our
own
sale
organization
we
accomplish
this
not
by
break
tie
with
our
exist
representative
and
building
an
organization
from
scratch
but
by
approach
most
of
our
representative
to
see
if
they
would
be
interested
in
become
sale
division
of
hewlett
packard
the
response
be
positive
and
virtually
all
of
these
firm
agree
to
be
acquire
by
hp
either
by
an
exchange
of
stock
or
by
cash
purchase
noel
eldred
our
vice
president
of
marketing
have
work
with
the
representative
for
several
year
and
played
a
key
role
in
our
negotiation
with
them
i
have
mention
that
by
the
mid
s
we
have
more
than
a
dozen
operating
division
each
responsible
for
develop
manufacturing
and
marketing
their
own
product
in
addition
the
acquisition
of
our
u
s
sale
representative
add
another
group
of
unit
reporting
into
palo
alto
we
have
expand
our
international
market
as
well
in
europe
we
have
set
up
our
own
sale
organization
headquarter
in
geneva
and
have
establish
manufacturing
plant
in
germany
and
england
and
in
japan
our
joint
venture
company
have
become
operational
so
within
a
few
short
year
we
have
grown
from
a
highly
centralize
rather
narrowly
focus
company
into
one
with
many
widely
disperse
division
and
activity
and
our
family
of
product
have
substantially
increase
both
in
size
and
diversity
this
transition
present
us
with
a
good
many
management
challenge
among
these
be
the
problem
of
staff
some
of
our
new
operating
unit
with
effective
manager
we
be
successful
in
do
this
thanks
in
large
part
to
recruiting
effort
and
training
program
we
have
well
qualify
people
within
hp
to
fill
key
management
position
as
the
company
become
more
decentralize
our
objective
and
policy
do
not
change
in
any
significant
way
at
that
time
we
be
still
largely
in
the
business
of
general
purpose
electronic
instrumentation
and
our
growth
be
derive
almost
entirely
from
new
product
we
continued
to
focus
our
effort
on
those
technical
area
where
we
thought
we
could
make
a
good
contribution
and
we
be
not
take
on
any
new
project
just
for
the
sake
of
grow
as
time
go
on
some
of
our
old
division
grow
to
a
substantial
size
produce
many
different
product
and
employ
as
many
as
people
at
that
point
line
of
communication
be
stretch
to
the
limit
management
becomes
more
difficult
and
people
begin
to
lose
their
identification
with
the
product
and
their
pride
in
what
the
division
be
do
so
it
become
our
policy
still
observe
today
to
split
off
part
of
the
division
give
it
responsibility
for
an
establish
profitable
product
line
and
usually
move
it
to
a
new
but
nearby
location
this
local
decentralization
as
i
suppose
it
could
be
call
have
be
successfully
implement
in
california
colorado
massachusetts
virtually
everywhere
we
have
major
facility
and
operation
in
rapidly
grow
company
organizational
change
occur
quite
frequently
and
in
hp
s
case
our
next
transition
occur
in
with
the
number
of
operating
division
and
their
product
line
steadily
increase
we
gradually
adopt
a
group
structure
this
involve
combine
organizationally
division
with
related
product
line
and
market
into
a
group
head
by
a
group
manager
with
a
small
staff
each
group
be
responsible
for
the
coordination
of
divisional
activity
and
the
overall
operation
and
financial
performance
of
its
member
we
have
two
objective
to
enable
compatible
unit
to
work
together
more
effectively
on
a
day
to
day
basis
and
to
begin
to
decentralize
some
top
management
function
so
that
the
new
group
would
be
responsible
for
some
of
the
planning
activity
and
other
function
previously
assign
to
corporate
vice
president
the
group
structure
also
extend
to
our
field
sale
organization
where
it
have
become
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
an
hp
sale
engineer
to
understand
and
sell
the
entire
line
of
hp
product
under
the
new
structure
the
sale
engineer
become
the
representative
of
a
specific
group
sell
and
support
only
that
group
s
product
as
the
company
move
to
a
group
structure
i
stress
to
our
people
that
this
change
do
not
represent
any
deviation
from
our
traditional
philosophy
of
management
from
the
begin
we
have
a
strong
belief
that
group
of
people
should
be
give
responsibility
for
specific
area
of
activity
with
wide
latitude
to
develop
their
own
plan
and
make
their
own
decision
our
new
organization
do
not
alter
this
basic
concept
but
strengthen
it
by
the
early
s
hp
have
sixty
five
division
organize
into
thirteen
product
group
the
peril
of
centralization
it
have
be
my
experience
that
most
business
executive
be
quick
to
praise
the
concept
of
decentralization
but
when
it
come
to
their
own
organization
many
be
reluctant
to
adopt
it
perhaps
the
idea
of
turn
over
a
portion
of

a
fundamental
part

the

early

it
be
frequently
call
be
the
antithesis
of

the
latter
refers
to
a
tightly
control
system
of

of
the
military
type
where
people

assign
and
expect
to
do

precisely
as

told

without
the
need

know
much
about
the
overall
objective
of
the
organization
management
by
objective
on
the
other
hand
refers
to
a
system
in
which
overall
objective
be
clearly
state
and
agree
upon
and
which
give
people
the

to

toward
those
goal
in
way
they
determine
best
for
their
own
area

the
philosophy
of

in

the
very
essence
of
free
enterprise
more
and
more
company

recognize
the
very
real
benefit
provide
by
decentralization

they

also
find
that
the
concept
of
people
work
together
under
common
objective
and
in
an
atmosphere
of
individual
freedom

nothing

it
be
demonstrate
by
athens
against
sparta
more
than
twenty
century
ago
there
be
much
evidence
both
from
history
and
from
current
business
experience
to
show
that
an
organization
offering
opportunity
for
individual
initiative
performs
well
than
organization
operating
with
corporate
directive
and
tight
control
i
should
point
out
that
the
successful
practice
of
management
by
objective
be
a
two
way
street
manager
at
all

must
be
sure
that
their
people
clearly
understand
the
overall
objective
and
goal
of
the
company
as
well
as
the
specific
goal
of
their
particular
division
or
department
thus
manager
have
a
strong
obligation
to
foster
good
communication
and
mutual
understand
conversely
their
people
must
take
sufficient
interest
in
their
work
to
want
to
plan
it
to
propose
new
solution
to
old
problem
and
to
jump
in
when
they

something

the
well

express
his
thought
on
this
subject
in

interview
in
the
spring
issue
of

talk
about
what
he
call
the
post
capitalist
society
in
this
new
society
and
corporate
environment
drucker
say

will
have
to
learn
to
manage
in

where
you
don
t
have

where
you
be
neither

he
later
point
out
that
in
the
traditional

the
organization
of
the

the

that
their
people
clearly
understand
the
objective
and
specific
goal
of
their
division
or
department
as
i
have
say
it
be
also
essential
that
the
manager
have
a
thorough
knowledge
and
understand
of
the
work
of
his
or
her
group
this
brings
up
the
debate
that
have
be
carry
on
by
businesspeople
for
many
year
some
say
good
manager
can
manage
anything
they
can
manage
well
without
really
know
what
they
be
try
to
manage
it
s
the
management
skill
that
count
i
don
t
argue
that
the
job
can
t
be
do
that
way
but
i
do
argue
strongly
that
the
best
job
can
be
do
when
the
manager
have
a
genuine
and
thorough
understand
of
the
work
i
don
t
see
how
manager
can
even
understand
what
standard
to
observe
what
performance
to
require
and
how
to
measure
result
unless
they
understand
in
some
detail
the
specific
nature
of
the
work
they
be
try
to
supervise
we
have
held
closely
to
this
philosophy
at
hp
and
i
hope
will
continue
to
do
so
we
have
a
technique
at
hp
for
help
manager
and
supervisor

their
people
and
understand
the
work
their
people
be
do
while
at
the
same
time
make
themselves
more
visible
and
accessible
to
their

many
year

by
one
of
our
manager
though
the
technique
itself
go
back
to
my
day
at
general
electric
solve
the
ignitron
problem
as
i
mention
earlier
when
i
be
with
ge
in
its
vacuum
tube
engineering
department
it
be
have
problem
manufacturing
ignitrons
and
i
be
give
the
job
of
find
out
why
so
many
be
fail
during
test
i
learn
everything
i
could
about
the
cause
of
failure
and
decide
to
spend
most
of
my
time
on
the
factory
floor
make
sure
every
step
in
the
manufacturing
process
be
do
correctly
i
found
several
instance
where
the
write
instruction
provide
the
manufacturing
people
be
inadequate
and
i
work
with
them
on
each
step
in
the
process
to
make
sure
there
be
no
mistake
this
painstaking
attention
to
detail
paid
off
and
every
tube
in
the
next
batch
pass
its
final
test
as
i
look
back
my
decision
to
work
on
that
ignitron
problem
with
the
people
in
the
factory
have
a
profound
influence
on
the
management
policy
we
developed
for
the
hewlett
packard
company
that
be
the
genesis
of
what
have
be
call
mbwa
i
learn
that
quality
require
minute
attention
to
every
detail
that
everyone
in
an
organization
want
to
do
a
good
job
that
write
instruction
be
seldom
adequate
and
that
personal
involvement
be
essential
we
have
found
this
personal
involvement
to
be
very
important
at
all
level
in
the
company
i
also
found
it
useful
when
i
serve
in
washington
as
u
s
deputy
secretary
of
defense
at

we
discover
that
the
practice
of

be
generally
as
effective
at

overseas

give
us
the

informally
with

and
see
the
work
they
be
do
the
open

policy
straightforward
as
it
sound
there
be
some
subtlety
and
requirement
that
go
with
mbwa
for
one
thing
not
every
manager
find
it
easy
and
natural
to
do
and
if
it

reluctantly

infrequently
it

won

it
need
to
be
frequent
friendly
unfocused
and
unscheduled
but
far
from
pointless
and
since
its
principal
aim
be
to
seek
out
people
s
thought
and
opinion
it
require
good
listen

with
mbwa
be
another
important
management
practice
at
hewlett

and
a
basic
tenet
of
the
hp
way
it
s
call
the
open

policy
like
mbwa
this
policy
be
aim
at
building
mutual
trust

create
an
environment
in
which
people
feel

express
their

encourages

of
either
a

related
nature
to
discus
these
with
an
appropriate
manager
in
the
vast
majority
of
case
this
will
be
the
employee
s
immediate
supervisor
but
should
the
employee
be
uncomfortable
talk
with
the
supervisor
he
or
she
can
go
up
the
line
to
discus
misunderstanding
or
any
other
problem
with
a
high
level
manager
we
ve
found
that
people
do
not
seem
to
be
particularly
averse
to
bring
up
any
problem
or
concern
they
may
have
and
manager
usually
be
able
to
find
satisfactory
solution
fairly
quickly
it
must
be
clearly
understood
by
supervisor
and

to
reprisal
or
to
any
other
adverse
consequence
i
be
occasionally
ask
the
extent
to
which
the
open
door
policy
be
use
at
hp
it
be
use
quite
frequently
and
in
response
to
another
question
both
bill
hewlett
and
i
have
each
participate
in
open
door
communication
with
employee
usually
about
issue
of
general
concern
rather
than
personal
grievance
the
open
door
policy
be
very
important
at
hp
because
it
characterizes
the
management
style
to
which
we
be
dedicate
it
mean
manager
be
available
open
and
receptive
everyone
at
hp
include
the
ceo
work
in
open
plan
doorless
office
this
ready
availability
have
its
drawback
in
that
interruption
be
always
possible
but
at
hp
we
ve
found
that
the
benefit
of
accessibility
far
outweigh
the
disadvantage
the
open
door
policy
be
an
integral
part
of
the
management
by
objective
philosophy
also
it
be
a
procedure
that
encourages
and
in
fact
ensures
that
the
communication
flow
be
upward
as
well
as
downward
hp
be
consider
unusual
in
that
during
the
first
eighteen
year
of
our
existence
we
operate
without
a
personnel
department
this
be
not
because
bill
and
i
have
any
negative
feeling
toward
personnel
department
or
personnel
manager
but
because
of
the
emphasis
we
place
on
relationship
between
our
manager
and
their
people
particularly
the
need
for
manager
to
be
accessible
to
their
people
and
to
be
sensitive
to
their
problem
and
concern
we
felt
that
the
presence
of
a
personnel
function
might
supplant
or
interfere
with
this
direct
manager
employee
relationship
so
in
when
we
establish
a
corporate
personnel
department
we
be
careful
in
define
its
role
and
responsibility
it
be
to
support
management
not
supplant
it
visitor
to
hp
often
notice
and
comment
to
us
about
another
facet
of
the
hp
way
our
informality
and
our
use
of
first
name
in
address
each
other
bill
and
i
have
always
believe
that
we
all
operate
more
effectively
and
comfortably
in
a
truly
informal
and

as
in

our

frequent

we
think
of
them

a

to
the

of

that
they

up

be
especially
critical

of
an

the

and
the

of
many
thousand
of
people
during
the
early
year
of
hewlett
packard
as
with
any
small
company
we
didn
t
give
much
thought
to
management

but
as
the
company
grow
the
selection
of
the
best
qualify

to
fill
a
specific

have

this
be
no
well

that
that

do
it
reasonably
early
in

tends
to

of

already
experienced
in

we
have

try
to
have

team
become
acquaint
with
the
young
manager
in
the
company
one
of
the
way
we
do
this
in
the
past
be
through
our
divisional
review

would
be
visit
at

once
a
year
by

spent
a
full
day
review
the

s
operation
concentrate
on
its
product
development
program
at
these
meeting
we
ask
both
the
division
manager
and
the
key
people
reporting
to
him
to
make
a
presentation
this
give
us
an
opportunity
to
appraise
the
ability
of
the
young
manager
and
also
to
ass
how
well
their
boss
be
carry
out
their
training
and
development

a

in
conjunction
with
the
meeting
also
help
us
become
acquaint
in
a
more
informal
way
with
many
of
the
division
manager
today
it
be
not
possible
for
hp
s
top
management
to
conduct
an
annual
review
of
each
of
the

s
many

instead
the
division
be
regularly
review
by
their
respective
group

and
the
group
s
operation
by

though
the
format
be
different
the
inherent
benefit
derive
from
the
review
process

be

many
year
ago

and
i
establish
a
similar
review
process
within
the
company
s
board
of
director
meeting
it
be
the
usual
practice
at
each
board
meeting
to
have
an
organizational
unit
within
hp
such
as
a
product
group
a
sale
unit
or
a
corporate
department
give
a
presentation
about
its
area
of
operation
this
have
the
advantage
of
enable
our
outside
director
to
become
more
familiar
both
with
the
company
and
with
many
of
the
people
who
manage
it
eventually
some
of
the
more
senior
hp
manager
themselves
be
elect
to
the
board
and
it
be
important
that
each
director
become
acquaint
with
these
manager
and
their
ability
prior
to
the
election
in
recent
year
the
company
have
developed
additional
more
structure

of
evaluate

manager
and
their
potential
for
great
responsibility
on
a
regular
basis
the
ceo
now
lew

gather
his
top

periodically
with

and
nominate

to
review
the
performance
of
key
manager
promote
from

i
have
always
felt
that
the
most
successful
company
have
a
practice
of
promote
from
within
until
the
s
when
we
enter
the
computer
business
it
be
rare
to
find
a
key
manager
who
have
not
grown
up
within
the
company
our
entry
into
the
computer
business
change
that
a
bit
we
need
to
acquire
some
expertise
in
computer
science
and
a
good
part
of
that
expertise
be
available
only
from
outside
the

most
of
those
who
join
us
in
addition
to
make
important
contribution
to
our
strength
in
computer

adapt
quite
readily
to
the

a
few
do
not
and
chose
to
leave
long
before
we
reach

i
have
be
think
and
talk
about
who

in
the

this
provide
a
good
transition
to
the
time
when

john
become

m
not
a
strong
advocate

there
be
no
question
that

responsibility
to

i
have
strong
recollection
of
the
depression
year
in
pueblo
colorado
in
the
s
although
no
one
in
our
neighborhood
be
consider
wealthy
there
be
poor
family
with
virtually
no
income
those
who
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
mean
to
support
their
own
family
share
willingly
and
voluntarily
with
those
who
could
not
provide
food
clothing
or
shelter
for
themselves
this
personal
experience
left
a
last
impression
with
me
of
the
importance
of
personal
care
and
involvement
among
the
hewlett

objective

down

good
corporate
citizen

in
which
a

operates
be
now
widely
recognize

accepted
by
american
business
but
it
wasn
t
always
so
i
recall
a
conference
i
attend
in
the
late
s
that
include
people
from
various
industry
and
organization
we
begin
talk
about
whether
business
have
responsibility
beyond
make
a
profit
for
their
shareholder
i
express
my
view
that
we
do
that
we
have
important
responsibility
to
our
employee
to
our
customer
to
our
supplier
and
to
the
welfare
of
society
at
large
i
be
surprised
and
disappointed
that
most
of
the
others
disagreed
with
me
they
felt
their
only
responsibility
be
to
generate

for
their

look
back

however
the

make
and

be
of
great
benefit
to
the

from
to
i
be
privileged
during
my
tenure
on
the
stanford

to
have
former

as
a
friend
and

be
in
fact
a
member
of
stanford
s
first
graduate
class
he
serve
as
a

from
until
his
death
in
hoover
s
devotion
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
be
a
motivate
factor
throughout
his
life
his
many
year
of
public
service
have
a
great
effect
in
contribute
to
a
high
ethic
but
he
be
very
firm
in
support
the
position
he
believe
in
during
my
term
as
chairman
of
the
stanford
board
of
trustee
i
have
one
particularly
ticklish
encounter
with
president
hoover
he
be
concerned
that
wally
sterling
then
president
of
stanford
be
go
to
let
the
faculty
take
over
the
appointment
of
the
board
of
overseer
of
the
hoover
institution
at
stanford
president
hoover
want
his
institution
to
demonstrate
the
evil
of
communism
the
faculty
maintain
that
the
institution
s
research
should
not
have
its
outcome
determine
in
advance
i
spent
some
considerable
time
try
to
reconcile
these
two
viewpoint
once
a
month
i
d
journey
to
new
york
city
to
breakfast
with
president
hoover
in
the
sunny
corner
of
his
apartment
at
the
waldorf
tower
the
situation
be
particularly
difficult
for
me
because
lucile
and
i
be
very
good
friend
with
easton
rothwell
director
of

hoover
institution

president
hoover
want
him
replace
with
glenn
campbell
whom
president
hoover
have
know
for
some
time
we
finally
solve
the
problem
the
donor
president
hoover
have
a
right
to
say
what
he
want
his
institution
to
do
at
the
same
time
research
should
be
broad
and
objective
and
not
subject
to
any
preconceive
outcome
unfortunately
president
hoover
be
not
sure
the
trustee
would
hold
to
that
position
so
he
take
his
personal
paper
to
his
home
in
west
branch
iowa
in
later
year
president

most
of
the
time
before
the
inauguration
in
january
work
with
mel
to
plan
what
we
would
do
i
knew
that
robert
mcnamara
secretary
of
defense
during
the
kennedy
and
johnson
year
have
alienate
the
professional
military
people

there
be
many
story
of
mcnamara
s
clash
with
the
brass

of
these
be
about
the
blockade
to
stop
the

blockade
i
think
bob
mcnamara
be
right
he
should
have
have
a
say
as
part
of
the
administration
about
how
the
blockade
be
to
be
handle
participatory

this
fit

our
first
assignment
for
president
nixon
be
to
consider
how
much
the
defense
budget
could
be
reduce
to
provide
more
money
for
domestic
program
this
be
to
implement
the
nixon
doctrine
which
be
to
ask
the
country
we
be
support
to
provide
for
their
own
security
with
help
from
us
to
work
for
world
peace
and
to
rely
on
negotiation
rather
than
arm
conflict
i
support
this
challenge
initiative
because
i
thought
it
be
the
right
way
to
go
but
the
policy
could
not
work
unless
it
be
support
by
military
strength
and
i
felt
quite
sure
we
could
provide
adequate
strength
with
a
low
level
of
funding
i
told
the
military
chief
that
i
want
them
to
participate
in
decide
where
reduction
in
the
budget
might
be
make
i
also
told
them
that
after
i
make
a
decision
i
would
ask
each
of
the
service
involve
to
have
a
hearing
before
i
would
present
the
propose
reduction
to
the
undersecretary
committee
we
have
to
make
substantial
cut
in
just
a
few
week
and
we
have
very
good
support
from
the
professional
military
people
procurement
one
unfortunate
legacy
of
the
prior
administration
be
the
total
package
procurement
plan
under
that
plan
contractor
who
want
to
bid
on
military
weapon
be
require
to
bid
for
the
entire
job
of
develop
test
and
manufacturing
them
this
might
be
a
good
theory
but
it
be
simply
impossible
to
make
a
bid
on
a
weapon
system
that
have
not
yet
be
design
almost
all
of
the
program
under
the
total
package
procurement
policy
be
in
trouble
and
we
have
to
figure
out
how
to
deal
with
them
the
c
a
be
a
large
transport
plane
whose
specification
could
have
be
relaxed
in
a
number
of
place
without
seriously
reduce
its
capability
when
we
offer
to
reduce
the
requirement
the
lawyer
say
we
have
to
reduce
the
price
because
it
be
a
valid
contract
this
put
us
in
a
very
difficult
position
and
in
the
end
i
have
to
go
back
to
congress
to
get
some
more
money
to
save
these
program
one
procurement
problem
that
come
up
shortly
after
i
take
office
concerned
supply
we
bought
from
three
southern
textile
mill
the
previous
administration
left
this
problem
for
us
to
deal
with
and
they
thought
we
would
trip
up
on
it
these
mill
have
not
met
the
level
of
minority
employment
they
be
oblige
to
achieve
fortunately
i
d
have
some
previous
experience
in
a
related
situation
when
we
have
expend
considerable
effort
at
hp
in
try
to
increase
the
opportunity
for
the
people
in
east
palo
alto
a
predominately
black
community
while
we
at
hp
be
struggle
with
this
issue
i
heard
of
reverend
leon
sullivan
whose
opportunity
industrial
center
oic
have
achieve
positive
result
for
minority
industrial
worker
in
philadelphia
i
ask
him
to
come
out
and
help
me
establish
a
similar
program
in
east
palo
alto
and
together
we
set
up
the
opportunity
industrial
center
west
oicw
to
make
this
work
i
invite
all
of
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
company
in
the
area
to
join
us
to
make
sure
graduate
from
oicw
would
have
job
and
the
project
be
a
great
success
i
decide
i
would
do
the
same
thing
with
these
three
southern
textile
mill
i
personally
knew
two
of
the
chief
executive
of
these
mill
and
i
contact
all
three
of
them
i
told
them
i
would
award
the
contract
to
them
if
they
promise
me
that
they
would
become
involve
and
make
sure
adequate
progress
be
achieve
all
three
agree
to
do
so
i
award
the
contract
on
that
basis
and
immediately
senator
ted
kennedy
ask
me
to
come
before
his
subcommittee
and
discus
what
i
have
do
i
explain
to
him
that
i
do
this
because
i
have
learn
from
my
experience
in
palo
alto
that
it
would
work
i
told
him
we
need
the
material
and
if
they
do
not
make
good
progress
i
would
have
other
opportunity
to
do
something
about
it
in
hearing
of
this
kind
member
of
the
senate
from
the
administration
s
party
would
appear
to
support
the
person
at
the
hearing
senator
everett
dirksen
appear
at
this
particular
hearing
and
support
me
i
will
never
forget
how
he
say
in
his
gravelly
voice
about
what
i
have
do
he
be
right
as
rain
the
prototype
program
i
begin
to
look
at
military
weapon
acquisition
system
use
by
other
country
and
some
of
the
successful
program
of
the
dod
i
learn
that
the
desault
company
in
france
have
be
able
to
design
build
and
deliver
a
prototype
fighter
aircraft
to
the
french
military
for
about
million
in
the
united
state
the
lockheed
skunk
work
run
by
kelley
johnson
have
deliver
a
number
of
reconnaissance
aircraft
in
a
relatively
short
time
and
at
a
reasonable
cost
i
discuss
these
program
with
dr
john
foster
the
pentagon
s
head
of
research
and
engineering
barry
shillito
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
and
a
number
of
other
people
and
i
conclude
that
a
prototype
program
should
be
set
up
to
produce
two
prototype
fighter
plane
and
a
number
of
other
item
we
get
mixed
up
a
bit
by
describe
the
prototype
program
by
the
phrase
fly
before
you
buy
because
you
cannot
do
exactly
that
without
stretch
out
the
program
far
too
long
i
want
to
build
two
prototype
fighter
plane
and
use
the
prototype
system
on
a
number
of
other
project
congress
want
us
to
take
the
money
for
the
prototype
program
out
of
the
overall
budget
they
have
approve
i
resist
because
of
the
substantial
cut
each
service
have
already
take
congress
finally
allow
me
to
handle
the
program
the
way
i
thought
best
we
give
mcdonald
douglas
one
contract
and
they
produce
a
prototype
plane
the
f
northrup
get
the
other
contract
for
a
prototype
plane
the
f
the
f
have
become
the
best
air
force
fighter
plane
and
the
f
rename
the
f
have
become
the
best
navy
fighter
reliability
beyond
our
procurement
difficulty
there
be
a
serious
problem
with
the
reliability
of
the
vacuum
tube
equipment
use
on
all
of
our
plane
the
f
which
at
the
time
be
our
best
fighter
plane
have
a
mean
time
between
failure
measure
in
day
in
vietnam
that
meant
an
f
could
fly
only
a
few
sortie
before
go
in
for
repair
this
problem
be
solve
when
we
use
large
scale
integrate
circuit
a
few
year
later
the
joint
chief
and
unified
command
i
really
do
not
know
very
much
about
how
the
dod
be
manage
but
i
soon
realize
that
in
fact
it
have
be
manage
by
a
committee
the
joint
chief
in
theory
the
four
service
acquire
the
weapon
and
train
the
force
the
service
then
provide
the
weapon
and
force
for
combat
to
the
specify
and
unified
command
the
most
important
specify
command
be
the
strategic
force
command
under
general
curtis
lemay
with
its
headquarters
at
omaha
nebraska
and
its
nuclear
command
post
in
cheyenne
mountain
at
colorado
spring
because
general
lemay
be
a
forceful
leader
this
command
work
well
the
unified
command
be
in
a
bad
state
because
each
service
decide
where
to
station
its
weapon
and
force
and
the
unified
commander
have
little
to
say
about
their
placement
in
addition
to
that
the
service
paid
little
attention
to
how
their
force
work
with
the
force
of
the
other
service
the
marine
radio
equipment
could
not
communicate
with
the
navy
s
radio
equipment
the
air
force
have
a
fleet
of
b
bomber
station
on
guam
when
these
b
s
be
call
in
to
bomb
in
cambodia
they
do
not
have
a
secure
radio
channel
so
the
viet
cong
knew
where
the
bomber
would
strike
when
they
left
guam
and
these
raid
be
essentially
worthless
i
do
not
learn
about
all
of
these
type
of
problem
during
the
three
year
i
be
at
the
pentagon
but
i
learn
enough
to
realize
that
a
major
change
have
to
be
make
i
also
learn
that
this
be
what
president
eisenhower
meant
in
his
farewell
address
when
he
warn
of
the
danger
of
the
military
industrial
complex
the
military
service
have
too
much
political
power
and
he
could
not
make
the
change
necessary
to
reduce
that
power
when
he
be
in
office
after
leave
my
post
as
deputy
secretary
i
serve
on
several
commission
for
the
defense
department
most
recently
as
chairman
of
the
blue
ribbon
commission
on
defense
management
for
president
reagan
we
work
closely
with
senator
barry
goldwater
and
don
nickel
in
get
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chief
to
be
the
sole
uniformed
officer
to
be
adviser
to
the
president
on
national
security
issue
it
s
my
belief
and
many
military
analyst
have
agree
with
me
that
our
success
in
the
gulf
war
be
directly
attributable
to
the
clear
chain
of
command
from
president
bush
to
chairman
colin
powell
and
in
turn
to
general
norman
schwarzkopf
and
his
subordinate
commander
before
i
go
to
washington
even
the
people
who
encourage
me
to
go
warn
me
that
a
career
in
business
would
ill
prepare
me
for
the
frustration
of
government
bureaucracy
and
they
be
right
at
the
time
i
comment
that
work
with
the
washington
bureaucracy
be
like
push
on
one
end
of
a
forty
foot
rope
and
try
to
get
the
other
end
to
do
what
you
want
the
washington
year

there

be
apply
to
the

they

not

but
the
loss
of
a

even
the

their

they

epilogue
when
i
think
of
the
phenomenal
growth
of
the
electronics
industry
over
the
last
fifty
year
i
realize
how
fortunate
bill
hewlett
and
i
be
to
be
in
on
the
ground
floor
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
like
to
tell
on
myself
in
my
sophomore
year
at
stanford
i
take
a
course
in
american
history
and
have
the
opportunity
to
study
the
westward
movement
begin
with
the
early
pioneer
and
continue
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
i
remember
lament
that
i
have
be
born
one
hundred
year
too
late
that
all
the
frontier
have
be
conquer
and
that
my
generation
would
be
deprive
of
the
pioneer
opportunity
offer
our
forebear
but
in
fact
we
go
on
to
make
breathtaking
advance
in
the
twentieth
century
during
this
century
science
become
the
dominate
factor
in
the
progress
of
the
world
there
be
two
world
war
that
take
the
life
of
million
of
people
but
at
the
end
of
the
century
there
be
a
real
prospect
that
there
will
be
no
more
world
war
although
it
seem
that
the
senseless
kill
of
people
in
numerous
religious
and
ethnic
group
will
continue
for
some
time
in
the
twentieth
century
we
have
experienced
dizzy
progress
most
of
it
found
on
scientific
principle
establish
over
many
year
in
the
past
this
science
largely
in
place
by
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
be
base
on
the
concept
that
the
atom
be
the
small
particle
in
the
universe
and
that
its
structure
consist
of
a
nucleus
of
proton
and
neutron
surround
by
ring
of
electron
from
this
concept
the
periodic
table
be
construct
and
the
atom
bomb
developed
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
we
and
our
ally
and
the
soviet
union
embark
on
a
massive
program
of
high
energy
physic
in
the
quest
to
secure
military
advantage
neither
side
ever
achieve
this
goal
but
in
the
process
it
be
discover
that
the
atom
be
not
the
small
particle
in
the
universe
but
that
the
atom
itself
contain
ten
small
particle
with
weak
force
and
strong
force
that
do
not
obey
the
newtonian
law
of
gravity
use
the
old
notion
of
the
atom
we
could
simulate
material
that
occur
in
nature
such
as
diamond
but
with
the
new
understand
of
the
atom
we
can
create
material
that
do
not
occur
in
nature
material
that
be
harder
than
diamond
glass
that
be
ductile
this
discovery
have
unleashed
the
whole
new
field
of
genetic
engineering
offering
a
whole
new
world
of
scientific
opportunity
everywhere
i
look
i
see
the
potential
for
growth
for
discovery
far
great
than
anything
we
have
see
in
the
twentieth
century
exponential
growth
be
base
on
the
principle
that
the
state
of
change
be
proportional
to
the
level
of
effort
expend
the
level
of
effort
will
be
far
great
in
the
twenty
first
century
than
it
have
be
in
the
twentieth
century
hewlett
packard
company
be
a
good
case
in
point
it
take
forty
year
for
the
company
bill
hewlett
and
i
start
in
to
reach
one
billion
dollar
in
annual
sale
and
a
major
part
of
that
be
from
inflation
in
the
fiscal
year
that
end
last
october
we
begin
the
year
with
twenty
billion
dollar
in
worldwide
sale
and
add
five
billion
to
that
by
year
s
end
this
occur
with
essentially
no
inflation
other
technology
company
have
show
similar
growth
just
as
it
have
in
the
past
our
growth
in
the
future
will
come
from
new
product
in
we
spent
two
billion
dollar
in
new
product
development
begin
in
we
generate
at
least
six
dollar
of
profit
spread
over
five
or
six
year
for
every
dollar
spent
on
new
product
development
by
new
product
i
mean
product
that
make
real
contribution
to
technology
not
product
that
copy
what
someone
else
have
do
this
must
be
our
standard
in
the
future
just
as
it
have
be
in
the
past
recently
there
have
be
much
discussion
about
develop
an
information
superhighway
this
can
be
accomplish
with
product
and
technology
already
in
place
the
twenty
first
century
however
will
be
much
more
than
an
information
age
it
will
be
an
age
in
which
many
kind
of
new
product
contribute
to
a
well
life
for
all
of
the
people
in
the
world
our
company
will
work
hard
to
contribute
its
share
