have
reach

have
therefore
transfer

you

your
successor
as

from
which
be
to

the

in

that
never
in

do
we

yes
we
would
have
bemoan
but
accepted
the
possibility
that
it
would
rise

from
to
do
we
expect
some
complaint
when
individual
cref
account
suddenly
go
down
sharply
in
after
generally
rise
for
many
year
yes
we
have
be
warn
it
be
ever
thus
and
we
go
ahead
and
establish
cref
anyway
do
we
expect
complaint
from
some
people
when
cref
go
up

in

i
start
seriously
to
ponder
do
something
drastic
about
annuity

inflation

a
piece
or
two
be
miss
would
a
pension
plan

only
by

do
the
job
but
such
a

probably
would
go
broke
sooner

later
in

drop

there
be
a
way
to
avoid
use
dollar
valuation
of

and
liability
how
could
you
do
that
in
the
annuity
business
furthermore
how
do
you
give
participant
a
stake
in
the
good
experience
when
stock
be
do
well
but
protect
them
when
they
be
not
or
aha
should
you
attempt
that
all
annuity
then
be
guaranteed
to
provide
a
fix
number
of
dollar
be
that
necessary
one
day
in

i
have
a
chance
to
chat
with
some
of
my
colleague
about
my
develop
idea
a
half
dozen
of
us
met
near
wall
street
for
a
luncheon
at
mazzalotti

dr

disque
deane
of

and
two
others
be
in
the
group
that
be
the
first
time
i
ever
talk
outside
about
the
idea
in
his
recent
oral
history
dr
roger
murray
brought
up
that
luncheon
he
indicate
he
remember
it
very
well
after
year
because
of
the
intrigue
idea
present
he
say
when
you
invite
me
and
a
couple
of
others
to
lunch
to
discus
the
very
general
outline
of
what
you
have
in
mind
what
you
have
be
think
about
it
be
not
that
you
give
us
a
specific
blueprint
here
you
be
talk
about
an
annuity
that
didn
t
have
a
guarantee

a
prescribed
rate
of
anything
you
re
go
to
pay
them
in
funny
money
as
compare
with
the
standard
so
many
dollar
a
month
for
life
dr
murray
emphasize
the
intrigue
nature
of
the
idea
but
he
be
worried
my
concern
be
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
get
a
bunch
of
academic
to
understand
sit
down

listen
in
the
first

people
have
be
indoctrinate
from
childhood
to
the
certainty
of
an

you
come
into
this
world
of

income
with
an
expectation
that
it
be
go
to
be
precisely
the
same
amount
to
the
penny
for
your
life
and
for
the
life
of
your
spouse
as
to
accept
the
idea
of
common
stock
for
pension
investment
that
be
no
problem
for
dr
murray
his
expertise
on

in

be
why
he
be
invite
to
the

he
have
be
instrumental
in

i
ask
dr

about

my
main
worry
in

inflation
be
not
in
the
range
of
our
real
concern
at
the

he
be
interested
in
the
investment
opportunity
of
the
idea
the
state
of
the
capital
market
be
so
compelling
as
you
wcg
be
talk
about
you
could
double
your
current
income
by
own
stock
instead
of
bond
in
the
spring
of
on
a
trip
to
my
alma

indiana
university
i
visit
a
number
of
my
former
economics
and
business
school
faculty
colleague
on
the
top
of
our
mind
be
the
economic
challenge
we
discuss
pension
inflation
college
endowment
investment
and
the
tiaa
retirement
system
we
worried
because
interest
earnings
then
of
less
than
percent
on
fix
dollar
investment
with
an
inflation
rate
of
percent
to
percent
meant
a
negative
rate
of
real
return
this
do
not
treat
saver
very
well
and
it
make
save
adequately
for
retirement
income
nearly
impossible
my
early
teach
colleague

edward
e
edward

needle
out
for
me

my
indiana
family
name
what
be

do
about

why
isn

it
i
then
go
next
door
to
see
dr
harry
sauvain
finance
professor
and
later
a
cref
policyholder
select
trustee
we
talk
for
some
time
and
discuss
an
idea
of
his
for
invest
the
cash
value
of
life
insurance
in
equity
from
my
different
perspective
i
be
think
about
annuity
it
be
that
specific
conversation
that
drop
into
place
the
final
miss
piece
for
the
variable
annuity
i
can
still
remember
how
neatly
it
all
suddenly
arrange
itself
in
my
mind
a
lifetime
annuity
free
to
move
up
or
down
in
direct
proportion
to
the
value
of
a
portfolio
of
common
stock
the
aha
idea
be
express
everything
in
unit
not
dollar
go
ahead
and
make
guarantee
but
express
them
as
unit
not
dollar
and
let
the
unit
value
flow
freely
up

this
fit
perfectly
with

conviction
that

have
no

no

it
should

great
if

would
do

the
other

then
by

have
the

express
it
in

when

high
the

they
have
look
at
the
new

and
found
it
so
restrictive
that
tiaa
could
not
meet
their

i
told
dr

something
about
my
thought
on

awhile

with
this
additional

i

for

combine
a
number
of
well
know
principle
into
a
broad
new
pattern
the
principle
of
diversification
among
issue
of
equity
investment
would
be
obtain
through
pool
a
portion
of
the
annuity
saving
of
many
employer
and
individual
into
a
substantial
fund
invest
in
hundred
of
company
in
many
industry
the
principle
of
diversification
over
time
would
be
obtain
by
accept
small
payment
month
by
month
and
year
by
year
over
a
major
portion
of
each
participant
s
work
lifetime
these
payment
would
be
directly
related
to
salary
and
therefore
would
continue
at
all
level
of
common
stock
price
effective
use
would
be
make
of
the
principle
of
dollar
cost
average
whereby
more
share
of
stock
be
purchase
at
low
price
than
at
high
perhaps
the
most
interest
development
be
the
unit
annuity
few
individual
can
accumulate
enough
by
retirement
time
to
live
entirely
on
the
earnings
from
investment
under
ordinary
condition
the
retire
individual
dare
not
dip
too
deeply
into
principal
because
he
have
no
way
of
know
how
long
he
and
his
wife
will
live
some
people
die
soon
after
retirement
others
live
year
or
longer
by
use
of
the
traditional
life
annuity
an
individual
can
with
safety
use
up
capital
as
well
as
interest
earnings
and
thereby
obtain
a
substantially
high
income
throughout
the
remainder
of
his
life
the
unit
annuity
directly
applies
that
same
principle
to
a
new
area
of
investment
common
stock
allow
the
individual
the
assurance
again
that
he
can
use
up
both
capital
and
dividend
payment
without
danger
of
outlive
his
income
three
compelling
conclusion
emerge
from
the
economic
report

it
be
unwise
to
commit
all
of
one
s
retirement
saving
to
dollar
obligation
since
decrease
in
the
purchasing
power
of
the
dollar
can
seriously
reduce
the
value
of
a
fix
income
annuity
increase
in
the
purchasing
power
of
the
dollar
on
the
other
hand
improve
the
status
of
the
owner
of
a
fix
income
annuity

it
be
equally
unwise
to
commit
all
of
one
s
retirement
saving
to
equity
investment
since
variation
in
price
of
common
stock
be
much
too
pronounce
to
permit
full
reliance
on
them
for
the
stable
income
need
during
retirement
change
in
the
value
of
common
stock
and
other
equity
be
by
no
mean
perfectly
correlate
with
cost
of
living

because
of
their
continue
relevance
to

employer

system
decision
the

should
make
no

its

should
always
be

value
in

of

this
be
a
cardinal
point
of
the
suggest
arrangement
for
two
principal
reason
a
it
assures
that
the
equity

be
failure
proof
in
the
technical
sense
and
cannot
be
force
into
liquidation
of
its
asset
at
a
low
point
in
the
market
whether
the
market
be
high
or
low
the
equity

and
whose

partially
in
fluctuate
security
such
as
common
stock
be
vulnerable
in
this
connection
b
it
assures
the
individual
participant
his

in

assurance
to
his

any
appreciation
in

value
be
normally
use
to
reduce
the

s
cost
or
to
create

whereas
it
be
need
in
a
period
of

price
as
an
increase
benefit
for
the
employee
through
a

free
from
the
confinement
of

a

can
have
a

opportunity
to

the

of
the
american
economy
with
part
of
his

obviously
this
opportunity

most
of
the

from

this
necessitate

although
it
do
not
gain

at

the

would

reverse
the

the

to

the

and
the

draft
result
in
a
complex
technical
wordy
form
we
already
be
have
trouble
explain

if
we
serve
up
to

an

we

multiply
the

solve

in

unique

at

way
in
a
memorandum
to
george

force
i
suggest
i
wonder
if
the
first
page
could
not
be
a
very
simple
statement
of
the
broad
outline
of
the
plan
eliminate
all
unnecessary
word
legal
qualification
and
the
like
could
it
not
be
merely
descriptive
in
nature
rather
than
summary
for
a
certificate
of
this
sort
it
seem
particularly
inappropriate
to
have
a
word
sentence
as
contain
in
the
fifth
paragraph
on
the
first

as
i
try
in
one
meeting
to
make
sense
out
of
what
the
lawyer
and
actuary
be
say
i
write
on
a
line
pad
a
general
description
of
the
new
annuity
contract
we
decide
that
if
it
help
me
it
might
help
the
policyholder
so
my
rough
draft
smooth
up
wcg
to

may
re
cref

a
bit
become
the

of

this
general
description
at
the
outset
specify
that
it
be
not
a
part
of
the
contract
but
an
effort
to
describe
just
what
a
variable
annuity
be
in
nontechnical
language
it
have
serve
this
purpose
over
the
year
and
help
to
avoid
the
frequent
criticism
of
insurance
policy
that
they
be
not
understandable

on
the

approach

add
if
the

be
well
receive
by
the
certificate
holder
and
do
not
involve
a
significant
amount
of
litigation
it
might
well
be
the
answer
to
the
often
heard
criticism
that
insurance
policy
be
so
full
of
legalistic
phraseology
that
it
take
a
good
lawyer
to
understand

this
be
a
double

sendoff

more

why

the

it

reassure
for

if
they

plan
their

it

be
more
economical
for

the
more
the

look
at
this
question
the
less
they
thought
the
annuity
unit
value
need
to
be
change
during
the
year
all
that
would
do
would
be
to
impose
a
series
of
little
squiggle
in
monthly
annuity
paid
to
participant
we
consider
withdraw
from
the
cref
common
stock
fund
the
total
amount
of

payment
cref
would
have
to
make
during
an
ensue
year
and
place
that
amount
in
short
term
money
market
type
investment
but
when
we
compare
the
performance
of
those
normally
very
low
interest
rate
investment
with
the
high
return
on
common
stock
we
found
variability
would
not
be
reduce
much
and
what
reduction
there
be
would
not
compensate
for
the
loss
of
the
high
total
return
over
time
on
common
stock
so
the
final
decision
be
make
to
hold
the
annuity
unit
value
constant
for
a
year
at
a
time
and
to
keep
fully
invest
in

why
the

the

be
a
neutral
date
on
which
to

the

no

actually
tiaa
test
december

other
possible

not
find
persistent
bias
with
them
but
conclude
they
might
develop
from
tax
or
other
reason
in
the
future
we
consider
use
three
month
end
value
to
smooth
the
amount
of
benefit
payment
somewhat
but
found
over
a
long
period
that
it
do
not
result
in
much
smooth
it
do
however
cause
far
lag
in

current
common

why
not

one
of
the
more
frequent
proposal
over
the

have
be
why
not
smooth
out
the
annuity
benefit
and
their
upward
and
downward
movement
from
year
to
year
any
average
creates
a
lag
in
the
payment
of
the
fully
participate
benefit
this
would
delay
adjustment
to
inflationary
force
for
retire
people
who
may
already
be
try
to
live
comfortably
on
an
impaired

furthermore
a
lag
would
not
give
equitable
treatment
among
participant
and
such
a
smooth
process
would
necessitate
some
kind
of
reserve
contrary
to
the
full

be
that
finance
committee
would
decide
on
allocation
of
fund
from
time
to
time
between
stock
and
bond
this
matter
come
in
for
careful
study
at
tiaa
the
decision
be
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
separate
fund
for
tiaa
and
cref
the
most
important
consideration
be
that
hundred
of
thousand
of
individual
would
be
start
their
participation
in
college
retirement
plan
at
various
time
during
the
year
and
over
the
year
would
be
change
job
and
tiaa
and
cref
participation
would
be
change
their
own
allocation
accord
to
their
individual
need
from
time
to
time
and
would
be
retire
at
different
time
the
separate
fund
approach
allows
maximum
choice
by
individual
for
their
participation
otherwise
the
allocation
of
investment
of
their
retirement
saving
between
equity
and
fix
dollar
asset
would
be
decide
by
the
fund
and
they
would
have
no
choice
there
also
be
investment
reason
in
a
balance
fund
base
for
example
on
a
split
between
stock
and
bond
the
investment
manager
be
continually
cut
back
on
whichever
investment
category
be
do
well
in
order
to
rebalance
the
fund
this
be
defend
as
a
useful
discipline
for
investment
manager
in
the
short
run
business
cycle
but
it
work
poorly
for
long
term
saving
program
such
as
pension
for
instance
from
to
the
fund
would
have
be
cut
back
on
its
common
stock
investment
to
balance
with
fix
dollar
asset
most
of
the
time
the
only
time
the
system
would
have
provide
discipline
to
increase
common
stock
materially
would
be
fairly
short
period
such
as
in
during
world
war
ii
and
plus
a
few
even
shorter
opportunity
the
to
present
period
be
discuss
later
a
balance
fund
can
lead
to
lose
opportunity
whenever
a
major
movement
to
a
new
level
of
either
stock
or

occurs
over
a

transfer
to
tiaa
at

should
participant
be
allow
to
transfer
part
or
all
of
their
cref
accumulation
to
tiaa
at
retirement
in
this
be
a
real
question
two
task
force
head
jenkins
and
johnson
thought
no
such
transfer
should
be
allow
they
be
right
philosophically
the
author
s
memorandum
at
the
time
describes
the
rationale
for
tiaa
s
final
decision
if
at
any
one
moment
in
the
process
a
large
shift
of
money
can
be
make
out
of
or
into
common
stock
there
be
real
danger
that
the
shift
will
be
make
at
the
wrong
time

many
person
will
want
a
fix
dollar
income
after
retirement
they
be
perfectly
willing
to
take
the
chance
in
common
stock
while
they
be
work
but
feel
that
their
risk
take
day
should
end
when
they
retire

if
a
person
have
be
invest
his
premium
over
a
long
period
of
time
say
year
then
historically
speak
he
would
not
be
hurt
badly
if
he
transfer
all
of
it
out
even
in
such
poor
year
as
etc

there
be
a
question
as
to
how
far
the
policyholder
should
be
protect
from
his
own
bad
decision
with
the
result
that
he
be
prevent
from
make
good
decision
such
as
transfer
out
of
the
market
at
the
right
time
i
find
it
especially

also

prevent

note
that
the

left
to
the

alfred
bohlinger
our
timing
be
off
during
that
period
superintendent
bohlinger
be
engage
in
a
difficult
fight
on
automobile
premium
rate
in
new

he
greet
the
delegation
courteously
and
listen
as
well
as
he
could
between
telephone
call
and
interruption
it
be
clear
when
the
group
left
that
we
have
make
little
progress
all
that
the
tiaa
representative
hop
for
anyway
be
to
have
the
superintendent
of
insurance
stand
aside
and
not
oppose
their
effort
in
the
legislature
but
apparently
even
that
be
too
much
to
hope
for
not
only
be
the
superintendent
preoccupy
but
also
his
staff
have
conclude
the
propose
common
stock
fund
be
not
an
insurance
company
and
could
not
come
under
the

not
be
allow
at
this

and
subsequent
meeting
staff

show

but
repeatedly

the
establishment
of
the
new
organization
and
the
appropriateness
of
its
supervision
by
the
insurance
department
one
of
their
point
be
that
because
cref
would
always
be
solvent
by
definition
the
department
really
would
have
no
function
in
its
triennial
examination
incredibly
there
tiaa
be
a
private
pension

argue
vigorously
that
the
new
york
state
department
of

should
regulate
the
new
enterprise
and
the
department
be
argue
that
it
should
not
this
be
a
remarkable
reversal
of
role
of
regulator
and
regulatee
it
must
have
be
some
kind
of
a
first
in
the
history
of

tiaa
point
out
that
the
department
would
have
major
responsibility
for
assure
fair
and
equitable
treatment
of
participant
accuracy
of
record
and
conformity
to
all
provision
of
insurance
law
except
inappropriate
section
such
as
investment
limitation
later
the

ask
tiaa
to

in
write
instruction
for
the

seem
to
be
generally

that

to

that
it
would
be
understood
that
there
be
a
possibility

well
as

that

what
disturbs
me
however
be
that
the

i
do
not
and
do
not
believe

alone

a
satisfactory
proxy

in

although
it
may
be
a
keen
measure
of
short
term
psychological
attitude
toward

i
have
just
reread
some
correspondence
i
have
with
milton
friedman
in
that
clearly
state
the
question
although
it
do
not
end
the
discussion
friedman
write
i
believe
the
criterion
of

be
utterly
unsuited
to
cref
it
measure
the
variability
of
annual
rate
of

it
be
appropriate
for
someone
who
be
contemplate
get
in
and
out
of
the
market
at
fairly
frequent
interval
so
that
it
do
matter
to
him
what
return
he
will
get
for
a
period
as
brief
as
a
year
that
clearly
applies
to
essentially
none
of
cref
s
policyholder
certainly
not
during
the
accumulation
during
that
period
nothing
could
be
of
less
interest
to
a
cref
policyholder
than
the
year
to
year
variation
in
rate
of
return
but
what
do
interest
him
be
the
mean
rate
of
return
that
he
will
earn
over
the
period
during
which
he
be
accumulate

a
s
you
increase
the

of

for

individual
return

measure
from
one
year
to
two
year
to
five
year
to
ten

the
variability
would
diminish
very
sizably
neither
friedman
nor
i
be
say
there
be
no
risk
in
common
stock
investment
but
we
be
say
the
widely

for

variability
measure
by
volatility
of
annual
or
even
quarterly
rate
of

should
be
irrelevant
for
the

in

be
one
of

this

provide
tiaa
with
the
wide
latitude
in
the
selection
of

and
stand
in
sharp
contrast
to
most
institutional
investor
saving
bank
and
saving
and

institution
traditionally
have
take
what
turn
out
to
be
demand
deposit
that
be
withdrawable
on
demand
and
then
invest
them
in
long

illiquid
mortgage
whenever
short
term
rate
move
well
ahead
of
long
term
rate
many
depositor
would
shift
their
fund
to
money
market
obligation
or
certificate
of
deposit
issue
by
commercial
bank
leave
the
saving
institution
badly
expose
this
effectively
remove
them
from
the
market
for
new
loan
just
at
the
time
new
loan
provide
the
high
rate
of

a
parallel
situation
exist
for
the
life
insurance
company
policyholder
could
cash
in

or
take
out
policy
loan
at
percent
or
in
some
state
percent
interest
and
immediately
invest
the
fund
at
high
rate
thus
even
the
life
insurance
company
be
force
to
reduce
their
lending
activity
right
at
the
high
point
in
interest
rate
disintermediation
always
occurs
during
period
of
rapidly
rise
interest
rate
and
usually
result
in
heavy
withdrawal
from
saving
institution
this
be
a
time
of
opportunity
for
pension
fund
when
other
saving
institution
be
decrease
their
commitment
tiaa
be
increase
its
new

acquisition
and
commitment
during
for
example
tiaa
make
million
more
in

conventional
mortgage

than
it
have
make
in

another
example
tiaa
work
down
its
forward
commitment
in
direct
placement
loan
from
million
on

to
million
on

subsequently
as
interest
rate
rise
forward
commitment
be
increase
to
million
on
january
the
most
traumatic
period
occur
in
the
early
s
when
saving
institution
suffer
hundred
of
billion
of
dollar
in
withdrawal
during
a
short
period
because
u
s
interest
rate
be
at
historic
high
life
insurance
company
suffer
less
but
still
severely
through
policyholder
cash
in
their
policy
or
borrowing
on
them
the
life
insurance
company
have
net
withdrawal
of
billion
during
the
period
this
result
in
a
large
miss
investment
opportunity
for
these
institution
during
the
same
period
tiaa
increase
its
total
investment
commitment
by
billion
to
take
advantage
of
the
high
prevail
interest
rate
during
the
follow
spectacular
drop

concurrent
with
the
drop
in

of
the
early

tiaa

at

the

because
it

not

we

the
certainty
of
that

that
really
matter

its

the
insurance
examiner
be
underwhelmed

the
cogency
of
that
argument

require
a
writedown

the
fact
be
that
earnings
on

individual
i
wish
to
express

its
number
one
obligation

and
protection
of
the
retirement
resource
of
all
the

the
follow
proposition

so

should

its
statement
of
investment
judgment
in
my
letter
to
loomis
and
to
kohl
i
use
three
example
of
why
effort
to
establish
particular
investment
restriction
should
be
avoid
the
first
example
be
the
restrictive
state
law
limit
investment
of
life
insurance
company
well
intentioned
law
but
one
that
make
invest
of
pension
fund
like
tiaa
less
effective
for
participant
these
law
make
the
creation
of
cref
far
more
difficult
this
illustrate
the
problem
that
restriction
design
for
particular
situation
pension
system
college
endowment
church
endow
ments
mutual
fund
frequently
do
not
fit
outside
their
particular
structure
the
second
problem
be
one
of
definition
and
action
social
criterion
to
one
group
mean
not
invest
in
the
large
defense
contractor
to
another
avoid
any
company
operating
in
south
africa
to
another
it
mean
invest
substantial
sum
in
subsidize
housing
to
another
avoidance
of
any
company
that
contributes
to
air
water
and
land
pollution
to
yet
another
avoidance
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
religion
sex
or
age
the
problem
of
sort
among
usually
worthy
and
strongly
felt
objective
would
become
impossible
and
much
of
the
american
economy
would
be
off
limit
for
invest
for
one
cause
or
another

the
third
example
be
the
change
in
the
nation
s
social
objective
over
time
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
tiaa
be
one
of
the
early
company
to
participate
vigorously
in
the
fha
and
va
single
family
and
multiple
dwell
home
loan
program
we
make
a
large
number
of
these
loan
they
seem
essential
in
order
to
house
our
return
serviceman
to
make
up
for
the
great
deficiency
in
home
building
that
occur
during
the
s
and
to
try
to
upgrade
the
living
condition
of
american
this
be
a
widely
applaud
social
goal
i
now
look
upon
our
sprawl
city
in
america
spread
out
in
suburban
community
endlessly
over
the
horizon
i
see
the
ribbon
of
concrete

asphalt
slash
their
way
through
these
community
spawn
their
trivia
of

neon
sign
hamburger
stand
and
a
proliferation
of
use
car
and

it
make
me
wonder
if
the
nation
s
social
objective
be
quite
as
clearly
define
as
they
seem
to
be
at
the
time
i
comment
that
tiaa
and
cref
s
major
goal
be
to
innovate
and
lead
social
development
toward
retirement
security
and
the
strengthen
of
high
education
and
finally
that
i
saw
no
conflict
between
social
objective
of
quality
high
education
and
good
pension
support
by
high
productivity
fiduciarily
chosen
investment
the
exchange
of
correspondence
be
useful
and
lead
to
great
understand
and
support
for
tiaa
cref
policy
but
something
i
say
in
the
long
letter
to
dr

worried
dr
joseph
t
sneed
a
cref
trustee

conservative
law
professor
at

i
use
the
term
social
productivity
and
perhaps
it
be
not
helpful
dr

conclude
i
be
be
inconsistent
in
claim
tiaa

i

deeply
resent
the
use
of
my

for
any
other
purpose
and
another
i
strongly
oppose

than

factor
lay

these

in

i
do
not

a

at
that
time
of
about
a

that
provision

later
to

it
be
unusual
for
a
pension
funding
agency
to
support
the
extension
of
social
security
one
of
the
argument
use
by
the
college
be
that
they
be
happy
with
their
exist
retirement
provision
through
tiaa
and
do
not
need
or
want
social

this
be
please
of
course
but
tiaa
believe
it
overlook
an
opportunity
for
the
college
so
part
of
tiaa

effort
be
to
show
how
college
could
meet

or

a

leader
be
make
some
of
the
most
misguide
suggestion
for
social

that
have
ever
be
make
in
its
long
and
remarkably
successful
history
only
the
tersest
comment
will
be
make
here
one
misguide
idea
be
that
oasdi
benefit
should
be
paid
only
upon
meeting
a
need
test
this
would
penalize
the
thrifty
wreak
havoc
with
the
hard
won
security
of
all
low
income
and
middle
class
work
american
and
destroy
the
effective
partnership
between
governmental
social
security
benefit
and
private
benefit
plan
just
for
starter
this
be
a
very
bad
idea
it
probably
would
lead
to
far
high
contribution
from
college
and
individual
to
tiaa
cref
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
oasdi
benefit
but
this
be
not
the
way
to
go
another
be
that
social
security
benefit
should
be
fully
taxed
this
idea
be
half
right
under
present
law
only
half
of
the
oasdi
benefit
receive
be
include
in
taxable
income
and
i
believe
this
be
how
it
should
be
the
employee
s
contribution
to
oasdi
already
have
be
taxed
during
work
year
and
should
not
be
taxed
again
the
present
taxation
of
half
the
benefit
as
come
from
employer
contribution
be
arbitrary
but
reasonable
however
oasdi
benefit
should
be
include
in
taxable
income
without
the
high
threshold
limit
for
single
person
and
for
married
person
filing
joint
return
this
would
not
hurt
the
poor
and
it
would
eliminate
a
special
unfair
discrimination
for
social
security
income
as
against
income
from
earnings
or
saving
the
retirement
earnings
test
should
be
gradually
restrengthen
american
who
continue
to
work
should
not
just
because
they
be
over
age
receive
additional
income
transfer
from
young
worker
the
annual
exclusion
amount
should
be

at
its

regardless
of

but
age
as

would
be
a
reasonable
compromise
many

do
not

its
first

to
conduct

the

the

a

to
put
those

they
be
about
what
one

of

would
have
accomplish
at

a
notable

actually
my

upon

you

that
question
capture
the

the

we

that

the

definitely
do

occasionally
we

while
age
discrimination
can
be
compare
with

discrimination
in
the
instance
of

the
age
discrimination
argument
fails
because
pension
fund
obviously
cannot
pay
the
same
monthly
benefit
to
a
similarly
situate
person
at
age
as
they
can
at
other
factor
in

rate

the
powerful
effect

earnings

the
small
factor
of
expense
one
argument
press
by
the
advocate
of
equal

be
that
pension
plan
do
not
make

factor
know
to
affect
longevity
for
example
smoking
drinking
and
eat
too
much
the
answer
give
be
that
these
voluntary
and

factor

unreliable
and
therefore
inappropriate
to
use
in

advocate
of

press
hard
on
the
claim
that

discriminate
against
black

not
give
them
large

their

data
show
that
life
span

indeed

that
be
mostly
account

by
the

poorer
medical
care
during

generally
poorer

in

at

live

one
of
the
first
challenge
be
to
the

table
why
be
it
that
female
longevity
from

be
about
the

but
it
have
increase
dramatically
more
than
that
of

by
mid

a
specific
factor
be
responsible
the
remarkable
decrease
of

in

during
the
first
half
of
the

but
this
be
not
relevant
to
the

year
the
next
question

do

woman

the
stress

have
the

be

that
some

therefore
they

discriminate

that
the

unequivocally
prove
that

the
only
fair

comprehensive
way
to
meet

be
through

perhaps
it

enthusiasm

the

such

should
be
provide
for

i
do
have
one
fundamental
reservation
i
take
major
exception

the

that
the

as

whether
to
allow

distribution

transfer
of

as
well
as
new

should
be
return
to

i
believe
this
to
be
a
systemwide
decision
in
a
multi
employer
arrangement
such
as
tiaa
cref
not
one
to

it
would

a
calamity

from

make
decision
that
should
be
make

i
comment
it
be
fun
to
beat

over
the

for
their
paternalism

the

well

it
be
an
essential
ingredient
of
true
portability
once
the
genie
of

transferability
of

out
