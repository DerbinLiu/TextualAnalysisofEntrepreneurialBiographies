so
bad
that
they
tore
it
down
to
build
a
slum
it
be
the
only
home
i
knew
of

fun
just
ourselves
and
our
mind
my
mother
be
the
matriarch
and
peacemaker
of
the
family
she
be
such
a
positive
human
be
that
it
be
difficult
to
depress
her
spirit
she
could
find
the
bright
side
of
any
situation
even
death
mother
be
a
great
optimist
she
often
use
the
jewish
word
b
sheirt
which
mean
it
be
destine
to
be
and
to
her
everything
that
be
destine
to
be
be
always
very
positive
in
other
word
even
if
somebody
die
she
would
find
a
good
reason
they
didn
t
suffer
or
the
family
didn
t
suffer
she
could
make
anything
into
a
positive
my
mom
taught
me
most
of
the
belief
i
posse
today
especially
that
you
have
only
so
much
physical
and
mental
energy
don
t
spend
time
replay
the
past
it
only
keep
you
from
focus
on
the
future
don
t
spend
time
on
thing
in
which
you
can
t
make
a
difference
she
also
taught
me
that
the
way
you
handle
and
deal
with
life
s
setback
creates
the
basis
for
what
you
ll
accomplish
in
the
future
i
often
think
of
willy
loman
the
central
character
in
arthur
miller

great
play
death
of
a
salesman
willy

clearly
behind
him
if
he
want
to
keep
his
job
he
need
to
change
instead
he
blame
everyone
but
himself
for
his
failure
my
mom
be
just
the
opposite
always
look
on
the
bright
side
a
very
very
bright
woman
my
mother
have
enough
wisdom
to
qualify
her
to
teach
at
our
best
business
school
she
be
bedridden
in
her
mid
forty
cripple
with
rheumatoid
arthritis
she
couldn
t
walk
when
my
sister
bea
be
eight
year
old
mother
s
doctor
told
her
that
the
only
hope
she

would
be
if
she
have
another
baby
believe
it
or
not
i
be
conceive
for
medical
reason
even
well
after
give
birth
to
me
on
mother
s
day
no
less
she
be
able
to
walk
again
her
hand
and
foot
be
still
hopelessly
gnarl
but
she
be
able
to
walk
to
her
i
be
a
blessing
she
love
me
so
because
i
literally
save
her

although
in
unrelenting
pain

function
for
some
thirty
year
after
my
birth
and
have
an
immense
influence
on
my
life
my
father
be
a
cabinetmaker
he
be
strong
as
an
ox
a
great
craftsman
but
a
terrible
businessman
he
work
day
and
night
seven

a
week
fifteen
hour
a
day
and
still
couldn
t
make
end
meet
for
his
wife
and
four
child
without
the
contribution
of
my
two
grown
brother
irving
and
seymour
the
family
would
never
have
survive
as
poor
as
we
be
my
mother
use
to
take
ice
cream
money
away
from
my
brother
and
sister
and
me
often
against
our
will
and
give
it
to
charity
her
sincere
belief
be
that
the
more
you
give
the
more
you
get
how
right
she
be
we
live
in
a
predominantly
black
neighborhood
which
make
me
a
target
if
for
no
other
reason
than
i
stood
out
in
any
crowd
black
gang
kid
use
to
challenge
me
to
fight
every
day
after
school
and
whip
me
badly
but
somewhat
fearless
somewhat
stupid
i
always
come
back
for
more
finally
the
leader
of
one
gang
be
so
impressed
with
my
ability
to
take
what
he
be
dish
out
that
he
want
me
as
part
of
the
gang
at
year
old
i
not
only
ran
with
this
gang
of
thirty
black
kid
but
i
become
its
second
in
command
then
when
i
be
about
we
move
away
from
that
neighborhood
which
be
get
too
rough
for
our
family
my
family
be
always
in
tough
shape
financially
so
i
start
work
from
the
age
of
my
first
job
be
as
a
soda
jerk
after
school
during
summer
vacation
in
high
school
i
earn
money
for
college
as
a
busboy
in
the
catskill
mountain
you
could
accumulate
a
significant
in
those
day
amount
of
money
if
you
be
frugal
because
the
job
include
room
and
board
and
the
tip
be
all
yours
from
an
early
age
i
have
a
propensity
for
medicine
especially
psychiatry
i
be
particularly
interested
in
study
the
mind
i
spent
hour
reading
the
work
of
freud
and
jung
and
become
determine
at
the
age
of
that
i
would
become
a
psychiatrist
during
this
time
i
learn
the
art
of
hypnosis
when
i
be
a
waiter
at
kutsher
s
country
club
i
become
proficient
enough
that
i
be
able
to
perform
on
stage
i
would
put
somebody
into
a
hypnotic
state
take
them
back
in
year
but
i
never
make
a
fool
out
of
anybody
i
help
people
with
memory
problem
find
something
they
lose
in
fact
i
do
one
of
the
original
stop
smoking
routine
it
be
a
very
excite
period
in
my
life
i
hypnotize
as
many
as
ten
people
at
a
time
it
be
here
as
i
get
into
people
s
mind
that
i
begin
to
understand
how
some
folk
become
obstacle
for
others
i
recognize
then
that
my
call
be
in
medicine
and
specifically
psychiatry
i
register
for
premed
study
at
rutgers
college
in
newark
which
allow
me
to
save
money
by
living
at
home
after
my
second
year
i
sought
a
med
school
scholarship
one
day
the
dean
with
whom
i
have
become
friendly
call
me
he
have
arrange
a
scholarship
for
me
to
attend
harvard
medical
school
i
be
very
excite
then
he
say
to
me
i
will
give
you
the
address
where
you
have
to
send
a
check
and
i
just
look
at
him
in
disbelief
he
explain
that
there
be
a
quota
on
how
many
jew
harvard
would
willingly
accept
into
medical
school
the
be
some
kind
pf
kickback
i
never
personally
spoke
to
anyone
from
harvard
but
i
be
told
there
be
an
unwritten
quota
system
regard
how
many
jewish
student
could
be
accepted
into
various
graduate
school
medical
include
but
if
my
family
could
come
up
with
a
contribution
i
could
probably
circumvent
the
quota
well
my
entire
family
parent
aunt
uncle
and
cousin
have
never
see
that
kind
of
money
let
alone
possess
it
so
my
dream
be
quashed
like
a
tenpenny
nail
be
hit
by
a
sledgehammer
in
total
frustration
i
quit
school
the
next
day
packed
my
suitcase
and
hitchhike
down
to
florida
where
i
stayed
for
a
year
i
be
so
despondent
because
i
couldn
t
be
a
doctor
after
i
d
have
a
year
of
real
life
learn
experience
and
total
independence
my
mother
prevail
on
me
to
finish
my
education
all
good
jewish
mother
feel
their
child
need
a
college
degree
so
i
go
home
i
go
back
to
rutgers
and
enrol
in
pharmacy
school
which
be
far
from
my
heart
s
first
choice
i
be
very
young
during
world
war
ii
but
it
and
the
news
of
the
holocaust
in
particular
have
a
sober
effect
on
me
it
dawn
on
me
that
folk
like
myself
be
massacre
for
no
other
reason
than
be
born
jewish
if
not
for
the
courage
of
my
parent
give
up
everything
they
knew
to
come
to
this
wonderful
land
i
might
have
perish
in
hitler
s
death
camp
so
at
an
early
age
survival
of
the
jewish
race
and
religion
become
very
important
to
me
synagogue
and
living
our
life
accord
to
the
scripture
be
very
important
and
have
a
special
meaning
to
my
parent
and
through
their
eye
to
me
they
have
a
strong
belief
in
god
and
they
instill
that
in
me
i
be
very
religious
myself
although
i
have
a
problem
i
didn
t
understand
hebrew
it
be
difficult
for
me
to
pray
to
god
in
a
language
that
i
didn
t
understand
i
do
the
chant
and
i
do
the
word
but
i
didn
t
understand
it
and
as
an
adult
i
kind
of
back
off
on
orthodoxy
but
i
never
back
off
on
be
a
jew
i
understand
the
frustration
that
black
face
in
america
year
ago
jew
suffer
the
same
obstacle
large
corporation
bank
and
industry
be
devoid
of
jew
in
position
of
authority
we
couldn
t
belong
to
exclusive
club
or
high
society
so
we
have
to
work
harder
and
smarter
to
succeed
there
be
great
jealousy
of
the
accomplishment
of
jew
in
america
but
we
fought
for
our
share
i
believe
that
the
value
of
our
religion
be
critical
i
think
it
have
taught
me
value
and
what
i
have
always
understood
be
that
the
human
be
be
his
own
temple
that
if
you
feel
good
about
yourself
and
share
your
good
fortune
with
others
who
be
not
so
fortunate
that
you
be
do
the
work
of
god
begin
with
my
mother
s
encouragement
i
have
try
to
conduct
myself
in
this
manner
when
i
finish
pharmacy
school
in
intern
for
a
year
before

full
of
stress

be
now
so
my
father
spent
a
lot
of
time
talk
to
people
about
their
health
give
them
advice
it
s
somewhat
ironic
that
my
partner
bernie
have
a
ground
and
experience
as
a
pharmacist
when
my
father
work
for
his
brother
it
be
only
a
couple
of
block
from
where
we
live
mother
would
make
his
lunch
or
dinner
and
i
would
take
it
to
him
at
the
drugstore
i
would
sit
there
and
watch
while
he
mixed
prescription
the
way
pharmacist
really
use
to
do
it
and
he
talk
to
me
between
customer
and
sneak
a
bite
of
food
i
remember
how
hard
he
work
when
he
start
his
own
business
sherry
pharmaceutical
a
mail
order
pharmaceutical
company
sell
direct
to
hospital
doctor
and
nursing
home
across
the
country
at
night
he
would
come
home
and
be
on
the
phone
for
hour
do
deal
one
of
the
great
loss
in
my
life
happen
when
my
father
die
in
of
a
heart
attack
he
be
just
and
i
be
my
uncle
also
die
of
a
heart
attack
sometime
later
my
brother
michael
who
be
two
and
a
half
year
old
than
i
be
be
always
convince
that
he
would
never
live
past
really
he
just
knew
that
he
be
go
to
die
because
dad
die
so
young
today
michael
be
and
still
in
good
health
i
never
have
that
fear
i
have
always
push
myself
hard
but
it
be
never
because
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
live
a
long
life
i
do
however
think
one
of
the
reason
i
have
have
an
extreme
emphasis
on
health
and
exercise
in
my
life
be
my
father
s
death
in
the
mid
s
a
doctor
at
the
scripps
clinic
in
san
diego
warn
me
against
smoking
you
have
one
big
strike
against
you
he
say
your
father
s
heart
condition
that
have
a
big
effect
on
me
on
the
plane
ride
home
i
read
kenneth
cooper
s
first
book
aerobics
all
about
run
and
stay
in
shape
when
i
get
home
i
ran
a
mile
cooper
have
a
test
in
which
your
physical
fitness
start
point
be
run
as
far
as
you
could
in
twelve
minute
i
be
able
to
run
a
mile
in
twelve
minute
which
today
be
ridiculously
slow
then
it
be
a
major
accomplishment
the
next
day
i
do
it
again
pretty
soon
i
be
run
a
mile
or
two
every
morning
people
would
see
me
out
run
this
be
before
it
become
a
national
obsession
and
they
would
say
what
be
you
do
what
be
that
about
it
be
such
a
strange
thing
to
do
then
so
i
think
my
father
s
death
affected
me
in
a
lot
of
way
maybe
at
some
level
deep
down
inside
have
always
have
a
sense
of
urgency
about
get
thing
do
and
accomplish
thing
and
move
on
with
thing
and
maybe
some
of
that
have
come
from
him
but
i
never
consciously
have
a
fear
of
die
at
an
unusually
young
age
in
fact
i
be
probably
in
well
condition
and
fitter
than
most
men
half
my
age
one
of
the
great
loss
that
i
feel
i
have
be
that
i
never
really
knew
my
father
as
an
adult
there
have
be
time
when
i
have
be
under
stress
and
i
take
great
comfort
in
recall
childhood
conversation
with
my
father
and
imagine
how
we
would
discus
the
current
issue
in
my
life
when
you
see
a
person
through
your
eye
at
age
and
that
be
the
end
of
the
relationship
you
don
t
really
know
him
as
an
adult
would
know
him
and
as
i
have
go
through
the
growth
in
life
my
first
marriage
to
diana
our
three
child
kenny
dena
and
danielle
all
the
business
situation
building
the
home
depot
in
the
last
twenty
year
my
second
marriage
to
stephanie
and
our
son
joshua
i
wish
my
father
could
have
be
there
through
it
all
my
mother
molly
be
a
young
woman
when
my
father
die
how
much
his
death
affected
her
nobody
will
ever
really
know
for
sure
but
i
think
it
be
probably
great
than
any
of
us
ever
suspect
not
only
because
she
have
to
go
into
his
business
and
run
it
with
no
experience
but
because
it
be
really
a
small
business
then
that
she
built
from
the
ground
up
if
she
have
try
to
sell
it
right
after
my
father
die
it
wouldn
t
have
be
worth
very
much
she
be
concerned
because
she
have
to
put
two
son
through
college
both
in
expensive
private
school
the
issue
of
be
able
to
support
us
be
paramount
for
her
my
father
do
not
have
a
lot
of
life
insurance
the
life
insurance
that
he
have
be
in
dispute
because
he
have
take
it
out
only
a
year
or
so
prior
to
his
heart
attack
there
be
question
of
whether
or
not
he
have
make
a
full
disclosure
about
his
health
so
mother
become
the
breadwinner
try
to
as
she
put
it
be
a
mother
and
a
father
to
two
son
of
course
there
be
no
way
that
a
mother
can
be
a
father
to
boy
anyway
the
pressure
our
situation
exert
upon
her
be
enormous
and
it
take
a
lot
out
of
her
over
the
year
my
father
s
death
affected
her
not
only
because
she
lose
her
husband
but
because
it
put
much
more
stress
on
her
and
make
her
life
a
lot
more
difficult
in
many
many
way
it
change
my
relationship
with
my
mother
who
be
a
very
remarkable
woman
she
be
a
very
bright
lady
a
principled
person
a
perfectionist
with
strong
social
liberal
leaning
iviy
mother
who
really
have
no
business
experience
go
into
the
business
and
ran
it
as
best
she
could
and
she
do
a
very
good
job
i
have
always
be
athletically
inclined
today
i
run
marathon
back
in
high
school
i
be
a
baseball
and
football
player
as
well
as
run
track
be
competitive
have
always
be
at
the
core
of
my
nature
although
it
didn
t
kick
in
with
regard
to
academic
until
i
get
to
college
in
high
school
sport
be
my
consume
passion
i
do
okay
in
school
in
term
of
academic
but
mention
sport
and
my
attention
be
truly
rivet
in
baseball
i
start
off
as
a
centerfielder
but
i
eventually
threw
my
arm
out
and
couldn
t
make
any
long
throw
so
i
become
a
catcher
a
position
that
suit
me
because
i
be
in
the
middle
of
almost
every
play
i
apparently
get
my
athleticism
from
my
father
he
go
to
columbia
university
where
he
set
thcn
new
york
city
record
for
both
the
mile
and
the
yard
dash
an
unlikely
feat
today
because
athlete
tend
to
specialize
in
distance
or
sprint
race
when
i
start
at
babson
college
a
small
business
school
just
outside
of
boston
i
take
school
seriously
for
the
first
time
and
there
s
nothing
like
apply
yourself
i
be
elect
vice
president
of
my
junior
class
president
of
the
senior
class
do
everything
in
school
that
you
could
possibly
do
plus
i
be
a
straight
a
student
and
make
the
dean
s
list
one
of
the
way
i
paid
for
my
college
education
be
run
my
own
landscape
business
freed
from
the
confines
of
city
life
i
discover
a
love
of
be
outside
i
ran
my
own
laundry
business
as
well
pick
up
laundry
on
campus
several
night
a
week
my
brother
michael
earn
a
degree
in
pharmacy
from
the
university
of
michigan
on
paper
our
skill
sound
like
the
perfect
combination
for
take
over
the
family
business
and
finally
relieve
our
mother
of
the
pressure
cause
by
dad
s
premature
death
michael
would
be
more
on
the
technical
side
i
would
handle
the
business
side
but
after
graduate
with
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
in
accounting
in
i
postpone
join
the
family
business
a
while
longer
and
take
a
job
with
the
big
eight
accounting
firm
of
arthur
young
company
i
be
the
young
staff
person
they
ever
recruit
in
new
york
city
and
i
stayed
for
almost
five
year
some
of
the
work
i
do
at
arthur
young
be
in
management
consult
i
be
year
old
when
i
start
so
i
be
never
the
senior
person
on
major
assignment
but
do
do
some
consult
as
well
as
staff
accounting
i
enjoy
that
and
i
be
very
good
at
what
i
do
it
be
important
for
me
to
get
some
outside
experience
in
the
business
world
so
i
could
eventually
bring
a
great
expertise
to
our
own
company
i
be
on
the
verge
of
become
an
audit
manager
in
when
i
chose
to
join
the
family
business
instead
the
company
have
be
grow
and
do
well
and
my
mother
and
brother
be
anxious
to
have
me
finally
take
my
place
beside
them
one
of
my
father
s
brother
be
involve
with
it
as
be
a
cousin
it
truly
be
a
family
business
it
be
very
different
than
what
i
have
expect
after
all
those
year
i
be
prepared
to
roll
up
my
sleeve
and
do
what
it
take
for
the
business
to
be
successful
and
i
understood
the
responsibility
that
i
would
have
then
would
be
very
different
than
what
i
have
at
arthur
young
and
they
certainly
be
the
environment
certainly
be
very
different
but
that
be
okay
with
me
and
i
enjoy
my
work
when
i
be
there
i
work
very
hard
very
long
hour
but
it
be
not
a
growth
situation
from
a
professional
standpoint
it
be
hard
for
me
to
work
with
my
brother
and
my
mother
i
love
them
both
very
much
but
it
be
impossible
i
spent
a
couple
of
year
work
there
and
then
my
mother
sell
the
business
to
the
daylin
corporation
on
june
when
my
father
die
in
it
be
a
very
small
business
by
the
time
she
sell
it
my
mother
have
built
the
company
up
to
several
million
dollar
in
volume
daylin
be
a
conglomerate
center
in
the
retail
business
with
an
emphasis
in
pharmacy
and
health
good
if
you
have
a
family
where
family
member
can
work
together
that
be
wonderful
but
it
doesn
t
often
happen
and
it
didn
t
happen
in
our
situation
i
love
my
mother
i
love
my
brother
but
we
be
not
meant
to
work
together
every
day
and
i
think
mother
finally
saw
that
too
i
think
sell
the
company
be
the
right
decision
for
her
as
a
widow
and
mother
her
primary
interest
be
not
building
a
huge
business
but
conserve
its
equity
and
resource
she
be
too
concerned
about
her
own
future
at
that
time
to
think
in
term
of
risk
and
expansion
when
daylin
take
over
we
all
stayed
with
the
business
for
a
while
longer
but
i
really
didn
t
feel
that
stay
in
that
business
be
what
i
want
to
do
long
term
it
be
still
hard
for
me
to
work
with
my
mother
fortunately
daylin
be
a
company
of
infinite
opportunity
h
in
daylin
name
me
chief
financial
officer
of

two

later
i
become

of

and
my

very
supportive
during
my
career
there
when
i
become

of
the
division
it
be
kind
of
a
shock
to
the
rest
of
the
daylin
organization
because
i
be
a
very
young
man
in

way
and
that
be
how
you
grow
we
be
two
different
people
who
fit
together
symbiotically
handy

that

a

percent
of
their
wholly

such
as
handy
dan
to
the

the

kept

on
the
belief
that
the
public
would
unlock
value
in
the
asset
create
a
high
value
so
that
the
percent
would
be
worth
much
more
than
if
it
be
completely
private

the

to

a
fascinate

at
at

three
of

percent

on

a

for
two
of
the
three
company
that
have
repurchase
their

be
there
any
common
theme
in
why
this
be
be
do
langone
ask
why
be
this
stock
be
reacquired
the
economics
didn
t
work
the
lawyer
say
and
the
hold
company
didn
t
realize
as
much
value
as
they
anticipate
in
many
case
instead
of
asset
value
rise
the
exact
opposite
occur
the
publicly
held
share
plummet
in
value
handy

for
example
go
public
at
and
drop
as
low
as
at
one
point
well
that
and
one
other
thing
the
lawyer
say
what
be
that
this
structure
be
a
time
bomb
the
lawyer
say
we
believe
theoretically
at
least
that
if
somebody
be
to
get
control
of
the
percent
minority
the
only
way
the
person
who
held
the
percent
could
really
exercise
their
fiduciary
responsibility
to
the
minority
would
be
to
vote
it
in
direct
proportion
to
the
way
the
minority
vote
on
any
issue
langone
be
thunderstruck
not
speechless
of
course
just
thunderstruck
you
mean
langone
ask
that
if
percent
or
percent
of
the
percent
say
they
want
to
do
something
the
only
way
that
the
percent
owner
could
sanitize
their
vote
would
be
to
vote
directly
proportionate
to
the
minority
do
this
mean
that
the
motion
would
carry
which
mean
that
the
minority
control
the
company
yes
the
lawyer
say
it
seem
convolute
but
consider
fiduciary
duty
that
be
the
only
way
the
majority
owner
can
say
hey
i
didn
t
shout
i
didn
t
force
my
will
on
anybody
i
think
that
be
a
stretch
okay
but
it
will
probably
work
langone
who
control
virtually
all
of
the
percent
of
handy
dan
public
share
waste
little
time
in
call
sigoloff
and
ask
for
a
meeting
daylin
be
out
of
bankruptcy
protection
by
then
and
back
to
business
as
usual
a
few
day
later
in
california
the
two
men
shook
hand
and
sigoloff
completely
in
the
dark
ask
what
s
up
well
sandy
langone
say
i
just
want
to
see
how
you
and
i
be
go
to
run
this
company
go
forward
the
gauntlet
be
thrown
down
the
line
drawn
in
the
sand
insert
your
own
adversarial
cliche
any
will
do
what
do
you
mean
wf
sigoloff
erupt
sandy
there
be
a
body
of
thought
and
langone
fill
sigoloff
in
on
what
the
attorney
told
him
this
be
why
these
other
company
be
all
buying
their
share
back
because
there
be
a
potential
time
bomb
here
i
don
t
want
to
have
any
trouble
with
you
i
think
what
you
and
i
ought
to
do
be
to
stay
in
constant
contact
and
communicate
with
one
another
the
thing
we
want
to
do
with
the
company
to
the
best
interest
of
everybody
a
major
control
freak
who
have
no
intention
of
cede
a
whit
of
influence
to
langone
me
or
anyone
else
sigoloff
be
furious
i
don
t
believe
that
it
s
crazy
this
be
stupid
sigoloff
say
i
never
heard
of

dumb
in
my
whole
life

his
most
conciliatory
tone
and
keep
as
straight
a
face
as
possible
i
just
hope
it
doesn
t
get
to
the
point
where
one
day
we
have
to
test
it
that
day
come
sooner
rather
than
later
a
month

on
the
spot
i
call
ed
kaufman
a
daylin
lawyer
at
home
i
told
him
that

else
do
include
the
board
of
director
there
be
basically
two
kind
of
banking
relationship
transaction
banking
and
relationship
banking
rip
believe
that
relationship
banking
be
the
only
way
to
go
just
as
we
believe
that
we
could
succeed
in
retail
only
by
building
personal
relationship
with
our
customer
he
sought
banking
relationship
that
would
continue
for
year
encourage
close
relationship
between
the
officer
of
the
company
and
the
bank
in
that
way
the
banker
expect
to
be
first
to
learn
the
good
as
well
as
the
bad
news
sigoloff
vehemently
object
to
the
nature
of
our
relationship
with
rip
he
thought
we
be
too
open
with
rip
with
whom
we
share
everything
good
bad
and
ugly
i
even
share
otherwise
confidential
information
about
handy
dan
with
rip
he
be
a
great
supporter
of
ours
he
would
meet
with
anybody
on
our
behalf
sometimes
put
his
own
reputation
on
the
line
to
protect
the
handy
dan
company
sigoloff
couldn
t
believe
the
way
we
treat
rip
our
relationship
with
rip
drove
him
crazy
he
hat
it
especially
when
we
would
be
discuss
a
sensitive
issue
and
i
would
say
well
i
spoke
to
rip
about
it
and
sigoloff
would
interrupt
and
say
what
do
you
mean
you
spoke
to
rip
what
be
you
talk
about
and
i
would
say
well
rip
already
know
about
this
why
do
you
do
that
sigoloff
would
say
frustrate
again
sigoloff
told
me
how
he
have
manipulate
banker
all
of
his
life
he
say
they
don
t
know
what
the
hell
they
be
do
as
contemptuous
as
he
be
of
banker
sigoloff
still
need
their
money
to
run
his
business
his
oft
state
philosophy
be
keep
bank
in
the
dark
and
feed
them
crap
like
mushroom
his
mo
be
bury
them
in
paper
and
it
wasn
t
just
bank
it
be
anybody
in
fact
he
put
people
on
his
payroll
whose
primary
job
seem
to
be
generate
those
kind
of
document
sigoloff
s
approach
be
to
hit
the
bank
with
so
many
fact
so
many
chart
that
no
human
be
could
ever
go
through
it
all
and
before
that
confuse
them
then
when
you
confuse
them
he
d
say
you
ll
end
up
with
somebody
who
you
can
do
anything
you
want
with
this
be
how
sigoloff
want
us
to
treat
handy
dan
s
banker
but
we
refuse
in
fact
it
be
the
begin
of
our
practice
of
do
everything
the
opposite
of
the
way
sigoloff
operate
sigoloff
want
to
become
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
handy
dan
but
rip
base
on
covenant
in
loan
agreement
guarantee
separation
between
daylin
and
handy
dan
told
sigoloff
that
it
wasn
t
go
to
happen
sandy
you
be
entitle
to
board
representation
on
handy
dan
rip
told
him
but
you
will
not
be
its
chairman
control
of
handy
dan
wasn
t
the
issue
for
sigoloff
what
he
really
want
be
credit
for
turn
daylin
around
save
it
from
the
creditor
save
it
for
the
shareholder
save
it
from
bankruptcy
but
the
only
daylin
division
that
have
a
great
cash
flow
be
handy
dan
my
division
as
langone
have
forecast
when
public
ownership
disappear
so
too
go
the
ability
to
shield
ourselves
from
sigoloff
s
dark
shadow
the
day
i
knew
i
be
finish

daylin
board
of
director
discuss

sigoloff
appoint
board
member
say
i
don
t
know
why
there
be
any
question
about
succession
here
since
you
have
your
obvious
successor
right
in
this
room
bernie
marcus
by
that
time
i
have
be
promote

the
board
and
ceo
of
flandy
dan
in
addition
to
carry
the
title
of

a
quick
glance
at
sigoloff
s
ashen
face
told
me
that
that
be
never
go
to
happen
and
the
very
notion
that
some
on
the
board
support
the
idea
make
me
a
genuine
threat
to
sigoloff
the

high
profile
job
or
a
few
embarrass
newspaper

primarily
after

family
and
friend

make
a
little
joke

make
you
pile
of

no
arthur
told
her
it
really
happen
we
have
never
discuss
the
actual
charge
sigoloff
make
against
us
but
for
the
record
here
be
what
happen
we
have
be
involve
in
a
decertification
battle
with
a
handy
dan
labor
union
in
san
jose
california
the
only
unionized
store
in
the
chain
incidentally
a
group
of
employee
have
come
to
us
and
say
they
want
to
decertify
out
of
the
union
we
hire
an
attorney
who
told
us
what
we
could
and
could
not
do
during
the
decertification
proceeding
i
direct
our
personnel
department
to
do
whatever
fell
within
the
legal
guideline
what
we
eventually
learn
be
that
action
be
take
that
apparently
violate
some
national
labor
relation
board
rule
none
of
us
knew
about
these
suppose
nlrb
violation
until
some
time
after
sigoloff
fire
us
anybody
who
knew
the
fact
behind
it
include
ron
brill
also
have
to
go
as
director
of
internal
audit
ron
knew
the
cost
of
the
decertification
proceeding
but
he
didn
t
think
that
what
we
be
do
be
illegal
and
ultimately
neither
do
anybody
else
but
for
nearly
four
year
sigoloff
make
our
life
miserable
and
cost
us
a
fortune
in
legal
defense
fee
incredibly
neither
the
justice
department
nor
the
sec
instigate
investigation
sigoloff
through
his
attorney
do
he
make
accusation
to
the
justice
department
he
go
to
the
security
and
exchange
commission
his
attorney
inform
the
justice
department
of
their
accusation
and
explain
that
that
be
why
we
be
fire
the
labor
decertification
proceeding
be
use
as
a
tool
to
eliminate
me
and
those
closest
to
me
these
effort
do
cause
us
emotional
and
financial
harm
but
the
issue
remain
strictly
personal
the
material
and
information
about
the
circumstance
regard
the
decertification
that
be
turn
over
to
the
justice
department
and
the
security
and
exchange
commission
be
carefully
re
view
and
consider
despite
all
of
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
justice
and
the
sec
to
act
against
us
not
one
charge
be
ever
make
against
arthur
ron
or
me
by
any
government
agency
ironically
the
only
official
proceed
that
come
out
of
the
entire
decertification
labor
case
be
that
a
formal
complaint
charge
unfair
labor
practice
be
issue
by
the
nlrb
against
the
union
it
cost
us
each
a
small
fortune
to
hire
lawyer
to
defend
ourselves
and
we
be
hardly
well
paid
ron
for
example
be
only
paid
in
the
mid
range
none
of
us
own
stock
in
handy
dan
all
of
our
hard
work
and
innovation
seem
to
have
enrich
everyone
from
ken
langone
to
sandy
sigoloff
but
not
us
i
have
option
in
the
company
but
they
be
wipe
out
sigoloff
also
void
my
contract
dare
me
to
sue
the
only
problem
for
you
sigoloff
taunt
me
be
that
i

to
fight
me
with
your
own
money
which
you

right
traumatic

experience
at
handy

an
important
part

that
love
and
compassion

really
hamstrung
and
haven
t
be
able
to
do
a
lot
of
the
thing
you
want
to
do
and
it
be
pretty
clear
to
me
as
an
investment
banker
and
financier
that
you
have
a
lot
more
capacity
than
what

t
view
this
as
a
negative
bernie

continued

your
own
thing

another
handy
dan
store
in
houston
langone
flew
in
from

for
the
occasion
as
we
be
walk
the
store
langone
stop
short
and
ask
why
be
you
opening
so
many
store
in
houston
it
appear
that
you
already
have
a
store
on
every
major
street
corner
in
the
city
because
some
day
i
say
somebody
be
go
to
open
a
store
that
be
go
to
make
all
of
our
store
obsolete
what
do
you
mean
there
be
a
store
that
i
have
create
in
my
imagination
that
be
go
to
make
handy
dan
obsolete
what
will
it
look
like
if
i
tell
you
then
you
will
know
i
say
right
now
only
i
know
in
already
envision
the
prototype
of
the
home
depot
a
massive
store
unlike
anything
in
the
united
state
at
that
time
if
handy
dan

fifteen
store
in
houston
i
told
langone
three
of
my
new
store
would
make
these
obsolete
langone
couldn
t
imagine
it
well
i
be
not
go
to
tell
you
about
it
i
say
and
i
be
just
pray
that
no
one
else
think
of
it
i
won
t
share
it
with
anybody
else
not
yet
that
be
the
daydream
behind
the
home
depot
but
still
in
shock
after
be
fire
without
warn
i
be
not
in
a
mood
for
daydream
bernie
langone
say

repeatedly
told
me
how
handy

this
whole
industry
be
vulnerable
too
many
small
chain
no
national
company
and
price
be
too
high
do
you

s
you
and
i
meet

soon
as

number
twenty
five
million
at
that
langone

subject
drop
without
far
comment
and
say
good
bye
f

with
very
little
cash
on
hand
my
reputation

but
every
time

cost
an
hour
that

when

to
spend
more
time
with
him
in
san
diego
when
i
arrive
a
few
day
later

into
a
room
that

with

what
i
have

the
last
three
year

shook
my
head
in
awe

future
loom
before
my
eye

thought
about
be
the
lawsuit
the
attorney
be
suck
me
dry
he
say
in
the
final
analysis
even
if

lose
which
ultimately
be
what
happen
price
won
but
he
lose
all
the
energy
and
time
he
have
to
put
into
it
wasn
t
worth
it
he
drain
his
body
his
energy
his
thought
and
his
money
do
you
have

on
a
contingency
basis
no
bernie

say
sympathetically
put
his
hand
on

when
i
sell

company
i
go
right
out
and
start
the
price

have
the
money

we
be
able
to
do
that
and
sue
these
bastard
you
don
t
have
money
to
waste
he
pause
while
i
consider
that
bernie
do
you
think
you
be
talented
price
ask
yes
i
think
i
be
do
you
think
you
have
the
ability
to
build
something
to
create
something
do
you
feel
good
about
yourself
yeah
i
do
i
say
quickly
i
feel
all
those
thing
i
think
i
can
be
very
successful
then
why
don
t
you
just
tell
sigoloff
to
go
himself
and
get
on
with
your
life
pay
your
lawyer
what
you
owe
them
and
walk
away
from
it
i
drove
back
to
los
angeles
that
night
roll
over
and
over
in
my
mind
the
thing
i
saw
and
heard
by
the
time
i
get
home
i
realize
that
price
be
percent
right
it
be
time
to
get
on
with
my
life
arthur
be
not
happy
be
out
of
work
but
he
do
enjoy
the
time
it
give
him
to
spend
with
his
wife
and
young
child
while
he
consider
his
future
he
also
become
more
dedicate
to
his
fitness
use
the
time
to
train
for
and
run
his
first
marathon
his
friend
leon
beck
himself
late
of
daylin
suggest
they
open
a
cpa
practice
together
but
that
wasn
t
tlie
direction
arthur
saw
himself
go
he
also
decline
opportunity
to
run
the
wickes
and
handy
city
chain
of
home
improvement
store
which
be
later
somewhat
ironic
when
sigoloff
be
hire
to
turn
that
parent
corporation
around
too
and
there
be
the
grow
talk
of
a
new
challenge
the
home
improvement
store
of
the
future
i
have
langone
s
interest
in
raise
money
and
have
make
it
clear
i
couldn
t
even
think
of
go
forward
without
arthur
arthur
quickly
realize
that
win
or
lose
his
destiny
be
deeply
entwine
with
mine
we
met
several
time
a
week
first
at
the
old
hyatt
coffee
shop
in
the
city
of
commerce
a
point
halfway
between
our
home
arthur
s
in
fullerton
mine
in
encino
and
later
in
space
lent
to
us
by
our
attorney
buchalter
nemer
field
chrystie
young
stuart
buchalter
later
become
chairman
of
standard
brand
somewhat
of
a
competitor
start
with
a
clean
yellow
pad
of
paper
we
put
a
business
plan
together
i
dream
aloud
of
wide
open
ware
house
store
as
arthur
try
to
make
sense
of
the
number
it
be
an
interest
exercise
because
the
number
didn
t
work
our
vision
be
of
an
immense
warehouse
store
anywhere
from
to
square
foot
and
with
high
ceiling
the
big
handy
dan
store
be
just
square
foot
handy
dan
carry
a
small
assortment
of
selective
merchandise
the
best
seller
in
every
category
unlike
handy
dan
we
would
insist
on
buying
directly
from
the
manufacturer
manufacturer
would
send
merchandise
directly
to
our
store
cut
out
middleman
and
warehouse
so
we
could
give
their
profit
back
to
the
customer
in
price
reduction
per
store
volume
would
be
million
to
million
in
annual
sale
that
be
insane
at
a
time
when
the
best
handy
dan
store
average
million
we
imagine
gross
profit
margin
of
to
percent
that
too
be
unheard
of
prevalent
in
the
industry
at
that
time
be
margin
of
to
percent
to
make
payroll
traditional
store
need
high
margin
but
we
believe
that
high
volume
store
would
do
much
more
business
than
handy
dan
or
any
other
store
in
existence
in
those
day
because
of
the
low
price
at
which
we
would
sell
the
merchandise
we
would
have
immense
amount
of
merchandise
and
great
assortment
stack
to
the
ceiling
so
consumer
would
be
overwhelmed
when
they
walk
in
and
they
would
virtually
smell
a
bargain
finally
and
most
important
this
superstore
would
star
highly
train
people
on
the
sell
floor
who
could
not
only
move
product
but
help
even
the
least
mechanically
inclined
customer
through
most
any
home
repair
or
improvement
that
be
the
theory
behind
the
home
depot
in
my
mind
the
concept
be
simple
but
it
be
arthur
s
job
to
make
the
business
plan
work
on
paper
and
it
didn
t
it
just
didn
t
the
number
don
t
work
arthur
say
why
don
t
they
work
i
ask
the
margin
and
the
volume
don
t
support
the
profit
what
do
we
need
more
sale
okay
i
say
that
s
easy
let
s
write
in
more
sale
just
put
them
in
that
go
against
arthur
s
straightlaceci
financial
training
i
can
t
do
that
arthur
just
do
it
i
say
just
raise
the
sale
look
this
whole
thing
be
not
a
fact
it
s
a
product
of
my
imagination
a
business
plan
be
just
a
creation
just
raise
the
sale
what
do
you
need
a
million
two
million
dollar
put
it
in
because
if
you
don
t
do
it
i
will
arthur
didn
t
give
in
easily
but
he
do
give
in
stretch
the
number
only
as
far
as
he
could
go
without
feel
guilty
we
both
felt
good
about
the
concept
even
if
we
weren
t
exactly
sure
how
the
number
would
unfold
in
the
marketplace
we
even
form
an
operating
company
mb
associate
short
for
marcus
blank
it
be
something
to
do
while
we
wait
for
fate
to
find
us
the
financier
my
people
don
t
drive

a
couple
of

decision
over
the
next
several
month
ken

business
and
expand
their
personal
rapport
two
more
different
men
you
could
not
find
but
that
seem
a
common
denominator
in
most
of
ken
s
business
deal
early
in
their
discussion
perot
say
next
time
you
come
down
bring
all
the
prospectus
of
all
the
deal
you
have
do
uh
sure
at
the
end
of
their
next
meeting
perot
ask
do
you
bring
the
prospectus
with
you
no
ken

perot
be
surprised
ken
be
not

do
you
forget
them
no
why
didn
t
you
bring
them
ken
finally
fessed
up
because
there
be
none
you
be
it
what
yours
be
the
first
deal
i
be
go
to
do
perot
just
stood
there
slack
jawed
he
couldn
t
believe
what
he
be
hearing
bear
in
mind
one
thing
ross
ken
continued
you
have
such
a
great
company
nobody
can
screw
it
up
an
idiot
can
do
your
deal
if
i
blow
it
i
be
out
of
business
but
if
i
do
a
great
job
for
you
my
reputation
be
set
i
have
every
incentive
and
i
promise
you
i
will
personally
handle
this
deal
myself
after
time
perot
narrow
the
field
to
two
allen

public
number
one
it
didn

company
public
what
matter
be
the
person
who
actually
lead
the
deal
to
the
public
because
if
that
person
exert
a
lot
of
effort
and
influence
the
company
would
enjoy
a
successful
underwriting
if
that

didn
t
do
his
job
the
big

in

charlie

because
he
have
be
there
and
do
that
so
many
time
and
have
such
a
great
reputation
but
langone
be
the
guy
that
i
would
pick
why
for
one
thing
he
be
so
excite
about
this
he
can
hardly
stand
it
he
desperately
want

and
he
see

his
best
shot
in
june
perot
make
his
decision
he
call
ken
and
say
the
deal

catch
ken

to
agree
to
bring
ed
out
at
a
multiple
of
time
earnings
which
be
an
absolutely
outrageously
stretch
number
on
september
the
night
before
ed
go
public
ken
and
elaine
langone
and
ross
and
margot
perot
be
in
the
back
of
a
limousine
drive
through
the
holland
tunnel
from
new
york
to
new
jersey
the
time
be
midnight
in
those
day
you
would
actually
sign
all
the
paper
for
a
stock
offering
in
jersey
then
turn
around
and
come
right
back
so
you
didn
t
have
to
pay
the
new
york
state
transfer
tax
the
perots
be
in
the
backseat
look
forward
the
langones
opposite
them
look
backward
ross
i
have
something
to
tell
you
about
tomorrow
ken
say
we
won
t
be
bring
ed
out
at
time
earnings
after
all
i
knew
it
perot
say
point
his
finger
everybody
on
wall
street
told
me
that
you
will
say
you
will
do
the
stock
offering
at
time
earnings
and
at
the
last
minute
say
sorry
we
can
t
do
it
you
be
just
like
everybody
else
this
be
exactly
what
they
warn
me
be
go
to
happen
the
financier
ross
wait
a
minute
hold
it
ken
say
calmly
don
t
want
you
upset
if
that
s
what
you
want
we
will
do
it
at
time
earnings
well
a
deal
be
a
deal
you
say
time
fine
fine
we
will
do
it
at
time
earnings
just
then
margot
spoke
up
ken
what
be
you
go
to
say
a
minute
ago
just
that
instead
of
lime
earnings
i
be
go
to
do
it
at
a
share
time
earnings
ken
say
watch
perot
turn
from
a
slow
burn
to
a
big
red
face
laugh
but
if
he
only
want
time
then
that
be
okay
with
me
because
he
be
the
only
person
ken
langone
knew
with
million
to
spare
ross
perot
nearly
become
the
majority
owner
of
the
home
depot
and
this
be
probably
one
of
the
great
what
if
business
story
of
all
time
in
the
world
of
technology
ed
be
to
the
s
and
s
what
microsoft
have
be
to
the
s
and
s
it
brought
a
whole
new
dimension
to
the
business
of
computer
service
ed
be
eat
up
the
business
world
although
perot
be
not
yet
the
household
name
and
folk
hero
he
be
today
ken
take
me
to
meet
perot
in
dallas
my
first
impression
be
that
of
a
gregarious
and
enthusiastic
man
who
be
a
model
of
the
american
free
enterprise
system
he
be
a
patriot
for
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
who
literally
create
something
out
of
nothing
a
former
ibm
salesman
and
look
at
him
now
i
thought
america
have
be
good
to
him
and
he
frequently
talk
about
give
back
to
his
country
ken
told
perot
who
be
always
cordial
but
never
crack
a
smile
about
how
arthur
and
i
have
built
tliis
great
business
handy
dan
and
the
injustice
sigoloff
have
commit
against
us
ken
told
the
story
in
a
way
that
we
could
not
and
perot
ate
it
up
there
be
a
few
structural
and
compatibility
issue
that
i
felt
i
need
to
run
by
perot
right
from
the
begin
to
see
if
we
would
be
compatible
ross
i
say
i
be
not
interested
in
do
anything
with
you
un
deal
through
intermediary
and
i
will
not
become
part
of
your
exist
organization
if
i
have
a
problem
i
will
call
you
and
you
and
i
will
agree
on
how
we
proceed
i
be
not
go
to
a
captain
or
a
lieutenant
i
be
not
interested
in
that
nonsense
if
we
get
caught
up
in
corporate
crap
i
won
t
be
part
of
it
it
be
my
way
of
throw
down
a
gauntlet
challenge
perot
to
accept
me
for
who
and
what
i
be
i
didn
t
change
my
personality
for
sigoloff
i
wasn
t
go
to
do
it
for
perot
either
i
like
straightforward
people
perot
say
no
i
wouldn
t
put
anybody
in
between
us
you
have
my
word
with
an
understand
of
our
position
in
place
we
agree
to
explore
a
relationship
i
introduce
arthur
to
perot
at
the
next
meeting
arthur
be
unsure
what
he
be
go
to
do
with
his
life
while
he
sort
out
his
option
ken
arrange
for
arthur
to
do
some
consult
work
in
philadelphia
for
gary
erlbaum
s
panelrama
chain
during
this
time
perot
hire
a
consultant
name
brian
smith
who
have
be
a
general
director
of
the
board
of
texas
instrument
perot
give
our
presentation
material
to
smith
for
a
second
opinion
at
our
next
meeting
the
new
man
be
alongside
perot
perot
introduce
smith
and
i
could
see
a
barrier
already
develop
between
me
and
perot
ken
raise
the
issue
later
and
perot
wave
it
away
he
say
that
because
of
his
intense
travel
schedule
we
would
need
someone
who
could
act
and
make
decision
in
his
absence
smith
be
that
man
uneasy
i
let
it
slide
for
the
time
be
but
smith
thought
our
retail
concept
be
a
bad
idea
at
that
time
gross
margin
in
the
industry
be
about
percent
really
big
markup
but
we
be
talk
about
our
gross
margin
be
as
low
as
percent
we
expect
to
make
up
the
difference
and
more
on
volume
but
smith
just
couldn
t
get
perot
s
wallet
wrap
around
the
concept
how
be
you
go
to
do
it
he
ask
at
a
subsequent
meeting
if
you
be
sell
at
these
margin
you
will
lose
a
pile
of
money
no
that
s
not
right
i
insist
the
idea
be
that
the
volume
of
business
we
will
do
in
these
store
will
give
us
a
different
kind
of
benchmark
levy
s
be
a
chain
of
four
home
improvement
store
in
louis
ville
kentucky
own
by
the
levy
family
at
that
time
they
produce
some
of
the
big
sale
volume
in
our
industry
roughly
million
per
store
annually
our
model
be
base
on
at
least
double
their
volume
the
profit
percentage
would
be
low
but
the
gross
margin
dollar
the
actual
dollar
that
the
margin
would
convert
into
would
be
substantially
high
ken
turn
to
perot
i
just
don
t
agree
with
brian
ken
say
he
doesn
t
understand
the
concept
perot
wasn
t
one
who
worried
much
about
step
on
the
view
of
his
underling
he
want
to
do
what
be
best
for
business
smith
meanwhile
remain
resistant
to
the
deal
for
his
s
million
perot
would
own
percent
of
the
company
as
yet
unnamed
ken
would
get
percent
and
we
would
own
percent
out
of
our
percent
we
would
bring
in
a
team
of
people
such
as
ron
brill
and
others
we
make
one
final
trip
to
dallas
intend
to
iron
out
a
few
final
detail
there
be
strong
signal
of
future
culture
conflict
however
we
be
more
than
a
little
discomfit
by
the
military
nature
of
ed
include
the
corporate
uniform
everybody
have
to
wear
a
shirt
and
tie
and
the
only
acceptable
shirt
color
be
white
and
the
guard
who
met
every
car
enter
the
corporation
s
campus
during
a
discussion
of
what
perk
would
go
with
my
salary
i
told
perot
i
have
a
small
problem
while
my
salary
and
perk
would
be
similar
to
those
i
enjoy
at
handy
dan
there
be
the
matter
of
a
company
car
the
lease
car
i
have
be
drive
be
still
be
paid
for
by
handy
dan
but
the
company
would
repossess
it
unless
i
plan
to
take
over
the
lease
or
buy
it
for
the
depreciate
value
this
be
a
good
deal
for
a
new
company
we
ought
to
try
to
save
as
much
money
as
we
can
i
say
i
would
like
to
buy
it
outright
at
the
depreciate
value
would
you
like
me
to
buy
it
and
then
i
will
just
charge
it
to
our
entity
or
do
you
want
to
give
me
a
check
and
i
will
pay
for
it
that
s
fine
perot
say
you
can
either
do
that
or
buy
a
new
car
i
don
t
really
care
but
then
perot
decide
to
test
me
what
kind
of
a
car
be
it
perot
ask
in
that
peculiar
texas
drawl
of
his
it
s
a
cadillac
perot
didn
t
like
that
answer
at
all
my
people
don
t
drive
cadillacs
he
say
my
guy
at
ed
drive
chevrolets
that
s
fine
i
say
i
think
it
s
a
good
policy
for
you
but
this
be
a
new
company
we
re
form
not
ed
look
this
be
a
four
year
old
car
and
i
m
a
big
guy
it
be
cheaper
to
have
an
old
cadillac
than
it
be
to
go
out
and
get
a
new
chevrolet
so
how
do
we
pay
for
it
not
that
the
question
meant
anything
my
people
don
t
drive
cadillacs
perot
say
again
and
again
my
people
don
t
drive
cadillacs
and
when
he
say
it
the
third
time
i
realize
this
be
never
go
to
work
go
from
ming
the
merciless
to
ross
perot
be
no
improvement
perot
be
establish
who
and
what
his
position
be
and
what
mine
be
partner
or
not
my
mind
flash
back
to
the
day
sigoloff
and
i
nearly
come
to
blow
during
a
board
of
director
meeting
when
we
go
into
another
room
to
hash
out
our
disagreement
privately
sigoloff
told
me
that
he
be
the
bos
he
control
my
career
and
i
need
to
understand
that
then
he
demand
that
i
literally
repeat
that
back
to
him
i
say
nothing
of
the
sort
instead
acknowledge
that
he
be
right
about
one
thing
he
be
the
bos
i
nonetheless
told
him
to
go
himself
nobody
control
my
life
but
me
he
own
share
of
stock
the
control
share
of
stock
in
handy
dan
but
he
would
never
control
me
or
my
career
now
i
be
look
across
a
different
table
star
at
ross
perot
my
blood
pressure
rise
my
face
turn
red
and
i
be
hearing
sigoloff
s
word
come
out
of
perot
s
mouth
i
be
the
bos
i
control
your
life
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
regain
my
composure
i
smile
ross
i
have
to
talk
to
kenny
for
a
minute
would
you
mind
if
we
step
outside
ken
be
perplexed
look
kenny
i
whisper
i
know
perot
be
a
very
important
person
in
your
life
but
you
have
to
understand
something
if
this
guy
be
go
to
be
bother
by
what
kind
of
car
i
be
drive
how
much
aggravation
be
we
go
to
have
when
we
have
to
make
really
big
decision
if
we
can
t
be
free
to
run
the
business
the
way
we
know
it
have
to
be
run
it
isn
t
go
to
work
i
be
never
go
to
have
this
man
for
a
partner
i
would
rather
starve
to
death
no
way
now
it
be
ken
s
turn
to
wonder
whose
brain
be
scramble
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind
be
you
crazy
my
god
he
be
go
to
give
you
million
kenny
i
wouldn
t
touch
it
with
a
ten
foot
pole
i
be
out
of
here
i
say
and
head
down
the
hall
ken
go
back
in
look
perot
in
the
eye
and
never
say
a
word
about
cadillacs
ross
look
we
be
all
think
about
where
we
be
ken
say
brian
obviously
doesn
t
like
the
deal
this
be
a
no
win
situation
for
me
personally
and
maybe
we
ought
to
just
cool
it
for
a
while
let
s
just
let
some
time
pas
and
then
decide
whether
we
want
to
get
back
together
okay
perot
say
if
you
want
to
come
back
come
on
back
ken
say
that
he
would
call
in
a
few
day
and
that
be
how
we
walk
away
from
ross
perot
the
interest
thing
be
that
if
perot
hadn
t
be
so
hung
up
on
cadillacs
his
original
percent
share
of
the
home
depot
stock
would
be
worth
approximately
billion
today
ft
later
ken
wonder
if
he
have
damage
his
long
term
relationship
with
perot
i
thanked
god
the
deal
hadn
t
be
conclude
and
arthur
felt
the
heavy
weight
of
sigoloff
enshroud
him
once
more
after
briefly
see
daylight
i
be
the
first
to
speak
what
do
we
do
now
now
we
be
go
to
go
raise
the
million
at
percent
ken
say
defiantly
what
be
you
talk
about
arthur
say
let
s
put
together
a
group
of
investor
where
you
won
t
have
to
worry
about
that
i
be
go
to
get
my
percent
ken
explain
you
guy
be
go
to
have
and
the
next
investor
will
get
percent
that
doesn
t
make
sense
arthur
argue
that
mean
we
will
have
a
well
deal
by
walk
away
from
this
deal
that
s
right
ken
say
in
the
retail
business
when
you
can
t
sell
something
you
mark
it
down
in
my
business
when
we
can
t
sell
something
we
mark
it
up
a
the
home
depot
get
its
start
when
ken
langone
reach
out
to
his
own
investment
group
for
seed
money
we
have
convince
him
that
our
new
retail
concept
have
such
a
good
blend
of
low
price
wide
assortment
and
customer
service
that
it
couldn
t
miss
it
be
destine
to
become
the
first
nationwide
home
improvement
store
brand
and
once
ken
believe
he
set
out
to
convince
the
rest
of
the
world
on
our
behalf
we
have
never
met
most
of
ken
s
group
so
he
set
up
a
meeting
in
new
york
we
felt
like
beggar
ask
these
successful
people
to
invest
in
our
company
not
that
that
be
necessary
they
give
us
a
rouse
reception
why
these
be
the
people
who
bought
handy
dan
stock
between
and
a
share
and
sell
it
at
s
a
share
of
course
they
love
us
of
course
while
they
have
make
ton
of
money
we
be
broke
that
irony
wasn
t
lose
on
ken
you
guy
make
a
ton
of
money
on
bernie
and
arthur
he
told
them
take
a
portion
and
roll
it
over
into
their
new
business
sure
it
s
a
gamble
a
real
gamble
if
you
go
to
vega
you
would
drop
a
few
thousand
dollar
a
day
so
what
the
hell
let
s
drop
it
here
and
see
if
these
guy
can
roll
seven
again
we
wouldn
t
have
want
anyone
but
ken
manhandle
this
crowd
he
s
the
kind
of
guy
who
if
you
be
in
a
meeting
with
him
and
he
be
quiet
for
more
than
a
minute
and
a
half
you
d
think
he
be
asleep
in
fact
if
ken
have
any
fault
it
s
that
he
give
answer
faster
than
you
can
ask
a
question
ken
eventually
cajole
forty
or
so
player
in
his
group
into
buying
enough
unit
of
prefer
stock
to
get
us
to
million
in
seed
capital
that
s
of
course
a
far
cry
from
the
original
million
i
thought
be
necessary
to
capitalize
the
home
depot
and
in
fact
we
be
undercapitalized
for
a
number
of
year
the
idea
be
that
they
would
put
the
money
up
but
it
would
be
a
prefer
stock
and
they
would
get
their
money
back
not
that
sell
those
unit
be
a
snap
in
the
end
they
give
us
million
and
two
year
to
open
up
any
business
that
we
chose
the
money
be
intend
to
cover
our
salary
expense
and
benefit
equal
to
what
we
make
at
handy
dan
there
be
actually
two
piece
to
the
investment
ken
s
investment
group
bought
unit
consist
of
prefer
and
common
stock
common
stock
be
also
what
we
bought
at
penny
a

this
give
us
the
opportunity
to
be
participant
in
the
fruit
of
our
own
labor
an
important
and
much

of

be
not
available
until
i
met
him
within
thirty
minute
however
i
conclude
that
the
man
be
an
egomaniac
a
rave
lunatic
out
of
control
in
orbit
do
you
ever
dislike
somebody
instantly
that
be
my
response
to
pat
and
pat
wasn
t
any
more
impressed
with
me
pat
left
the
office
and
i
told
arthur
i
wouldn
t
hire
this
guy
on
a
bet
he
and
i
would
be
like
fire
and
oil
it
will
be
a
distant
day
before
i
d
have
him
associate
with
me
besides
pat
feel
rather
cocky
about
his
own
company
s
rosy
future
indicate
he
wasn
t
interested
either
fast
forward
several
year
in
national
lumber
be
do
very
well
and
the
family
be
spending
less
time
hand
on
pretty
much
entrust
its
operation
to
pat
s
care
he
and
mel
jaffee
even
start
invest
together
outside
the
company
but
a
dispute
over
one
of
those
investment
turn
both
of
their
life
upside
down
the
situation
start
innocently
enough
when
pat
met
cliff
branch
branch
own
california
cooperage
which
manufacture
a
popular
line
of
hot
tub
pat
thought
they
d
be
great
project
starter
in
national
lumber
store
buy
the
hot
tub
and
build
a
deck
around
it
as
usual
he
be
right
do
it
yourselfers
bought
the
tub
and
then
drop
thousand
more
on
deck
material
it
be
go
so
well
that
mel
and
pat
decide
to
buy
the
company
they
both
like
branch
and
thought
he
d
be
helpful
in
refocus
national
s
lumber
business
they
negotiate
a
deal
for
an
percent
ownership
but
the
day
before
the
deal
would
close
and
be
announce
in
san
francisco
at
the
national

let
all
of
the
water

he
return
from
a
trip
to
israel
and
announce
he
couldn
t
go
through
with
the
deal
i
can
t
make
this
investment
now
he
abruptly
told
pat
pat
didn
t
have
the
cash
to
do
the
deal
by
himself
and
there
be
no
way
to
raise
the
balance
of
the
money
so
they
have
to
back
out
pat
flew
to
san
francisco
and
give
branch
the
bad
news
in
person
he
felt
so
bad
about
it
that
on
the
spot
without
any
planning
he
told
branch
he

at

of
his
most
trust
manager
from

one
catch
though

jack
s
brother
continued
operating
a
small
liquor

the
first
really

have
no
idea
whether
he
be
make
money
he
couldn
t
spell
the
word
audit
we
ask
him
what
he
thought
his
gross
margin
the
difference
between
the
cost
of
buying
product
and
the
price
for
which
he
could
sell
them
be
and
he
say
well
i
think
it
be
percent
and
we
be
make
all
this
money
shortly
thereafter
we
sign
a
letter
of
intent
to
buy
homeco
subject
to
our
due
diligence
we
hire
ron
brill
to
act
as
the
store
s
comptroller
and
assign
him
the
challenge
of
get

financial
record
straighten
out
pat
s
bookkeeper
show
ron
around
the

on
his
first
day
ron
notice
she
avoid
a
particular
filing
cabinet
what
s
in
here
he
ask
pull
it
open
even
as
he
spoke
it
literally
explode
at
him
packed
as
it
be
with
unopened
invoice
from
homeco
s
vendor
and
supplier
that
make
a
good
anecdote
of
course
but
the
reality
be
that
by
the
time
ron
start
opening
and
record
the
invoice
what
be
in
them
didn
t
matter
pat
didn
t
have
the
cash
to
pay
the
bill
he
be
do
great
sale
volume
and
that
s
how
he
cover
his
payroll
by
not
pay
for
his
inventory
he
give
the
impression
of
have
plenty
of
cash
pat
and
his
top
guy
for
example
be
drive
porsches
or
cadillacs
as
long
as
pat
have
cash
it
never
occur
to
him
that
he
be
insolvent
he
have
no
clue
what
his
liability
be
fiscal
responsibility
be
just
not
his
thing
we
commission
kpmg
peat
marwick
to
do
an
in
depth
audit
between
them
and
ron
brill
what
they
discover
be
that
while
inventory
be
fly
out
the
door
pat
wasn
t
pay
the
vendor
for
it
he
be
spending
more
on
advertising
than
he
could
afford
in
fact
he
never
paid
any
bill
have
no
system
no
control
and
he
be
slowly
but
surely
sinking
into
the
sunset
however
in
conduct
a
physical
inventory
of
the
store
ron
discover
one
of
the
great
farrah
s
many
secret
empty
paint
can
if
the
store
have
four
layer
of
paint
can
the
can
on
the
bottom
layer
be
empty
they
be
on
the
showroom
floor
for
show
they
give
the
illusion
of
great
inventory
and
since
the
empty
can
look
just
like
the
full
can
ron
have
to
bang
on
each
and
every
one
of
them
to
determine
what
if
anything
be
in
them
late
one
afternoon
arthur
receive
a
call
from
ron
we
finish
the
audit
he
say
but
what
we
be
concerned
about
be
not
so
much
homeco
s
expense
but
what
the
store
s
gross
margin
really
be
it
wasn
t
the
industry
standard
percent
it
wasn
t
the
percent
pat
have
guess
it
be
a
mere
percent
at
national
lumber
pat
have
a
financial
structure
in
place
that
he
rarely
dealt
with
let
alone
worried
about
his
whole
expertise
be
merchandising
and
cultural
get
people
excite
sell
them
on
thing
catering
to
the
stuff
that
they
want
and
make
it
happen
at
homeco
business
basic
such
as
pay
the
bill
reveal
pat
s
blind
spot
bottom
line
pat
be
lose
his
as
arthur
be
in
shock
when
pat
call
him
later
that
even
arthur
say
he
have
the
result
ol
the
audit
and
suggest
they
discus
it
over
dinner
and
drink
well
pat
ask
how
do
it
go
arthur
hesitate
ah
the
first
number
what
be
it
like
twenty
five
twenty
four
the
first
number
be
a
one
you
re
kid
the
first
number
be
a
one
oh
no
the
second
number
be
also
a
small
number
arthur
have
grown
fond
of
pat
in
the
short
time
since
the
buyout
dance
begin
and
found
deliver
this
news
not
unlike
tell
a
child
his
dog
have
be
run
over
by
a
truck
pat
be
in
a
state
of
disbelief
and
denial
arthur
told
pat
furthermore
that
base
on
homeco
s
gross
margin
and
base
on
what
arthur
knew
about
pat
s
cash
position
he
have
maybe
six
month
left
pat
he
say
you
re
get
kill
we
can
t
possibly
do
this
deal
this
isn
t
go
to
work
we
have
already
commit
a
great
deal
of
limited
start
up
capital
to
buying
homeco
but
we
realize
that
if
we
bought
the
company
just
pay
off
pat
s
debt
would
suck
us
dry
we
would
have
no
money
left
this
one
store
would
kill
us
in
the
womb
we
just
couldn
t
do
the
deal
pat
say
he
understood
but
he
be
in
shock
he
be
lose
pallet
of
money
he
be
go
broke
how
could
that
be
wasn
t
this
die
coolest
home
improvement
store
on
the
planet
so
much
of
his
personality
who
he
be
who
he
want
to
be
be
tie
up
in
the
homeco
store
why
don
t
you
just
close
it
up
arthur
say
and
we
ll
all
go
somewhere
else
and
start
over
i
can
t
do
that
pat
say
we
have
our
own
investor
and
i
have
all
these
people
who
left
national
lumber
to
work
for
me
can
t
just
quit
on
them
like
that
we
be
go
to
go
fight
it
out
and
see
if
we
can
make
it
for
pat
our
decision
not
to
buy
homeco
be
far
more
painful
than
his
earlier
departure
from
national
lumber
about
three
month
later
homeco
couldn
t
pay
enough
bill
to
stay
afloat
and
pat
file
for
bankruptcy
both
business
and
personal
two
day
after
pat
close
homeco
s
door
i
call
him
well
pat
i
say
i
still
want
you
to
join
arthur
and
me
in
this
new
venture
pat
felt
horrible
terribly
guilty
about
all
the
money
he
have
lose
the
employee
and
investor
he
have
let
down
after
the
home
depot
go
public
he
organize
a
get
together
for
the
original
homeco
investor
and
give
them
all
their
money
back
in
home
depot
stock
nobody
knew
it
be
come
today
that
stock
would
be
worth
more
than
million
he
be
burn
out
on
the
whole
business
plus
he
thought
that
maybe
i
felt
obligate
to
offer
him
a
job
because
we
didn
t
have
a
business
to
buy
despite
the
homeco
fiasco
i
still
have
star
in
my
eye
i
could
not
understand
why
pat
didn
t
jump
at
my
offer
to
be
a
part
of
another
hardware
store
warehouse
concept
with
tentative
financing
two
more
day
go
by
and
i
call
pat
again
i
don
t
think
you
understand
what
i
m
say
pat
i
say
can
t
believe
you
aren
t
take
me
up
on
this
you
be
a
great
merchant
you
have
a
great
concept
you
just
don
t
have
us
you
need
us
and
we
need
you
pat
be
dumbfound
a
man
of
infinite
energy
and
verbosity
he
couldn
t
think
of
a
single
response
so
i
kept
go
we
be
go
to
do
the
deal
the
same
way
you
will
be
the
third
partner
in
this
thing
with
arthur
and
me
what
be
there
left
for
him
to
say
but
yes
imi
the
fir
store
they
lock
me
up
because
i
sell
at
such
low
price
bernie
a
key
part
of
our
plan
to
form
what
become
the
home
depot
be
our
partnership
arthur
no
longer
want
to
work
for
me
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
we
be
each
go
to
bring
an
equal
measure
of
necessary
ingredient
to
the
recipe
base
on
our
individual
strength
so
we
agree
to
be
partner
i
take
the
traditionally
high
title
of
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
because
of
my
great
experience
and
i
end
up
with
slightly
more
stock
for
that
reason
percent
to
arthur
s
percent
arthur
become
president
once
pat
conclude
his
and
homeco
s
bankruptcy
proceeding
he
be
grant
an
amount
of
stock
that
be
almost
but
not
quite
equal
to
arthur
s
holding
but
the
idea
from
day
one
be
that
the
gap
would
close
both
financially
and
in
term
of
the
company
hierarchy
we
knew
that
we
couldn
t
afford
to
construct
anything
because
new
store
would
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
so
we
start
search
for
vacant
building
that
we
could
afford
to
lease
our
preference
since
we
all
live
there
be
to
start
in
los
angeles
but
that
wasn
t
enough
justification
so
we
begin
a
nationwide
search
if
we
couldn
t
be
in
los
angeles
where
else
would
we
want
to
live
we
need
to
be
near
an
airport
with
a
hub
that
we
could
fly
in
and
out
of
a
place
from
which
we
could
grow
and
raise
our
child
we
take
turn
visit
site
across
the
country
look
for
real
estate
we
recognize
that
we
would
be
hire
talented
people
at
every
level
we
need
a
place
where
family
would
be
happy
and
transportation
would
be
easily
accessible
in
our
travel
we
decide
on
several
thing
one
we
be
go
to
build
a
national
chain
not
a
single
market
group
of
store
actually
we
plan
to
open
a
thousand
store
seriously
we
believe
that
be
possible
from
the
begin
although
we
be
careful
not
to
put
it
in
write
so
we
need
to
be
in
an
appeal
place
to
which
we
could
recruit
the
best
people
as
we
look
around
the
site
selection
process
quickly
narrow
to
four
city
boston
atlanta
dallas
and
los
angeles
atlanta
be
a
place
that
arthur
who
have
previously
live
in
griffin
georgia
knew
intimately
from
his
day
as
president
of
elliott
s
drug
but
i
be
not
too
keen
on
it
newspaper
all
across
the
country
have
carry
terrify
story
of
crime
in
atlanta
during
the
mid
s
and
it
just
didn
t
sound
like
the
kind
of
place
to
which
we
want
to
move
our
family
but
atlanta
be
where
opportunity
beckon
zayre
corporation
which
operate
a
discount
chain
of
the
same
name
have
two
store
in
atlanta
and
two
in
charlotte
that
it
want
to
unload
and
we
seriously
consider
them
study
all
the
available
demographic
and
opportunity
all
road
lead
to
atlanta
real
estate
be
readily
available
in
the
deep
south
so
the
die
be
cast
arthur
and
pat
be
so
convince
that
atlanta
be
the
right
place
even
without
a
sign
store
lease
that
they
be
living
out
of
hotel
and
make
plan
to
relocate
their
family
in
fact
even
as
we
move
on
the
zayre
property
arthur
met
with
the
atlanta
journal
constitution
advertising
director
to
talk
about
our
potential
ad
budget
the
ad
director
mention
a
rumor
that
j
c
penney
be
look
to
scale
back
its
monster
square
foot
treasure
island
discount
store
he
say
j
c
penney
be
reportedly
look
to
sublease
square
foot
in
each
of
its
four
area
location
he
also
men
tioned
that
handy

be
look
at
the
site
i
get
my
job
at

when
george
hanzi

founder
of

city
and
former

be
start
a
clone
handy
city
on
the
side
he
have
to
leave
and
i
be
give
the
assignment
because
of
my
personal
experience
with
wall
street
even
more
ironically
pat
have
already
approach
j
c
penney
about
the
treasure
island
store
everywhere
we
go
while

location
be
take
by
treasure

pat
already
knew
they
be
sublease

but
they
told
him
at
the
time
that
they
weren
t
interested
in
subdivide
the
atlanta

arthur
go
straight
to
the
near

and
call

i
agree
about
the
desirability
of

treasure
island
location
and
the
opportunity
to
tweak
handy
city
so
i
call
ken

and
ask
if
he
knew
anyone
at
j
c

distinguish
itself
from

just
didn

work
the

a
failure
they

for
the
amount
of

harris
be
ask
no
one
be
interested
treasure
island
itself
wasn
t
perform
very
well
so
harris
suggest
another
tack
to
j
c
penney
consolidate
the
treasure
island
store
into
square
foot
and
free
up
a
narrow
square
foot
space
include
frontage
space
by
the
time
j
c
penney
agree
however
the
retail
market
be
extremely
soft
w
t
grant
spartan
and
woolco
be
all
in
the
process
of
throw
in
the
towel
closing

and
create
a
glut
of
available
big
box
space
price
plummet
in
december
harris
receive
a
call
from
a
treasure

senior
vice
president
who
have
met
with
ken
langone
who
told
him
we
be
interested
in
lease
square
foot
in
four
adanta
area
treasure
island

harris
then
invite
us
to
his
office
arthur
make
that
first
meeting
memorable
he
and
pat
walk
into
harris
s
office
bearing
a
loaf
of
french
bread
and
a
bottle
of
wine
to
break
the
ice
the
gesture
meant
to
suggest
our
sincere
interest
in
negotiate
a
deal
be
not
lose
on
harris
he
understood
that
when
we
be
do
we
expect
to
break
bread
together
as
friend
it
s
a
good
thing
we
brought
a
snack
too
that
first
session
last
eight
hour
harris
be
a
deal
maker
very
pragmatic
one
real
stick
point
however
almost
quashed
the
deal
harris
insist
we
take
space
in
all
four
adanta
areatreasure
island
store
or
there
be
no
deal
we
be
ambitious
but
not
that
ambitious
we
be
uncertain
we
have
the
financial
resource
to
open
two
store
let
alone
four
but
we
gulped
hard
and
agree
arthur
negotiate
tremendous
lease
with
j
c
penney
that
tilt
heavily
in
our
favor
the
only
reason
we
could
ever
guess
why
j
c
penney
do
this
be
they
thought
if
our
concept
work
they
might
eventually
buy
us
out
but
that
s
just
conjecture
because
the
issue
be
never
raise
by
them
harris
require
a
financial
statement
from
us
as
well
as
a
business
plan
it
show
the
million
that
our
equity
partner
have
commit
that
didn
t
impress
harris
but
one
of
die
name
of
our
investor
do
colonel
frank
borman
harris
didn
t
recognize
the
name
of
any
of
the
other
people
in
the
group
but
everyone
knew
the
commander
of
the
apollo
moon
mission
and
the
then
president
of
eastern
air
line
borman
give
us
much
need
credibility
although
we
didn
t
realize
how
much
until
flarris
fessed
up
twenty
year
later
in
an
interview
for
this
hooka
our
plan
for
a
wholesale
price
home
improvement
operation
sound
good
to
plarris
and
his
associate
too
they
thought
it
might
be
a
more
complementary
draw
for
the
treasure
island
store
than
the
supermarket
harris
make
a
commitment
to
us
that
he
could
get
the
lease
do
quickly
quick
in
j
c
penney
parlance
might
mean
as
long
as
six
month
on
a
lease
like
this
we
make
it
quite
clear
we
couldn
t
sit
on
our
hand
that
long
and
he
actually
turn
it
around
in
a
month
in
fact
he
order
work
start
to
build
the
wall
between
treasure
island
and
our
store
to
be
name
later
even
before
the
lease
be
sign
j
c
penney
be
a
large
company
and
we
be
upstart
entrepreneur
building
our
dream
surprisingly
they
treat
us
with
dignity
and
respect
certainly
bill
harris
do
whenever
we
have
conversation
with
him
he
be
honest
and
forthright
that
be
a
great
learn
experience
for
us
that
a
company
could
be
big
and
yet
have
a
human
face
we
like
harris
so
much
that
a
few
year
later
after
he
have
retire
from
j
c
penney
and
return
to
his
native
cleveland
we
hire
him
to
guide
our
own
real
estate
decision
he
be
a
person
whose
value
appeal
to
us
harris
join
us
in
as
senior
vice
president
of
corporate
development
when
we
have
fifty
store
over
the
next
decade

guide
us
through
our
five
hundredth
store
we
back

fateful
day
to
hear
about
the
treasure
island

today
because
those
zayre
location

terrible
arthur
pat
and
ron

i
m
a
businessman
in
dallas
i
don
t

se
but
whenever

into
town
they
call
me
i
go
to
the
bar
mitzvah
and
wedding
of
their
jewish
client
or
if
somebody
like
you
come
into
town
in
other
word
i
say
they
identify
me
as

potential
customer
but
a
jew
yeah
to
be
honest
the
bank
be
actually
very
nice
despite
this
inauspicious
start
but
they
turn
us
down
too
ri
sg
one
of
ken
s
lead
be
a
little
know
boston
base
venture
capitalist
who

early
in
lot
of
good
company
and
make
a
ton
of
money
his
people
be
quite
anxious
to
buy
into
our
would
be
business
which
exist
only
on
paper
like
ken
they
bought
the
vision
of
the
first
nationwide
home
improvement
warehouse
brand
for
s
million
he
be
buying
us
and
our
experience
and
we
need
that
s
million
the
way
somebody
die
of
stab
wound
need
blood
in
his
vein
this
time
we
agree
to
term
afterward
with
our
group
in
a
celebratory
mood
i
happily
drove
our
new
investor
to
the
airport
but
in
the
car
the
man
turn
very
serious
again
listen
there
be
thing
i
didn
t
want
to
talk
about
in
the
office
because
they
be
very
sensitive
and
i
want
to
discus
them
with
you
he
say
what
be
they
i
ask
first
i
need
two
men
on
the
board
of
director
that
be
easy
something
i
anticipate
okay
you
get
it
now
when
i
make
an
investment
i
like
people
to
invest
with
me
and
i
need
an
investment
on
your
part
what
do
you
mean
investment
well
i
need
to
have
you
invest
we
start
tjie
business
we
left
everything
in
california
especially
our
support
system
i
say
puzzle
we
be
sacrifice
our
life
here
no
i
mean
more
than
that
he
say
first
of
all
you
should
not
have
company
car
we
all
have
lease
company
car
because
so
much
of
our
time
be
spent
in
car
drive
all
over
georgia
on
company
business
and
none
of
us
could
afford
to
buy
car
pat
be
broke
and
i
be
broke
attorney
have
suck
us
both
dry
arthur
and
ron
have
no
money
either
that
would
be
kind
of
tough
for
us
i
say
but
if
we
could
figure
out
a
way
to
pay
for
auto
expense
maybe
we
can
do
that
okay
the
man
say
another
thing
be
that
everybody
need
to
take
a
percent
cut
in
salary
i
star
at
him
in
disbelief
everybody
yes
do
you
know
what
i
just
go
through
to
hire
these
people
i
hire
them
from
all
over
the
united
state
i
brought
them
here
i
sell
them
on
this
dream
they
take
less
money
than
they
ever
have
make
before
and
they
left
their
security
all
of
those
thing
and
you
want
me
to
cut
their
salary
by
percent
yes
well
i
guess
we
could
do
that
if
that
s
so
important
to
you
i
don
t
think
it
s
fair
but
what
choice
do
i
have
now
the
man
say
be
the
best
of
all
i
be
not
pay
your
employee
or
manager
medical
insurance
i
think
they
should
get
it
on
their
own
that
be
an
issue
reminiscent
of
the
matter
of
principle
that
nearly
cause
a
brawl
between
me
and
sandy
sigoloff
the
blood
rise
up
in
my
eye
i
swerve
and
pull
the
car
onto
the
shoulder
of
the
highway
my
gut
told
me
this
be
a
terrible
mistake
and
my
premonition
so
far
have
be
right
get
out
of
the
car
i
say
get
out
of
the
g
damn
car
the
man
just
look
at
me
he
thought
i
be
crazy
we
be
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
car
and
truck
be
zip
by

say

out
of
the
car
you
be
a
stupid
sonuvabitch
do
you
think
i
would
get
in
bed
with
an
imbecile
like
you
get
out
of
the
f
ing
car
you
can
walk
to
the
airport
for
all
i
care
i
then
get
out
of
the
car
and
as
the
man
timidly
get
out
i
toss
his
luggage
by
the
side
of
the
road
please
don
t
leave
me
here
the
man
plead
i
have
to
catch
a
plane
after
several
minute
still
fume
i
relent
and
allow
the
man
back
in
don
t
talk
to
me
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
we
be
finish
this
partnership
be
over
before
it
have
begin
here
again

somebody
with
whom
i
be
go
to
have
to
live
who
have
no
clue
about
what
it
meant
to
care
about
people
be
not
a
loose
cannon
my
mind
be
in
overdrive
weigh
the
pro
and
con
i
put
everybody
s
career
in
jeopardy
by
reject
him
that
way
i
didn
t
react
to
him
just
on
emotion
i
be
not
that
crazy
i
be
not
a
crook
i
be
very
deliberate
in
everything
i
do
i
realize
that
i
be
go
to
get
the
money
we
need
but
i
just
couldn
t
live
with
this
guy
this
company
didn
t
blossom
from
miracle
it
come
from
our
instinct
know
whom
to
do
business
with
and
whom
to
avoid
remember
the
story
i
told
about
two
guy
founder
herb
hubschman
in
the
first
chapter
to
his
face
i
call
him
the
big
schmuck
i
ever
met
in
my
life
that
be
a
calculate
gamble
i
read
his
personality
i
knew
what
be
go
to
get
to
him
of
course
he
wasn
t
a
schmuck
but
nothing
short
of
call
him
one
would
have
gotten
his
attention
rivet
on
me
i
have
often
thought
back
over
that
situation
wonder
what
would
have
happen
if
i
have
say
mr
hubschman
i
could
do
a
well
job
nothing
would
have
happen
instead
i
very
deliberately
apply
blunt
trauma
to

i
go
to
rip
s
office
with
arthur
s
financial
plan
under
my
arm
the
plan
impressed
rip
with
its
promise
of
establish
a
national
home
improvement
brand
base
on
the
low
price
the
wide
selection
and
the
best
customer
service
i
finally
won
him
over
he
already
believe
in
us
personally
but
see
it
on
paper
help
what
rip
like
about
our
plan
be
the
one
stop
home
center
concept
a
three
legged
stool
that
be
held
up
in
equal
measure
by
price
selection
and
customer
service
prior
to
this
if
a
homeowner
or
professional
tradesperson
be
go
to
do
a
home
improvement
project
he
have
to
go
to
a
variety
of
place
he
go
to
a
hardware
store
to
get
tool
a
lumber
company
for
lumber
a
paint
store
for
paint
nowhere
do
he
get
information
or
instruction
and
all
this
be
in
our
concept
one
place
where
you
can
get
all
the
material
tool
and
competent
advice
you
need
from
skilled
representative
it
just
make
sense
still
he
wasn
t
sure
he
could
convince
the
bank
to
approve
a
credit
line
a
commercial
loan
of
this
size
would
normally
fall
beneath
rip
s
radar
in
the
corporate
banking
department
under
different
circumstance
it
should
have
be
negotiate
and
no
doubt
reject
by
a
security
pacific
branch
rather
than
through
the
corporate
banking
group
as
we
have
already
heard
over
and
over
this
be
a
very
easy
loan
to
turn
down
as
a
matter
of
fact
rip
be
rid
up
in
an
elevator
one
day
when
one
of
his
fellow
loan
officer
say
rip
there
s
no
way
we
can
make
this
loan
and
rip
say
well
that
s
the
easy
thing
to
say
somehow
we
be
go
to
find
a
way
to
make
it
whether
or
not
this
company
get
off
the
ground
now
depend
on
rip
fleming
arthur
ken
and
i
take
charge
of
the
detail
and
negotiation
go
back
and
forth
for
three
week
despite
rip
s
vocal
support
and
our
own
proven
history
with
the
bank
as
executive
at
handy
dan
we
kept
get
turn
down
by
the
loan
officer
finally
it
boil
down
to
our
investor
put
up
letter
of
credit
as
the
final
condition
of
a
s
million
line
of
credit
those
letter
of
credit
be
transferable
into
stock
in
the
company
so
if
they
put
up
a
letter
of
credit
for
they
get
an
equal
warrant
to
buy
share
of
stock
in
the
company
at
a
later
date
from
the
bank
s
perspective
in
the
event
that
mb
associate
broke
through
certain
protect
covenant
of
the
loan
agreement
security
pacific
could
call
on
additional
capital
from
our
investor
these
covenant
make
us
a
more
reasonable
risk
it
become
the
first
start
up
loan
security
pacific
have
ever
write
and
it
be
the
save
grace
of
the
company
let
me
skip
ahead
five
or
six
year

cost
a
fraction
of
the

sign
watt
come
up
with
a
name

era
when

i
would
suggest
that

for
some
other
name
and
that
be
the
end
of
my
life
of
crime
we
subsequently
have
an
investor
meeting
in
new
york
and
ask
everyone
for
idea
drive
home
to

on
the
project

a
dozen

while
her
husband
doze
in
the
passenger
seat
each
name
include
the
word
home
her
first
choice
be
the
homeplace
because
of
its
association
with
an
outward
bound
school
with
which
she
have
be
involve
her
next

as
she
pass
the
station

which

from
a
former
railroad
car
the
next
day
marjorie
mail
us
her
list
the
homeplace
didn
t
do
much
for
us
it
sound
a
little
soft
for
a
place
that
would
sell
hardware
tool
and
lumber
by
the
ton
but
the
home
depot
wasn
t
bad
not
bad
at
all
arthur
and
pat
be
split
it
sure
beat
bad
bernies
buildall
but
be
it
good
enough
we
still
have
our
doubt
but
what
s
in
a
name
today
when
you
see
macy
s
you
say
wow
what
a
great
name
well
it
be
great
but
only
because
the
business
create
the
name
think
of
saks
fifth
avenue
bloomingdale
s
or
even
kmart
the
name
be
not
the
most
important
thing
it
be
the
entity
that
creates
value
in
the
name
and
of
course
our
company
s
name
turn
out
to
be
a
wonderful
one
our
sign
be
finish
and
instal
with
only
two
day
to
spare
before
the
first
store
open
on
opening
day
we
face
what
at
the
moment
be
a
disaster
but
turn
out
to
be
a
publicity
bonanza
we
couldn
t
afford
a
major
television
commercial
campaign
so
the
primary
ad
announce
the
grand
opening
of
the
home
depot
on
june
be
go
to
run
the
day
before
june
in
the
atlanta
journal
constitution
grand
opening
be
schedule
for
a
friday
wc
submit
a
double
truck
ad
two
full
page
face
each
other
to
run
as
a
tease
on
thursday
morning
but
guess
what
the
atlanta
journal
constitution
do
not
run
our
full
grand
opening
ad
it
be
a
disaster
because
you
re
not
really
open
if
nobody
know
about
it
there
would
be
no
customer
come
friday
morning
because
there
be
no
ad
on
thursday
i
go
back
to
our
office
and
call
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
my
voice
be
choked
with
emotion
a
ferocious
mix
of
anger
and
grow
panic
i
be
watch
our
life
go
down
the
drain
no
sale
no
cash
flow
payroll
be
already
eat
us
alive
the
clock
be
tick
with
vendor
who
want
to
be
paid
you
just
kill
us
i
say
you
kill
us
we
be
try
to
get
this
company
off
the
ground
and
you
single
handedly
put
us
out
of
business
the
editor
be
contrite
he
felt
truly
awful
about
the
paper
s
mistake
as
part
of
our
grand
opening
strategy
we
sent
our
own
kid
and
wife
into
the
parking
lot
of
the
store
and
on
the
street
hand
out
one
dollar
bill
to
try
and
lure
customer
in
but
thing
be
so
bad
without
the
newspaper
ad
that
we
literally
couldn
t
give
the
dollar
bill
away
on
friday
the
ad
finally
ran
but
the
damage
be
do
still
we
get
something
from
that
incident
for
which
we
could
never
have
negotiate
for
week
to
come
the
journal
constitution
give
us
a
plum
the
back
page
of
one
of
its
daily
news
section
the
prime
advertising
spot
which
our
young
company
never
would
have
be
able
to
afford
so
out
of
something
that
be
really
bad
something
really
great
arose
the
break
be
still
go
our
way

hour
before
the
sun
would
rise
on
the
home
depot
for
the
first
time
that
friday
morning
pat
call
me
i
wasn
t
able
to
sleep
anyway
we
have
another
disaster
on
our
hand
pat
say
what
happen
i
ask
i
cannot
begin
to
tell
you
you
be
go
to
go
crazy
when
you
see
it
meet
me
right
away
pat
also
unable
to
sleep
have
come
back
to
one
of
the
store
early
to
plan
an
employee
rally
set
for
six
a
m
what
he
saw
shock
and
dismayed
him
the
store
be
sparkle
clean
what
the
hell
happen
pat
demand
who
screw
up
the
store
during
the
night
our
store
manager
charlie
barnes
and
ed
mcguire
think
they
be
do
us
a
great
favor
brought
in
crew
that
scrubbed
the
store
concrete
floor
we
clean
up
so
it
would
look
great
for
the
customer
barnes
say
proud
of
the
initiative
he
and
mcguire
take
i
have
these
guy
come
in
to
surprise
you
you
be
out
of
your
mind
pat
scream
get
the
forklift
get
the
pallet
jack
pat
call
the
other
store
and
say
if
that
floor
be
waxed
get
your
ass
on
the
forklift
and
screw
it
up
again
for
whatever
time
remain
before
the
door
be
schedule
to
open
for
the
first
time
we
speed
around
the
aisle
in
forklift
skid
around
corner
stomp
on
the
brake
scuff
up
the
floor
so
it
would
once
more
look
like
a
warehouse
the
home
depot
isn
t
a
supermarket
where
customer
need
to
feel
they
could
eat
off
the
floor
our
store
be
action
place
the
idea
for
our
store
be
that
they
look
shop
that
be
why
we
didn
t
originally
put
in
a
separate
rear
entrance
for
the
lumber
buyer
it
be
why
we
have
contractor
and
professional
go
to
the
front
register
alongside
the
do
it
yourself
customer
that
creates
action
we
want
the
big
stuff
go
out
the
front
and
load
in
the
parking
lot
so
that
everyone
saw
it
on
top
of
that
the
do
it
yourselfers
saw
that
the
contractor
buying
two
unit
of
sheet
rock
paid
the
same
price
as
they
do
there
be
no
secret
back
door
or
discount
for
contractor
we
be
price
right
for
everyone
not
just
a
select
group
another
important
concept
for
us
inside
the
store
be
that
the
merchandise
not
be
constantly
front
we
didn
t
want
product
push
to
the
front
edge
of
the
shelf
if
everything
be
perfectly
line
up
that
tell
you
it
be
not
sell
there
be
no
action
besides
it
take
too
much
energy
to
maintain
the
facade
of
front
everything
we
front
the
product
once
but
never
again
that
way
we
can
see
what
be
sell
and
our
customer
feel
like
there
be
action
in
the
aisle
face
the
product
be
another
practice
we
don
t
believe
in
sears
and
true
value
face
their
product
meaning
they
pay
employee
to
go
through
the
store
and
turn
label
out
face
customer
it
look
good
but
it
s
tremendously
expensive
we
find
it
get
in
the
way
of
offering
product
at
the
low
possible
price
if
pat
saw
product
front
or
face
he
thought
it
look
too
tidy
if
we
saw
if
we
thought
it
be
too
expensive
the
home
depot
be
suppose
to
look
like
a
warehouse
we
want
sawdust
we
want
skid
mark
on
the
floor
we
didn
t
want
it
to
look
like
a
hospital
we
want
it
to
look
like
a
warehouse
we
go
crazy
nut
in
a
matter
of
hour
people
would
walk
in
and
see
this
shiny
floor
it
be
perhaps
our
bad
nightmare
or
so
we
thought
at
the
time
because
it
be
against
everything
that
we
want
the
perception
of
the
company
would
be
change
it
didn
t
look
like
a
warehouse
it
look
like
a
retail
store
we
even
push
back
product
that
have
be
front
on
the
shelf
so
that
it
look
like
we
have
already
be
open
by
the
time
we
officially
open
we
dirty
up
the
store
enough
that
it
look
like
a
warehouse
again
we
told
everyone
if
anyone
ever
do
that
again
we
would
kill
them
we
wouldn
t
fire
them
because
fire
be
not
bad
enough
of
a
punishment
it
have
to
be
kill
m
among
the
many
merchandise
skill
pat
farrah
brought
to
the
table
be
a
magician
s
inclination
toward
smoke
and
mirror
when
we
open
product
box
be
stack
high
on
our
rack
and
shelf
it
be
a
truly
breathtaking
display
and
some
of
the
box
actually
have
product
in
them
a
week
before
we
open
there
just
wasn
t
enough
merchandise
to
fill
the
store
floor
to
ceiling
so
pat
call
up
the
delmar
cabinet
company
on
the
west
side
of
town
and
ask
them
to
loan
us
box
of
all
different
size
we
fold
them
up
and
put
them
on
the
top
of
the
rack
all
around
the
first
two
store
box
a
store
so
they
look
full
of
merchandise
we
marked
them
with
an
x
so
we
didn
t
count
them
as
inventory
it
look
fabulously
legitimate
we
even
have
video
of
ourselves
assemble
empty
box
laugh
and
have
a
good
time
do
it
pat
pull
a
similar
trick
with
our
paint
stack
he
have
empty
paint
can
sent
over
lor
each
store
we
put
label
on
them
and
stack
them
ten
foot
high
i
ml
we
initially
have
real
difficulty
succeed
in
atlanta
despite
put
together
a
great
store
with
a
great
merchandise
mix
and
the
low
price
ever
this
be
a
market
where
people
have
be
do
business
with
traditional
lumberyard
store
such
as
handy
city
and
west
building
material
for
year
and
year
relationship
be
in
place
and
the
idea
of
shopping
at
our
store
be
as
anathema
to
most
consumer
as
cheat
on
their
spouse
our
home
improvement
mall
concept
be
antithetical
to
old
hardware
and
lumber
shopping
habit
a
paint
store
for
paint
the
plumbing
store
for
pipe
and
fixture
a
lumber
yard
for
x
s
one
stop
shopping
didn
t
exist
in
atlanta
in
those
day
so
it
be
really
hard
to
break
those
habit
the
first
month
be
slooooow
customer
the
few
we
have
receive
great
service
we
could
literally
wait
on
every
customer
because
they
come
in
one
at
a
time
and
the
people
who
do
walk
into
the
store
be
astound
by
the
sheer
volume
and
selection
of
merchandise
but
they
didn
t
understand
they
be
a
little
intimidate
by
it
all
low
price
double
and
triple
the
usual
service
level
we
felt
that
we
be
on
to
something
big
and
something
really
different
a
new
concept
that
would
cause
a
revolutionary
change
in
the
home
improvement
industry
we
be
the
folk
who
be
go
to
demonstrate
that
the
home
improvement
world
be
round
instead
of
flat
we
bought
our
product
directly
from
about
half
of
our
manufacturer
that
make
our
price
low
than
anyone
else
s
in
the
city
of
atlanta
nobody
could
compete
with
us
on
price
the
only
thing
lack
be
customer
in
term
of
our
industry
we
be
visionary
even
if
most
people
didn
t
immediately
see
the
vision
one
of
the
great
reason
for
our
survival
in
be
that
this
be
a
private
company
because
everybody
in
the
industry
predict
we
would
self
destruct
their
store
be
too
big
there
be
too
much
in
ventory
price
be
ridiculously
low
etc
and
initially
we
didn
t
produce
the
volume
average
weekly
sale
in
be
between
and
sale
do
begin
move
upward
but
we
kept
it
a
deep
dark
secret
if
we
didn
t
we
might
have
encourage
competitor
those
first
store
really
have
the
look
of
a
warehouse
they
weren
t
dirty
they
weren
t
ugly
but
you
wouldn
t
take
a
lot
of
picture
and
hang
them
on
your
wall
we
never
want
a
pretty
store
what
we
want
to
do
be
pile
the
merchandise
up
and
that
help
create
the
illusion
and
eventually
the
sale
we
laid
them
out
in
a
racetrack
design
when
you
walk
in
you
saw
a
massive
assortment
of
unfinished
furniture
in
the
center
of
the
store
you
couldn
t
miss
it
a
third
of
the
store
be
unfinished
furniture
customer
love
the
quality
and
price
but
it
take
up
a
tremendous
amount
of
floor
space
customer
come
in
the
entrance
go
down
one
aisle
hit
lumber
in
the
back
and
come
back
up
the
next
aisle
the
right
hand
side
of
the
store
be
paint
and
hardware
the
left
hand
side
be
electrical
at
the
front
of
the
store
be
wood
burning
stove
you
wouldn
t
walk
in
and
think
these
be
strictly
lumber
and
building
material
store
because
the
lumber
be
locate
in
the
back
we
do
that
follow
the
logic
of
supermarket
lumber
be
our
meat
when
you
go
into
a
grocery
store
you
never
see
the
meat
up
front
because
you
want
everybody
to
buy
all
of
the
condiment
before
they
get
to
the
meat
so
we
put
the
lumber
in
the
back
make
customer
hunt
for
the
x
s
passing
by
saw
door
stain
varnish
paint
threshold
weather
strip
and
lock
walk
around
the
whole
store
they
be
drawn
to
item
that
they
didn
t
even
think
that
they
be
come
in
for
esi
the
home
depot
wasn
t
really
born
until
treasure
island
die
treasure
island
s
death
be
inevitable
foot
traffic
into
its
store
be
dreadful
those
big
cavernous
box
be
painfully
empty
but
when
j
c
penney
finally
read
the
write
on
the
wall
and
announce
a
go
out
of
business
sale
at
treasure
island
store
the
public
discover
us
every
week
as
treasure
island
cut
its
price
first
by
percent
then
percent
and
on
through
and
percent
the
car
pour
into
their
parking
lot
and
once
folk
picked
treasure
island
clean
many
of
them
wander
over
to
our
store
or
while
the
wife
go
into
treasure
island
the
husband
pass
time
in
the
home
depot
quite
often
the
husband
return
to
their
car
with
more
purchase
than
their
wife
when
we
do
the
lease
with
j
c
penney
our
big
concern
be
that
we
need
them
to
be
next
to
us
we
depend
upon
them
for
foot
traffic
if
they
go
out
of
business
we
fear
we
would
lose
our
source
of
customer
arthur
negotiate
a
covenant
of
continue
operation
in
our
lease
in
which
j
c
penney
guaranteed
us
that
treasure
island
would
not
go
out
of
business
so
when
it
come
time
that
they
do
we
renegotiate
our
lease
with
them
and
agree
to
let
them
off
the
hook
if
they
let
us
take
more
space
increase
each
store
another
square
foot
to
square
foot
and
give
us
right
of
first
refusal
on
their
florida
location

at
the
same
time
treasure
island
be
go
out
of
business
an
exasperate
incident
with
pat
reinforce
for
us
how
critically
important
it
be
to
sell
product
at
the
right
price
business
just
wasn
t
boom
it
just
wasn
t
happen
we
be
barely
cover
our
expense
still
have
difficulty
identify
with
the
market
cash
flow
be
not
good
our
financial
resource
be
erode
shortly
after
we
open
our
third
store
in
atlanta
a

less
concerned
with
whether
we
could
sell
them
and
more
concerned
with
whether
our
check
would
bounce
but
he
be
able
to
secure
a
phenomenal
price

the
minute
the

however
people
begin
flock
into
the
store
and
we
blew
through
the
screen
in
about
four
day
the
entire
load
we
have
the
cash
before
we

kind
of
a
deal
we
end
up
sell
out
the
timing
be
perfect
the
price
irresistible
it
be
so
incredibly
cheap
people
found
it
worth
their
while
to
drive
fifty
mile
to
see
us
we
fill
the
lot
and
it
be
another
early
event
that
brought
people
into
the
store
in
drove
that
be
another
critical
moment
for
the
home
depot
it
take
an
insane
ad
to
bring
folk
to
our
store
to
discover
the
home
depot
secret
we
be
never
flush
with
cash
if
a
vendor
want
to
see
our
financial
statement
in
order
to
extend
credit
we
would
say
no
this
be
a
privately
own
company
and
we
be
not
go
to
share
that
information
with
you
because
we
knew
if
we
do
they
would
never
give
us
credit
the
strategy
work
a
manufacturer
or
distributor
would
give
us
a
line
of
credit
which
be
a
big
deal
at
the
time
and
after
we
paid
it
off
they
would
raise
it
to
when
the
inevitable
you
be
at
your
limit
call
would
come
ron
would
cajole
the
credit
manager
to
raise
the
limit
again
one
of
the
individual
who
truly
believe
in
what
we
be
do
at
the
home
depot
be
jerry
burnett
who
be
then
the
vice
president
of
sale
for
the
john
manville
corporation
burnett
knew
we
be
have
trouble
qualify
for
credit
with
a
number
of
manufacturer
so
he
take
a
remarkable
step
he
print
business
card
that
say
jerry

credit
manager
john

credit
with
a
vendor
have
them
call
me
so
that
s
what
we

have
spoken
on
our

to
at

a

company

it
take
year
for
us
to
get
decent
credit
term
with
his
own
company
john
manville
by
the
time
we
go
public
in
and
have
to
distribute
our
actual
financial
statement
it
wasn
t
much
of
an
issue
anymore
fl
back
then
before
we
be
a
public
company
most
of
us
top
to
bottom

make
nothing

we
be
all
living
on
the
fume
of
dream
our
success
today
be
almost
take
for
grant
by
outsider
but
twenty
year
ago
there
be
nothing
take
for
grant
we
do
not
for
one
minute
take
the
customer
come
in
our
store
for
grant
we
really
want
them
back
and
our
entire
service
culture
developed
from
that
it
wasn
t
some
lofty
idea
write
by
out
of
town
consultant
in
a
policy
book
nobody
read
it
be
necessity
today
we
feel
a
desire
to
carry
on
this
way
back
then
it
be
out
of
pure
necessity
if
we
didn
t
do
whatever
it
take
we
be
out
of
business
after
four
or
five
month
in

start
recognize
return

and
enthusiasm

mile
and
more
to
shop
at
the
home
depot
store
somehow
we
hadn
t
make
an
impact
on
the
people
closest
to
the
store
but
people
be
travel
from
just
about
everywhere
else
because
they
recognize
the
variety
of
merchandise
twice
as
much
as
any
other
hardware
store
or
home
improvement
center
up
until
that
point
and
the
price
be
dramatically
low
than
anybody
else
s
from
that
point
on
we
spent
much
more
time
at
the
register
gently
ask
customer
where
they
be
from
and
how
they
heard
about
us
the
answer
be
mind
boggling

hour
and
a
half
two
hour
or
more
to

same
incredible
loyalty
and
respect
that
he
have
at
national
lumber
and
homeco
it
be
because
of
his

less
attractive
trait
when

ready
for
it
there
be
a
rare
chemistry
at
work
between
these
men
and
the
people
who
work
with
them
you
couldn
t
help
but
get
wrap
up
in
it
h

the
guy
who

always
in
the
store

allow
it
he
go
to
every
inventory
and
every
grand
opening
for
year
he
laid
out
every
store
and
be
often
there
when
the
concrete
truck
pour
the
slab
he
take
the
tape
and
chalk
line
and
literally
taped
off
where
all
the
fixture
would
be
write
down
what
be
go
to
be
in
those
area
and
walk
the
store
together
with
a
group
of
merchant
for
two
more
day
talk
about
whether
the
store
felt
good
just
as
he
have
when
he
lead
our
manager
in
construct
our
first
outdoor
garden
department
an
early
vision
of
arthur
s
pat
could
be
see
in
our
new
store
in
boot
and
levi
s
lead
the
effort
of
newly
hire
associate
to
set
fixture
build
and
raise
rack
it
be
the
great
way
ever
imagine
to
give
our
people
ownership
of
the
store
twenty
year
and
nearly
a
thousand
store
later
we
still
open
about
a
quarter
of
our
store
the
same
way
we
do
in
the
early
day
set
the
store
give
our
people
ownership
we
don
t
own
these
store
they
do
the
people
who
start
this
company
be
not
just
involve
but
live
what
we
talk
about
we
weren
t
just
preacher
we
go
out
and
practice
it
and
rightfully
so
if
this
thing
didn
t
work
we
be
broke
out
on
the
street
again
pat
never
let
a
customer
out
of
the
store
empty
hand
period
if
there
be
something
they
need
that
we
didn
t
have
such
as
a
quart
size
he
would
give
them
the
gallon
size
for
the
quart
price
pat
believe
you
didn
t
let
a
customer
leave
the
home
depot
without
satisfy
them
in
some
way
cl
p
in
the
first
few
year
the
day
to
day
operating
practice
of
the
home
depot
be
always
fluid
they
could
change
on
a
monthly
basis
or
even
minute
to
minute
if
any
two
of
us
be
in
the
bathroom
at
the
same
time
someone
inevitably
start
talk
about
how
some
product
or
sale
approach
wasn
t
work
and
how
we
have
to
do
something
different
and
we
would
change
that
be
how
quickly
it
come
about
common
sense
be
an
override
factor
in
everything
we
do
nothing
but
our
value
ethic
and
morality
be
set
in
concrete
meanwhile
the
business
plan
that
arthur
write
and
i
goose
envision
store
do
million
each
in
annual
sale
well
we
never
do
million
within
a
year
and
a
half
of
opening
the
first
two
store
together
be
gross
million
which
be
unheard
of
in
the
business
and
we
be
develop
a
profitable
bottom
line
in
we
lose
money
almost
a
million
dollar
by
however
we
be
in
the
black
by
the
follow
year
we
earn
almost
double
that
so
thing
look
real
good
but
there
be
a
limit
to
how
far
you
can
expand
on
start
capital
and
on
borrow
money
the
company
be
succeed
we
be
planning
year
ahead
and
knew
that
future
financing
would
be
necessary
if
we
be
go
to
expand
we
have
wonderful
support
in
ken
langone
and
his
ability
to
market
security
so
it
seem
obvious
that
the
time
be
ripe
for
an
initial
public
offering
this
be
a
big
step
go
public
meant
lose
the
anonymity
and
cloak
of
secrecy
a
privately
held
business
enjoy
it
meant
listen
to
and
consider
wall
street
which
would
become
our
ad
hoc
partner
from
the
day
we
go
public
forward
but
if
we
be
go
to
grow
there
be
no
other
way
the
only
reason
we
would
have
wait
any
longer
to
go
public
be
so
we
wouldn
t
have
to
give
as
much
of
the
company
away
that
and
the
fact
that
as
long
as
we
be
private
the
industry
perceive
us
as
fail
if
everyone
knew
how
much
money
we
be
make
there
would
have
be
more
clone
earlier
when
we
go
public
in
the
home
improvement
industry
woke
up
and
choked
on
our
sawdust
additional
financing
be
necessary
we
have
four
store
open
in
atlanta
and
we
be
planning
on
more
store
in
florida
in
choose
a
brokerage
house
to
handle
our
initial
public
offering
we
talk
to
merrill
lynch
drexel
burnham
lambert
inc
and
bear
stearns
company
ken
have
a
relationship
with
bear
stearns
but
the
firm
be
hesitant
to
do
the
deal
believe
it
be
premature
it
take
some
strategy
work
one
against
the
other
we
finally
told
bear
stearns
that
merrill
lynch
be
interested
in
do
the
deal
oh
in
that
case
we
will
do
it
bear
stearns
respond
bear
stearns
agree
to
do
an
over
the
counter
public
offering
of

stock
in
september
we
list
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
in
total
size
of
the
deal
be
go
to
be
million
share
at
half
the
money
would
be
use
to
redeem
the
prefer
stock
that
ken
and
his
investment
group
bought
for
million
and
the
rest
would
go
into
the
operation
of
the
business
take
a
company
public
require
a
magical
mystical
combination
of
dazzle
number
personality
and
a
little
sleight
of
hand
as
the
more
flamboyant
member
of
our
partnership
i
be
the
natural
choice
to
be
our
main
conduit
with
wall
street
ron
brill
and
i
conduct
more
than
percent
of
our
dog
and
pony
show
in
new
york
and
around
the
country
promote
the
upcoming
stock
offering
i
love
to
sell
and
this
be
a
fabulous
opportunity
arthur
and
ron
be
great
with
number
but
the
street
want
to
hear
our
dream
and
aspiration
that
s
why
ron
would
cringe
when
they
d
hear
me
speak
of
thing
such
as
reach
a
thousand
store
or
have
stock
value
at
or
more
i
live
in
the
future
but
the
wall
street
wizard
love
to
come
and
hear
me
pontificate
bombast
and
all
even
if
they
view
die
company
somewhat
skeptically
at
the
time
reflect
that
skepticism
bear
stearns
have
a
terrible
time
get
the
deal
do
the
ipo
water
be
very
choppy
at
the
time
and
we
be
unlike
anything
go
in
the
home
improvement
industry
let
alone
retail
in
general
bear
stearns
put
together
a
syndicate
of
broker
who
guaranteed
that
they
would
sell
the
share
of
our
stock
in
theory
they
would
take
advance
order
and
then
tell
us
okay
now
that
we
have
the
order
we
be
go
to
collectively
buy
the
share
well
to
our
utter
dismay
the
atlanta
office
of
bear
stearns
decide
it
didn
t
think
the
home
depot
offering
be
a
good
deal
it
didn
t
want
to
sell
any
of
the
stock
and
return
its
quota
to
the
syndicate
that
cause
a
major
problem
the
syndicate
have
to
find
somebody
else
to
lake
it
atlanta
s
decision
not
to
buy
the
deal
make
others
question
its
value
if
the
bear
stearns
office
in
the
home
depot
s
own
backyard
wouldn
t
buy
in
how
could
we
convince
someone
in
new
york
twenty
year
and
several
billion
dollar
later
we
still
haven
t
forgotten
that
incident
of
course
the
stock
do
extraordinarily
well
and
the
atlanta
office
look
bad
not
us
on
september
the
day
before
the
ipo
bear
stearns
call
and
say
they
intend
to
sell
only
half
the
deal
s
million
instead
of
million
we
be
angry
but
unfortunately
we
be
not
in
control
ken
be
force
to
contact
the
original
investor
fella
he
say
it
be
this
simple
if
we
don
t
take
the
money
bear
stearns
can
raise
for
us
even
though
it
be
only
half
of
what
we
want
we
be
either
go
to
have
to
put
the
money
up
ourselves
to
keep
the
company
go
or
the
home
depot
be
go
to
go
out
of
business
there
be
no
interest
in
put
up
any
more
money
so
ken
put
together
a
deal
convert
the
investment
group
s
prefer
stock
into
common
stock
they
end
up
with
approximately
share
of
common
stock
for
each
unit
of
prefer
stock
today
that
unit
be
the
equivalent
of
at
least
share
of
stock
and
worth
more
than
million
in
the
conversion
from
private
to
public
company
we
have
our
first
opportunity
to
take
some
equity
out
of
the
company
this
be
our
first
opportunity
to
become
liquid
financially
and
pay
off
our
own
personal
debt
i
sell
share
of
stock
for
million
arthur
and
pat
sell
each
for
million
today
the
combine
value
of
that
stock
we
sell
would
be
million
share
or
more
than
billion
worth
of
stock
by
the
way
ken
didn
t
choose
to
sell
any
one
of
the
reason
we
need
the
public
offering

to
finance
our
first
four

in
south
florida
the
first
two

almost
simultaneously
with

later
this

stroke
of

close
down
all

of
its
treasure
island
store
they
have
held
off
the
inevitable
for
a
long
time
because
they
didn
t
want
wall

cognizant
of
how
frightful
the

for
many

it

they

those
rumor
seriously
affected
hire
we
be
force
to
open
with
a
bare
minimum
of
associate
because
potential
hire
be
skeptical
of
their
future
with
us
still
opening
those
first
store
be
great
fun
although
everybody
work
around
the
clock
the
night
before
we
open
the
fort
lauderdale
store
be
a
mess
a
total
disaster
from
pack
out
box
for
week
late
that
night
charlie
barnes
organize
everybody
at
the
back
of
the
building
and
they
literally
march
in
a
line
to
the
front
of
the
store
pick
up
all
the
garbage
that
be
lie
around
as
he
now
knew
well
than
anyone
we
want
a
warehouse
look
not
a
dump
when
we
finally
open
our
door
on
september
shade
of
homeco
there
be
already
a
line
around
the
building
hundred
of
people
wait
to
get
in
why
an
ingenious
arthur
blank
promotion
ceiling
fan
they
cost
us
arthur
be
in
the
back
of
the
store
that
day
beneath
the
fan
cloud
wear
his
orange
apron
ready
to
wait
on
customer
but
he
never
stood
a
chance
as
we
be
overwhelmed
by
a
throng
of
customer
use
to
pay
and
more
for
the
very
same
inch
caribbean
breeze
fan
they
weren
t
interested
in
talk
they
just
want
to
buy
buy
buy
we
have
fan
stack
everywhere
but
people
be
flow
in
like
water
run
through
the
aisle
it
be
a
frenzy
unlike
anything
we
ever
saw
in
atlanta
everybody
figure
the
fan
price
be
a
gimmick
a
bait
and
switch
tactic
that
we
probably
have
limited
quantity
so
when
we
open
they
ran
through
the
store
look
for
these
import
asian
ceiling
fan
we
sell
out
our
vast
stock
immediately
but
vendor
david
moss
of
moss
manufacturing
have
a
full
warehouse
and
he
kept
us
well
supply
by
the
end
of
the
first
weekend
we
sell
fan
we
didn
t
have
an
import
department
in
the
early
day
so
moss
be
kind
of
our
importer
of
record
sell
us
ceiling
fan
and
roll
up
mini
blind
he
be
an
innovator
go
to
the
orient
for
product
moss
be
interest
to
watch
because
he
be
do
to
us
what
we
be
try
to
do
to
the
public
around
us
offer
a
huge
broad
selec
tion
at
a
great
price
he
give
us
a
leg
up
on
the
cost
side
where
we
could
sell
ceiling
fan
for
and
still
make
on
each
whereas
that
same
fan
would
have
cost
us
from
a
stateside
distributor
the
next
day
incidentally
we
have
a
bona
fide
problem
but
nothing
like
we
ever
encounter
before
in
adanta
the
bank
wouldn
t
take
our
deposit
it
be
more
than
and
in
south
florida
the
banker
be
very
sensitive
and
suspicious
about
large
cash
deposit
as
we
have
run
the
business
we
have
all
learn
a
lot
of
new
thing
but
that
be
something
we
never
expect
we
have
never
be
right
on
anticipate
demand
for
fan
ever
arthur
start
us
in
the
fan
business
and
it
kept
grow
and
grow
and
grow
and
become
an
incredible
business
but
we
reach
a
point
at
which
we
be
either
so
out
of
stock
or
so
overstock
that
pat

myself
so
pat
take
it
over
and
proceed
to
make
the
same
mistake
one
of
the
best
way
to
illustrate
the
fan
problem
be
by
tell
a
story
about
our
longtime
lumber
buyer
cecil
wilson

say
just
as
much
sometimes
more
than
what
a
district
manager
say
if
they
re
right
that
s
because
the
salesperson
touch
the
customer
more
talc
care
of
our
people
be
understand
that
every
position
in
the
company
be
critical
i
think
of
the
sale
associate
as
the
spinal
cord
of
this
company
they
hold
the
home
depot
erect
the
person
the
customer
be
go
to
interact
with
the
person
who
be
go
to
build
the
image
of
this
company
with
the
customer
be
always
go
to
be
a
sale
associate
they
be
the
one
who
will
have
the
product
knowledge
and
be
able
to
show
the
customer
how
to
use
it
they
be
the
hero
of
the
company
the
one
who
create
a
cult
among
our
customer
we
re
try
to
make
our
customer
bleed
orange
since
customer
in
the
store
be
the
center
of
our
universe
we
want
everyone
alphe
home
depot
to
feel
responsible
when
it
come
to
meeting
their
need
whether
they
be
a
senior
manager
with
an
office
in
our
store
support
center
in
atlanta
or
the
salesperson
or
cashier
in
one
of
the
store
in
fact
associate
on
the
sale
floor
be
in
many
way
more
empower
to
make
decision
than
people
at
store
support
simply
because
they
be
at
ground
zero
we
don
t
want
anyone
leave
a
home
depot
store
unhappy
so
it
s
the
job
of
people
work
in
the
store
to
do
whatever
it
take
to
make
customer
happy
that
give
them
broad
discretion
to
take
action
that
kind
of
power
also
require
the
kind
of
person
who
know
how
to
exercise
it
and
when
to
do
so
this
be
a
tough
place
to
work
if
you
be
inflexible
if
you
come
to
the
home
depot
from
a
company
where
you
checked
the
policy
and
procedure
book
before
make
a
decision
you
may
not
fit
in
well
at
the
home
depot
the
associate
described
in
bernie
s
golf
story
be
more
than
just
an
employee
he
wasn
t
solely
focus
on
make
the
high
possible
sale
today
but
on
cultivate
a
customer
who
will
eventually
spend
much
more
than
at
the
home
depot
over
his
lifetime
if
this
associate
didn
t
think
he
be
be
take
care
of
he
probably
wouldn
t
have
take
the
trouble
to
do
all
the
right
thing
with
that
customer
but
the
single
most
important
reason
for
the
home
depot
s
success
be
our
effort
to
take
care
of
our
associate
treat
our
associate
well
include
provide
them
with
the
opportunity
and
training
to
progress
into
a
meaningful
and
reward
career
when
we
left
sandy
sigoloff
and
handy
dan
we
have
make
a
ton
of
money
for
them
but
walk
away
with
nothing
we
vowed
that
if
the
home
depot
be
successful
everyone
who
work
here
would
have
a
chance
to
share
in
the
wealth
we
pay
people
what
they
be
worth
that
be
a
cornerstone
of
the
culture
of
our
company
that
mean
that
if
an
electrician
come
into
our
store
and
can
be
productive
and
sell
a
lot
of
electrical

they

a

we

them
at
that
rate
traditionally
we

as

overall
our

with
us
more
than
one

rare
after
that
they
tend
to
picture
themselves
building
a
career
at
the
home
depot
some
people
find
our
attitude
toward
customer
and
associate
a
little
hard
to
believe
but
what
make
us
so
different
from
anyone
else
in
our
industry
be
that
we
take
the
invert
management
structure
so
seriously
hourly
associate
really
do
lead
the
home
depot
every
day
their
decision
make
and
independence
make
our
store
well
and
that
reinforces
customer
loyalty
bernie
and
i
believe
it
s
all
about
trust
with
the
right
value
system
and
the
right
knowledge
to
do
their
job
people
can
be
trust
to
make
the
right
decision
if
you
can
operate
with
that
kind
of
trust
you
don
t
have
to
micromanage
and
people
will
do
more
good
for
the
company
than
anyone
could
ever
dictate
a
healthy
successful
grow
organization
provide
opportunity
to
all
kind
of
people
this

would
not
be
possible

experience
of
our

their
entrepreneurial
and
creative
spirit

the

of
the

we

of
their
story
jeff

who
be
now
a
district

in
central
florida
be
typical
of
our
first
hire
men
and
woman
who

a
point
where
we
have
delivery
seven
day
between
that
and
his
regular
responsibility
barrington
easily
put
in
his
share
of
seventy
hour
workweek
but
that
wasn
t
an
issue
for
him
he
be
a
team
player
whatever
it
take
to
get
the
job
do
barrington
do
it
barrington
be
typical
of
hundred
and
lai
er
thousand
of
home
depot
associate
whose
hunger
for
product
knowledge
and
vision
of
opportunity
in
the
company
cause
them
to
spend
much
of
their
mealtime
and
other
break
on
the
sale
floor
reading
the
back
of
box
and
eavesdropping
on
conversation
between
customer
and
sale
associate
because
of
change
in
the
labor
law
we
ve
become
much
stricter
about
hourly
people
work
for
the
home
depot
off
the
clock
they
recognize
this
company
s
inherent
burgeon

for
inform
motivate
staff
who
could
step
up
take
responsibility
and
be
promote
quickly
through
a
system
that
reward
and
encourage
entrepreneurial
spirit
and
risk
this
company
become
a
bastion
of
opportunity
for
men
and
woman
like
barrington
many
with
no
more
than
a
high
school
education
to
reach
out
and
grab
the
brass
ring
of
success
soon
barrington
move
up
from
lot
attendant
to
be

after
which
the

containment
band
be
cut
back
in
the

lumber
rack
and
put
the

and
other
assort

in
a

which
he
wheel
to
a

a
half
taller
barrington
roll
his

as
always
push
it
up
against
the
dumpster

reduce
the
regular
retail
price
on
these
item
put
them
out
on
the
sale
floor
and
give
customer
at
least
an
opportunity
to
purchase
something
that
be
damage
but
might
take
care
of
their
need
and
of
course
the
home
depot
would
make
a
little
money
ron

through

ron
make
it
his
business

make
every
nickel

he
understood
that

he
wasn
t
preach
to
barrington

in
a
rather
unique
way
how
he
protects
the
company
s
asset
if
a
company
s
value
be
nothing
more
than

see
they
re
a
fantasy

an
inspiration
to
barrington

of

yesterday
at
six
in
the
morning
and
you
be
just
go
home
now
yeah
the
next
day
khano
work
all
day
and
all
night
again
do
all
the
thing
she
felt
need
to
be
do
before
her
store
open
in
the
morning
once
more
i
pass
her
on
her
way
out
and
my
way
in
i
say
hello
shook
my
head
and
add
good
bye
then
i
call
the
district
manager
and
ask
be
linda
khano
here
all
night
i
don
t
know
he
say
maybe
that
day
i
write
and
circulate
a
memo
that
marked
the
end
of
the
first
home
depot
era
nobody
will
stay
in
a
store
past
midnight
anymore
i
write
we
do
not
want
to
kill
our
people
the
problem
be
that
we
all
work
hard
but
we
didn
t
work
smart
a
highly
motivate
workforce
will
fly
right
into
the
sun
they
get
so
energize
about
what
they
be
do
that
they
don
t
realize
they
be
damage
themselves
physically
we
eventually
put
into
effect
a
guideline
that
store
manager
and
their
assistant
should
work
an
average
of
only
hour
a
week
that
be
our
goal
somebody
on
the
outside
might
say
wow
that
s
a
lot
of
hour
but
that
s
not
us
look
to
increase
their
hour
that
s
an
effort
to
decrease
their
hour
people
need
a
balance
life
they
need
to
use
their
time
well
our
people
have
so
much
pride
and
dedication
to
their
work
that
they
would
not
accept
anything
less
than
the
best
from
themselves
they
want
their
sale
area
to
look
good
they
want
to
be
ready
for
the
customer
they
want
to
really
do
well
it
be
a
lot
of
hard
work
to
really
be
number
one
we
re
wiser
now
and
try
to
do
thing
smart
not
hard
r
st
r
lynn
martineau
who
be
now
president
of
our
western
division
have
an
early
encounter
with
bernie
on
the
floor
of
the
doraville
georgia
store
that
become
a
commonplace
occurrence
for
other
associate
through
the
year
you
know
lynn
bernie
say
i
didn
t
hire
you
to
do
because
you
be
go
to
have
to
do
anyway
i
hire
you
to
think
that
be
a
powerful
statement
come
from
a
founder
of
the
company
it
be
probably
one
of
the
most
empower
statement
that
a
young
person
could
hear
through
your
eye
and
through
your
knowledge
we
learn
what
be
go
on
with
the
customer
bernie
say
we
need
to
listen
to
you
these
people
men
and
woman
although
predominantly
men
at
the
time
literally
have
workday
where
they
come
in
as
the
sun
be
rise
and
didn
t
leave
again
until
the
next
sunup
it
be
a
fun
excite
place
an
environment
not
likely
to
be
duplicate
in
these
politically
correct
time
we
never
ask
our
manager
and
associate
to
do
anything
we
wouldn
t
do
if
an
associate
picked
something
up
off
the
floor
it
be
because
we
do
it
first
we
set
the
example
few
people
ever
felt
that
they
be
work
for
somebody
hopefully
it
be
more
like
they
be
work
with
somebody
everything
be
hand
in
hand
so
if
we
be
in
the
store
sell
on
saturday
and
sunday
we
didn
t
have
any
hesitation
to
expect
it
of
anyone
else
work
the
weekend
shift
as
a
matter
of
fact
be
require
of
all
manager
no
exception
if
we
didn
t
have
a
product
the
customer
need
we
d
take
their
name
and
address
and
promise
to
get
it
that
same
day
it
didn
t
matter
where
we
have
to
go
it
didn
t
matter
if
we
have
to
get
in
our
personal
car
pay
a
competitor
the
full
retail
price
and
then
drive
to
the
customer
s
home
late
at
night
whatever
it
take
serve
the
customer
that
s
why
so
many
of
our
longtime
customer
in
the
atlanta
area
tell
story
of
bernie
or
me
roll
into
their
driveway
with
the
sherwin
williams
paint
they
need
though
our
store
didn
t
even
carry
that
brand
or
if
a
delivery
truck
wasn
t
available
we
d
strap
a
piece
of
unfinished
furniture
to
the
roof
of
one
of
our
car
and
haul
it
wherever
it
need
to
go
our
manager
always
work
weekend
they
always
work
two
or
three
night
at
least
there
wasn
t
a
nine
to
five
schedule
for
any
body
even
ken
langone
would
come
down
from
new
york
roll
up
his
sleeve
and
go
to
work
that
rubbed
off
on
associate
too
when
one
of
our
store
manager
heard
a
police
officer
complain
about
the
service
he
receive
at
another
home
depot
store
the
manager
give
him
a
big
discount
on
the
product
he
want
why
be
you
apologize
the
cop
ask
it
be
not
your
store
i
have
the
problem
with
because
the
manager
explain
it
be
my
company
you
have
a
problem
with
i
don
t
want
you
go
anyplace
else
he
probably
gain
us
a
customer
for
life
that
manager
treat
all
the
customer
who
walk
into
his
store
like
they
be
his
best
friend
and
when
bryant
scott
hire
as
a
lot
engineer
now
president
of
our
expo
store
division
heard
us
talk
about
treat
the
customer
like
they
re
your
own
family
he
take
that
to
heart
he
come
from
a
very
close
knit
family
and
thought
that
be
a
heck
of
an
idea
what
aren
t
you
go
to
do
for
your
best
friend
what
aren
t
you
go
to
do
for
your
dad
that
be
what
you
need
to
do
for
your
customer
j
fl
ken
langone
attend
a
holiday
party
put
on
by
one
of
our
store
manager
a
few
year
ago
the
store
s
department
head
for
light
told
him
a
little
story
that
night
that
begin
thus
i
probably
be
go
to
lose
my
job
when
i
tell
you
but
he
have
forty
customer
all
regular
who
all
want
a
new
black
decker
snake
light
we
be
all
out
he
say
but
i
get
them
anyway
tell
me
what
you
do
ken
say
first
i
call
up
all
the
other
home
depot
store
in
our
district
and
ask
if
i
could
get
some
of
their
light
and
they
all
say
no
they
need
all
they
have
but
at
least
i
found
out
which
store
have
them
so
i
get
in
my
car
drove
to
those
store
and
i
bought
the
light
i
need
with
my
home
depot
credit
card
then
he
continued
his
tone
a
mixture
of
pride
and
fear
of
lose
his
job
i
brought
them
back
to
my
store
and
i
get
a
refund
then
i
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
counter
picked
up
the
forty
light
and
call
my
forty
customer
i
get
your
light
on
the
spot
ken
call
me
at
home
arthur
ken
say
after
repeat
the
story
we
have
to
send
this
guy
a
letter
congratulate
him
for
ingenuity
then
i
want
to
talk
to
pat
about
see
if
this
guy
want
to
become
a
merchant

we
get
new
associate
several
way
most
come
to
us
but
sometimes
we
go
out
look
for
them
for
example
when
we
open
our
first
store
in
evanston
illinois
our
store
manager
visit
the
local
builder
square
and
menard
s
scout
the
talent
she
would
feign
ignorance
of
product
try
to
uncover
the
competition
s
best
smartest
and
friendliest
people
one
day
she
be
in
a
container
store
look
for
something
that
she
actually
need
the
person
who
wait
on
her
be
so
friendly
she
say
here
s
my
card
come
and
see
me
if
a
salesperson
approach
her
first
that
be
a
good
first
step
that
mean
the
person
be
friendly
outgo
not
afraid
of
customer
s
that
be
the
most
important
thing
because
you
can
teach
anyone
about
a
drill
but
you
ca
not
teach
people
how
to
smile
and
be
kind
to
other
people
next
she
ll
ask
them
for
something
specific
if
they
point
and
say
yeah
go
down
three
row
turn
left
and
it
s
probably
halfway
down
on
the
right
then
she
know
they
be
not
really
into
customer
service
but
if
they
say
let
me
show
you
where
it
be
they
might
be
home
depot
material
if
they
try
to
help
that
s
a
good
sign
if
they
don
t
know
an
answer
and
say
i
really
don
t
know
but
let
me
get
someone
for
you
who
do
that
be
another
plus
if
they
appear
to
know
a
great
deal
about
something
then
she
ll
pepper
them
with
more
probe
question
how
do
it
work
what
s
well
in
your
opinion
at
one
competitor
s
store
she
saw
somebody
kill
time
push
label
and
absentmindedly
move
product
around
the
shelf
she
purposely
stood
right
next
to
him
just
to
see
if
he
would
budge
he
didn
t
she
even
rubbed
her
foot
against
his
foot
and
say
excuse
me
he
didn
t
say
anything
he
just
move
over
we
say
thank
god
for
people
like
that
because
they
work
for
the
competition
and
more
power
to
them
there
be
a
cultural
adjustment
that
must
take
place
for
anyone
to
be
valuable
to
this
company
at
any
level
whether
vice
president
store
manager
or
cashier
there
be
all
sort
of
baggage
that
people
bring
to
the
company
from
their
prior
work
experience
that
we
have
to
lovingly
strip
away
at
handy
city
where
one
of
our
associate
work
before
join
us
everything
have
to
be
really
neat
employee
there
always
carry
a
duster
around
like
french
maid
brushing
thing
off
and
keep
the
shelf
in
perfect
order
like
nordstrom
might
after
he
join
us
this
guy
once
spent
hour
organize
a
very
attractive
display
of
wallpaper
and
glue
product
he
be
very
proud
of
it
the
next
morning
he
stroll
around
the
corner
head
held
high
to
inspect
his
work
but
what
he
saw
make
him
mad
pat
farrah
be
stand
in
front
of
the
display
and
he
didn
t
like
it
at
all
as
he
be
inclined
to
do
from
time
to
time
pat
be
throw
it
all
to
the
floor
what
the
hell
be
you
do
the
associate
scream
in
dismay
i
want
this
store
to
look
like
a
warehouse
i
want
cut
case
not
this
pretty
stuff
pat
say
but
to
this
associate
pat
s
approach
wasn
t
in
the
least
professional
not
his
preference
for
display
and
certainly
not
his
people
skill
don
t
you
ever
do
that
just
then
a
store
manager
cut
the
associate
off
hey
that
s
pat
farrah
he
be
a
vice
president
of
the
company
don
t
talk
to
him
like
that
i
don
t
care
the
associate
say
i
m
not
let
anybody
do
something
like
that
to
my
work
that
associate
s
situation
illustrate
our
early
challenge
of
get
new
employee
enculturated
with
our
value
he
come
from
a

chain
where
he
be
encourage
and
reward
for
keep
product
and
shelf
in
perfect
order
if
you
recall
how
angry
we
be
the
night
before
our
first
store
open
when
the
manager
want
to
surprise
us
by
cleaning
and
wax
the
floor
you
ll
understand
why
the
associate
s
neat
and
order
approach
didn
t
belong
in
a
home

of
chaos
deliberately
mess
up
a
cherished
display

a
matter
of
enculturation

us
to
clean
up
our
room
we
teach
our
associate
to
be
messy
we
don
t
have
time
in
the
store
for
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its

to
wait
on
and
product
be

and

too
fast
for
that
besides

about
the
pump
on
display
look
closer
she
could
see
that
pat
have
write
his
name
and
the
date
in
the
dust
on
the
pump
anticipate
come
back
the
next
time
and
see
it
again
he
be
challenge
her
not
to
dust
the
place
but
to
rearrange
the
product
to
get
it
notice
and
sell
or
send
it
back
to
the
manufacturer
home
depot
merchandise
shouldn
t
be
in
stock
long
enough
to
collect
dust
as
a
company
that
hire
new
people
every
week
one
of
our
critical
belief
be
that
you
can
t
overlook
anyone
as
a
possible
source
of
associate
talent
there
be
good
people
everywhere
and
age
race
gender
mobility
and
even
physical
or
other
disability
should
play
no
role
in
a
person
s
opportunity
to
become
a
home
depot
associate
we
have
often
hire
people
with
down
s
syndrome
who
have
some
limitation
but
be
thrill
to
work
in
our
environment
and
because
of
their
dedication
they
inspire
their
coworkers
we
also
believe
in
hire
senior
citizen
we
refer
to
them
as
bernie
boy
and
girl
because
bernie
be
the
original
champion
of
this
outreach
they
be
gray
haired
people
who
be
basically
retire
but
who
want
to
work
and
we
hire
them
they
be
great
teacher
we
don
t
care
about
their
age
in
florida
we
have
an
associate
who
be
hire
at
the
age
of
after
twenty
five
year
in
the
hardware
business
he
felt
retirement
be
too
dull
for
him
be
there
another
company
in
america
that
would
do
something
like
that
in
bernie
visit
the
home
depot
store
in
boynton
beach
florida
an
old
man
come
over
and
start
hug
him
you
change
my
life
he
say
i
be
the
happiest
person
in
the
world
that
s
terrific
bernie
say
you
don
t
understand
he
say
you
hire
me
five
year
ago
when
i
be
nobody
else
would
hire
me
then
he
say
let
me
introduce
you
to
some
of
my
coworkers
and
he
brought
over
a
whole
cadre
of
guy
and
one
woman
who
be
all
in
their
s
in
fact
one
guy
be
in
his
s
bernie
go
to
the
general
store
manager
lamar
mike
and
compliment
him
on
these
associate
and
their
enthusiasm
i
just
let
them
loose
mike
say
these
be
the
great
they
train
people
for
me
so
when
we
talk
about
hire
the
best
number
one
be
people
with
experience
and
number
two
people
who
don
t
have
experience
but
be
willing
to
learn
and
want
to
learn
who
have
that
desire
to
learn
a
manager
interview
people
have
to
be
able
to
separate
these
people
out
that
be
a
critical
factor
and
once
you
have
them
you
must
invest
the
time
and
the
energy
into
training
them
few
associate
ever
hire
could
inspire
more
loyalty
and
devotion
in
both
customer
and
home
depot
associate
than

knowledge
be
truly
extraordinary
we
didn
t
have
computerize

then
like
we
do
now
where
our
technology
can
analyze
any
color
and
create
a
match
for
it
back
then
we
just
have
gene
he
could
eyeball
anything
and
color
match
it
and
he
d
wriie
the

you
could

he

of
the
century

everything

of
paint
on

gene
always
told
us
the
potential

tremendous
one
of
these
day
i
m
go
to
get
that
potential
everybody
remembers
gene
for
a
different
reason
some
remember
him
as
a
tireless
trainer
of
our
young
associate
he
always
have
a
joke
or
a
wise
word
for
somebody

be
always
cover
with
his
humorous
handwritten
sign
husband
be
not
permit

but
they
be
permit
to
pay
for
them
we
ask
you
to
please
refrain
from
groan
while

it
take
michelangelo
four
year

the
sistine

if
he

he
would
have
have
it
do
in
seven
day
if
the

your
house

do
not

this
extremely
gift
talented
good
look

while
mix

gene
the
purpose
of
the
sign
wasn
t
to
show
off
how
clever
he
be
it
be
to
amuse
customer
wait
in
line
to
see
him
because
every
day
of
the
week
long
line
of
people
queue
up
to
get
gene
s
advice
he
would
hold
court
in
the
middle
of
the
department
and
spend
whatever
time
be
necessary
to
answer
each
person
s
question
match
paint
or
solve
paint
related
problem
we
have
plenty
of
other
qualifled
associate
but
if
gene
be
on
duty
the
customer
prefer
to
wait
for
him
and
if
someone
come
in
look
for
gene
only
to
discover
it
be
his
day
off
they
d
leave
and
come
back
on
a
day
when
he
be
work
i
want
to
wait
on
that
customer
the

way
i
want
to
be

on
when

gene
say
i

as
much
as
possible
i
want
that
customer
to
keep
come
back
to
me
and
to
me
only
the
kid
always
come
around
look
for
gene
too
his
apron
always
have
an
extra
lollipop
in
it
whereas
our
associate
be
expect
to
wait
on
customer
and
restock
shelf
gene
be
the
exception
recognize
his
extraordinary
value
to
their
department
his
coworkers
cover
his
share
of
the
restock
chore
so
he
have
more
time
to
spend
one
on
one
with
customer
when
the
home

get
call
or

the

receives
a
customer
service
badge
to
sew
on
his

five
badge
a
year
gene
who
be
with
us
for
fifteen
year
have
so
many
more
than
four
hundred
of
them
they
cover
several
apron
if
we
have
to
describe
our
idea
of
customer
service
in
a
picture
instead
of

that
picture
would
be
of
gene
lewis
not
everyone
have
be
impressed
with
our
hire
practice
however
on
september
the
home
depot
without
admit
any
wrongdoing
enter
into
a
settlement
agreement
with
plaintiff
in
the
class
action
lawsuit
butler
et
al
v
home
depot
inc
in
which
the
plaintiff
assert
claim
of
gender
discrimination
in
hire
and
promotion
we
subsequently
reach
agreement
to
settle
three
other
individual
lawsuit
each
of
which
involve
claim
of
gender
discrimination
as
a
result
of
these
agreement
we
paid
million
to
the
plaintiff
class
member
and
million
to
the
plaintiff
attorney
in
butler
and
approximately
million
for
other
related
internal
cost
include
development
implementation
or
enhancement
of
certain
human
resource
program
as
well
as
the
settlement
term
of
the
three
other
lawsuit
be
there
ever
any
individual
case
of
discrimination
in
our
company
base
on
gender
race
religion
or
something
else
probably
the
issue
for
us
as
founder
however
be
this
do
our
company
policy
foster
what
the
law
defines
as
a
pattern
or
policy
that
support
discrimination
the
answer
be
no
do
we
have
mechanism
in
place
so
that
if
we
find
discrimination
it
be
dealt
with
effectively
and
quickly
we
always
felt
that
we
do
and
still
feel
that
we
do
from
a
personal
standpoint
the
accusation
in
the
suit
be
so
degree
oppose
to
our
personal
philosophy
that
in
that
sense
it
be
a
shock
the
nature
of
employment
class
action
have
change
in
the
last
few
year
in
the
law
change
to
give
victim
of
employment
discrimination
additional
remedy
they
can
now
get
general
and
punitive
damage
as
well
as
back
pay
they
can
also
have
a
jury
decide
the
issue
as
oppose
to
a
judge
which
have
lead
to
a
huge
increase
in
the
number
of
discrimination
case
and
class
action
the
oakland
california
law
firm
that
represent
the
plaintiff
in
our
case
saperstein
goldstein
demchak
baller
have
already
be
extremely
successful
with
a
gender
discrimination
class
action
formula
that
they
have
brought
chiefly
against
grocery
store
such
as
lucky
store
albertson
s
and
publix
the
issue
they
make
in
those
suit
be
that
at
grocery
store
the
front
end
the
cash
register
be
chiefly
staffed
by
female
meanwhile
sale
and
management
position
be
primarily
fill
by
male
in
my
mind
there
s
no
intuitive
reason
why
that
would
be
the
case
in
a
grocery
store
no
obvious
reason
but
there
be
an
obvious
reason
why
that
would
be
so
in
a
home
depot
our
competitive
advantage
be
have
knowledgeable
salesperson
people
who
know
how
to
sell
and
use
electrical
product
power
tool
building
material
and
lumber
people
who
have
experience
in
the
construction
trade
and
can
educate
and
train
our
customer
in
how
to
use
the
product
we
recruit
in
the
construction
trade
it
be
no
secret
that
the
construction
trade
be
predominantly
male
in
fact
a
scant
percent
of
the
people
work
in
these
trade
be
female
if
you
look
at
our
industry
and
the
building
trade
twenty
year
ago
there
be
very
few
woman
in
plumbing
electrical
lumber
and
mill
work
it
be
very
difficult
for
us
to
recruit
woman
who
have
professional
experience
in
those
area
back
then
we
employ
many
male
cashier
because
there
be
not
enough
woman
who
want
to
work
in
the
dust
and
noise
of
a
home
improvement
center
many
woman
felt
intimidate
by
product
they
didn
t
understand
and
didn
t
use
the
home
depot
be
a
great
big
warehouse
and
a
warehouse
be
not
a
magnet
to
large
number
of
woman
over
the
year
however
the
addition
of
indoor
and
outdoor
garden
department
and
window
treatment
brought
woman
into
the
store
as
customer
and
associate
before
long
woman
be
work
in
all
department
of
the
store
include
lumber
but
it
be
true
that
there
be
a
statistical
disparity
between
the
number
of
men
and
woman
at
the
home
depot
and
in
this
modern
enlighten
age
that
be
the
start
point
for
these
lawsuit
but
we
contend
there
be
a
good
reason
that
that
statistical
disparity
exists
and
that
reason
be
not
discrimination
it
be
due
to
the
qualification
and
choice
of
the
applicant
and
candidate
for
the
position
at
the
home
depot
not
a
deliberate
policy
of
exclusion
or
discrimination
we
want
our
manager
to
have
merchandising
experience
we
want
them
to
be
familiar
with
handle
demonstrate
and
display
home
improvement
product
turnover
and
return
rate
these
be
skill
need
to
run
a
store
that
generally
require
sale
experience
as
oppose
to
work
a
cash
register
but
the
saperstein
firm
have
be
incredibly
successful
in
get
huge
settlement
out
of
the
grocery
industry
and
so
when
they
look
for
other
company
that
parallel
the
business
against
whom
they
have
already
won
settlement
they
come
after
us
to
us
it
seem
just
outrageous
because
we
pride
ourselves
on
have
knowledgeable
salesperson
and
it
seem
self
evident
why
the
number
be
the
way
they
be
our
salesperson
be
predominately
male
and
we
typically
promote
from
within
so
our
management
rank
be
predominantly
male
too
these
be
legitimate
nondiscrim
inatory
reason
that
be
absolutely
obvious
to
anybody
who
work
at
the
feme
depot
but
because
of
our
sheer
size
the
plaintiff
have
the
begin
of
a
class
action
and
they
take
it
all
the
way
in
retrospect
we
be
especially
vulnerable
because
we
do
not
have
a
very
structure
computerize
objective
way
of
select
candidate
at
that
time
we
didn
t
computerize
information
on
application
about
previous
job
and
our
manager
conduct
free
form
interview
so
although
it
be
obvious
to
us
that
we
weren
t
discriminatory
and
that
we
have
good
reason
for
the
way

we
decide
to

two
phase
from
december
until
january
our
case

the
strategy
meeting
be
intend
to
educate
bernie
about
what
a
class
action
be
and
how
it
might
unfold
both
legally
and
in

they
go

about

and
he
use
the
s
word
settlement
he
didn
t
exactly
advocate
settlement
but
suggest
that
it
be
definitely
an
option
we
should
keep
in
our
mind
because
this
could
get
very
expensive
and
very
public
bernie
picked
up
his
knife
and
point
it
at
brown
s
throat
never
say
that
word
again
bernie
say
everyone
laugh
but
his
point
be
clear
he
be
adamant
that
we
be
go
to
have
our
day
in
court
there
would
be
no
settlement
no
inadvertent
admission
of
wrongdoing
as
founder
of
the
company
still
intimately
involve
in
run
the
home
depot
we
take
this
battle
very
personally
in
january
federal
district
court
judge
susan
illston
certify
the
plaintiff
class
include
possibly
as
many
as
female
applicant
even
though
not
one
have
complain
we
go
into
an
intense
discovery
phase
video
deposition
begin
in
all
produce
enough
document
to
fill
entire
room
it
be
a
mammoth
litigation
bernie
and
i
as
well
as
the
entire
board
of
director
and
senior
management
of
the
company
be
sicken
by
the
eventual
settlement
both
in
term
of
the
dollar
figure
we
give
out
and
the
concession
it
imply
but
even
i
must
concede
now
that
it
be
absolutely
the
right
decision
because
we
conclude
two
key
thing
be
against
us
the
judge
and
the
jury
susan
illston
be
not
the
first
judge
on
the
case
the
first
judge
be
federal
district
court
judge
vaughn
walker
in
the
precertifica
lion
phase
we
be
encourage
by
die
way
he
kept
a
very
strict
rein
on
the
plaintiff
however
one
week
before
we
be
due
to
argue
against
die
motion
for
class
certification
he
hand
the
case
off
to
a
new
appointment
to
the
bench
illston
who
have
make
her
career
in
plaintiff
security
class
action
she
have
actualty
be
co
counsel
with
the
other
firm
represent
plaintiff
in
this
case
lieff
cabraser
heiman
bernstein
llp
of
san
francisco
on
the
basis
of
this
knowledge
we
move
that
the
judge
should
recuse
herself
a
formal
request
that
she
step
down
because
of
the
possibility
or
appearance
of
bias
she
deny
our
motion
and
of
course
it
didn
t
endear
us
to
her
illston
be
a
very
bright
woman
a
very
ambitious
woman
but
pro
plaintiff
in
term
of
class
action
however
she
do
give
us
plenty
of
opportunity
to
argue
that
the
class
action
vehicle
be
inappropriate
and
whenever
our
team
argue
issue
before
her
tiiey
always
felt
she
listen
to
them
and
often
seem
to
be
sort
of
nod
her
assent
but
then
she
would
issue
an
order
that
be
completely
against
us
as
the
process
intensified
she
rule
in
the
plaintiff
favor
on
virtually
all
of
our
pretrial
motion
then
two
week
before
trial
she
not
only
order
the
party
to
mediate
but
she
also
impose
a
limit
of
hour
per
side
to
present
the
case
to
the
jury
when
you
consider
that
the
potential
class
be
maybe
female
the
idea
that
we
would
be
able
to
defend
against
these
broadranging
allegation
involve
a
class
that
big
in
only
hour
of
trial
time
be
devastate
to
us
the
plaintiff
would
be
able
to
broadbrush
their
allegation
by
put
on
a
few
sympathetic
witness
what
make
it
bad
be
another
of
judge
illston
s
pretrial
ruling
sex
harassment
evidence
would
be
admissible
even
though
the
case
be
not
about
sex
harassment
naturally
woman
have
not
be
harass
at
the
home
depot
but
there
have
be
over
the
year
one
or
two
case
that
be
pretty
ugly
and
would
shock
a
jury
and
we
have
no
doubt
they
be
go
to
hear
those
story
and
we
would
nol
have
adequate
time
in
hour
to
fight
the
primary
gender
discrimination
issue
and
put
sex
harassment
allegation
in
the
context
of
grow
workplace
where
thousand
and
thousand
of
woman
make
successful
lucrative
career
so
the
judge
be
one
reason
that
we
settle
the
other
reason
be
the
jury
pool
dr
reiko
hasuike
the
decisionquest
jury
consultant
we
use
say
we
have
probably
have
a
chance
of
win
before
a
jury
fifty
fifty
be
a
helluva
big
risk
that
be
why
against
our
steadfast
personal
belief
that
we
have
do
nothing
wrong
we
accelerate
the
settlement
discussion
we
knew
it
be
bound
to
be
a
fairly
lengthy
trial
even
give
judge
illston
s
time
constraint
with
fairly
complicate
statistical
evidence
we
be
very
afraid
that
the
so
call
anecdotal
witness
that
the
plaintiff
would
put
up
would
talk
about
an
isolated
incident
of
sex
harassment
and
would
sway
the
jury
into
believe
there
be
a
pattern
and
practice
of
sexual
discrimination
at
the
home
depot
back
in
atlanta
larry
smith
senior
vice
president
of
legal
along
with
john
wymer
of
the
atlanta
law
firm
of
powell
goldstein
frazer
and
murphy
attempt
to
mediate
a
settlement
when
smith
and
the
plaintiff
attorney
come
to
a
preliminary
agreement
they
have
to
sell
it
to
our
board
of
director
this
be
a
real
struggle
for
us
to
come
to
term
with
emotionally
we
have
conference
call
until
one
in
the
morning
and
the
decision
be
not
a
slam
dunk
in
the
end
however
the
board
be
unanimous
when
we
announce
the
settlement
two
day
before
the
trial
date
it
shock
and
disappointed
everyone
from
our
trial
team
on
the
west
coast
to
many
of
our
woman
manager
who
felt
insult
by
the
suit
in
the
course
of
the
litigation
judge
illston
have
order
that
we
could
not
talk
to
our
own
nonmanagement
female
employee
about
the
case
so
we
use
our
woman
manager
as
scout
for
good
story
witness
and
testimony
that
would
make
our
case
it
be
a
very
emotional
process
for
our
female
manager
they
felt
as
if
they
have
be
betrayed
because
they
have
be
ready
under
oath
to
tell
the
jury
that
they
have
more
opportunity
at
the
home
depot
than
they
have
ever
have
before
but
even
a
fool
doesn
t
want
to
stick
his
head
in
a
lion
s
mouth
so
we
be
worried
settle
be
very
emotional
for
us
because
when
you
settle
something
it
indicates
some
wrongdoing
and
we
didn
t
feel
that
we
do
anything
wrong
we
also
settle
because
we
could
reach
a
settlement
with
injunctive
relief
that
would
lead
to
employment
and
advancement
program
we
actively
want
to
do
anyway
we
might
not
otherwise
have
enact
them
as
fast
but
the
term
we
agree
to
in
the
consent
decree
make
sense
to
us
so
much
sense
that
we
implement
them
nationwide
not
just
on
the
west
coast
where
the
class
action
begin
that
really
indicates
that
we
think
those
thing
will
enhance
our
culture
go
forward
the
program
we
put
into
place
will
not
only
provide
us
a
defense
against
a
future
class
action
but
they
make
us
a
strong
company
for
the

to
such
thing
but
on
the
weekend
it
wasn
t
unusual
for
our
associate
to
throw
some
pretty
wild
beer
party
once
the
last
customer
go
home
and
the
door
be
close
music
would
be
cranked
up
on
the
pa
system
six
pack
of
beer
and
stack
of
hot
pizza
would
appear
and
then
it
be
back
to
work
while
this
would
never
be
tolerate
today
for
one
thing
we
be
alcohol
free
at
all
store
as
well
as
at
all
official
company
function
it
be
the
norm
then
maybe
it
be
a
tradition
hand
down
from
pat
harrah
s
homeco
day
when
he
be
just
a
chain
link
fence
away
from
beer
at
all
time
there
be
so
much
work
to
do
almost
around
the
clock
that
certain
allowance
be
make
our
young
associate
in
particular
give
over
so
much
of
their
free
time
and
sacrifice
so
much
that
allow
them
a
little
time
to
cut
loose
even
as
they
work
didn
t
seem
like
such
a
big
deal
most
of
them
couldn
t
tell
you
what
song
movie
or
tv
show
be
popular
from
to
because
they
just
didn
t
have
the
time
to
spare
if
they
hear
an
oldie
on
the
radio
today
that
they
don
t
recognize
they
usually
guess
it
be
a
hit
during
that
time
period
we
be
very
lucky
the
attitude
again
be
whatever
it
take
beer
hardware
and
the
opposite
sex
what
could
a
young
person
find
in
the
outside
world
that
he
or
she
couldn
t
enjoy
at
the
home
depot
we
be
a
small
company
and
a
tight
knit
unit
party
be
often
the
celebration
of
another
week
s
survival
and
preparation
for
the
next
week
at
war
all
night
long
the
music
be
cranked
up
the
energy
be
high
and
a
lot
of
work
get
do
real
quick
surprisingly
safely
so
we
didn
t
have
a
loss
prevention
department
then
and
it
be
a
miracle
that
we
all
survive
some
stunt
they
would
work
all
night
if
that
be
what
it
take
to
get
something
do
they
all
work
all
night
and
get
it
do
and
the
only
thing
on
their
mind
when
the
sun
come
up
be
not
go
home
but
when
the
customer
come
in
what
will
their
reaction
be
when
our
first
major
sale
record
be
set
a
week
at
the
marietta

about

a
couple
of
the
store
manager
and
district
manager
get
into
a
bash
home
depot
rant
one
of
the
bad
have
be
a
merchandising
executive
who
have
recently
be
demote
to
district
manager
he
become
verbally
abusive
and
several
store
manager
later
complain
about
his
behavior
as
a
result
of
that
several
people
be
demote
and
one
or
two
be
fire
this
be
not
one
of
our
shin
moment
when
you
go
back
to
the
origin
of
our
company
we
be
like
the
rough
rider
of
retail
this
be
a
tough
group
of
corporate
oddball
and
the
drinking
be
heavy
but
what
work
then
didn
t
fit
our
game
plan
later
on
by
the
early
s
we
saw
the
destructive
nature
of
alcohol
we
have
a
couple
of
christmas
party
where
we
be
especially
troubled
by
it
we
realize
that
the
hard
drinking
example
set
by
the
senior
officer
of
the
company
be
encourage
the
same
behavior
in
our
young
associate
suddenly
it
didn
t
seem
as
much
fun
or
as
romantic
we
discuss
the
situation
and
as
parent
ourselves
agree
we
no
longer
want
to
encourage
this
behavior
or
be
see
as
champion
of
recklessness
someone
be
go
to
get
hurt
or
kill
the
last
straw
be
when
a
young
man
shove
bernie
out
of
the
way
during
a
short
welcome
speech
at
a
holiday
party
he
grabbed
the
microphone
out
of
bernie
s
hand
and
proceed
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
and
insult
everybody
at
the
party
include
bernie
s
wife
sadly
it
be
all
alcohol
the
outburst
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
young
man
he
be
just
drunk
as
hell
internally
go
dry
be
consider
one
of
the
bad
calamity
that
could
ever
strike
the
company
imagine
have
a
holiday
party
with
no
alcohol
but
after
some
time
pass
most
people
understood
why
we
do
it
it
change
the
nature
of
the
company
s
internal
image
from
one
of
gunslinger
to
a
quilt
of
family
and
where
associate
have
stop
bring
their
family
to
company
party
now
everyone
come
we
have
to
take
responsibility
we
have
the
life
of
these
young
people
in
our
hand
and
we
feel
acutely
sensitive
to
that
it
s
a
fact
that
we
use
alcohol
in
our
early
day
in
order
to
get
start
and
get
thing
do
but
that
be
just
one
phase
in
our
life
the
next
phase
of
our
life
the
more
important
and
farther
reach
one
be
run
a
company
that
be
ethical
and
family
orient
we
want
to
attract
family
we
want
people
to
feel
comfortable
we
aggressively
hire
old
people
in
our
store
but
they
didn
t
like
the
recklessness
they
encounter
if
you
didn
t
go
out
drinking
after
hour
you
be
out
of
the
group
you
be
ostracize
that
s
not
what
we
want
this
company
to
be
about
and
quite
honestly
what
kind
of
an
image
do
we
portray
to
the
world
there
be
article
be
write
about
the
home
depot
everywhere
do
we
really
want
to
be
described
as
a
bunch
of
drunken
sailor
these
incident
lead
to
what
have
be
a
good
policy
for
the
company
we
decide
to
never
again
have
alcohol
at
company
function
the
only
time
we
serve
alcohol
be
when
there
be
more
outsider
involve
in
the
function
than
insider
for
example
we
serve
beer
and
wine
no
hard
liquor
to
vendor
attend
home
depot
sponsor
event
at
the
olympics
in
atlanta
the
customer
let
s
take
a
walk
and
we
ll
find
it
together

year
ago
i
read
the
big
store
inside
the
crisis
and
revolution
at
sears
donald
r
katz
s
behind
the
scene
look
at

roebuck
it
have
a
big
effect
on
me
and
for
a
number
of
year
i
insist
that
every
executive
in
our
company
read
the
book
the
big
store
told
the
story
about
how
one
particular
chief
executive
of
sears
ed
tell
hat
to
be
in
the
store
and
that
be
apparently
why
he
take
the
world
s
most
revere
retail
company
into
virtually
every
other
business
under
the
sun
from
insurance
to
real
estate
sears
bought
all
these
other
business
that
dilute
its
ability
and
energy
and
management
neglect
its
core
business
i
want
our
people
to
read
that
book
so
that
they
understood
how
important
our
core
business
be
tell
hat
be
in
the
store
and
that
be
where
the
bread
and
butter
be
come
from
that
be
what
paid
his
salary
he
never
understood
that
in
this
company
we
do
understand
that
that
be
why
we
insist
that
every
executive
of
this
company
work
in
the
store
upon
join
us
this
policy
even
applies
to
our
attorney
when

form
he
or
she
can

we
be
painfully
aware
of
how
integral
each
of
these
people

to
our
survival
but
at
sears
they

that
s
how
i
often
expand

i
would
run
back
inside

order
it
so
we
d
have
it
in
the
future
then
i

home
carefully
remove
the
other
store
s
price
sticker
and
charge
the
customer
a
low
price
than
i
paid
out

we
would

improvement
customer
be
go
to
pay
for
wider
aisle
and
brighter
light
that
s
not
what
they
come
to
our
store
for
in
many
retail
store
the
people
who
work
there
view
customer
as
a
pain
in
the
rear
end
customer
bother
you
they
stop
you
from
do
your
chore
they
stop
you
from
get
thing
do
that
you
want
to
get
do
they
be
in
your
way
that
be
not
the
case
at
the
home
depot
we
would
say
to
our
associate
if
your
brother
or
sister
come
into
your
store
how
would
you
treat
them
and
then
we
would
say
to
them
your
brother
and
sister
have
to
shop
here
other
people
don
t
you
have
to
treat
other
customer
stranger
well
than
you
do
your
brother
or
your
sister
and
we
instill
this
into
our
people
if
i
ever
saw
an
associate
point
a
customer
toward
what
he
or
she
need
three
aisle
over
i
would
threaten
to
bite
that
associate
s
finger
i
would
say
don
t
you
ever
let
me
see
you
point
you
take
the
customer
by
the
hand
and
you
bring
them
right
where
they
need
to
be
and
you
help
them
this
become
another
part
of
the
home
depot
s
way
of
cultivate
the
customer
you
won
t
even
see
aisle
number
in
our
store
there
be
not
a
retailer
on
the
face
of
the
globe
with
square
foot
store
other
than
the
home
depot
without
some
aisle
number
why
well
if
we
have
aisle
number
when
a
customer
asks
do
you
know
where
i
can
find
this
widget
it
would
be
very
easy
for
our
associate
to
point
and
say
aisle
eight
if
there
be
no
aisle
number
the
employee
have
to
say
let
s
take
a
walk
and
we
ll
find
it
together

our
philosophy
of
customer
service
be
whatever
it
take
that
mean
we
ll
do
whatever
it
take
to
satisfy
a
customer
within
all
human
reason
it
s
take
ownership
of
customer
problem
resolution
even
if
it
mean
go
far
out
of
our
way
to
do
it
but
we
also
believe
in
do
more
than
customer
service
we
call
it
customer
cultivation
what
be
the
difference
customer
service
be
ask
what
be
you
look
for
today
then
get
it
off
the
shelf
explain
its
use
and
send
the
customer
home
customer
cultivation
be
just
like
cultivate
a
tomato
plant
prepare
the
soil
maybe
put
some
additive
in
it
plant
the
seed
water
it
prune
it
fertilize
it
apply
insecticide
it
will
always
grow
big
if
you
cultivate
it
if
you
cultivate
it
it
will
bear
more
fruit
customer
cultivation
be
give
the
same
attention
to
somebody
building
a
rabbit
hutch
as
someone
remodel
a
kitchen
the
rabbithutch
builder
might
come
in
with
a
draw
scrawl
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
simple
plan
to
buy
a
few
x
s
and
a
roll
of
screen
but
with
our
expert
knowledge
we
might
say
well
instead
of
use
white
pine
i
would
recommend
pressure
treat
lumber
you
can
use
it
outside
it
won
t
rot
it
will
last
longer
oh
the
customer
will
say
i
didn
t
know
there
be
such
a
thing
next
i
would
recommend
use
hardware
cloth
it
be
galvanize
so
rabbit
foot
won
t
go
down
through
it
and
let
me
show
you
how
to
put
a
door
on
that
hutch
how
to
hang
hinge
what
the
customer
will
go
home
with
be
different
product
that
he
or
she
probably
wasn
t
aware
of
and
how
to
knowledge
of
how
to
assemble
them
a
little
bit
smarter
the
project
will
come
together
easy
and
we
hope
the
end
product
will
be
well
when
the
project
be
do
our
ten
minute
of
guidance
probably
increase
the
customer
s
self
confidence
along
the
way
we
might
also
sell
the
customer
a
new
handsaw
or
drill
to
complement
the
hammer
screwdriver
and
pair
of
plier
in
the
kitchen
drawer
in
our
experience
we
will
typically
see
that
same
customer
a
month
or
so
later
with
a
little
bit
big
project
this
time
it
might
be
a
wood
patio
deck
the
task
will
be
more
complicate
involve
a
power
saw
goggles
and
a
new
level
of
knowledge
then
the
customer
will
go
home
build
it
call
us
with
question
along
the
way
and
be
proud
enough
to
invite
the
neighbor
over
for
a
barbecue
and
some
beer
hey
look
what
i
built

of
our

and
be
cohesive

much
pressure

to
have
linkage

very
very
tight

why

important
that
we

an
intellectual
relationship
with
our

twenty
year

when
most
people
want
to
redo
a
bathroom
they
would
call
a
contractor
the
client
would
give
instruction
about
color
style
and
perhaps
name
brand
then
the
contractor
would
pick
up
the
plumbing
and

but
what
the
homeowner
didn
t
have
be
the
knowledge
to
put
it
all
together
because
we
hire
an
army
of
train
plumber
electrician
and

linda
khano
all
of
be
work
our
return
desk
when
a
woman
brought
in
a
product
that
she
claimed
be
defective
somehow
khano
decide
the
customer
be
lie
through
her
teeth
when
she
turn
away
from
the
woman
to
get
approval
for
the
return
from
a
manager
an
indignant
khano
found
me
stand
behind
her
i
can
t
believe
this
woman
be
do
this
she
say
under
her
breath
if
it
be
me
i
say
i
would
give
her
her
money
back
khano
do
just
that
smile
and
give
her
the
money
but
as
the
woman
walk
away
khano
be
fume
i
put
an
arm
around
her
shoulder
i
be
go
to
teach
you
a
lesson
that
you
will
remember
for
the
rest
of
your
life
i
say
sometimes
in
this
business
you
have
to
accept
thing
that
you
believe
be
totally
wrong
excuse
me
khano
say
sometimes
in
this
business
you
have
to
do
distasteful
thing
i
repeat
uh
okay
just
think
about
it
linda
i
continued
this
woman
she
brought
this
thing
back
even
though
it
be
not
defective
don
t
worry
about
it
even
if
we
have
to
eat
the
cost
of
it
or
throw
it
away
it
be
no
big
deal
because
from
now
on
she
will
have
the
confidence
to
come
and
buy
here
and
even
if
she
go
home
and
tell
everybody
that
we
be
stupid
that
s
okay
too
because
now
everybody
be
go
to
come
shop
here
and
take
advantage
of
us
the
key
to
our
no
hold
bar
return
policy
be
that
people
talk
about
it
it
get
them
hooked
they
know
they
can
never
make
a
bad
purchase
at
the
home
depot
because
we
don
t
ever
want
to
give
them
a
reason
not
to
come
back
there
be
probably
some
dishonest
people
that
will
take
advantage
of
us
but
they
be
a
tiny
minority
we
be
not
go
to
punish
the
honest
folk
who
need
to
trust
us
khano
s
first
reaction
to
this
customer
be
base
upon
on
how
she
thought
thing
should
be
base
on
what
she
learn
before
she
join
the
home
depot
we
have
to
unteach
those
tiling
so
she
could
apply
home
depot
s
core
customer
service
value
of
go
the
extra
mile
do
whatever
it
take
to
build
loyalty
at
the

associate
who
didn
t
get
our
concept
of

cultivation
and

and
every
so
often
one
of
them

huge
headache

be
a
nationwide
concept
handle
by
a
whole
cadre
of
people
on
a
regional
basis
and
it
be
still
pat
s
picture
in
our
training
class
we
will
always
ask
who
be
the
original
ben
hill
once
that
be
answer
we
will
ask
why
we
do
it
why

didn
t
just
hire
someone

no
travel
nothing
just
sit
by
the
telephone
and
we
will
take
all
the
call
ourselves
what
would
happen
to
the
ben
hill
call
they
would
go
down
the
store
would
have
zero
customer
complaint
why
because
our
associate
and
manager
wouldn
t
want
to
deal
with
us
directly
over
something
that
should
and
could
have
be
settle
in
the
store
so
part
of
ben
hill
s
purpose
be
to
create
a
culture
in
which
you
will
be
personally
responsible
for
the
customer
in
your
store
every
time
a
customer
call
ben
hill
it
reflect
a
failure
in
the
store
but
the
manager
and
associate
in
that
store
have
all
the
power
and
all
the
responsibility
in
the
world
to
fix
any
problem
that
any
customer
have
your
goal
we

in
because
of
their

there
be
average
above
the
line
and
below
the
line
a

do
not
want
to
be
above
the
line
on
the
other
hand
many
division
give

to

a
recognition
of

it
these
be
not
sought
after

they

naturally

incidental
branding
opportunity
because
all
kind
of
people
shop
our
store
and
have
an
emotional
connection
to
the
home
depot
our
understand
of
branding
have
evolve
as
the
home
depot
mature
in
the
begin
all
we
be
try
to
do
be
get
our
name
out
there
include
give
out
one
dollar
bill
in
just
to
get
people
in
the
front
door
back
then
the
first
component
of
branding
not
that
we
even
use
the
term
be
big
store
lot
of
stuff
low
price
that
be
the
brand
s
catch
point
back
then
it
be
novel
over
the
year
we
become
more
sophisticated
about
customer
service
and
that
be
an
attention
getter
we
may
not
have
be
consciously
do
it
but
we
be
building
a
brand
nonetheless
frustrate
with
a
california
base
ad
agency
that
have
difficulty
relate
to
georgia
folk
and
produce
few
result
we
hire
mel
finkel
s
atlanta
base
ad
agency
finkel
associate
in
to
handle
our
medium
buy
and
produce
radio
and
tv
commercial
for
us
when
we
open
the
first
store
finkel
be
a
good
of
southern
advertising
guy
and
he
understood
the
customer
a
lot
well
than
we
do
in
those
day
he
say
you
ought
to
have
ludlow
porch
do
some
commercial
we
be
already
fan
of
porch
a
much
beloved
atlanta
radio
personality
and
homespun
humorist
and
we
be
excite
by
the
prospect
of
him
deliver
our
message
all
right
bernie
told
finkel
let
s
try
him
why
don
t
i
meet
him
at
the
store
and
explain
what
we
be
do
here
that
be
probably
not
a
good
idea
pat
farrah
say
interrupt
what
do
you
mean
for
the
last
six
week
we

be
tell
everybody
else
we
ve
try
out
what
the
home
depot

all
about
and
they
have
not
do
a
very
good
job
with
it
pat
say
why
don
t
we
just
let
ludlow
do
it
by
himself
and
if
you
promise
you
won
t
interfere
with
him
i
promise
i
won
t
either
of
course
neither
one
of
them
felt
like
he
could
trust
the
other
one
to
steer
clear
i
found
the
whole
standoff
between
my
partner
quite
funny
two
day
later

even
with
all
that
work
he
still
found
time
for
a
little
mad
magazine
inspire
mischief
scribble
little
note
in
the
corner
of
his
cartoon
well
in
the
same
shelve
ad
he
drew
a
rubbermaid
trash
can
with
the
lid
lift
and
homer
peek
out
a
fellow

mention
a
guy
he
go
to
high

because
his

told
him
to
look
for
his

any
more
about
it
six
week
later

do
you
know
anything
about

who
be
furious
with
the

closet
case
plus
frank
the

next
to
homer
in
the
dress
be
just
too
much
for
the
man
in
tucson
to
accept
as
coincidence
but
it
be
when
we
expand
outside
of
atlanta
we
look
for
a
spokesperson
whose
appeal
would
extend
beyond
the
south
oddly
enough
we
found
that
person
at

be
every
bit
as
big
and
overstock
as
bernie
described
it
and
carrell

struck
by
how
all
the
associate
not
only
knew
bernie
and
call
him
by
his
first
name
he
knew
all
of

by

several
time
he
saw
bernie
get
distract
by
an
associate
inquire
about
this
one

his
life
carrell
say
he
would
definitely
like
to
work
with
the
home
depot
bernie
told
him
that
his
work
for
handy
dan
be
not
an
immediate
problem
because
the
two
be
in
different
market
but
that
he
couldn
t
work
for
handy
city
and
the
home
depot
besides
bernie
say
handy
city
isn
t
go
to
last
very
long
against
us
for
the
next
eight
year
on
radio
and
tv
al
carrell
the
superhandyman
be
the
sole
spokesperson
for
the
home
depot
he
become
so
closely
identify
with
us
that
people
still
think
he
s
with
us
and
that
s
okay
by
carrell
his
unexpected
stock
option
make
him
a
wealthy
man
that
happen
when
we
be
extend
carrell
s
contract
and
bernie
take
him
to
dinner
to
discus
the
future
i
want
to
put
you
on
our
payroll
for
a
small
part
of
your
remuneration
bernie
say
because
i
want
you
to
take
advantage
of
our
stock
option
plan
and
you
have
to
be
an
employee
to
do
that
several
people
have
give
carrell
stock
in
the
past
but
it
have
never
be
worth
anything
still
he
didn
t
want
to
hurt
bernie
s
feeling
gosh
bernie
that
sure
sound
great
after
his
stock
split
the
first
time

future
in
the
same
term
we
do
he
exercise
every
option
that
he
ever
receive
so
it
be
quite
okay
that
bernie
do
him
that
favor
as
the
year
roll
on
al
carrell
make
more
on
his
stock
option
than
he
be
ever
paid
by
us
for
all
his
year
of
promotional
work
combine
during
our
first
few
year
home
depot
sale
rise
and
fell
with
publication
of
our
biweekly
catalog
customer
would
wait
to
see
what
be
on

know
that
the
catalog
be
due
every
other
week
bring
with
it
greatly
discount
price
on
select
item
we
go
crazy
offering
ridiculously
low
price
to
get
attention
in
catalog
and
correspond
newspaper
ad
our
merchant
use
to
call
sale
our
drug
of
choice
sale
produce
a
flurry
of
activity
in
the
store
this
be
in
the
day
before
universal
product
code
and
computerize
bar
cod
when
every
item
have
to

and

when

in
our

it
meant
bleary

the

the
night
before
and
when
the
sale
be
over
if
anything
be
left
they
remove
the
red
sticker
and
repriced
item
by
hand
it
be
a
labor
intensive
process
every
home
depot
sale
catalog
guaranteed
a
to
percent
jump
in
store
sale
as
the
sale
wore
on
however
sale
dribble
downward
instead
of
see
a
steady
stream
of
customer
day
in
and
day
out
we
d
start
with
a
grand
rush
and
end
up
with
a
trickle
everyday
low
pricing
at
the
home
depot
be
an
idea
that
originate
with
sol
price
and
the
price
club
but
be
encourage
by
sam
walton
wherever
walton
travel
he
would
visit
a
home
depot
store
in
fact
when
we
open
the
first
home
depot
store
in
atlanta
in
those
old
treasure
island
building
walton
and
david
glass
be
among
the
first
in
the
industry
to
check
us
out
they
frequently
travel
to
atlanta
which
be
a
market
in
which
wal
mart
compete
head
to
head
against
treasure
island
richway
and
kmart
so
they
saw
the
home
depot
store
develop
from
their
inception
over
the
year
despite
be
competitor
in
several
department
we
become
good
friend
with
walton
and
glass
in
glass
told
fortune
magazine
that
the
home
depot
run
the
best
retail
organization
in
america
today
we
feel
very
comfortable
pick
up
the
phone
and
talk
to
them
about
general
retail
condition
and
they
have
always
be
very
candid
with
us
we
often
walk
each
other
s
store
together
share
idea
and
take
note
we
be
tough
but
friendly
competitor
on
a
very
high
level
so
it
should
not
be
too
surprising
that
while
visit
wal
mart
s
corporate
headquarters
in
bentonville
arkansas
walton
and
glass
convince
bernie
to
try
everyday
low
pricing
at
the
home
depot
the
main
purpose
of
his
visit
incidentally
be
to
learn
more
about
wal
mart
s
employee
stock
ownership
plan
also
know
as
an
esop
we
have
be
think
about
an
esop
program
for
some
time
and
wal
mart
s
be
consider
a
model
in
the
industry
our
theory
have
always
be
that
if
we
be
go
to
get
rich
we
want
our
associate
to
get
rich
with
us
if
we
be
go
to
benefit
they
be
go
to
benefit
as
well
that
have
always
be
a
part
of
our
philosophy
there
be
men
and
woman
bust
their
rear
end
kill
themselves
work
day
and
night
for
the
home
depot
if
we
make
it
we
want
them
to
make
it
as
well
from
the
day
we
open
the
store
that
be
a
philosophy
of
the
company
but
walton
probably
the
great
retailer
that
ever
live
have
something
else
on
his
mind
why
do
you
continue
to
run
sale
he
ask
don
t
you
run
out
of
merchandise
yeah
bernie
say
we
run
out
of
merchandise
all
the
time
in
fact
we
have
to
hold
back
stuff
in
the
back
room
because
otherwise
people
buy
all
the
merchandise
before
our
sale
catalog
hit
manufacturer
can
t
keep
up
with
you
be
that
right
walton
ask
that
s
right
why
don
t
you
go
to
everyday
low
price
like
we
have
walton
and
glass
then
explain
what
everyday
low
price
meant
to
them
they
do
a
thorough
sell
job
how
it
work
with
manufacturer
how
it
help
the
store
the
positive
effect
on
system
and
customer
if
you
take
everyday
low
price
as
a
marketing
philosophy
glass
say
and
you
list
the
pro
and
the
con
you
would
never
do
anything
other
than
everyday
low
price
there
be
very
convincing
argument
for
it
people
who
come
out
of
a
different
background
though
who
haven
t
really
work
with
everyday
low
price
or
thought
it
through
resist
it
walton
love
the
home
depot
and
say
you
have
to
do
it
most
retailer
can
t
do
it
don
t
have
the
intestinal
fortitude
or
the
vision
to
execute
and
make
it
happen
we
be
not
the
first
or
last
company
to
whom
walton
and
glass
recommend
everyday
low
price
but
few
could
properly
execute
it
when
he
return
to
atlanta
bernie
told
me
we
be
go
with
everyday
low
price
follow
a
great
deal
of
internal
discussion
this
be
after
all
a
momentous
decision
i
embrace
the
idea
as
well
i
like
the
logic
and
reliability
of
it
the
price
club
be
the
originator
of
everyday
low
price
it
be
a
concept
we
have
discuss
and
dismiss
in
the
past
across
the
rest
of
the
organization
it
be
a
much
tougher
sell
the
merchant
be
not
easily
convince
they
love
sale
they
live
for
sale
we
argue
that
sale
be
actually
a
weakness
and
that
everyday
low
price
meant
more
consistent
sale
overall
make
it
easy
to
stay
in
stock
and
that
we
would
give
away
margin
right
off
the
bat
in
other
word
at
whatever
price
we
would
previously
have
discount
an
item
that
s
the
price
we
should
be
sell
it
at
all
the
time
customer
should
be
able
to
get
the
same
good
deal
monday
through
sunday
in
retailing
some
people
need
to
find
way
of
create
artificial
excitement
but
who
want
to
go
shopping
for
a
deal
every
day
that
be
what
people
be
do
with
all
these
sale
larry
mercer
compare
the
change
in
philosophy
to
go
to
church
every
sunday
then
decide
from
now
on
you
will
go
to
church
every
day
day
in
day
out
pricing
become
our
new
religion
in
order
to
switch
to
everyday
low
pricing
in
we
have
to
mark
our
merchandise
down
and
under
the
retail
accounting
method
when
you
low
your
retail
price
that
be
a
charge
to
your
p
l
so
if
we
do
that
and
the
sale
didn
t
increase
and
our
advertising
spending
didn
t
decrease
then
our
earnings
would
decrease
it
be
a
one
time
charge
but
with
our
high
pe
ratio
one
bad
quarter
might
cause
the
stock
to
plummet
so
ron
brill
be
concerned
at
the
time
we
be
probably
spending
more
than
percent
of
gross
sale
on
advertising
so
if
we
have
million
in
sale
we
be
spending
million
on
advertising
if
something
sell
for
we
might
put
it
on
sale
for
which
be
percent
off
when
you
advertise
one
item
you
re
try
to
sell
it
and
others
and
get
a
good
overall
margin
but
people
only
bought
the
sale
item
so
we
didn
t
get
a
good
mix
everyday
low
price
force
us
to
low
price
across
the
board
but
because
of
that
we
be
able
to
sell
more
of
everything
as
customer
become
confident
that
our
price
be
always
good
we
save
on
advertising
and
well
control
our
margin
at
the
time
we
understood
wai
mar
t
s
advertising
to
be
about
percent
of
gross
sale
our
accountant
thought
we
would
never
achieve
that
kind
of
number
but
today
our
advertising
be
well
below
that
level
it
make
such
good
sense
but
it
take
us
more
than
a
year
to
mechanically
switch
over
and
year
emotionally
some
day
it
seem
as
if
everyone
fought
us
our
sale
associate
be
more
than
a
little
apprehensive
about
customer
response
when
we
make
the
switch
even
though
sale
event
meant
backbreaking
work
for
them
the
approach
of
a
new
catalog
every
day
create
an
adrenaline
rush
across
the
store
associate
fear
that
because
select
merchandise
would
no
longer
be
offer
at
dramatically
low
price
the
catalog
would
become
ineffectual
home
depot
merchant
the
people
who
make
deal
for
the
product
sell
in
our
store
have
a
major
problem
with
day
in
day
out
low
pricing
it
be
tough
for
them
to
buy
in
philosophically
that
everyday
low
price
meant
that
we
would
always
be
competitive
it
be
more
of
an
emotional
hurdle
for
the
merchant
because
they
felt
like
we
be
take
away
a
huge
piece
of
competitive
ammunition
from
the
marketplace
we
struggle
at
first
to
convince
both
the
associate
and
customer
that
all
price
be
reduce
to
what
we
would
normally
sell
on
sale
for
and
then
we
drop
the
term
on
sale
altogether
the
sale
curve
flatten
out
with
the
switch
to
everyday
low
pricing
initially
it
felt
to
everyone
like
we
be
give
away
business
because
we
didn
t
have
that
spike
anymore
in
fact
it
raise
sale
across
the
board
there
be
many
more
good
thing
that
come
about
as
a
result
of
the
switch
when
they
knew
what
item
be
go
on
sale
store
manager
have
guess
the
quantity
that
would
be
sell
usually
err
on
the
high
side
and
stack
them
to
the
ceiling
one
of
two
thing
always
happen
we
either
ran
out
before
the
end
of
the
catalog
which
happen
a
lot
or
when
the
ad
be
over
we
still
have
stuff
stack
to
the
sky
it
be
a
huge
guess
game
woe
unto
our
manager
if
they
ran
out
of
an
item
before
the
sale
end
they
could
find
themselves
write
several
hundred
rain
check
on
a
single
item
for
the
manager
and
their
assistant
it
be
a
huge
pain
because
a
rain
check
wasn
t
the
end
of
it
they
still
have
the
labor
ahead
of
call
the
customer
back
when
the
next
shipment
arrive
to
pick
it
up
we
subsequently
save
all
the
related
administrative
cost
of
the
rain
check
tag
and
track
merchandise
the
switch
lead
to
an
ingenious
marketing
slogan
we
have
use
ever
since
the
home
depot
where
low
price
be
just
the
begin
to
this
day
of
course
some
people
still
don
t
get
it
they
pick
up
an
item
that
might
be
in
our
catalog
and
ask
be
this
on

it

she
pout
the
summer
olympic
game
in
atlanta
be
our
true
come
out
party
as
a
national
brand
name
for
the
first
time
we
proactively
position
ourselves
as
a
part
of
the
fabric
of
north
america
in
we
go
downtown
to
see
the
folk
who
be
sell
corporate
sponsorship
for
the
olympic
game
in
atlanta
everybody
knew
that
another
little
atlanta
company
name
coca
cola
have
be
an
olympics
sponsor
for
decade
we
have
become
leader
in
the
atlanta
community
both
on
a
personal
basis
and
in
term
of
our
company
and
felt
the
time
be
right
to
step
up
atlanta
be
our
hometown
and
we
have
more
associate
here
than
in
any
other
market
the
home
depot
have
be
able
to
impact
the
atlanta
community
substantially
like
coca
cola
delta
or
cnn
our
success
and
the
kind
of
positive
attention
it
have
brought
to
the
atlanta
community
certainly
have
add
to
the
equation
and
be
a
sponsor
of
the
summer
olympics
in
atlanta
marked
an
enormous
milestone
for
our
company
we
didn
t
have
store
all
across
the
united
state
until
the
mid
s
so
we
couldn
t
afford
to
do
national
thing
until
then
we
do
big
thing
in
each
community
where
we
have
a
store
but
never
on
a
national
scale
so
our
sponsorship
of
the
olympics
make
a
major
statement
that
the
home
depot
have
arrive
on
the
national
scene
it
be
our
debutante
ball
we
spent
million
of
dollar
on
nbc
television
and
brought
thousand
of
associate
from
arizona
to
new
hampshire
to
atlanta
to
participate
when
you
become
an
olympics
sponsor
you
be
give
the
right
to
purchase
a
set
number
of
package
include
event
ticket
and
accommodation
for
two
we
have
an
option
for
package
half
go
to
our
vendor
partner
the
other
half
go
to
our
associate
in
fact
we
be
the
only
sponsor
who
devote
such
a
high
percentage
of
our
hospitality
package
to
our
associate
the
associate
we
invite
be
be
recognize
and
congratulate
for
outstanding
customer
service
in
some
case
they
be
people
who
have
never
left
home
before
never
be
on
a
plane
take
the
trip
of
a
lifetime
at
company
expense
and
the
vast
majority
of
them
be
hourly
employee
not
manager
or
executive
talk
about
a
party
another
highlight
at
least
for
us
be
when
larry
mercer
and
i
personally
participate
in
carry
the
olympic
torch
through
the
street
of
downtown
atlanta
with
my
daughter
danielle
run
beside
me
i
receive
the
torch
from
mercer
on
peachtree
street
thousand
of
associate
deck
out
in
orange
turn
out
for
the
two
a
m
handoff
why
do
we
sponsor
the
olympics
why
not
announce
our
status
as
a
national
company
in
some
less
costly
manner
number
one
we
want
to
be
part
of
the
fabric
of
north
america
as
a
company
and
there
be
no
great
sport
event
on
earth
than
the
olympics
in
term
of
emotion
and
viewership
it
be
the
pinnacle
it
be
number
one
in
term
of
its
mystique
it
be
a
positive
who
doesn
t
like
the
olympics
if
we
be
go
to
align
ourselves
with
something
the
home
depot
want
it
to
be
that
and
in
all
the
research
that
we
saw
olympic
sponsor
be
perceive
by
the
general
public
as
be
leader
in
their
industry
kodak
coca
cola
and
the
home
depot
we
like
that
affiliation
number
two
from
just
a
raw
advertising
standpoint
the
olympic
game
tend
to
be
the
most
watch
high
rat
tv
program
in
any
give
year
so
run
commercial
during
the
olympics
be
a
very
powerful
way
of
reach
your
customer
be
able
to
say
you
be
a
sponsor
be
equally
powerful
internally
if
not
externally
we
drew
analogy
between
our
associate
and
the
olympian
coach
we
want
our
associate
to
go
for
the
gold
we
need
that
same
dedication
they
be
like
coach
teach
inspire
training
and
motivate
their
customer
in
fact
we
name
ourselves
north
america
s
home
improvement
coach
during
the
game
another
element
of
our
support
we
be
one
of
the
large
provider
of
job
to
olympic
hopeful
in
the
world
go
into
the
game
we
employ
more
than
olympic
contender
of
whom
make
team
and
six
medaled
hire
olympic
athlete
become
a
morale
issue
as
well
because
our
employee
get
behind
these
men
and
woman
on
the
job
and
off
root
them
on
and
feel
a
party
to
their
progress
along
that
line
it
be
not
a
bad
recruiting
tool
to
say
that
we
be
an
olympics
sponsor
these
men
and
woman
live
by
a
high
standard
because
of
their
dedication
and
focus
in
the
big
scheme
of
thing
however
the
olympics
be
just
another
spoke
on
the
wheel
even
though
we
will
spend
ten
of
million
of
dollar
on
it
over
the
course
of
a
decade
it
only
represent
a
fraction
of
our
whole
marketing
budget
we
also
underwrote
olympic
glory
the
first
ever
large
format
millimeter
film
of
an
olympic
winter
game
shot
in
nagano
japan
during
the
game
it
be
another
way
of
bring
the
olympics
back
to
our
market
the
olympics
be
some
event
far
far
away
this
film
be
allow
our
customer
and
associate
to
feel
the
emotion
and
magnitude
of
the
most
powerful
sport
event
on
earth
we
sign
on
as
an
atlanta
olympics
sponsor
back
in
but
we
be
so
pleased
with
the
result
that
we
re
upped
as
sponsor
of
both
the
u
s
and
canadian
olympic
team
through
as
well
as
the
game
themselves
in
salt
lake
city
in
we
also
sponsor
the
canadian
and
u
s
paralympic
team
go
forward
we
will
continue
those
sponsorship
and
add
the
puerto
rican
olympic
team
to
our
sponsorship
effort
as
we
go
to
press
on
this
book
all
of
the
olympic
organize
committee
be
embroil
in
the
salt
lake
city
bribery
scandal
we
be
in
touch
almost
daily
with
the
u
s
olympic
committee
and
the
international
olympic
committee
and
share
their
confidence
that
these
issue
will
be
resolve
so
that
the
value
of
the
olympic
brand
be
restore
especially
here
in
north
america
after
all
the
focus
of
the
olympics
be
the
athlete
their
dedication
to
excellence
be
the
reason
we
support
them
when
you
merely
advertise
as
we
do
for
our
first
ten
or
fifteen
year
you
be
only
attract
people
through
one
narrow
channel
of
opportunity
you
re
just
another
store
in
the
neighborhood
with
a
newspaper
ad
hop
people
respond
to
it
now
that
we
re
part
of
the
fabric
of
north
america
we
want
to
plant
seed
more
subtly
for
consumer
to
consider
take
on
home
improvement
project
around
the
house
we
want
to
be
their
ubiquitous
source
for
the
information
they
need
to
do
these
project
one
of
the
reason
we
sponsor
the
olympic
team
and
game
be
because
olympian
know
that
what
won
four
year
ago
be
not
go
to
be
enough
to
win
again
that
be
in
keep
with
our
value
we
want
to
raise
the
bar
for
our
own
associate
in
the
same
way
even
though
we
won
a
gold
medal
in
the
past
last
week
last
quarter
we
like
the
olympic
athlete
need
to
reach
within
ourselves
every
day
to
raise
that
bar
he
competition
be
always
get
well
so
should
we
the
value
of
the
olympics
and
the
athlete
be
very
much
in
keep
with
ours
faster
high
strong
that
be
what
the
home
depot
be
all
about
ten
year
ago
the
home
depot
advertised
store
that
be
big
than
two
and
a
half
football
field
that
be
a
point
of
difference
today
who
isn
t
big
than
two
and
a
half
football
field
we
also
say
we
carry
more
than
item
that
be
a
point
of
difference
well
who
doesn
t
have
more
than
item
today
and
who
doesn
t
have
a
low
price
guarantee
if
all
those
thing
have
become
a
commodity
why
be
the
home
depot
still

that
it
be
a
big
market
and
the
two
company
could
enjoy
a
peaceful
coexistence

i
didn

want
there
to
be
any
misunderstand
i
suggest
an
analogy
from
the

about
a

killer
shark
have
you
see
the

the
difference
between
sweet
and
the
head
of
many
of
our
other
competitor
through
the
year
be
that

fifty

in

write
by

i
remember
my
first
exposure
to
the
home

tillman
say
lowe
s
have
a
store
manager
meeting
in
orlando
in
and
we
make
time
to
visit
home
depot
s
store
there
the
store
be
square
foot
we
be
on
a
little
bus
and
we
could
not
find
an
empty
space
in
the
parking
lot
leonard
herring
be
with
us
and
he
say
i
ll
bet
you
could
sell
these
parking
space
for
apiece
at
that
moment
i
knew
they
have
built
a
well
mousetrap
before
we
ever
go
into
the
store
still
lowe
s
stuck
with
its
traditional
store
model
for
many
more
year
a
lumberyard
with
a
showroom
that
might
have
be
to
square
foot
they
be
in
small
market
carry
not
only
home
improvement
product
but
also
appliance
and
electronics
it
wasn
t
until
that
their
first
big
box
store
square
foot
open
meanwhile
another
famous
competitor
of
ours
hechinger
also
stayed
its
course
buying
merchandise
at
high
cost
through
distributor
they
didn
t
have
the
merchandise
or
service
that
we
offer
but
they
do
offer
bright
clean
good
look
store
they
believe
that
the
same
formula
would
always
work
base
on
year
of
customer
loyalty
we
believe
there
be
no
perfect
ongoing
formula
as
long
as
your
value
remain
constant
i
don
t
think
they
understood
that
their
customer
loyalty
be
base
on
a
lack
of
option
when
we
arrive
customer
make
it
very
clear
that
the
static
hechinger
formula
be
not
the
one
offering
the
best
value
it
wasn
t
responsive
and
lowe
s
wasn
t
either
for
many
year
today
they
be
but
when
you
only
copy
somebody
and
don
t
really
understand
why
they
re
do
what
they
re
do
you
re
never
go
to
be
as
good
as
the
original
that
s
lowe
s
problem
vi
a
vi
the
home
depot
they
copy
almost
everything
we
do
from
store
design
to
marketing
but
the
reason
they
still
only
achieve
about
percent
of
our
volume
be
that
they
don
t
understand
the
essence
of
what
we
do
take
care
of
the
customer
it
s
not
how
beautiful
the
store
be
or
how
wide
the
aisle
be
people
come
to
our
store
for
the
product
selection
the
right
price
and
the
product
knowledge
our

be
not

the

be
a
warehouse
store
open
to
the
public
people
shopping
for
home
improvement
feel
very
comfortable
in
our
environment
you
can
copy
a
black
decker
drill
and
sell
it
for
the
same
price
that
we
do
but
you
can
t
copy
the
home
depot
culture
we
think
we
re
very
difficult
to
emulate
without
believe
in
the
same
value
that
we
do

be
a
major
player
in
a
market
be
an
important
part
of
our
growth
plan
we
open
in
certain
place
atlanta
south
florida
and
dallas
for
example
and
focus
our
marketing
in
those
place
until
we
become
number
one
only
then
do
we
move
on
to
the
next
city
we
never
go
to
a
new
market
with
plan
for
just
a
couple
of
store
one
of
the
reason
we
didn

go
into
los

that
our
real
estate
vice
president
bill

that

to
go
in
and
open
a
whole
bunch
of
store
at
once
and
be
the
best
against
a
broad
array
of
competitor
it
make
more
sense
to
stay
in
south
florida
until
we
be
number
one
with
the
customer
there
we
follow
that
philosophy
in
term
of
merchandise
in
our
store
too
always
have
the
wide
selection
if
we
can
t
be
the
best
in
a
category
we
don
t
carry
it
before
us
nobody
have
a
truly
national
presence
in
home
improvement
except
for

which
competes
in
the
industry
by
virtue
of
its
craftsman

sears

the
rest

regional

by
comparison
the
industry
knew
we
be
edge
closer
and
closer
to
them
but
they
never
prepared
for
us
they
all
knew
that
eventually
we
would
present
a
direct
threat
but
they
couldn

think
in

other
than
the
way
they
have
for
decade
they
ran
good
business
they

money
why
change
it
hardware
be
a
chummy
regional
business
there
be
room
for
everybody
but
the
truth
be
that
we
be
so
revolutionary
that
they
couldn
t
do
business
as
usual
with
us
in
a
market
they
once
dominate
they
have
to
low

be
look
for
way
of
take
away
what
be
yours
in
our
management
training
class
bernie
and
i
tell
our
people
it
s
not
just
an
issue
of
competition
it
s
more
personal
than
that
these
people
want
to
take
away
our
livelihood
we
re
talk
about
their
home
about
send
their
kid
to
college
we
re
talk
about
their
retirement
nest
egg
we
tell
them
about
all
the
thing
that
be
meaningful
in
their
life
that
a
competitor
target
by
opening
up
a
new
store
nearby
this
be
not
fun
this
we
warn
them
be
your
life
and
every
time
they
challenge
you
it
s
a
challenge
to
take
away
your
livelihood
and
your
career
and
your
future
so
we
tell
our
people
that
they
must
focus
on
the
customer
this
war
be
make
up
of
skirmish
tliat
go
on
every
day
every
day
be
a
skirmish
and
we
must
be
on
our
guard
every
single
day
competition
move
in
because
it
recognizes
a
weakness
in
your
fabric
so
we
have
to
be
very
careful
that
we
don
t
have
any
weakness
internally
we
have
many
different
opinion
as
to
what
approach
we
should
take
versus
our
competition
when
you
be
the
leader
in
the
marketplace
should
you
even
think
about
mention
number
two
how
high
a
road
do
we
want
to
take
should
we
just
sit
back
and
ignore
the
competition
just
because
they
be
not
hurt
us
we
produce
about
eight
commercial
spot
a
day
spot
a
year
so
we
can
usually
manage
a
little
of
everything
part
of
our
marketing
department
s
job
be
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
orange
blood
folk
wear
our
apron
be
charge
up
and
say
we
be
a
kick
as
company
we
won
t
just
let
the
competitor
come
in
and
throw
jab
at
us
they
haven
t
hit
us
hard
yet
but
they
keep
punch
should
it
be
personal
against
the
competition
well
our
associate
do
love
that
stuff
it
depends
on
how
edgy
you
want
to
get
builder
square
be
our
most
visible
competitor
of
the
s
when
it
close
its
last
store
in
atlanta
our
store
manager
put
on
a
vicious
skit
at
a
citywide
store
meeting
the
theme
be
how
we
deal
with
the
competition
when
the
big
roll
front
door
of
the
store
go
up
in
drove
a
black
funeral
hearse
inside
be
an
actual
funeral
home
director
he
gently
open
the
back
door
of
the
hearse
slid
out
a
coffin
and
lift
the
lid
everyone
gasped
at
the
sight
of
an
assistant
manager
hold
a
stake
that
read
builder
square
rest
in
peace
we
share
a
particular
antipathy
with
builder
square
because
it
be
found
by
frank
denny
our
ex
associate
at
handy
dan
he
start
the
company
in
san
antonio
texas
as

when
we

in
daytona

florida
builder

have
be
there
for
some
time
our
new
store
manager
hire
an
airplane
to
fly
over
the
builder
square
parking
lot
with
a

advertising
well

at
the

there
be
probably
a
well
way
of
spending
money
but
it
be
pretty
funny
and
our
daytona
beach
associate
cheer
her
sense
of
the
absurd
lowe

and
the

announce

to
enter
the

about
the

a
few
hundred
yard
apart
lowe

open
while
our
store
be
still
under
construction

that
didn

stop
us
from
have
fun
at
their
expense
our
jacksonville

manager
charter
a

he
conduct
a

meeting
in
the
parking
lot
when
we
arrive
in

washington
d

market
our
first
bouquet
of
black
rose
arrive
from
hechinger
it
quickly
become
a
tradition
that
whenever
we
open
a
store
we
would
find
a
bouquet
of
black
rose
on
our
door
then
of
course
we
would
reciprocate
after
a
while
the
two
company
stop
do
it
but
a
few
bouquet
kept
slip
through
the
crack
because
lowe

picked
up
the
practice
from

on
another
occasion

not
that
we

innocent
we
use
to
fill
a

with
our
employee
hay
wagon
style
and
do

visit
with

probably
just
as
strange
be
that
i
take
it
in
stride
pick
up
a
house
phone
and
say
yes
of
course
that
be
a
more
pleasant
experience
than
be
thrown
out
of
a
competitor
s
store
something
that
happens
more
and
more
these
day
when
they
spot
us
a
posse
of
employee
will
typically
follow
us
through
the
aisle
not
say
a
word
but
watch
everything
we
do
until
the
only
smart
move
be
to
leave
bernie
have
this
experience
at
a
competitor
s
store
in
minneapolis
he
be
literally
picked
up
and
thrown
out
the
nature
of
competition
in
our
industry
have
change
in
the
last
ten
year
primarily
because
of
the
home
depot
a
decade
ago
the
industry
be
small
we
be
small
and
our
competitor
be
more
often
than
not
the
founder
of
their
company
we
all
knew
each
other
on
a
first
name
basis
and
there
be
a
certain
kind
of
camaraderie
amongst
us

david
stanley
be
friend
of
ours
when
the
industry
be
characterize
by
regional
powerhouse
we
would
visit
their
store
they
would
visit
ours
hechinger
use
to
bring
an
entire
senior
management
group
to
atlanta
and
we
would
spend
several
hour
talk
about
what
we
be
do
we
weren
t
yet
think
of
barging
into
the
washington
d
c
market
and
he
never
thought
of
us
as
a
competitor
or
we
would
visit
somerville
lumber
in
boston
and
they
would
proudly
take
us
through
their
store
and
show
us
what
they
be
do
we
could
still
talk
about
industry
economics
and
thing
of
common
interest
ten
year
ago
these
people
didn
t
view
us
as
the
threat
to
their
survival
that
they
do
today
ten
year
ago
they
weren
t
openly
ridicule
by
industry
trade
magazine
analyst
and
even
customer
for
fail
to
keep
up
with
change
time
and
consumer
expectation
we
work
on
city
of
hope
and
other
charity
together
but
as
you
move
past
the
founder
of
the
company
the
glove
come
off
we
no
longer
have
the
same
kind
of
personal
relationship
on
the
other
hand
maybe
that
s
no
longer
realistic
the
fact
that
we
be
able
to
design
our
company
on
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
and
weren
t

by
year
of
tradition
and
year
of
people

to
a
certain

advantage

number
one
in
our
industry
until
we
sail
past
them
in
to
their
credit
lowe
s
finally
saw
the
write
on
the
wall
and
understood
that
the
only
way
they
could
compete
with
us
be
to
copy
our
format
around
that
time

of
the

that
ever
happen
to
our
company
wasthe

as
the
say

good
scare

cutout
of

could
a
lowe

menard
or
lowe
s
and
eagle
combine
force
to
well
compete
with
us
from
coast
to
coast
sure
they
could
but
we
would
still
be
much
big
than
they
be
with
store
gross
nearly
twice
what
they
do
per
square
foot
we
take
them
all
very
seriously
today
but
their
ability
to
compete
with
us
would
probably
not
be
greatly
enhance
if
they
be
combine
both
eagle
and
lowe
s
create
an
overall
environment
in
their
store
that
be
softer
than
ours
we
will
probably
do
more
in
die
year
to
come
to
create
more
of
a
decor
environment
within
certain
area
of
a
home
depot
store
of
course
if
we
cut
our
selection
to
match
lowe
s
we
would
have
wider
aisle
too
the
toughest
competitor
we
face
over
the
year
be
hechinger
in
the
washington
d
c
baltimore
virginia
market
hechinger
have
an
enthusiastic
consumer
follow
high
quality
location
a
classy
look
and
feel
and
heavy
advertising
if
they
be
steak
we
be
hamburger
it
be
also
the
only
game
in
town
for
a
long
time
so
buying
habit
be
form
and
solid
that
be
a
tough
one
to
break
down
we
seriously
discuss
a
merger
with
hechinger
in
at
a
point
when
they
be
well
know
and
widely
respect
and
we
be
start
to
attract
notice
hechinger
have
money
we
didn
t
we
waltz
around
and
around
romance
each
other
hechinger
president
dick
england
and
bernie
take
long
walk
down
fifth
avenue
in
new
york
discuss
the
in
and
out
of
a
merger
the
home
depot
s
name
would
have
be
on
the
building
after
the
merger
bernie
would
be
chairman
of
the
merge
company
on
this
we
all
agree
and
we
agree
that
neither
john
hechinger
nor
dick
england
would
be
president
they
be
up
in
age
and
didn
t
want
to
run
a
company
anymore
bernie
say
arthur
s
gotta
be
president
because
arthur
know
what
he
be
do
but
hechinger
and
england
want
john
w
hechinger
jr
a
junior
officer
in
their
company
at
that
time
to
become
president
he
be
a
kid
a
nice
kid
but
a
kid
nonetheless
over
dinner
at
england
s
house
he
say
he
couldn
t
do
the
deal
if
we
wouldn
t
name
john
jr
as
president
of
the
new
company
bernie
told
him
that
that
be
too
bad
because
one
way
or
the
other
we
be
go
to
come
up
to
the
northeast
and
compete
head
to
head
a
merger
would
have
gotten
us
to
d
c
earlier
and
the
hechinger
people
would
have
be
time
wealthier
than
they
be
today
and
their
employee
would
have
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
well
off
but
they
just
didn
t
see
it
ultimately
john
jr
become
president
of
hechinger
and
it
lose
its
luster
despite
acquire
home

it
also
spurn
an
opportunity
to

a
great
business
but
the
company
never
change
with
the
time
it
have
a
formula
that
work
once
and
that
be
good
enough
for

if
you
don

you
be
a
dead
duck
you
must
wake
up
every
morning
and
wonder
who
will
destroy
me
today
if
i
don
t
keep
my
eye
open
you
must
constantly
think
about
way
to
outmaneuver
the
competition
and
be
the
number
one
horse
i
hechinger
be
not
the
only
opportunity
to

with
the

that
one
of

who

over
all
of
their
hard
good
business
we
knew
we
have
a
win
concept
but
we
be
still
a
small
company
maybe
store
to
their
or
more
we
didn
t
yet
have
category
killer
brand
name
and
product
like
sears
do
with
its
craftsman
tool
and
weatherbeater
paint
line
they
also
have
their
credit
card
and
they
have
consumer
trust
when
people
be
ask
what
retailer
they
trust
in
those
day
sears
be
the
common
response
we
be
look
for
way
of
accelerate
our
growth
this
be
prior
to
our
bowater
acquisition
we
thought
sears
might
be
a
good
partner
in
theory
sears
would
eventually
stop
sell
craftsman
in
their
store
make
the
brand
only
available
in
the
home
depot
store
and
it
would
have
be
a
huge
advantage
to
us
to
have
direct
access
to
every
sears
and
discover
credit
card
holder
that
be
magic
to
us
when
we
discuss
the
possibility
of
a
merger
with
sears
in
the
early
s
al
goldstein
be
their
executive
in
charge
of
acquisition
goldstein
suggest
a
purchase
price
of
no
more
than
million
for
our
company
it
be
technically
worth
about
million
at
the
time
base
on
the
value
of
the
stock
you
can
do
what
you
want
ken
langone
told
him
but
this
company
be
go
to
be
worth
a
hell
of
lot
more
than
million
and
you
aren
t
go
to
buy
it
cheap
at
that
point
sears
be
a
diversified
conglomerate
with
allstate
insurance
coldwell
banker
real
estate
and
the
discover
credit
card
we
saw
hardware
and
home
improvement
as
a
sideline
for
them
at
a
time
when
their
core
retail
business
be
go
down
the
drain
they
be
rid
the
wrong
horse
in
the
pre
arthur
martinez
day
be
eat
up
by
their
bureaucracy
unable
to
make
quick
effective
decision
when
bernie
be
president
of
odell
in
he
have
an
encounter
with
sears
that
color
his
view
of
that
company
for
year
sears
be
make
a
choice
between
carry
odell
s
esquire
and
another
shoe
polish
brand
but
you
d
think
it
be
decide
between
capital
punishment
and
life
in
prison
with
all
the
committee
the
de
cision
go
through
it
be
a
joke
bernie
spent
so
much
time
wrangle
with
sears
wait
anxiously
for
a
decision
that
he
threw
up
his
hand
and
make
it
for
them
take
our
product
out
of
your
store
he
say
i
don
t
want
you
sell
our
stuff
anymore
it
s
just
not
worth
it
we
could
have
do
more
for
craftsman
tool
in
those
day
than
sears
be
do
and
they
need
more
room
for
clothing
so
we
give
them
the
out
but
there
be
nobody
there
besides
goldstein
willing
to
take
the
chance
negotiation
didn
t
get
very
far
and
as
a
result
of
the
sears
deal
fail
and
the
subsequent
issue
bowater
create
for
us
we
realize
that
we
couldn
t
accelerate
as
simply
as
we
thought
we
could
growth
require
a
very
cautious
well
consider
plan
in
retrospect
we
would
not
have
be
able
to
handle
a
merger
with
sears
so
it
be
a
good
thing
for
us
that
it
fell
apart
but
it
will
probably
go
down
in
history
as
one
of
sears
s
big
mistake
ever
p
i
often
tell
our
people
that
if
we
didn
t
have
competitor
we
would
have
to
create
them
we
be
at
our
best
when
we
be
compete
against
somebody
so
our
perpetual
challenge
be
create
a
competitive
environment
even
when
it
doesn
t
materialize
naturally
in
market
where
there
be
no
eagle
hardware
garden
menard
s
or
lowe
s
or
strong
local
competition
we
must
make
sure
that
our
associate
really
believe
in
the
competitive
factor
there
be
always
independent
lumberyard
electrical
and
plumbing
supply
house
and
specialty
store
it
be
just
a
question
of
make
sure
that
our
folk
be
really
aware
of
them
and
that
they
recognize
who
and
what
be
our
real
competitor
who
else
be
move
product
who
else
be
move
commodity
and
who
else
be
take
care
of
the
customer
in
the
marketplace
sometimes
it
be
company
that
you
be
aware
of
sometimes
it
be
company
whose
name
you
don
t
know
competition
be
an
important
part
of
be
aggressive
and
competitive
our
nature
be
to
be
in
your
face
i
ii
t
our
people
really
get
turn
on
by
competition
we
understand
that
we
be
in
the
business
not
to
destroy
a
competitor
but
to
serve
the
customer
if
as
a
result
of
that
we
end
up
hurt
a
competitor
that
be
fine
but
it
can
t
be
our
focus
our
focus
have
to
be
on
the
customer
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
we
have
to
win
the
customer
we
don
t
have
to
beat
the
competitor
we
have
to
win
the
customer
but
by
win
the
customer
we
also
take
advantage
of
the
competitor
consider
any
serious
competitor
we
have
in
any
market
any
single
competitor
represent
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
total
amount
of
lumber
and
building
material
all
of
the
product
that
we
sell
in
any
particular
market
so
even
if
we
get
all
their
business
it
would
not
begin
to
support
the
kind
of
business
that
we
have
today
that
s
why
we
focus
on
the
whole
industry
where
all
the
merchandise
be
be
sell
as
well
as
by
the
name
competitor
that
most
people
think
of
that
say
there
be
a
lot
to
be
say
for
one
on
one
competition
when
we
first
expand

it
be
pretty
funny
to
us
a
company
of
barely
a
dozen
store
but
it
really
rally
our
troop
we
blew
that
story
up
really
big
and
post
it
in
the
phoenix
store
and
when
we
go

we
actually
put

something
that

and
sufficient

that
be
the
mechanical
part
of
the
business
we
win
their
heart
and
their
mind
with
our
people
growth
it
be
like
basic
training
you
learn
how
to
do
a
lot
of
thing
then
you
go
to
war
and
improvised
arthur
one
of
the
company
that
we
have
admire
over
the
year
have
be
wal
mart
because
despite
their
success
the
founder
always
retain
a
degree
of
humility
about
themselves
david
glass
say
one
of
the
reason
they
haven
t
move
from
bentonville
arkansas
be
because
they
always
want
to
remember
who
they
be
and
where
they
come
from
sam
walton
often
told
us
that
the
way
wal
mart
reach
billion
in
sale
be
by
concentrate
on
its
store
not
on
the
number
that
become
the
basis
of
our
success
as
well
we
both
open
a
ton
of
store
because
we
have
so
much
control
of
merchandise
distribution
finance
and
infrastructure
merchandise
we
negotiate
the
low
possible
price
base
on
enormous
buying
power
and
our
willingness
to
pay
invoice
immediately
instead
of
pay
for
merchandise
on
net
day
or
even
we
pay
in
five
day
or
less
sometimes
we
send
check
overnight
that
policy
be
usually
good
for
an
additional
discount
from
vendor
and
if
you
ask
me
what
be
the
value
of
have
a
decentralize
merchandising
staff
like
the
home
depot
s
i
d
say
that
our
sale
volume
be
to
percent
high
because
we
re
make
decision
locally
rather
than
on
a
centralize
basis
distribution
most
of
our
vendor
ship
directly
to
our
store
cut
out
middleman
distributor
that
save
everybody
time
and
money
it
s
not
that
we
re
oppose
to
distributor
but
if
we
buy
merchandise
direct
from
the
manufacturer
we
can
get
it
at
a
low
price
then
if
we
price
it
low
we
ll
create
high
sale
volume
we
do
have
some
warehouse
operation
either
for
handle
lumber
or
where
it
make
sense
to
source
merchandise
globally
in
a
related
issue
we
currently
spend
more
money
on
freight
than
any
other
retailer
in
the
country
because
of
the
size
and
weight
of
our
merchandise
so
we
ve
rechallenged
ourselves
to
take
the
air
and
waste
space
out
of
delivery
truck
and
thereby
reduce
our
freight
cost
significantly
that
enhances
our
gross
margin
not
by
change
our
pricing
but
by
change
our
cost
finance
this
go
back
to
the
root
of
our
company
we
didn
t
originally
want
to
start
with
four
store
in
atlanta
we
want
to
do
two
that
wasn
t
because
we
didn
t
have
the
capital
to
do
four
we
do
what
we
lack
be
the
safety
net
we
need
a
strong
balance
sheet
to
grant
ourselves
the
courage
to
make
the
tough
decision
we
need
to
make
even
if
it
initially
drain
our
resource
we
didn
t
want
to
be
whipsaw
by
the
marketplace
before
our
concept
have
a
fair
chance
i
always
tell
people
start
new
company
to
secure
twice
the
capital
they
think
they
need
not
because
they
need
the
money
but
because
it
give
you
the
confidence
and
the
strength
to
do
what
you
think
be
right
instead
of
be
push
by
external
financial
force
we
want
a
strong
financial
statement
so
we
could
ignore
the
immediate
financial
consequence
and
do
what
we
knew
be
right
take
the
long
term
position
we
didn
t
want
to
imply
we
could
only
offer
the
best
price
selection
or
service
for
thirty
day
so
we
ve
always
overcapitalize
the
company
for
many
year
we
have
the
weak
balance
sheet
in
the
industry
if
we
have
be
a
public
company
in
we
would
not
be
in
busi
ness
today
because
the
people
who
come
to
our
store
have
already
convince
themselves
we
would
not
be
in
business
in
nine
month
and
we
do
lose
half
of
our
capital
reserve
in
the
first
year
but
have
the
other
half
give
us
the
courage
to
keep
do
the
right
thing
today
our
excellent
credit
and
cash
reserve
make
financing
expansion
easy
infrastructure
because
we
plan
our
growth
year
in
advance
we
have
invest
in
the
human
resource
we
will
need
to
ramp
up
expansion
before
not
after
the
fact
an
excellent
example
of
this
be
our
philosophy
of
hire
people
who
be
overqualified
for
the
position
to
which
they
be
initially
assign
charlie
barnes
be
a

manager
at
handy
city
when
we
hire
him
in
to
run
one
of
our
first
store
we
knew
he
d
do
a
bang
up
job
with
that
first
store
and
could
oversee
many
more
after

us
as
a
buyer
bruce
berg
left
wickes
a

billion
per
year
business
at
the
time
and
join
home
depot
as
a
merchandising
vp
when
we
be
only
a
million
per
year
business
lot
of
people
take
these
kind
of
chance
on
us
over
the
year
we
have
overinvested
in
people
for
two
reason
first
if
people
have
that
extra
capacity
and
experience
they
can
probably
do
whatever
job
we
ask
of
them
second
it
give
us
the
opportunity
to
grow
the
company
more
quickly
because
these
people
have
untapped
capacity
they
be
not
run
in
fifth
gear
they
be
probably
in
first
or
second
gear
and
we
always
get
a
in
term
of
performance
from
them
more
recently
we
open
our
first
store
in
chile
with
a
full
merchandising
staff
that
s
an
unheard
of
commitment
for
a
single
store
but
ours
be
a
people
base
philosophy
hire
the
best
people
payroll
be
not
an
expense
to
us
it
s
an
investment
and
like
any
other
investment
as
long
as
you
be
get
a
return
on
that
investment
you
invest
in
the
best
quality
you
can
get
every
young
company
screw
up
we
be
no
exception
with
our
atlanta
and
south
florida
store
go
great
gun
we
look
for
way
of
dramatically
increase
the
size
and
scope
of
the
home
depot
brand
in
march
we
bought
land
in
los
angeles
for
multiple
future
store
and
also
consider
site
in
houston
san
diego
and
san
francisco
later
in
the
year
on
october
we
also
bought
a
fledgling
plano
texas
base
chain
by
the
name
of
bowater
home
center
bowater
be
a
million
acquisition
of
a
chain
with
nine
bigbox
hardware
store
somewhat
like
ours
but
in
market
we
be
not
in
dallas
shreveport
baton
rouge
and
mobile
and
when
we
say
somewhat
like
ours
we
can
say
on
good
authority
that
they
be
base
on
our
early
store
that
s
because
the
american
division
of
the
london
england
base
bowater
corp
newsprint
and
chemical
manufacturing
conglomerate
try
to
buy
the
home
depot
while
it
be
still
in
the
conceptual
stage
bowater
be
another
company
to
which
we
try
to
sell
a
percent
equity
stake
in
our
company
for
million
their
american
ceo
ralph
dillon
be
very
affable
and
understood
what
we
be
try
to
do
and
be
very
interested
in
our
business
concept
he
sent
his
accounting
staff
in
although
there
wasn
t
much
to
see
this
be
all
prior
to
the
first
store
opening
so
everything
you
could
know
about
us
be
contain
on
twelve
sheet
of
paper
there
be
no
balance
sheet
the
money
be
all
outbound
all
investor
be
really
buying
be
talent
he
saw
that
like
what
we
be
do
and
we
make
a
deal
and
then
he
go
back
to
london
and
the
hold
company
turn
him
down
flat
but
while
they
wouldn
t
approve
his
investment
in
our
company
they
didn
t
say
he
couldn
t
start
his
own
copycat
chain
so
that
s
what
he
do
he
literally
take
our
blueprint
and
start
from
scratch
opening
bowater
home
center
in
texas
and
louisiana
he
have
all
our
number
and
our
business
plan
the
only
thing
he
didn
t
have
be
the
experience
of
how
to
run
it
we
weren
t
go
to
get
to
texas
for
many
many
year
so
copying
us
so
blatantly
probably
seem
safe
back
east
in
atlanta
and
florida
the
home
depot
have
open
up
great
store
boasting
a
wondrous
esprit
de
corp
and
confidence
in
our
retail
philosophy
low
price
wide
selection
and
the
best
customer
service
anywhere
so
we
go
down
to
look
at
the
bowater
store
even
with
our
blueprint
they
just
didn
t
know
how
to
run
the
business
the
location
be
not
bad
but
they
have
old
inventory
the
store
be
beaten
up
look
and
they
be
only
sell
half
the
dollar
volume
of
our
store
still
we
believe
that
their
location
under
good
management
could
leapfrog
our
expansion
plan
several
year
ahead
and
dallas
fort
worth
be
a
key
market
we
want
to
be
in
we
never
anticipate
the
ancillary
loss
cause
by
suck
all
of
the
great
people
out
of
our
exist
store
and
send
them
to
fix
the
black
hole
that
be
bowater
when
you
do
that
you
weaken
yourself
which
be
exactly
what
happen
in
our
exist
store
the
burden
of
recast
bowater
fell
to
pat
farrah
he
assume
the
responsibility
for
change
the
store
merchandise
which
be
the
critical
area
it
be
a
major
undertaking
and
a
heavy
burden
for
him
one
of
the
reason
bowater
taxed
us
so
greatly
be
the
indirect
drain
it
put
on
our
exist
system
the
bowater
store
be
in
such
disarray
that
we
immediately
sent
some
of
our
best
talent
from
atlanta
and
south
florida
to
fix
them
that
left
gap
hole
back
in
our
own
store
so
we
didn
t
get
anticipate
revenue
in
the
bowater
store
and
exist
home
depot
store
sale
go
flat
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
for
experienced
home
depot
manager
who
fan
out
across
texas
and
louisiana
the
bowater
experience
be
a
return
to
the
early
depot
day
they
work
seven
day
a
week
twelve
or
more
hour
a
day
every
third
week
we
flew
them
home
or
flew
their
spouse
and
child
to
them
but
it
be
a
difficult
tax
existence
they
bore
the
pressure
of
not
only
convert
these
runaway
store
but
also
save
our
rear
end
back
in
atlanta
the
conversion
of
the
merchandise
be
difficult
because
bowater
only
carry
about
half
of
the
product
that
home
depot
carry
we
have
the
task
of
introduce
all
of
the
home
depot
stock
keep
unit
skus
individual
variation
of
product
line
phase
out
the
one
that
we
didn
t
carry
and
then
mesh
them
all
together
product
by
product
aisle
by
aisle
we
put
familiar
home
depot
merchandise
on
bowater
shelf
and
dumped
bowater
product
onto
the
floor
mark
them
down
to
fire
sale
price
we
couldn
t
wait
to
get
them
out
the
door
culturally
we
be
as
different
as
night
and
day
home
depot
store
manager
spend
their
day
on
the
floor
wander
their
store
solve
problem
for
customer
and
associate
alike
most
bowater
store
manager
be
pencil
pusher
they
hid
in
office
as
do
their
assistant
manager
they
weren
t
prepared
to
do
the
side
by
side
go
go
work
that
we
expect
one
of
the
few
exception
be
vern
joslyn
who
not
only
stuck
with
us
but
go
on
to
become
president
of
our
northeast
division
our
people
sometimes
take
unusual
step
to
get
across
the
difference
in
the
two
retail
culture
ron
mccaslin
who
be
now
our
director
of
store
system
support
arrive
at
a
bowater
store
in
louisiana
one
day
point
to
the
manager
s
office
and
with
great
fanfare
announce
that
be
not
part
of
the
home
depot
then
he
climbed
aboard
a
forklift
and
literally
plow
through
the
wall
of
the
office
until
they
be
dust
we
terminate
all
of
the
bowater
corporate
executive
almost
all
of
them
anyway
when
everyone
else
be
go
one
old
gentleman
kept
show
up
for
work
each
day
he
d
go
to
his
little
office
toward
the
back
shuffle
paper
make
phone
call
and
generally
give
the
impression
of
be
busy
none
of
us
knew
who
he
be
somehow
this
particular
vice
president
slip
through
the
crack
so
every
day
he
come
into
the
office
he
never
talk
to
anybody
never
say
anything
finally
somebody
saw
through
his
ruse
and
he
too
be
fire
we
eventually
interviewed
all
the
employee
and
explain
one
on
one
what
the
home
depot
be
all
about
simultaneously
we
kept
the
store
open
and
yet
tore
them
apart
remodel
and
remerchandising
them
into
home
depot
all
the
while
use
employee
who
resent
us
in
the
end
we
terminate
almost
percent
of
the
original
bowater
crew
u
rv
w
vv
i
ii
every
one
of
us
could
feel
the
resentment
when
we
come
in
and
demand
tliat
they
work
the
hour
that
we
expect
everybody
to
work
it
didn
t
go
over
real
well
ironically
if
the
bowater
employee
have
channel
as
much
pride
into
bowater
while
it
be
a
go
concern
it
would
have
meld
much
more
easily
with
the
home
depot
bowater
put
an
unanticipated
and
unwelcome
demand
on
our
vendor
as
well
we
pressure
them
to
take
back
bowater
merchandise
where
they
refuse
we
marked
good
down
and
sell
them
at
a
loss
but
some
of
the
merchandise
in
these
store
be
so
bad
we
couldn
t
even
give
it
away
the
home
depot
have
always
be
a
high
multiple
stock
part
of
the
explanation
for
it
be
that
the
financial
community
trust
us
they
know
that
we
be
aboveboard
with
them
they
know
that
if
something
be
out
there
on
the
horizon
that
we
be
concerned
about
we
will
tell
them
up
front
for
a
time
the
bowater
debacle
severely
test
our
goodwill
on
wall
street
until
we
ultimately
turn
the
situation
around
it
temporarily
dampen
the
euphoria
for
the
home
depot
it
s
not
easy
be
a
public
company
you
have
to
answer
to
a
ton
of
people
you
have
to
answer
a
lot
of
question
and
wall
street
s
memory
be
only
as
good
as
your
iasi
quarter
long
term
for
the
street
be
between
breakfast
and
lunch
you
always
have
to
run
your
business
worry
about
how
much
somebody
else
say
you
will
make
somebody
who
may
not
have
enough
knowledge
to
understand
what
your
potential
be
but
against
all
of
those
negative
without
public
money
this
company
would
still
be
a
chain
of
four
store
in
atlanta
georgia
the
reason
we
be
who
we
be
today
be
the
public
money
the
fact
that
people
bought
our
stock
believe
in
us
thought
that
what
we
be
do
be
right
saw
in
our
store
exactly
what
we
preach
that
the
customer
service
be
well
than
anywhere
else
that
the
product
knowledge
be
well
than
anywhere
else
that
our
pricing
be
well
than
anywhere
else
they
bought
us
base
on
the
truth
of
what
we
told
them
about
ourselves
and
they
could
go
see
it
for
themselves
such
trust
be
invaluable
to
us
and
we
didn
t
want
to
do
anything
that
would
puncture
or
endanger
it
we
arrange
a
series
of
meeting
in
new
york
in
which
bernie
and
ron
brill
every
hour
on
the
hour
for
a
full
day
come
clean
with
the
fund
manager
and
analyst
who
cover
our
company

before
each
group
bernie
stood
up
and
bluntly
announce
i
be
the
ceo
of
this
company
and
i
be
a
schmuck
in
precisely
those
word
we
screw
it
up
we
should
have
close
the
bowater
store
after
that
bernie
told
them
about
the
corrective
measure
that
we
put
in
place
to
prevent
a
repeat
in
the
future
he
assure
them
that
the
growth
and
profitability
would
continue
and
they
believe
bernie
many
ceo
would
blame
a
bowater
type
fiasco
on
the
economy
blame
it
on
this
or
blame
it
on
that
we
didn
t
blame
it
on
anybody
we
blame
it
on
ourselves

seriousness
of
our
miscalculation

with
the
banking
syndicate
lead
by
security
pacific
s
faye
wilson
and
thank
god
that
deal
be
do
and
secure
we
couldn
t
have
make
the
same
deal
a
month
later
it
would
have
be
year
before
we
would
ever
be
able
to
go
back
to
the
financial
community
and
get
this
kind
of
money
while
all
the
pessimist
wag
finger
at
us
it
give
us
enormous
resolve
to
prove
that
we
weren
t
an
accident
we
say
we
ll
show
these
people
just
how
good
we
be
and
we
do
in
retrospect
bowater
wasn
t
even
a
good
real
estate
deal
because
we
eventually
close
all
the
store
we
acquire
and
built
big
well
home
depot
store
close
by
if
we
have
just
pass
on
bowater
altogether
it
probably
would
have
go
out
of
business
anyhow
bowater
taught
us
we
re
never
as
smart
as
we
think
we
be
you
have
to
look
at
yourself
your
talent
and
ability
realistically
we
thought
we
be
well
we
thought
we
could
handle
anything
success
be
breeding
a
little
arrogance
and
we
learn
that
sometimes
you
believe
you
can
do
more
than
you
really
can
do
on
the
other
hand
maybe
it
be
a
good
deal
even
though
it
only
give
us
six
store
in
dallas
fort
worth
the
other
store
be
in
louisiana
even
though
tlie
transition
take
longer
and
be
more
raucous
than
we
dream
and
even
though
it
produce
an
ugly
quarter
for
us
on
wall
street
it
do
secure
our
position
in
dallas
fort
worth
and
the
other
market
that
be
amaze
consider
that
at
the
time
handy
dan
have
seventeen
unit
there
pay
less
cashways
have
thirteen
and
boise
cascade
have
eight
and
once
we
start
make
money
on
those
store
in
we
never
stop
those
store
become
cash
cow
for
this
company
and
the
deal
give
us
vern
joslyn
an
assistant
manager
at
bowater
who
have
go
on
to
become
president
of
the
northeast
division
so
bowater
be
a
great
and
hard
lesson
learn
after
bowater
bernie
ken
and
i
sat
down
for
a
serious
heart
to
heart
we
have
no
choice
but
to
change
the
philosophy
of
the
company
the
decision
that
come
out
of
that
meeting
be
first
we
would
ask
the
board
to
pas
a
resolution
that
we
could
not
grow
at
a
pace
exceed
percent
new
store
a
year
the
board
agree
to
cap
our
annual
growth
so
we
would
never
again
be
tempt
to
do
more
than
that
we
want
the
board
to
protect
us
from
ourselves
and
it
have
second
we
would
be
more
cautious
about
buying
a
company
and
keep
its
management
in
place
because
you
can
t
match
the
home
depot
culture
anywhere
we
have
competitor
that
copy
every
single
thing
that
we
do
we
just
have
to
be
so
careful
that
no
matter
how
they
copy
us
they
cannot
copy
the
essence
of
what
the
home
depot
be
all
about
at
the
time
the
bowater
acquisition
come
crash
down
on
our
head
we
be
ready
to
close
on
some
great
real
estate
in
detroit
so
our
third
major
decision
be
to
sell
all
four
property
in
detroit
we
simply
could
not
go
to
detroit
we
no
longer
have
the
surplus
of
qualify
people
that
we
have
before
bowater
we
be
stretch
more
from
a
personnel
standpoint
than
a
financial
standpoint
we
just
couldn
t
afford
to
do
it
fortunately
the
real
estate
in
detroit
be
so
good
that
ron
brill
sell
it
in
very
fast
order
and
at
a
profit
to
pace
membership
warehouse
we
be
in
despair
when
our
longtime
banker
at
security
pacific
national
bank
rip
fleming
retire
in
it
be
even
more
trouble
when
the
home
depot
account
be
turn
over
to
a
new
loan
officer
neither
fleming
nor
we
felt
that
this
new
banker
have
the
correct
vision
of
our
future
we
be
a
small
company
with
store
and
revenue
of
s
million
and
he
couldn
t
envision
us
as
a
big
one
and
instead
of
the
hand
on
intimate
relationship
we
have
with
fleming
we
be
be
handle
in
a
traditional
manner
by
the
bank
s
smallbusiness
group
we
be
number
and
point
to
them
not
people
with
unique
personality

and
the
other
company
she

gopto

be
interested
in
achieve
more
protection
and
guarantee
for
the
bank
wilson
be
a
reserve
unassuming
woman
who
doesn
t
look
like
a
powerhouse
but
she
speaks
with
great
passion
she
be
an
articulate
woman
who
be
not
afraid
to
stand
up
and
be
heard
she
be
a
lion
in
sheep
s
clothing
she
be
a
killer
who
go
about
her
business
as
calmly
as
a
librarian
and
she
literally
save
our
company
in
just
after
we
acquire
bowater
but
before
it
turn
nightmarish
it
be
clear
we
would
continue
to
grow
as
ever
tire
question
be
pay
for
that
growth
we
begin
a
new
dialogue
with
security
pacific
national
bank
and
wilson
about
put
together
a
new
to
million
line
of
credit
that
would
allow
us
to
grow
from
fifty
store
and
annual
sale
of
million
to
a
hundred
store
and
give
us
the
fund
to
operate
them
this
also
force
us
to
make
wide
range
decision
on
whether
we
would
lease
or
purchase
property
in
the
future
what
our
balance
sheet
would
look
like
versus
our
obligation
and
with
regard
to
the
store
themselves
the
inventory
it
would
take
to
open
so
many
wilson
say
that
to
do
a
loan
this
large
she
would
organize
a
con
sortium
of
bank
who
would
share
the
risk
we
be
banking
with
a
variety
of
institution
besides
security
pacific
a
small
bank
in
louisiana
citizen
southern
in
atlanta
first
atlanta
and
banker
trust
through
its
local
office
in
atlanta
wilson
say
we
need
to
bring
in
another
large
new
york
bank
such
as
j
p
morgan
she
also
suggest
a
southeast
bank
with
a
strong
atlanta
presence
wachovia
they
come
to
a
meeting
but
ultimately
decline
to
participate
we
then
look
at
where
the
home
depot
might
grow
in
the
future
and
also
sought
to
include
bank
in
texas
and
chicago
j
p
morgan
pass
first
atlanta
an
atlanta
headquarter
bank
that
handle
our
import
related
letter
of
credit
and
be
later
acquire
by
wachovia
stayed
in
as
do
banker
trust
and
c
s
c
s
be
a
party
to
our
previous
credit
line
and
handle
trust
business
for
us
at
the
time
it
be
also
our
stock
transfer
agent
the
problem
come
when
wilson
receive
a
call
from
the
c
s
loan
officer
who
have
be
in
the
syndication
meeting
with
us
we
later
learn
that
he
thought
our
expansion
into
california
be
too
risky
so
at
the
last
minute
he
unilaterally
make
the
decision
that
the
bank
would
not
participate
in
the
deal
this
set
off
alarm
because
here
be
a
local
bank
one
that
knew
the
company
knew
the
management
presumably
have
an
ability
to
physically
be
involve
day
to
day
look
at
operation
if
they
wish
and
we
have
other
business
with
them
their
withdrawal
for
unexplained
reason
be
less
an
issue
of
their
share
of
the
cash
but
the
appearance
of
a
problem
at
home
what
would
another
bank
one
we
didn
t
already
have
a
relationship
with
say
c
s
must
know
something
we
don
t
know
it
create
a
potential
blackball
effect
wilson
call
ron
brill
that
afternoon
and
give
him
the
bad
news
he
relayed
the
development
to
us
and
we
felt
sick
we
expect
c
s
s
decision
would
surely
scuttle
the
syndicate
but
wilson
told
us
not
to
worry
don
t
you
do
anything
she
say
i
will
take
care
of
this
she
say
that
very
calmly
as
she
say
everything
she
immediately
start
work
the
phone
and
work
through
the
njght
to
keep
the
deal
from
collapse
none
of
the
other
syndicate
member
blink
wilson
have
be
with
the
company
and
walk
the
analyst
through
the
bowater
acquisition
much
as
we
have
with
rip
fleming
her
predecessor
we
talk
regularly
with
wilson
we
have
a
good
understand
she
knew
how
detail
orient
the
company
be
and
we
knew
that
she
didn
t
want
bad
news
but
like
to
know
what
be
come
so
we
particularly
ron
brill
be
very
good
about
send
information
to
security
pacific
and
be
very
regular
about
call
her
with
update
security
pacific
demonstrate
its
absolute
confidence
in
us
by
pick
up
c
s
s
share
rather
than
reduce
the
total
in
the
great
tradition
of
rip
fleming
wilson
convince
her
bank
to
actually
increase
its
exposure
security
pacific
have
a
new
chief
credit
officer
at
the
time
one
who
come
in
after
fleming
s
many
home
depot
related
loan
scuffle
he
say
to
wilson
be
you
willing
to
put
your
job
on
the
line
for
this
yes
she
say
be
have
security
pacific
not
take
on
more
risk
its
partner
in
the
syndicate
would
certainly
have
reconsider
their
own
situation
wilson
save
us
from
endure
that
ignominy
it
be
the
second
time
a
banker
from
security
pacific
have
save
our
bacon
the
next
morning
she
call
and
told
us
the
deal
be
do
and
we
close
on
time
but
we
didn
t
know
until
later
what
she
go
through
on
our
behalf
the
c
s
withdrawal
be
a
real
learn
experience
for
us
not
so
much
that
anyone
could
have
predict
the
bank
s
decision
but
that
we
can
often
find
depth
of
character
and
brilliance
in
unexpected
place
from
that
point
on
we
look
at
faye
wilson
differently
than
we
ever
do
before
she
become
our
new
tower
of
strength
when
the
bank
sent
her
to
work
with
international
client
at
its
security
pacific
hoare
govett
office
in
london
in
she
be
name
that
division
s
manage
director
of
merger
and
acquisition
our
relationship
with
the
bank
change
dramatically
then
because
we
no
longer
have
anyone
there
to
personally
represent
our
interest
but
because
we
frequently
travel
overseas
we
stayed
in
close
contact
with
wilson
faye
we
told
her
when
you
come
back
to
the
u
s
we
want
you
on
our
board
she
understood
who
we
be
how
we
ran
our
business
the
culture
she
understood
everything
about
the
home
depot
she
also
love
to
be
in
our
store
this
be
a
woman
who
love
the
home
depot
as
much
as
we
do
if
wilson
thought
we
be
just
be
nice
the
day
she
do
return
from
europe
in
mid
she

besides
she

already
retire

out
of
a
job
we
weren
t
do
with
c
s
incidentally
naturally
we
as
a
corporation
and
as
individual
cancel
all
of
our
business
with
c
s
we
sent
a
letter
to
all
of
our
employee
encourage
them
to
pull
their
personal
account
from
c

we
blame
the

even
though
the
chairman
of
the
board
per
sonally
insist
that
the
fault
lay
with
one
mistaken
loan
officer
we
say
if
you
have
procedure
that
allow
one
person
to
unilaterally
almost
kill
a
company
we
don
t
want
to
do
business
with
you
in
retrospect
it
s
interest
that
c
s
drop
out
of
the

before
anybody
include
us
knew
about
the
mess
bowater
be
become
when
that
news
broke
someone
at
c
s
probably
enjoy
a
moment
of
superiority
to
the
bank
in
our
syndicate
but
that
be
short
live
not
only
do
we
survive
bowater
but
we
have
long
since
outlive
c
s
which
disappear
in
a
merger
with
nationsbank
in
but
we
wouldn
t
do
business
with
nationsbank
either
until
several
year
later
when
we
put
together
a
new
line
of
credit
million
and
finally
invite
the
then
preeminent
southeastern
bank
to
participate
which
they
gladly
do
the
credit
line
close
in
early
november
the
begin
of
the
fourth
quarter
and
it

in
the
fourth

the
challenge
of

in
shortly
before
this

come
to
a
head
ken
langone
s
mother
die
and
he
have
the
unpleasant
task
ofcleaning
out
her
long
island
home
prior
to

ask
the

sure
enough
they
didn
t
have

so
he
bought
a

instead
near

again
while
we
now
have
a

in

it
be

place
it
take
us
longer

where
we
have
go
in

will
end
up
depend
on
how
many
more
we
open
near
enough
to
cannibalize
them
we
severely
underestimated
the
sale
that
dense
population
such
as
those
found
in
paramus
new
jersey
and
long
island
could
generate
and
compound
our
error
by
overestimate
the
competition
we
may
even
have
underestimated
how
good
our
own
product
be
we
have
to
do
so
many
thing
differently
so
quickly
it
be
sort
of
like
basic
training
in
the
military
you
learn
how
to
do
a
lot
of
thing
then
you
go
to
war
and
then
you
threw
it
all
away
and
improvised
the
only
thing
you
really
learn
in
basic
training
be
how
to
improvise
really
when
all
be
say
and
do
the
goal
be
survival
for
us
the
northeast
be
the
retail
equivalent
of
a
war
zone
but
not
in
the
way
the
skeptic
predict
our
volume
be
so
unbelievably
high
any
concept
of
customer
service
above
and
beyond
keep
product
on
the
shelf
go
right
out
the
window
we
sell
job
lot
quantity
the
amount
of
good
that
pro
customer
would
order
for
one
of
their
project
such
as
interior
door
or
electrical
junction
box
and
brought
in
massive
amount
of
product
just
to
stay
in
stock
over
the
weekend
we
thought
we
be
mass
merchandising
before
but
when
we
get
into
a
store
that
be
do
a
million
dollar
or
two
million
dollar
a
week
that
s
when
we
really
learn
how
to
mass
merchandise
just
to
stay
in
stock
it
show
our
flexibility
and
our
enhance
ability
to
adapt
not
only
to
positive
development
but
to
negative
one
too
that
be
a
very
very
important
issue
that
go
back
to
find
out
what
you
be
do
right
and
what
you
be
do
wrong
for
one
thing
we
need
more
people
before
then
have
associate
on
a
store
s
payroll
be
a
lot
but
in
the
northeast
a
single
store
might
employ
as
many
as
people
and
we
need
them
quicker
we
have
to
speed
up
the
hire
training
and
enculturation
process
everything
have
to
be
accelerate
that
demand
apply
to
our
vendor
as
well
our
northeast
store
be
hungrier
for
product
than
any
other
unit
in
the
company
so
the
vendor
have
to
respond
more
quickly
than
they
have
before
the
tempo
picked
up
dramatically
much
to
their
own
pleasant
surprise
most
manufacturer
discover
they
could
keep
up
those
that
couldn
t
fell
by
the
way
side
if
we
have
not
adapt
we
would
have
have
so
many
ticked
off
customer
we
would
have
die
as
a
company
we
didn
t
change
our
general
business
philosophy
training
or
operational
practice
to
enter
the
northeast
but
we
be
force
to
radically
reexamine
our
approach
to
merchandising
in
volume
and
that
change
the
company
a
lot
the
store
we
open
there
do
many
many
time
high
volume
than
even
we
be
accustom
to
we
grow
wilhin
our
ability
in
the
northeast
there
be
always
a
desire
to
open
more
than
we
could
handle
but
we
always
open
less
than
we
could
handle
instead
of
opening
three
or
four
store
in
some
market
we
open
just
one
or
two
we
make
sure
that
we
be
staffed
with
the
right
kind
of
people
we
spent
a
phenomenal
amount
of
time
and
energy
on
training
if
that
work
we
could
always
add
more
store
later
the
key
be
to
do
it
right
the
first
time
there
be
al
way
the
issue
of
whether
employee
in
the
northeast
would
treat
customer
as
well
as
they
do
in
the
south
where
people
be
generally
more
genteel
but
we
found
wonderful
people
we
filter
a
lot
of
people
out
find
people
in
the
orientation
process
selection
of
people
become
very
critical
and
they
become
as
good
or
well
than
anybody
else
in
this
company
the
successful
change
we
make
operationally
in
the
northeast
be
instantly
apply
in
the
south
and
the
west
as
well
the
paradigm
that
change
most
be
that
we
found
that
virtually
every
item
that
we
carry
every
line
of
good
need
to
be
package
in
great
quantity
in
the
south
we
would
sell
electrical
receptacle
and
then
order
more
in
the
northeast
we
need
a
thousand
of
the
same
item
so
then
we
go
back
to
the
vendor
and
say
we
will
no
longer
buy
these
in
pack
don
t
even
think
about
pack
them
to
a
box
we
want
a
coffin
we
want
you
to
bundle
up
a
thousand
of
them
at
a
time
once
they
recover
from
the
shock
at
the
dramatic
size
of
our
order

us
for
take
too
long
to
get
into
market
such
as
seattle
detroit
and
chicago
but
our
philosophy
be
to
commit
store
to
market
where
we
already
be
establish
and
have
become
the
strong
player
in
the
marketplace
number
one
in
number
of
store
number
one
in
assortment
pricing
service
and
so
on
we
always
felt
that
if
we
do
our
thing
the
best
we
would
be
the
leader
in
the
marketplace
and
we
could
take
that
same
package
of
best
and
replicate
it
in
the
next
market
in
california
our
marketing
campaign
be
more
specialized
than
they
have
be
in
atlanta
florida
or
texas
we
enter
the
mar

the

have
the
capacity
to
hold
more
product
they
be
cleaner
brighter
pricing
be
extremely
aggressive
but
what
ultimately
blew
the
californian
away
be
the
high
service
level
in
our

a

stephen

to

president
of

he
held
the
position
for
only
a
couple
of
month
however
before

recruit
away
by
the
molson
company
which
be
best
know
for
its
canadian
brewery
molson
assign
him
to
start
a
canadian
base
home
improvement
chain
the
home
depot
be
not
yet
in
canada
so
it
wasn
t
directly
competitive
but
we
and
our
ex
merchant
knew
we
be
go
there
eventually
aikenhead

home
improvement

the

be
call
built
a
good
reputation
with
customer
but
molson
see
us
loom
on
the
horizon
decide
that
rather
than
do
battle
with
us
it
make
more
sense
to
join
force
we
bought
a
percent
interest
in
aikenhead
s
in
and
change
its
name
to
the
home
depot
canada
we
bought
out
the
rest
of
molson
s
interest
in
it
be
a
much
well
operation
than
bowater
which
have
make
us
wary
of
acquisition
aikenhead
s
have
good
people
and
some
critical
real
estate
that
we
want
they
also
have
partner
that
would
be
important
to
have
in
a
new
and
for
us
foreign
marketplace
in
aikenhead
s
molson
have
a
business
that
be
very
successful
at
least
from
a
customer
service
point
of
view
customer
love
the
store
and
base
on
that
aikenhead
s
employee
participate
in
a
bonus
plan
that
give
the
impression
the
company
be
succeed
but
in
reality
the
store
be
lose
fistful
of
money
that
become
a
problem
in
merge
the
company
because
we
have
to
break
the
news
to
aikenhead
s
employee
that
their
store
be
not
financially
viable
which
be
why
molson
sell
out
to
us
it
take
a
long
time
to
get
aikenhead
s
payroll
and
operating
expense
in
line
it
didn
t
happen
overnight
we
invest
a
year
in
convert
their
operational
system
and
it
take
us
almost
two
year
to
bring
our
value
into
this
company
but
it
be
still
a
well
transition
than
bowater
because
by
the
time
we
bought
aikenhead
it
could
not
as
a
percentage
affect
the
bulk
of
our
business
the
way
bowater
have
we
also
do
something
new
rather

many
of
them
to
work
in
our
u
s
store
for
month
at
a
time
and
we
sent
people
from
the
united
state
to
canada
so
that
we
all
learn
each
other

culture
it
later
become
the
model
for
develop
our
first

that
even

what
the

the
growth
of
our
canadian

have
go
from
good
to
spectacular
the
hour
home
improvement
center
may
be
one
of
our
boldest
most
customer
friendly
move
yet
the
decision
to
expand
a
store
s
hour
to
an
around
the
clock
schedule
be
something
larry
mercer
and
i
push
through
after
several
year
of
try
it
be
base
on
a
very
scientific
method
we
count
headlight
how
much
traffic
be
drive
by
the
store
at
midnight
or
three
in
the
morning
our
flush
store
in
the
new
york
city
borough
of
queen
be
the
first
to
go
hour
in
june
a
huge
portion
of
the
population
there
work
the
midnight
shift
your
off
hour
may
be
after
six
p
m
and
on
the
weekend
theirs
might
be
one
in
the
morning
and
they
want
a
place
to
shop
especially
those
planning
to
start
their
home
improvement
project
by
two
a
m
we
want
a
home
depot
that
serve
their
need
there
be
already
twenty
of
these
store
and
there
will
be
a
significant
increase
in
their
number
in
the
near
future
usually
in
urban
area
that
tend
to
be
congest
during
the
day
the
hour
seven
day
a
week
store
create
some
communication
and
teach
problem
for
the
company
we
be
already
do
video
training
sunday
morning
at
or
a
m
and
we
have
to
push
that
back
in
some
store
to
a
m
and
instead
of
one
store
manager
each
unit
have
two
we
double
the
size
of
the
home
depot
inc
every
year
the
base
number
of
store
keep
grow
but
we
believe
we
have
the
infrastructure
in
place
to
double
the
company
again
in
the
next
four
year
when
we
go
from
four
to
eight
store
in
expand
from
atlanta
into
south
florida
it
almost
kill
us
because
the
next
four
store
be
high
volume
than
the
first
four
store
and
we
weren
t
ready
for
it
but
we
learn
from
our
mistake
for
the
last
decade
the
home
depot
s
growth
have
be
very
consistent
between
percent
and
percent
each
year
in
term
of
store
count
this
be
not
growth
for
growth
s
sake
it
s
a
strategy
for
profitable
growth
in
response
to
favorable
trend
that
we
see
in
the
marketplace
they
include
an
increase
in
household
growth
in
the
overall
industry
continued
cultivation
of
exist
customer
as
well
as
consolidation
in
the
industry
and
opportunity
in
the
international
marketplace
as
we
have
grown
the
industry
have
grown
and
we
still
don
t
have
a
huge
market
share
the
do
it
yourself
industry
base
on
number
be
about
billion
in
annual
sale
we
still
only
do
percent
of
that
total
market
billion
in
to
put
that
in
context
percent
of
the
product
in
our
industry
be
sell
outside
of
our
store
so
when
people
ask
if
supplier
have
the
capacity
to
grow
with
us
sure
they
do
they
be
shipping
more
than
percent
of
what
they
make
now
to
retailer
other
than
us
that
leaf
a
lot
of
business
worth
compete
over
and
the
fact
be
billion
be
an
inaccurate
depiction
of
the
market
an
important
part
of
our
mindset
about
growth
be
redefine
our
view
of
the
home
improvement
industry
in
we
redefine
the
traditional
measurement
to
include
product
already
sell
by
us
or
our
competitor
and
sale
to
customer
in
business
related
to
home
improvement
that
be
not
include
in
the
traditional
measure
we
look
at
how
all
building
material
be
sell
in
the
united
state
and
canada
with
a
limited

as
a
whole
be
even
more
fragment
than
the
traditionally
define
home
improvement
industry
it
be
everything
from
provide
light
bulb
for
a
howard
johnson
s
motor
lodge
to
supply
renovation
material
for
a
single
family
home
instead
of
the
billion
a
year
industry
the
consultant
describe
we
see
close
to
a
billion
a
year
market
the
home
depot
s
market
share
in
the
billion
industry
be
only
about
percent
provide
lot
of
opportunity
for
growth
of
the
billion
billion
be
spending
by
professional
customer
electrician
and
plumber
general
contractor
repair
and
remodelers
and
heavy
construction
we
then
exclude
area
outside
our
core
business
such
as
steel
beam
concrete
and
other
heavy
construction
and
wound
up
with
a
pro
market
of
billion
our
piece
of
this
pie
be
very
small
about
percent
and
this
be
where
we
be
look
at
opportunity
to
gain
market
share
by
rethink
the
pond
in
which
we
fish
we
have
expand
our
market
and
give
the
home
depot
an
almost
limitless
opportunity
this
pro
market
can
be
split
in
two
the
small
pro
customer
who
do
repair
and
remodel
and
the
large
pro
the
small
pro
typically
spends
less
than
in
total
annual
material
purchase
and
make
most
of
those
purchase
at
home
center
or
wholesale
supply
house
the
large
pro
spends
more
than
annually
and
rarely
shop
in
home
center
instead
make
most
purchase
at
wholesaler
or
other
outlet
this
latter
group
require
extensive
price
tier
rebate
and
large
scale
delivery
admittedly
the
traditional
home
depot
store
be
not
equip
to
adequately
serve
all
of
the
large
pro
customer
s
need
the
small
pro
however
be
already
a
home
depot
customer
but
only
buy
percent
of
his
or
her
material
from
us
that
s
our
real
opportunity
service
and
relationship
be
most
important
to
the
small
pro
less
so
pricing
because
we
be
already
perceive
as
be
price
competitive
they
shop
our
store
for
convenience
sake
so
we
need
to
provide
faster
in
and
out
service
and
go
far
in
develop
relationship
with
them
to
address
these
two
primary
issue
we
be
put
a
separate
pro
service
desk
into
our
store
to
quickly
meet
the
pro
s
product
and
service
need
we
be
also
reach
out
to
them
with
the
probook
a
business
trade
finally
we
re
add
new
credit
program
and
a
menu
of
delivery
option
at
competitive
price
to
get
product
to
the
pro
faster
we
realize
we
cannot
serve
all
pro
customer
efficiently
and
profitably
inside
our
exist
store
that
s
why
we
re
initially
focus
on
one
segment
of
the
pro
business
and
we
will
not
rob
resource
from
the
diy
customer
to
attract
pro
customer
one
of
the
significant
advantage
we
do
have
with
regard
to
the
pro
customer
be
that
time
be
money
our
store
be
open
long
hour
seven
day
a
week
the
average
supply
house
where
most
pro
do
their
business
be
open
a
m
to
p
m
and
a
couple
of
hour
on
saturday
we
originally
only
carry
home
improvement
product
and
home
improvement
brand
name
such
as
black
decker
today
we
have
grown
beyond
that
however
and
we
stock
contractor
brand
such
as
halo
light
dewalt
power
tool
and
milwaukee
tool
often
whatever
be
good
for
the
pro
turn
out
to
be
doubly
good
for
the
do
it
yourselfer
it
be
not
just
a
question
of
get
the
job
do
well
either
they
like
tool
they
like
good
product
and
they
get
a
kick
out
of
have
high
quality
product
that
they
can
work
with
and
show
off
to
their
neighbor
the
home
depot
have
deliberately
and
continually
expand
the
hardware
and
home
improvement
market
we
introduce
new
product
broaden
selection
found
or
inspire
merchandise
that
make
project
easy
to
do
yourself
eventually
we
reach
the
point
where
we
be
stimulate
manufacturer
to
make
product
that
be
more
friendly
in
term
of
appeal
application
construction
and
preassemble
part
when
we
first
sign
up
milwaukee
tool
as
a
vendor
we
talk
their
product
up
as
a
high
quality
high
end
addition
to
our
overall
merchandise
selection
a
store
manager
in
north
plainfield
new
jersey
get
so
excite
about
it
he
call
pat
farrah
up
on
a
thursday
and
say
come
see
what
i
have
do
with
these
well
instead
of
tuck
the
milwaukee
tool
in
a
nice
place
where
only
our
pro
customer
would
know
to
look
for
them
he
built
an
endcap
display
full
of
these
professional
tool
that
retail
for
each
on
average
the
endcap
be
stack
floor
to
ceiling
pat
didn
t
even
know
that
milwaukee
make
that
many
saw
in
a
year
let
alone
that
he
would
ever
see
them
in
one
place
but
there
they
be
on
display
sign
and
ready
to
go
pat
a
man
who
can
be
brought
to
tear
by
a
gleam
stack
of
plier
nonetheless
thought
there
be
not
enough
contractor
in
all
of
new
jersey
to
buy
all
these
tool
he
be
wrong
the
follow
monday
the
manager
call
again
and
invite
him
back
to
the
store
you
have
to
see
this
he
say
four
day
later
half
of
the
tool
in
the
display
have
be
sell
it
told
us
that
it
wasn
t
just
the
pro
buying
these
product
do
it
yourselfers
be
buying
them
too
just
like
one
person
buy
a
chevy
and
another
take
a
bmw
some
customer
want
the
option
of
choose
a
milwaukee
or
a
dewalt
over
a
no
name
saw
we
help
create
this
breed
of
people
who
want
to
buy
high
end
hardware
product
they
want
and
can
afford
to
emulate
the
pro
when
we
first
get
to
atlanta
do
it
yourselfers
be
people
who
mow
their
own
lawn
and
maybe
paint
once
in
a
while
we
encourage
and
taught
them
to
do
room
addition
electrical
wiring
and
plumbing
through
our
clinic
we
take
the
fear
out
of
a
lot
of
project
instead
of
say
i
can
t
do
that
we
put
our
customer
in
front
of
pro
who
show
them
how
since
opening
our
first
store
in
atlanta
we
have
give
confidence
to
diyers
all
across
north
america
that
if
the
project
do
not
go
well
we
would
take
care
of
them
one
of
the
key
strategy
of
this
company
have
always
be
to
do
thing
before
we
need
to
do
them
that
may
sound
obvious
but
lot
of
company
get
paint
into
a
corner
then
they
have
to
react
instead
of
pre
act
one
of
the
reason
we
own
as
much
real
estate
as
we
do
today
percent
of
exist
site
and
nearly
percent
of
new
location
be
that
we
want
to
control
the
store
through
the
development
cycle
with
the
simultaneous
consolidation
of
chain
and
overall
growth
of
sale
take
place
in
our
industry
we
don
t
want
to
end
up
in
a
few
year
accept
c
and
d
quality
location
because
all
the
well
site
be
go
the
merchant
act
n
who
be
star
out
the
window
wonder
where
we
will
be
in
five
year
bernie
pat
farrah
be
always
look
for
opportunity
to
make
the
store
well
some
day
he
communicate
those
idea
well
than
other
day
early
associate
have
to
be
smart
enough
to
separate
his
message
from
the
way
in
which
he
deliver
it
which
be
sometimes
direct
and
unsympathetic
some
people
couldn
t
handle
that
especially
when
he
use
language
that
would
not
be
consider
politically
correct
these
day
this
area
be
an
abortion
pat
would
holler
but
that
critical
eye
for
detail
represent
an
important
stage
of
our
development
it
make
us
well
it
make
us
noncomplacent
pat
be
a
hand
on
guy
and
when
the
company
get
to
the
size
where
he
couldn
t
touch
everything
every
day
it
frustrate
him
when
he
couldn
t
be
in
every
store
every
day
when
he
couldn
t
be
involve
in
everything

outer
limit

he
work
hour
that
be
inhuman
and
he
drove
the
people
that
work
for
us
to
be
just
like
him
he
be
a
merchant
and
that

strain
of

up
with
him
anymore
i

as
a
complete
shock
we
didn
t

how
serious
the
problem
with
pat
be
until
this
merchant
spoke
up
he
be
exhaust
emotionally
and
physically
here
s
why
workday
with

morning
the
next
morning

would
start
at

a
m
all
over
again
this
would
go
on
seven

and

in
a
row
because
he
always
work
weekend
pat
be
destroy
even
the
heartiest
people
work
for
him
he
drove

and

time
come
for

big
and
big
every
day
and

the
way

way

for
him
they
all
love
him
they
all
respect
him
they
thought
he
be
a
brilliant
merchant
but
you
can
t
push
people
that
far
that
long
and
expect
them
to
be
able
to
function
they
just
couldn
t
do
it
as
for
pat
he
be
frustrate
he
be
the
type
of
guy
who
expect
that
if
he
walk
into
a
home
depot
everybody
would
know
him
he
once
told
us
how
aggravate
he
be
because
he
walk
into
several
store
and
he
would
say
hey
you
have
to
do
this
and
you
have
to
do
that
and
they
would
say
who
be
you
why
be
you
tell
us
what
to
do
and
he
would
say
what
do
you
mean
who
be
i
pm
pat
farrah
burnout
be
a
shopworn
phrase
that
doesn
t
quite
explain
this
situation
it
be
more
an
issue
of
pat
not
be
able
to
adapt
to
the
breadth
of
what
we
have
become
pat
have
the
capacity
for
create
something
from
nothing
but
he
have
this
great
need
to
be
all
over
to
be
the
home
depot
ambassador
of
everything
and
it
reach
a
point
where
he
couldn
t
be
manage
we
have
some
stretch
where
i
didn
t
speak
to
pat
for
day
at
a
time
because
i
thought
he
be
be
too
crazy
the
problem
sim
mered
for
six
month
as
this
madness
this
hyperkinetic
frantic
behavior
rise
to
a
boil
when
he
left
it
be
one
of
the
saddest
day
we
have
ever
know
because
he
be
a
guy
who
we
love
dearly
love
like
a
brother
we
care
about
his
well
be
and
health
and
his
health
be
not
good
he
be
not
take
care
of
himself
and
we
be
concerned
about
what
be
go
to
happen
to
him
more
important
he
left
the
thing
he
love
the
most
which
be
the
home
depot
he
love
it
because
he
be
one
of
the
creator
of
it
and
leave
be
a
terrible
terrible
day
for
him
and
for
all
of
us
not
only
that
he
be
such
a
fun
guy
he
be
such
an
upbeat
guy
and
so
great
to
be
around
his
passion
be
an
inspiration
for
us
all
when
pat
left
in
we
all
thought
our
store
company
be
big
but
it
be
tiny
in
many
way
pat
farrah
s
departure
in
marked
the
home
depot
s
come
of
age
whenever
pat
be
around
there
be
controversy
life
be
never
quiet
and
peaceful
the
air
be
always
electric
and
after
he
be
go
we
have
to
generate
more
of
our
own
electricity
we
miss
him
but
we
also
prove
to
ourselves
that
we
could
still
run
the
business
even
if
it
wasn
t
as
much
fun
without
him
we
come
to
understand
that
the
culture
we
create
be
big
than
any
one
person
and
would
survive
and
flourish
when
the
day
come
for
any
of
the
founder
to
move
on
the
next
ten
year
saw
unbridled
and
virtually
unrestrained
expansion
as
the
number
of
store
and
associate
multiply
we
developed
mature
operational
system
and
settle
into
life
as
an
unqualified
retail
success
both
in
the
aisle
and
on
wall
street
it
be
a
heady
time
and
yet
because
we
re
not
a
couple
of
year
old
it
didn
t
go
to
our
head
we
enjoy
success
but
stayed
ground
at
the
same
time
a
decade
later
in
late
one
of
the
happiest
day
of
our
life
occur
pat
farrah
return
to
the
company
we
never
lose
touch
with
pat
pat
have
always
be
in
the
family
he
be
never
banish
we
always
talk
on
the
phone
we
always
do
thing
together
such
as
play
golf
arthur
organizes
an
out

every
year
that
always
brought
the
four
home
depot
partner
together
pat
never
miss
it
in
his
year
away
from
us
he
help
his
kid
michael
and
shannon
into
adulthood
i
le
and
his
second
wife
ann
spent
their
time
at
home
in
california
florida
and
hawaii
he
bought
two
ocean
racer
and
a
foot
sport
fishing
boat
in
a
disorganize
manner
we
include
ken
langone
begin
plant
a
seed
for
pat
s
ultimate
return
a
good
two
year
before
he
actually
come
back
ken
even
help
pat
attract
million
to
finance
his
other
business
mg
product
he
sell
merchandise
to
us
through
mg
product
so
he
would
be
in
our
store
and
every
so
often
he
would
call
one
of
us
about
something
that
distressed
him
in
a
home
depot
you
be
run
a
terrible
business
you
have
to
do
this
you
have
to
do
that
actually
he
wouldn
t
say
you
have
to
do
this
pat
would
say
v
have
to
do
this
ave
be
do
this
wrong
in
his
mind
he
never
left
the
home
depot
and
everything
he
told
us
be
dead
on
accurate
and
we
listen
closely
to
him
arthur
begin
informal
discussion
with
pat
in
late
about
return
him
to
the
fold
i
harbor
doubt
about
the
sagacity
of
such
a
move
so
we
take
our
time
finally
after
a
day
of
play
golf
at
arthur
s
annual
tournament
in
pat
and
i
be
walk
together
when
he
start
tell
me
all
the
thing
we
need
to
fix
in
the
store
pat
i
say
i
be
tire
of
listen
to
you
tell
me
what
we
have
to
do
i
think
it
s
time
for
you
to
come
back
we
all
felt
the
same
way
people
outside
this
company
never
quite
understood
our
eagerness
to
bring
pat
back
into
the
fold
the
company
be
go
great
gun
they
say
why
do
you
need
him
back
certainly
not
because
thing
have
deteriorate
sale
per
square
foot
and
sale
per
store
be
both
up
dramatically
in
the
ten
year
he
be
away
we
have
also
see
improvement
on
gross
margin
and
in
the
lower
of
our
cost
of
buying
product
in
fact
from
to
everything
get
well
his
departure
actually
marked
our
come
of
age
but
in
term
of
create
a
spark
building
the
training
environment
have
a
vision
we
want
that
from
pat
a
home
run
hitter
like
mark
mcgwire
be
not
a
balance
player
every
couple
of
at
bat
he
hit
one
out
of
the
park
in
between
however
he
may
just
as
often
strike
out
a
team
could
probably
win
without
him
but
a
mcgwire
be
a
great
addition
to
a
team
he
thrill
the
fan
he
also
excites
his
own
teammate
everybody
want
to
see
him
play
so
if
you
re
look
for
a
long
ball
player
you
want
a
mark
mcgwire
or
a
pat
farrah
in
your
organization
we
simply
have
not
be
able
to
duplicate
many
of
pat
s
strength
he
be
such
an
unusual
guy
today
sure
we
re
a
huge
success
but
what
about
five
year
from
now
who
be
star
out
the
window
wonder
where
we
will
be
then
the
company
be
do
well
because
of
its
size
but
like
anything
else
if
you
aren
t
always
renew
your
youth
you
get
old
we
notice
in
the
early
s
that
we
didn
t
have
the
same
verve
that
we
d
once
have
we
need
not
only
to
revive
ourselves
but
we
also
need
some
new
think
sometimes
you
get
so
close
to
the
tree
you
don
t
see
the
forest
right
there
be
a
difference
between
a
great
company
and
an
also
ran
company
a
great
company
go
beyond
make
money
a
great
company
have
a
mission
a
vision
a
dream
we
need
a
road
map
back
to
the
forest
we
also
become
a
little
fat
a
little
arrogant
we
re
the
big
we
re
the
best
we
can
do
whatever
we
want
but
that
attitude
also
make
you
lazy
and
sloppy
as
we
ultimately
discover
when
we
found
we
be
pay
too
much
for
certain
product
that
would
have
never
happen
on
pat
s
watch
we
give
our
merchant
too
much
latitude
only
to
learn
that
in
certain
category
our
competitor
and
even
small
company
be
get
well
deal
than
we
be
we
need
a
revival
of
aggressiveness
in
deal
with
certain
vendor
they
need
to
be
remind
that
we
must
always
be
the
cheapest
guy
in
town
the
home
depot
need
pat
farrah
to
keep
us
think
like
youngster
we
need
some
aggressive
behavior
we
need
some
craziness
i
consider
myself
a
damn
good
merchant
but
pat
be
well
he
be
the
best
any
of
us
have
ever
see
we
want
him
on
the
team
back
in
the
homeco
day
and
we
never
stop
longing
for
him
during
the
decade
he
be
away
pat
well
knew
when
he
return
that
he
be
come
into
a
situation
that
be
potentially
fraught
with
risk
for
him
and
for
the
company
therefore
his
return
demand
a
great
level
of
patience
and
diplomacy
than
have
be
his
hallmark
in
the
past
the
year
away
from
the
company
mellow
the
man
without
cost
him
his
edge
pat
recognize
that
he
might
be
a
threat
to
some
people
and
he
bent
over
backward
not
to
be
one
he
grow
into
a
marvelous
developer
of
talent
so
people
who
have
a
desire
will
grow
by
virtue
of
their
proximity
to
him
and
people
who
be
threaten
by
pat
will
be
threaten
by
anybody
and
probably
shouldn
t
be
with
us
some
people
who
use
to
work
with
pat
and
be
still
with
us
felt
that
he
desert
them
when
he
left
when
he
come
back
year
later
there
be
some
bad
feeling
you
have
be
go
all
this
time
you
expect
to
step
right
back
in
and
tell
us
what
to
do
and
they
didn
t
like
it
there
be
some
reticence
on
a
lot
of
people
s
part
people
who
be
fairly
high
up
in
the
organization
today
who
might
have
be
merchant
when
pat
be
the
head
merchant
but
if
you
spoke
to
those
same
people
today
they
would
say
it
be
terrific
that
he
come
back
bill
hamlin
our
executive
vice
president
of
merchandising
and
a
group
president
deserves
tremendous
credit
for
create
the
environment
that
allow
pat
farrah
to
return
bill
be
pat
s
bos
so
it
fell
to
him
to
create
a
situation
in
which
pat
could
come
back
and
once
more
make
a
substantial
contribution
and
not
only
that
but
to
establish
a
complementary
positive
relationship
with
him
few
people
i
know
could
do
that
if
bill
have
say
i
don
t
want
this
guy
back
i
m
the
senior
merchant
in
this
company
we
would
not
have
be
able
to
bring
pat
back
we
value
bill
s
contribution
too
much
to
undermine
him
it
would
have
create
a
very
divisive
environment
but
bill
work
hard
to
create
a
place
where
pat
could
come
back
and
be
pat
stardust
wart
and
all
as
it
turn
out
bill
be
a
very
good
counterbalance
for
pat
he
know
how
to
get
people
to
buy
into
and
support
pat
s
idea
he
also
know
how
to
diplomatically
step
on
pat
s
brake
too
because
with
skus
on
average
in
every
store
and
store
we
need
good
system
to
focus
us
on
what
department
need
attention
bill
s
very
good
at
that
the
beauty
be
that
they
balance
and
respect
each
other
much
the
way
arthur
and
i
do
pat
brought
a
lot
of
the
old
culture
back
the
hand
on
feel
he
be
a
wonderful
motivator
he
have
train
our
merchant
and
gotten
them
back
to
the
basic
which
the
big
we
become
the
more
they
need
to
do
in
rejoin
us
pat
realize
he
have
nothing
left
to
prove
the
home
depot
be
an
enormous
over
the
top
success
and
he
be
one
of
the
reason
pat
doesn
t
have
to
worry
about
title
or
status
or
anything
else
this
time
around
everybody
know
that
he
have
immediate
and
direct
access
to
us
pat
know
who
he
be
like
who
he
be
but
he
be
still
a
dangerous
person
he
could
still
bury
us
with
inventory
in
fact
it
almost
happen
when
he
first
come
back
we
say
pat
you
cannot
order
anything
you
coordinate
you
facilitate
you
be
not
order
we
be
not
give
you
a
pen
so
he
pumped
the
merchant
up
and
they
go
out
and
they
would
order
all
the
inventory
in
response
to
whatever
pat
say
when
we
confront
him
he
be
like
the
cute
little
not
me
ghost
child
in
the
family
circus
comic
strip
he
would
say
i
didn
t
do
it
it
wasn
t
me
but
it
be
him
he
goad
them
on
say
thing
like
who
in
this
room
won
t
step
up
and
order
some
of
this
so
they
all
step
up
and
that
quickly
we
be
overinventoried
merchant
get
in
a
room
away
from
regular
people
and
they
get
a
little
crazy
or
instead
of
test
a
product
in
one
market
they
order
the
product
for
every
market
and
we
can
t
do
that
anymore
we
have
too
many
store
that
ten
year
of
season
away
from
us
be
good
for
all
of
us
the
impact
that
pat
have
have
in
this
company
in
the
last
few
year
can
t
be
measure
there
be
an
indefatigable
spirit
he
brought
with
him
that
we
sorely
miss
pat
will
look
at
something
and
say
if
you
make
it
just
that
way
i
can
sell
of
them
but
if
you
make
that
blue
instead
of
yellow
i
can
sell
of
them
don
t
ask
pat
to
explain
how
he
come
up
with
those
number
but
il
be
scary
how
many
time
he
be
right
that
be
pat
s
genius
he
brings
a
special
verve
to
our
business
that
no
one
else
can
match
it
s
a
style
of
look
at
a
product
and
know
how
we
can
make
it
well
or
how
we
can
get
the
vendor
to
do
something
differently
and
thereby
drive
more
volume
through
the
store
pat
can
instinctively
tell
us
how
to
create
a
well
value
perception
of
us
with
consumer
how
we
can
clean
up
sku
creep
it
s
all
second
nature
to
him
not
everybody
can
be
entrepreneurial
from
a
creative
standpoint
and
we
create
that
environment
for
pat
we
give
him
a
hothouse
to
flourish
in
twenty
year
ago
and
we
re
do
it
again
now
it
be
like
we
create
a
seed
bed
in
which
pat
could
be
plant
and
then
we
kept
die
storm
and
the
crap
and
the
creditor
and
the
bank
and
the
this
and
the
that
and
everybody
away
from
him
until
he
could
grow
we
need
him
he
need
us
we
be
incomplete
without
him
he
stretch
our
parameter
and
we
protect
his
blind
side
when
he
come
back
the
first
day
we
work
together
in
almost
a
decade
be
astound
the
magic
hadn
t
left
us
we
all
laugh
recognize
the
fact
that
we
be
the
same
and
the
combination
of
us
be
still
a
beautiful
thing
pat
be
a
great
part
of
this
culture
the
interrelationship
with
the
associate
and
the
interrelationship
of
the
company
witli
the
community
in
which
we
have
our
store
you
can
learn
something
from
him
just
by
be
around
him
for
more
than
ten
minute
he
walk
into
a
store
and
immediately
increase
the
level
of
morale
he
be
that
dynamic
and
at
any
moment
he
might
get
up
on
a
desk
start
clap
his
hand
and
get
a
cheer
go
when
we
set
up
the
home
depot
we
deliberately
engineer
a
fine
balance
between
the
merchandising
operation
and
financial
group
but
merchandising
be
always
key
it
didn
t
mean
the
financials
weren
t
important
or
that
operation
weren
t
important
but
we
knew
that
create
sale
be
the
most
important
the
role
of
operation
be
support
sale
the
role
of
the
financial
group
be
capture
the
dollar
and
reinvesting
them
when
pat
return
he
brought
back
all
of
the
passion
that
he
have
before
and
much
more
but
at
the
same
time
pat
recognize
his
own
limitation
he
still
work
terrible
hour
and
there
be
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
but
he
do
use
people
well
and
he
be
training
people
now
he
have
learn
that
he
must
train
people
in
order
to
get
thing
accomplish
he
understands
what
a
real
executive
do
and
we
be
strengthen
because
of
it
strategic
partner
we
have
to
be
psychologist
lover
romancers
and
con
artist
bernie
our
number
one
job
in
and
the
early
s
be
to
get
the
vendor
and
manufacturer
who
sell
us
good
to
see
a
vision
the
home
depot
as
the
number
one
home
improvement
center
in
the
world
the
relationship
between
us
and
the
company
that
sell
product
to
us
be
a
vital
link
in
our
success
today
we
leverage
our
store
enormous
sale
volume
to
get
the
best
possible
price
but
over
time
these
relationship
grow
from
leap
of
faith
on
the
manufacturer
part
to
great
nurture
and
respect
on
both
side
as
the
home
depot
become
a
brand
name
unto
itself
we
have
a
singular
vision
that
we
sell
over
and
over
again
the
first
group
we
sell
it
to
be
the
banker
the
second
be
the
vendor
we
use
to
tell
these
people
that
we
would
lead
our
industry
before
long
and
be
convincing
when
we
say
it
too
we
dare
them
to
look
into
our
eye
when
we
say
do
you
think
anything
be
go
to
stop
us
you
must
stick
to
a
vision
and
turn
people
into
believer
we
have
to
be
psychologist
lover
romancers
and
con
artist
to
get
them
aboard
our
ability
to
paint
a
picture
of
how
that
would
take
place
low
price
wide
selection
and
great
customer
service
be
what
convince
skeptical
manufacturer
to
sell
merchandise
to
us
during
the
early
year
we
would
take
the
vendor
out
and
use
all
of
our
guile
to
convince
people
to
do
business
with
us
we
spent
at
least
three
night
a
week
schmooze
and
pitch
to
vendor
at
pano
s
and
paul
s
restaurant
in
atlanta
we
be
pretty
good
dream
weaver
especially
with
something
in
which
we
fervently
believe
especially
where
our
life
be
on
the
line
we
talk
about
what
they
normally
would
sell
to
a
retail
store
then
we
would
give
them
round
number
of
what
we
thought
we
could
move
the
number
that
we
threw
out
be
one
they
have
never
heard
from
people
in
our
industry
before
most
didn
t
believe
us
until
we
laid
down
immense
order
we
didn
t
have
the
buying
power
of
our
establish
competitor
on
paper
we
couldn
t
compete
with
handy
city
or
handy
dan
but
we
be
very
good
at
sell
future
you
need
to
do
this
for
us
now
we
d
tell
vendor
because
down
the
road
we
will
have
fifty
store
eventually
we
will
be
the
big
in
the
industry
so
now
be
the
time
for
you
to
get
on
board
as
in
any
long
term
relationship
the
key
be
get
to
know
the
vendor
and
at
the
same
time
understand
what
motivate
them
then
we
motivate
them
we
appeal
to
their
greed
we
appeal
to
their
enthusiasm
for
new
concept
we
appeal
to
their
need
to
get
their
product
expose
manufacturer
give
us
target
projection
for
sale
line
and
then
we
would
ask
whether
we
could
get
incremental
discount
as
sale
volume
increase
so
if
the
cost
of
the
product
be
we
would
ask
when
sale
hit
can
we
get
a
percent
discount
and
when
we
sell
another
we
ask
for
a
percent
discount
at
we
then
ask
for
a
percent
discount
all
the
vendor
look
at
us
like
we
be
crazy
anyway
not
because
of
the
discount
per
se
but
because
there
be
no
way
in
the
world
we
would
get
that
kind
of
business
of
course
we
regularly
exceed
projection
so
when
we
receive
the
percent
quantity
discount
we
negotiate
in
the
begin
on
top
of
what
be
already
consider
a
good
price
the
vendor
be
shock
they
never
expect
us
to
sell
in
such
volume
in
lieu
of
direct
price
break
there
be
always
a
fresh
idea
to
get
a
manufacturer
to
provide
co
op
advertising
instead
by
the
time
we
expand
from
two
to
four
store
we
be
buying
product
equivalent
to
the
volume
that
handy
dan
order
for
all
of
its
store
it
be
mind
boggling
for
the
vendor
and
their
salesperson
the
sale
people
especially
want
to
believe
in
our
number
and
potential
they
have
to
be
optimistic
otherwise
they
couldn
t
survive
in
the
sell
business
so
we
be
sell
to
seller
sell
something
that
couldn
t
help
but
capture
their
commission
harden
heart
pat
farrah
and
i
have
a
grab
bag
of
different
routine
that
we
use
to
win
over
stubborn
vendor
the
most
basic
approach
be
a
mutt
and
jeff
thing
where
pat
would
start
talk
and
talk
when
he
lose
steam
i
would
jump
in
with
fresh
enthusiasm
before
the
vendor
could
change
the
direction
of
the
conversation
then
pat
would
talk
some
more
then
me
it
be
a
mortar
barrage
that
wore
down
the
opposition
since
then
we
have
learn
they
all
fear
that
we
would
be
bankrupt
inside
of
two
year
they
felt
this
way
because
people
like
frank
denny
who
take
over
handy
dan
when
arthur
and
i
be
fire
told
them
that
the
home
depot
concept
would
never
work
the
number
do
not
work
so
how
could
these
giant
store
turn
merchandise
fast
enough
to
pay
the
bill
in
a
sense
denny
and
the
others
be
right
the
number
didn
t
work
on
the
face
of
it
which
be
why
i
persuade
arthur
to
be
as
aggressive
as
humanly
possible
with
the
number
in
the
original
business
plan
there
be
no
reason
to
expect
a
two
or
even
four
store
southern
hardware
chain
would
not
only
be
able
to
dictate
who
it
bought
product
from
manufacturer
over
wholesale
distributor
but
price
and
term
as
well
pat
farrah
be
always
the
emotional
and
spiritual
leader
of
the
home
depot
s
merchant
those
men
and
woman
who
negotiate
with
vendor
and
manufacturer
to
acquire
good
for
sale
in
our
store
pat
taught
these
merchant
how
to
negotiate
how
to
handle
themselves
how
to
walk
away
don
t
be
afraid
to
ask
for
more
he
d
say
that
be
really
the
big
thing
don
t
be
afraid
to
ask
the
senior
buyer
in
this
company
work
under
pat
and
bill
hamlin
have
always
be
put
up
on
a
pedestal
they

our
cowboy
always
on
the
road

drive
go
wherever
the
deal

from
atlanta
to
beijing
from

under
tight
schedule
sometimes
wonder
where
they
ve

where
they
be
or
where
they
re
go
if
you
want

in

while
pat

role
with
the

be
to
take
this
energy
both
positive
and

and

bruce
berg
come
to
us
from
wickes
company
and
if
our
merchant
already
have
a
cowboy
reputation
when
berg
join
them
he
be
the
first
to
look
the
part
we
be
exactly
the
kind
of
place
berg
be
look
for
because
we
didn
t
care
if
he
have
a
beard
or
not
he
do
and
we
didn
t
care
if
he
wore
a
suit
or
not
he
do
not
we
be
only
interested
in
result
berg
come
here
partly
because
he
be
drawn
by
the
legend
of
pat
farrah
unfortunately
pat
left
the
company
less
than
six
month
later
the
two
didn
t
really
get
to
know
one
another
until
pat
return
a
decade
later
many
thing
have
change
about
this
company
over
the
year
but
one
thing
have
not
we
accept
people
for
what
they
be
and
who
they
be
as
long
as
they
be
go
in
the
same
direction
as
we
be
some
of
them
may
travel
at
mph
some
at
but
everybody
be
pretty
much
move
in
the
same
direction
those
that
don
t
usually
leave
the
company
of
their
own
volition
rarely
do
we
have
to
tap
somebody
on
the
shoulder
and
say
you
don
t
understand
the
culture
of
the
company
those
people
tend
to
move
on
by
themselves
as
for
berg
he
fit
in
one
of
his
early
assignment
and
the
one
in
which
he
have
the
great
long
term
impact
be
straighten
out
our
ceiling
fan
operation
pat
bought
ceiling
fan
like
there
be
no
tomorrow
from
every
factory
that
make
them
and
put
a
variety
of
brand
name
on
them
the
whole
operation
be
out
of
control
berg
put
all
those
diverse
product
under
a
single
brand
name
umbrella
hampton
bay
today
hampton
bay
be
the
large
sell
brand
of
ceiling
fan
in
the
world
by
quite
a
margin
and
it
be
a
brand
name
that
be
very
well
respect
we
fell
in
love
a
lot
in
the
early
day
but
sometimes
our
love
go
unrequited
some
large
national
manufacturer
company
such
as
m
and
wagner
paint
sprayer
initially
treat
us
as
if
we
could
be
bankrupt
in
a
week
that
be
their
opinion
ours
be
that
we
didn
t
need
their
merchandise
in
our
store
eight
year
and
several
hundred
store
later
m
come
back
to
the
bargaining
table
admit
they
have
make
a
serious
blunder
with
us
they
do
get
back
in
and
they
paid
a
very
steep
price
for
the
opportunity
they
be
always
important
to
us
but
not
at
the
price
of
put
up
with
their
condescend
behavior
but
even
that
relationship
still
need
to
be
tweaked
now
and
again
we
have
ten
store
in
minneapolis
where
im
be
base
but
one
of
their
key
guy
on
our
account
have
never
be
in
our
store
until
we
make
an
issue
of
it
be
that
pathetic
it
be
amaze
even
today
how
many
people
will
try
to
sell
to
us
and
they
don
t
even
know
us
step
one
for
any
vendor
get
to
know
us
spend
time
in
our
store
talk
to
our
associate
talk
to
our
customer
we
often
invite
vendor
to
conduct
their
meeting
with
our
merchant
on
the
store
sale
floor
to
get
them
to
understand
what
this
be
about
porter
cable
take
eight
year
to
convince
that
they
should
sell
to
us
klein
tool
take
eleven
year
people
in
the
industry
call
us
the
pound
gorilla
and
we
in
turn
say
to
vendor
that
when
you
start
to
dance
with
an
pound
gorilla
you
don
t
stop
dance
until
the
gorilla
want
to
stop
that
be
why
some
manufacturer
be
reluctant
to
sell
to
the
home
depot
once
we
become
big
they
miss
the
opportunity
when
the
company
be
small
and
now
they
look
at
it
and
wonder
do
i
really
want
to
stick
my
hand
in
its
mouth
do
i
trust
it
that
much
for
many
year
these
manufacturer
thought
a
stiff
wind
would
blow
us
away
then
we
begin
affect
their
core
business
halo
and
klein
both
sell
into
the
electrical
distribution
channel
we
eventually
affected
that
channel
use
other
supplier
one
day
the
electrical
trade
magazine
weren
t
talk
about
other
electrical
distributor
they
be
talk
about
the
effect
that
the
home
depot
have
on
their
business
the
instinct
of
survival
take
over
and
someone
decide
get
me
that
guy
from
home
depot
the
one
who
be
always
after
me
at
the
trade
show
the
traditional
line
of
distribution
prior
to
the
home
depot
be
very
strong
typically
most
manufacturer
sell
through
distributor
there
be
very
strong
relationship
built
up
over
the
year
it
take
a
tremendous
amount
of
energy
for
us
to
convince
manufacturer
that
the
world
have
change
we
be
not
go
to
buy
from
any
wholesaler
or
distributor
we
have
customer
come
into
our
store
who
be
consumer
of
many
of
these
product
when
they
couldn
t
buy
these
product
in
our
store
they
bought
something
else
so
we
have
to
convince
the
manufacturer
that
they
have
to
be
in
our
store
because
that
s
where
their
customer
be
that
be
our
sell
point
go
outside
one
of
our
store
and
interview
our
customer
we
d
tell
the
manufacturer
find
out
how
many
of
them
be
your
customer
and
be
no
longer
your
customer
every
business
be
there
to
please
the
customer
they
have
to
understand
that
the
way
they
do
thing
be
not
work
anymore
it
take
time
to
convince
them
that
that
type
of
distribution
be
go
away
and
they
need
to
jump
on
the
bandwagon
there
be
few
product
line
today
that
we
can
t
buy
direct
from
the
manufacturer
it
didn
t
matter
how
many
time
they
say
no
because
we
would
never
stop
ask
the
job
of
home
depot
mer
chant
be
get
their
own
way
they
be
professional
get
your
own
way
people
for
many
year
weiser
lock
be
one
of
those
manufacturer
that
didn
t
return
our
flirtatious
advance
it
already
have
a
satisfactory
form
of
distribution
utilize
a
wholesaler
in
south
georgia
addison
corp
now
rugby
building
product
inc
that
sell
its
product
across
the
south
but
we
didn
t
want
to
buy
anything
from
distributor
we
want
everything
direct
from
manufacturer
drop
ship
direct
from
their
plant
to
our
store
which
be
a
radical
way
to
do
business
in
those
day
that
s
because
it
be
cheaper
we
eliminate
a
layer
of
price
markup
with
direct
shipping
and
it
be
faster
by
not
go
through
distributor
we
get
the
good
much
faster
to
our
customer
but
weiser
didn
t
want
to
disrupt
its
distribution
the
company
figure
if
they
cut
a
new
deal
with
us
it
might
make
addison
angry
with
them
or
it
would
eat
into
addison
s
sale
we
kept
tell
them
that
we
have
customer
that
addison
would
never
see
we
personally
guaranteed
that
weiser
would
see
incremental
sale
increase
in
fact
we
promise
to
increase
weiser
s
exposure
we
make
that
pitch
to
phil
pryne
the
president
ofweiser
for
four
year
finally
in
the
early
s
we
wore
him
down
and
he
give
in
tire
of
hearing
our
relentless
song
and
dance
we
picked
up
the
full
line
ofweiser
lock
and
they
sell
like
crazy
the
very
same
year
weiser
s
wholesaler
addison
saw
an
percent
increase
in
sale
because
we
have
do
the
hard
work
of
increase
the
brand
s
name
recognition
in
our
advertising
we
have
burnish
our
point
in
green
and
orange
in
fact
weiser
sale
be
so
good
at
the
home
depot
that
when
pat
retire
in
he
have
an
unexpected
visitor
in
fellow
retiree
phil
pryne
pryne
have
sell
the
business
and
move
to
alamitos
bay
california
where
by
sheer
coincidence
he
live
seven
house
away
from
pat
on
christmas
eve
pryne
show
up
at
pat
s
house
with
a
big
magnum
of
champagne
i
just
want
to
thank
you
for
sell
me
on
sell
to
you
he
say
that
be
the
day
my
business
go
through
the
roof
that
be
the
day
i
become
a
multimillionaire
today
i
be
living
in
a
beautiful
house
on
the
water
here
because
you
make
me
sell
to
you
i
want
to
thank
you
and
let
you
know
that
i
truly
recognize
you
as
the
move
force
that
make
my
life
pat
be
stun
and
delighted
there
be
only
one
thing
i
be
angry
about
pryne
add
couldn
t
you
have
convince
me
to
sell
to
you
faster
there
be
a
real
art
to
negotiate
and
get
people
to
do
what
you
want
them
to
do
and
work
to
the
death
and
be
happy
about
it
it
s
largely
because
when
we
say
we
will
do
something
we
will
now
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
our
merchant
will
make
a
commitment
and
we
won
t
be
able
to
fulfill
it
or
there
be
case
in
which
a
vendor
think
he
get
a
raw
deal
from
us
if
that
happens
we
will
make
it
right
period
we
back
our
word
percent
and
people
know
that
so
even
though
they
have
to
work
really
tight
on
their
margin
to
sell
to
us
they
aren
t
afraid
to
because
they
know
that
they
will
get
back
their
risk
with
us
our
criterion
for
which
product
line
we
carry
be
define
right
from
the
begin
as
that
merchandise
in
which
our
sale
dominate
the
category
second
we
have
to
have
top
of
mind
awareness
for
the
category
for
example
when
people
think
of
kiddy
swim
pool
they
don
t
think
first
of
the
home
depot
they
think
of
toy
r
us
target
or
wal
mart
they
will
never
think
of
us
for
kiddy
swim
pool
so
there
be
no
reason
for
us
to
carry
them
but
when
people
need
a
filter
for
their
furnace
who
do
they
think
of
us
so
even
if
we
don
t
make
money
on
furnace
filter
we
must
stock
them
and
the
third
question
be
be
it
a
product
essential
for
the
repair
refurbish
remodel
or
fix
up
of
a
home
or
business
if
the
answer
be
no
to
any
of
those
question
then
we
don
t
have
any
business
carry
that
product
the
sheer
number
of
transaction
we
do
in
every
store
make
us
attractive
to
vendor
the
big
we
get
the
more
vendor
will
show
up
with
phenomenally
profitable
opportunity
to
get
their
product
visibility
in
our
store
but
because
we
can
t
confuse
our
customer
about
what
business
we
be
in
we
must
often
say
no
to
some
great
deal
the
home
depot
concept
take
hard
sell
in
the
early
day
because
even
if
salesperson
want
to
sell
to
us
when
they
pitch
it
to
their
company
the
comptroller
cfo
or
credit
manager
would
turn
the
deal
down
for
our
merchant
a
sale
meant
not
only
convincing
the
salesperson
but
also
the
cfo
and
eventually
the
ceo
we
often
have
to
deal
with
all
three
to
get
deal
do
pat
farrah
would
say
i
need
to
have
this
and
then
we
would
have
to
go
after
a
manufacturer
to
sell
it
to
us
it
be
difficult
especially
when
the
merchandise
in
question
come
from
someone
who
lose
money
on
pat
at
homeco
i
knew
peter
gold
of
price
pfister
a
manufacturer
of
high
quality
plumbing
fixture
for
the
bath
and
kitchen
from
my
handy
dan
day
he
decline
our
first
advance
to
carry
his
line
but
i
wouldn
t
take
no
for
an
answer
peter
i
say
not
only
be
you
go
to
sell
to
us
but
we
be
go
to
buy
it
cheaper
than
we
do
at
handy
dan
and
i
need
extra
advertising
dollar
because
we
have
no
money
and
we
need
invoice
postdate
on
top
of
that
normally
their
date
be
end
of
the
month
eom
or
day
date
but
we
would
get
or
even
day
to
pay
our
invoice
that
be
as
important
to
us
as
buying
the
product
cheaper
it
ease
our
cash
flow
immeasurably
we
didn
t
know
when
the
cash
be
go
to
start
flow
so
pay
for
anything
be
a
crapshoot
gold
appreciate
our
long
friendship
but
there
be
big
issue
confront
him
if
i
sell
to
you
gold
say
i
have
already
be
told
that
i
will
probably
lose
percent
of
my
business
maybe
percent
there
be
people
who
will
immediately
stop
buying
from
me
if
i
sell
to
you
there
be
subtle
threat
like
this
from
competitive
retailer
to
almost
every
manufacturer
gold
do
sell
to
us
and
he
do
lose
that
other
business
but
his
act
because
he
be
very
influential
in
the
vendor
community
convince
a
lot
of
other
vendor
to
sell
us
product
after
he
sell
his
business
gold
join
our
board
and
serve
with
distinction
today
our
store
represent
a
very
important
part
of
many
vendor
overall
business
both
in
term
of
sale
and
bottom
line
do
business
with
us
require
a
great
commitment
of
manufacturer
resource
because
for
us
to
stock
their
product
across
all
of
our
store
they
must
invest
heavily
in
manufacturing
and
distribution
as
well
as
money
for
display
collateral
and
advertising
and
while
we
be
loyal
to
a
fault
shelf
space
in
the
home
depot
be
brutally
competitive
we
have
an
insatiable
appetite
for
merchandise
to
the
point
of
frequently
suggest
new
national
or
regional
product
or
line
extension
to
our
vendor
occasionally
manufacturer
run
into
trouble
with
us
when
they
can
t
keep
up
with
demand
but
that
s
not
for
lack
of
warn
from
us
we
keep
our
vendor
thoroughly
apprise
of
our
expansion
plan
for
example
and
we
expect
them
to
take
step
to
keep
us
fully
stock
in
the
early
day
we
do
this
because
it
be
important
to
get
their
support
have
them
believe
in
the
concept
and
have
an
understand
of
what
we
be
try
to
accomplish
today
we
tell
the
vendor
where
we
be
go
and
when
we
will
be
there
these
manufacturer
be
not
like
chicken
little
where
the
sky
will
fall
down
on
them
one
day
home
depot
store
be
plan
well
in
advance
at
any
time
we
know
how
many
and
where
our
new
site
will
be
for
the
next
four
to
five
year
we
actively
share
with
them
the
level
of
detail
they
need
so
that
they
have
the
distribution
and
manufacturing
in
place
to
keep
up
there
be
some
individual
vendor
situation
where
we
be
an
awfully
big
piece
of
their
pie
and
that
be
not
good
for
us
or
them
we
don
t
want
to
get
too
dependent
and
neither
should
they
despite
our
best
effort
to
work
with
and
help
them
grow
with
us
some
manufacturer
still
make
the
mistake
of
say
yes
to
us
when
they
should
say
no
or
at
the
very
least
maybe
if
they
stretch
themselves
too
far
everybody
get
in
trouble
and
no
one
be
serve
we
do
ask
for
a
vendor
s
best
price
and
because
of
the
velocity
of
our
sale
not
just
the
volume
of
product
sell
but
the
speed
with
which
they
come
in
the
back
door
and
go
out
the
front
there
be
other
way
we
expect
to
be
recognize
by
supplier
that
might
mean
make
appropriate
allowance
for
return
and
high
level
of
service
in
our
high
volume
store
but
most
important
we
insist
they
ship
full
order
we
can
t
sell
product
from
empty
shelf
over
the
year
as
we
experienced
monumental
growth
spurt
business
come
full
circle
and
we
found
out
that
we
have
to
help
the
manufacturer
help
us
part
of
our
vendor
presentation
each
year
be
a
preview
of
the
year
ahead
in
term
of
new
store
demand
for
product
and
expectation
we
also
use
this
opportunity
to
highlight
or
introduce
new
technology
we
be
use
to
increase
operational
efficiency
if
you
be
do
million
with
us
today
we
d
say
then
most
certainly
you
will
have
to
expand
capacity
and
manufacturing
capacity
because
every
four
year
we
will
double
in
size
and
you
must
be
much
farther
ahead
of
the
curve
to
just
keep
pace
we
learn
to
do
that
the
hard
way
because
until
then
we
be
grow
at
such
a
clip
that
we
just
suck
some
manufacturer
dry
today
manufacturer
understand
much
well
how
much
product
we
will
sell
and
how
fast
their
salesperson
salivate
to
get
in
the
door
and
we
must
really
temper
their
lust
let
me
tell
you
what
be
go
to
happen
if
we
carry
your
product
we
ll
warn
we
will
blow
you
away
we
will
suck
everything
out
of
your
inventory
meanwhile
they
re
not
listen
do
their
sell
routine
say
that
s
fine
we
have
it
cover
and
sure
enough
we
will
drain
their
inventory
and
it
take
them
month
to
catch
up
we
be
force
to
cease
do
business
with
some
vendor
because
they
do
not
want
to
make
the
investment
necessary
to
keep
up
with
the
demand
that
happens
even
to
the
big
kid
on
the
block
because
some
of
these
manufacturing
plant
must
invest
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
in
equipment
to
satisfy
our
need
few
board
of
director
will
vote
to
fund
that
just
to
satisfy
one
customer
we
be
very
loyal
to
these
people
within
reasonable
limit
especially
those
who
bought
the
dream
early
on
however
it
s
not
blind
loyalty
if
somebody
else
come
in
and
be
able
to
sell
to
us
a
well
quality
product
at
a
significant
discount
and
the
exist
vendor
can
t
match
it
or
deal
within
a
tolerance
level
we
will
unfortunately
switch
we
need
to
be
price
competitive
that
situation
developed
with
a
light
manufacturer
that
have
be
with
us
forever
a
wonderful
company
a
competitor
of
theirs
come
in
and
undercut
them
by
percent
they
have
to
go
back
and
sharpen
their
pencil
and
they
get
within
three
point
that
be
good
enough
because
they
have
brand
name
recognition
a
track
record
with
us
and
they
be
very
credible
people
too
so
we
stayed
with
them
but
we
also
give
their
competitor
an
opportunity
to
sell
to
us
because
they
really
force
the
other
company
s
hand
we
have
take
a
more
proactive
approach
to
our
ongoing
vendor
relationship
initiate
periodic
product
line
review
that
have
radically
reduce
our
assortment
in
certain
area
incidentally
our
policy
be
that
no
vendor
can
be
cut
off
without
the
line
be
review
by
a
senior
company
officer
and
when
our
merchant
have
a
problem
with
a
vendor
they
ask
a
senior
merchandising
officer
to
come
in
if
they
can
t
solve
it
which
be
rare
arthur
or
i
will
personally
work
with
them
to
find
a
resolution
if
johnson
johnson
brings
out
something
new
for
baby
parent
almost
instinctively
believe
the
product
will
be
pure
and
safe
something
they
could
use
on
their
baby
when
people
think
about
a
home
improvement
item
the
first
place
i
would
likewise
hope
they
think
of
be
the
home
depot
you
know
that
the
quality
s
go
to
be
good
because
since
we
guarantee
to
take
any
product
back
with
no
question
ask
why
would
we
carry
anything
but
the
best
quality
we
have
now
reach
a
place
in
life
where
we
be
become
a
brand
in
and
of
ourselves
because
of
that
we
be
in
a
position
to
ask
manufacturer
to
share
their
brand
with
us
and
let
us
be
its
caretaker
sometimes
a
brand
name
we
want
be
exclusively
tie
to
a
competitor
in
certain
circumstance
we
will
create
our
own
product
name
in
others
we
will
license
an
exist
brand
name
and
extend
it
into
a
new
related
category
for
decade
honda
have
only
one
channel
of
distribution
for
its
lawn
mower
independent
dealer
but
that
change
when
some
of
their
people
go
into
a
home
depot
store
and
met
a
department
head
who
convince
them
that
we
be
just
like
their
terrific
independent
dealer
they
approach
us
believe
it
or
not
we
hadn
t
even
thought
of
bring
in
honda
because
of
their
well
know
commitment
to
independent
dealer
they
say
that
by
the
way
we
run
our
store
and
the
way
our
people
respond
to
the
customer
our
goal
be
the
same
as
theirs
they
suggest
we
become
the
only
mass
merchant
retailer
for
their
product
we
take
care
of
their
customer
just
the
way
they
would
we
have
the
same
commitment
to
total
satisfaction
to
the
ongoing
relationship
and
all
the
other
thing
that
honda
hold
dear
so
they
have
entrust
their
jewel
to
us
the
partnership
clicked
immediately
grow
from
lawn
mower
and
rider
to
string
trimmer
generator
compressor
and
pressure
washer
then
use
the
same
technique
we
d
use
in
the
early
day
we
go
to
pergo
manufacturer
of
the
world
s
best
sell
laminate
floor
and
told
them
the
honda
story
you
have
a
distribution
pattern
very
similar
to
honda
s
we
say
and
you
also
need
a
large
u
s
retailer
to
create
interest
and
help
grow
your
market
and
your
market
share
and
we
be
it
we
should
be
the
only
one
we
will
protect
it
just
like
it
be
our
own
name
that
make
sense
to
them
and
they
developed
an
exclusive
line
of
floor
product
for
us
general
electric
use
to
be
our
exclusive
lightbulb
supplier
in
fact
ge
be
give
linear
foot
of
shelf
space
foot
across
and
foot
high
of
sell
space
in
virtually
all
of
our
store
any
vendor
would
kill
for
that
kind
of
shelf
commitment
ge
have
more
exposure
than
any
other
vendor
in
our
store
that
s
the
ongoing
business
ge
lose
by
not
shipping
complete
and
on
time
order
to
us
this
be
such
a
problem
that
in
we
be
force
to
cancel
ten
of
million
of
dollar
worth
of
ge
bulb
business
and
switch
to
philip
every
fourth
quarter
ge
ran
its
inventory
down
create
out
of
stock
in
our
store
which
we
couldn
t
stand
for
lightbulb
to
us
be
like
bread
milk
or
egg
to
a
grocer
customer
expect
to
see
them
on
the
shelf
when
they
come
into
the
store
so
ge
lose
our
bulb
business
all
of
our
bulb
business
in
fact
i
be
so
concerned
i
personally
flew
to
see
ge
s
chairman
of
the
board
jack
welch
and
deliver
the
news
myself
you
can
help
put
a
man
on
the
moon
i
told
him
but
you
can
t
get
a
watt
bulb
in
our
store
then
i
travel
to
the
netherlands
and
cut
a
deal
with
philip
ge
s
lesson
here
be
the
same
one
we
have
to
apply
to
ourselves
never
ever
take
the
customer
for
grant
when
we
drop
ge
as
a
supplier
welch
personally
want
to
know
why
once
we
told
him
he
understood
our
reason
and
dealt
with
them
at
the
same
time
he
never
stop
look
for
a
way
to
get
his
product
back
in
our
store
he
work
hard
to
get
back
in
our
good
grace
and
stay
there
when
pat
farrah
return
from
retirement
in
we
challenged
him
to
try
to
put
something
back
together
between
the
two
company
we
begin
by
introduce
ge
electrical
panel
and
breaker
into
our
store
which
quickly
become
a
million
category
for
us
we
also
reintroduce
ge
light
bulb
but
only
in
certain
area
and
certain
category
once
the
two
side
make
up
and
start
do
business
again
ge
once
more
become
one
of
our
big
supplier
but
nothing
be
ever
easy
they
want
to
sell
us
water
softener
but
be
reluctant
to
sell
us
appliance
because
they
didn
t
want
to
disrupt
their
exist
channel
ultimately
we
begin
sell
their
ge
and
hotpoint
brand
we
then
saw
a
consumer
survey
show
that
ge
water
heater
have
name
recognition
one
problem
with
the
survey
result
ge
didn
t
make
water
heater
but
the
brand
be
so
strong
consumer
thought
they
do
it
encourage
us
to
suggest
a
new
deal
with
ge
why
don
t
you
give
us
your
name
for
water
heater
they
ultimately
agree
we
go

will
just
put

would
say
we
have
be
do
their
stuff
for
forty
year
and
i
would
never
turn
my
back
on
them
that
would
be
dishonest
unethical
immoral
and
i
always
come
away
from

wish
there
be
more
people
as
loyal
and
moral
as
chuck

to
st

for
my
annual
golf

picked
me
up
at
the
airport
and
told
me
a
story
you
be
not
go
to
believe
this
he
say
after
forty
year
he
say
that
sears
have
hire
a
consultant
who
decide
the
company
could
no
longer
afford
to
buy
american
make
power
tool
they
have
to
go
overseas
they
go
through
a
process
of
review
he
say
and
just
like
that
we
be
out
they
inform
us
by
phone
we
be
closing
the
plant
in
paris
tennessee
and
get
out
of
the
business
he
continued
be
there
a
possibility
that
you
would
take
up
the
slack
that
we
could
make
the
tool
for
you
incidentally
my
foursome
that
day
include
chuck
knight
and
arthur
martinez
the
chairman
of
sears
my
heart
start
beating
faster
well
i
don
t
know
i
say
maybe
we
could
do
it
but
first
let
me
tell
you
how
to
sell
to
us
take
every
one
of
those
tool
you
make
for
craftsman
and
make
it
well
than
it
ever
be
increase
the
strength
add
feature
in
other
word
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
but
show
us
a
well
tool
than
you
ever
have
for
craftsman
next
you
need
a
marketing
program
i
say
and
then
you
have
to
price
it
right
and
you
have
to
have
the
right
promotion
i
spent
hour
tell
him
how
to
sell
to
the
home
depot
then
i
call
pat
farrah
who
be
hysterically
delighted
this
be
an
emotional
rather
than
a
financial
issue
for
chuck
knight
when
he
and
i
talk
about
do
this
he
be
visibly
upset
that
this
town
be
go
to
be
wipe
out
i
don
t
think
that
the
profit
and
loss
enter
into
it
as
much
as
the
fact
that
he
be
go
to
destroy
people
s
life
that
also
become
a
very
critical
factor
for
us
that
we
be
go
to
save
a
town

in
perfectly
with

develop
the
new
ridgid
line
for
the
home

from
sears
go
overseas
employee
percent
of
the

one
of
the
big
advantage
that
we
have
over
most
of
our
competitor
be
be
decentralize
it
allows
us
to
be
close
to
the
customer
and
access
the
best
knowledge
in
the
field
that
way
we
can
do
not
only
what
be
right
for
the
store
but
also
respond
to
the
marketplace
and
support
the
associate
in
the
store
we
begin
decentralize
operation
away
from
atlanta
when
our
west
coast
expansion
be
in
full
bloom
and
we
create
an
autonomous
california
base
division
to
handle
business
in
that
part
of
the
country
that
eventually
become
the
model
for
the
whole
company
we
now
have
additional
regional
divisional
headquarters
in
the
northeast
midwest
southeast
southwest
and
canada
in
addition
expo
design
center
have
its
own
individual
management
structure
we
enter
the
northeast
market
without
regional
office
in
place
something
we
wouldn
t
do
today
i
try
run
the
northeast
myself
for
the
first
year
but
quickly
realize
we
need
someone
on
the
ground
there
full
time
every
day
learn
listen
and
respond
to
the
market
as
a
native
i
turn
over
that
responsibility
to
larry
mercer
and
go
look
for
a
counterpart
to
him
in
the
southeast
that
s
when
bruce
berg
be
ask
to
fly
up
to
new
york
for
a
meeting
he
be
surprised
to
find
a
limousine
wait
for
him
with
me
inside
how
would
you
like
to
be
president
of
the
southeast
division
i
ask
yeah
berg
say
nonchalantly
that
would
be
okay
okay
i
say
you
re
the
president
of
the
southeast
division
the
limo
be
quiet
for
a
few
moment
as
berg
soak
up
what
have
just
transpire
hey
art
he
say
break
the
silence
what
do
the
president
i
of
the
southeast
division
do
we
ll
talk
about
that
later
later
be
two
week
later
bruce
let
me
put
your
new
responsibility
this
way
i
explain
think
of
your
new
job
as
be
enclose
by
an
invisible
fence
and
you
be
wear
a
collar
out
there
somewhere
be
a
fence
and
you
be
go
to
keep
run
around
in
the
yard
do
your
thing
at
some
point
you
will
inevitably
go
beyond
the
boundary
of
what
your
job
responsibility
should
be
and
you
will
hit
that
fence
and
when
you
do
you
will
get
buzz
art
berg
ask
have
you
ever
hit
an
invisible
fence
no
well
i
have
and
it
really
hurt
and
sure
enough
he
be
zapped
by
the
fence
quite
a
few
time
that
s
because
the
role
of
a
home
depot
regional
president
be
a
somewhat
amorphous
position
if
thing
go
right
in
the
division
everyone
be
reward
but
if
anything
go
wrong
in
the
division
there
be
only
one
call
i
will
make
we
learn
together
where
that
fence
be
it
be
in
different
place
for
different
people
and
it
move
all
the
time
the
division
president
have
a
tremendous
amount
of
autonomy
they
should
with
multi
billion
dollar
individual
business
under
their
management
they
be
effectively
run
the
large
home
improvement
business
around
for
each
of
them
that
fence
will
have
a
different
effect
a
different
amount
of
juice
it
s
not
a
fix
fence
for
all
of
them
what
work
in
maine
might
not
necessarily
click
in
atlanta
or
seattle
take
vern
joslyn
for
example
the
president
of
our
large
division
the
northeast
vern
be
always
the
first
one
to
try
anything
new
and
subsequently
everyone
in
the
division
follow
his
lead
as
entrepreneurial
risk
taker
for
new
division
president
i
might
draw
the
circle
around
them
a
little
tighter
for
a
time
until
they
become
more
comfortable
and
can
run
freer
they
re
not
go
to
run
into
the
street
and
get
hit
by
a
car
when
hurricane
andrew
hit
south
florida
the
invisible
fence
move
and
berg
get
buzz
since
we
didn
t
have
a
clue
in
atlanta
what
to
do
we
pretty
much
left
deal
with
the
storm
and
its
aftermath
up
to
berg
the
system
work
too
until
berg
get
a
bright
idea
one
day
about
building
a
huge
blacktop
addition
on
the
land
where
our
four
day
old
cutler
ridge
store
have
be
flatten
by
the
hurricane
berg
need
a
place
to
store
all
his
incoming
lumber
and
building
material
it
be
the
right
decision
but
he
forgot
to
tell
me
about
it
on
a
rare
day
when
berg
be
play
hooky
on
his
boat
i
call
him
berg
get
tangle
up
in
the
fence
pretty
good
that
day
look
at
the
sign
on
our
store
i
say
do
it
say
bruce
s
depot
no
it
say
the
home
depot
well
then
don
t
you
think
that
you
should
tell
me
when
you
decide
to
pave
four
or
five
acre
and
pour
into
a
store
yeah
berg
say
sheepishly
i
should
have
i
didn
t
have
a
problem
with
the
decision
especially
at
a
store
hit
million
a
week
in
sale
but
berg
should
have
share
the
plan
with
me
before
it
happen
if
we
be
go
to
work
together
i
say
if
you
be
go
to
be
an
officer
of
mine
i
will
give
you
great
latitude
but
other
thing
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
i
don
t
know
the
difference
remember
the
invisible
fence
this
suck
man
berg
say
i
don
t
know
where
the
boundary
be
you
will
get
it
don
t
worry
not
long
after
that
bernie
give
berg
some
advice
first
build
trust
with
arthur
he
say
then
the
fence
will
be
much
more
elastic
the
invisible
fence
be
not
just
for
our
seven
division
president
it
be
use
and
apply
throughout
the
company
up
to
and
especially
in
the
store
our
store
manager
and
their
assistant
manager
have
more
operating
and
decision
make
leeway
than
in
any
other
retail
chain
in
america
we
want
them
to
roam
and
test
parameter
to
see
how
far
they
can
move
out
on
the
fringe
of
the
property
those
who
can
deal
with
the
fence
experiment
more
they
bring
more
unconventional
think
to
the
table
rather
than
always
toe
the
line
we
don
t
build
a
straitjacket
around
our
division
president
and
that
be
by
design
we
want
them
to
be
flexible
we
want
them
to
be
entrepreneurial
we
would
rather
have
them
push
harder
in
that
direction
than
not
and
if
we
impose
our
own
limit
on
them
they
will
stay
well

the
three
bundle
empowerment
be
a
primary
almost
magical
management
issue
for
us
we
believe
the
answer
to
most
challenge
be
in
all
of
us
and
we
rally
people
to
think

in

make
good
decision
transfer
the
decision
make

on
the

of
three
bundle
a
concept
suggest
to
us
by
ge
chairman
jack
welch
bundle
this
be
the
nonnegotiable
bundle
there
be
very
few
bundle
be
in
the
home
depot
those
be
the
thing
we
do
the
same
across
the
company
many
of
these
be
operational
in
nature
area
where
investment
in
system
dictate
a
more
uniform
compliance
they
be
usually
transparent
to
the
customer
thing
that
have
to
be
do
to
maintain
key
consistency
between
the
store
bundle
this
be
the
entrepreneurial
bundle
entrepreneur
ship
come
into
play
here
because
this
involves
challenge
in
which
the
company
provide
only
a
minimum
standard
if
a
store
can
extend
that
standard
great
we
say
your
store
will
carry
such
and
such
product
line
how
you
sell
or
display
them
be
up
to
you
as
a
result
we
get
the
benefit
of
some
extraordinary
creativity
in
this
bundle
many
of
these
idea
get
distribute
companywide
as
part
of
the
best
practice
program
for
example
when
we
introduce
the
ridgidtool
line
one
of
our
store
team
have
the
bizarre
but
inspire
idea
of
set
up
a
miniature
golf
course
in
their
parking
lot
to
show
how
powerful
new
ridgid
blower
vac
be
they
invite
customer
to
sink
putt
use
blower
instead
of
club
that
be
a
great
idea
when
we
introduce
a
new
saw
blade
another
enterprising
store
team
brought
a
junk
car
into
its
parking
lot
and
demonstrate
the
new
blade
by
saw
the
car
in
half
then
they
move
half
of
the
car
inside
and
set
up
an
endcap
display
around
it
that
sell
a
lot
of
saw
blade
we
also
discover
a
market
for
these
saw
in
firefighter
who
previously
use
lesser
saw
blade
and
reciprocate
saw
to
literally

out
of
tlieir

by
the
time
the
class
be
do
they
usually
teach
at
least
ten
thing
the
entrepreneurship
bundle

at
every
level
of
the
company
we
even
use
it
to
far
our
community

by
give
the
store
a
budget
for
spending
in
their
own
community
we
don
t
tell
them

they

and
financially
the
empowerment

this
be
when
we
give

complete
autonomy
to
make
their

decision

the
way

they

about

although
they
do
talk
to
the
merchant
about
what
tlieir
customer

for
so
in
a
sense
they
re
responsible
for
the
fine
tune
of
the
assortment
but
they
re
totally
responsible
for
the

right
in

great
responsibility
that

with
charles

a
conference
at
a
time
when
the

still
rather
small
over
lunch
i
ask
lazarus

share
with
me

to
half
a

a
billion

so
on

at
some
point
along
the
way
they
ran
out
of
steam
they
be
terrific
people
but
they
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
take
me
from
a
billion
to
billion
from
billion
to

recognize
that
and

it
be
hard
to
put

besides
our

never
really
have
an
office
where
you
could
put
a

if
someone
absolutely
need
a

he

she
go
out
to
kinko
s
or
sir
speedy
today
the
average
store
do
about
million
in
sale
so
we
can
afford
a
copier
in
each
one
when
ron
come
up
with
a
sale
formula
for
approve

as
well
as
much
in

forklift
and
truck
one
of
our
regional
vice

still
wouldn
t
approve
the
expense
we
do
without
it
for
all
these
year
he
say
we
be
still
not
go
to
do
it
one
year
i
want

to
an
even
ron

he

we
will
do
that
so
the
number
you

thousand
but
i
don
t
want
store

agers
to
think
that
s
isn
t
important
i
want
them
to
think
be

so
even
today
a
store
that
be
do
million
will
know
its
sale
down
to
the
dollar
because
the
store
manager
have
to
focus
in
on
every
dollar
if
you
don
t
watch
the

they
add
up
very
quickly
today
we

we
want
to
put
in

an
expense
of
so
we
really
well
know
that
we
be
go
to
get
a
payback
on
it
in
april
ron
launch
a
strategic
review
that
lead
to

the
way
we
open

a
year
later
the

he
just
always

no
he
listen
to

his
first
approach
be
always
to

no
you

have
a
compelling
reason
to

of
an
infamous

one
of

his

what
they

how
he

the
rule
be
different
for
pat
or
so
pat
like
to
believe
in
the
early
s
pat
would
take
his
merchant
to
exotic
place
for
catalog
meeting
occasionally
he
would
charter
a
plane
which
might
cost
well
ron
thought
that
be
an
outrageous
expense
and
wouldn
t
reimburse
him
if
he
want
to
do
that
you
pay
for
it
ron
would
say
ron
would
investigate
the
comparable
cost
of
commercial
coach
ticket
on
the
same
route
and
that
be
how
much
he
would
reimburse
pat
for
his
merchant
pat
also
have
a
problem
filing
his
travel
expense
on
a
timely
basis
so
we
end
up
passing
the
rule
that
anything
old
than
day
you
eat
at
a
time
when
we
weren
t
make
much
money
pat
once
turn
in
a
year
s
worth
of
expense
in
one
report
that
be
such
a
big
hit
it
actually
distort
our
earnings
we
be
overinventoried
on
ceiling
fan
at
one
point
gross
margin
might
have
be
low
one
month
so
ron
and
pat
would
get
into
it
your
inventory
be
too
high
your
margin
too
low
their
confrontation
both
verbally
and
in
term
of
their
physical
size
difference
have
the
making
of
a
good
abbott
and

both

one
day
pat
ask

how

he
slip
off
his

and
step
into
the
hallway
hey

threw
it
down

ever

money
on
other
than
a

be
aghast
then
he
look
more
carefully
at
the
watch
piece
on
the
floor
and
notice
a
price

as
a
gag

bought

there
be
always
something

you
every
time
pat
would
see
something
go
wrong
he
didn
t
deal
with

very
well
he
couldn
t
delegate
responsibility
for
correct
something
he
have
to
do
it
himself
immediately
if
not
sooner
he
walk
in

day
and
told
bernie
about

wrong
merchandise
be
displayed
improperly
and
it
be
the
wrong
kind
of

so
he
take
a
forklift
and
literally
destroyed
the
endcaps
merchandising
be
a
magical
game
consumer
walk
into
a
place
and
if
they
don
t
see
something
that
be
excite
something
that
say
buy
me
then
you
won
t
be
in
business
long
the
point
of
the
ehd
cap
in
any
store
be
to
present
idea
thing
people
might
not
have
thought
of
buying
thing
that
will
suggest
a
project
that
they
hadn
t
before
consider
if
pat
the
consummate
merchant
go
into
a
store
and
didn
t
see
the
kind
of
provocative
suggestive
endcaps
he
expect
it
aggravate
him
do
you
know
how
many
hour
i
put
in
in
that
store
he
say
he
literally
work
around
the
clock
from
saturday
afternoon
until
sunday

redo
the
endcaps
do
the
district
manager
work
with
you
bernie
ask
no
do
the
store
manager
work
with
you
no
in
other
word
bernie
say
you
do
this
yourself
yep
well
pat
then
you
accomplish
nothing
because
you
train
nobody
you
taught
nobody
you
do
it
yourself
and
you
want
me
to
have
sympathy
for
you
i
would
have
felt
a
whole
lot
well
if
you
have
the
district
manager
there
if
you
show
him
what
you
be
do
if
you
explain
to
him
why
you
be
do
it
that
be
teach
and
training
that
be
really
what
you
have
to
do
you
be
a
one
man
show
bernie
continued
a
one
man
show
doesn
t
make
it
in
this
company
and
then
bernie
threw
pat
out
of
his
office
pat
do
not
understand
that
as
the
company
get
big
that
we
all
have
to
become
more
teacher
than
doer
that
teach
be
more
important
than
anything
else
he
would
rather
do
something
himself
and
get
the
personal
satisfaction
of
it
be
do
than
wait
and
get
the
satisfaction
of
training
other
people
to
do
it
the
lesson
for
pat
be
a
simple
one
for
him
to
know
how
to
do
something
and
not
share
that
knowledge
with
somebody
else
be
to
waste
his
knowledge
bernie
s
role
have
always
be
to
challenge
people
to
make
them
belter
to
create
people
who
would
be
selfsufficient
who
would
be
able
to
operate
how
would
you
like
your
ecg
one
of
the
quick
thing
that
can
sink
a
company
be
a
communication
problem
we
must
communicate
to
our
store
why
we
do
the
thing
that
we
do
and
let
them
understand
the
logic
behind
our
action
the
day
that
they
think
we
be
stupid
be
the
day
we
be
dead
in
the
water
a
business
be
only
as
good
as
the
leg
it
stand
on
and
the
leg
this
company
stand
on
be
the
people
who
work
with
us
so
we
periodically
need
to
get
in
front
of
our
associate
and
talk
to
them
we
have
several
formal
and
informal
vehicle
for
do
this
on
the
formal
side
bernie
and
i
often
go
on
location
to
our
store
to
shoot
breakfast
with
bernie
and
arthur
a
lively
give
and
take
home

rally
with
our
associate
that
be
broadcast
live
via
satellite
to
all
of
our
store
location
the
breakfast
show
usually
originate
from
the
store
to
give
them
a
natural
feel
to
which
all
of
our
associate
can
relate
during
breakfast
bernie
and
i
banter
with
each
other
and
then
turn
the
microphone
over
to
our
associate
for
question
about
whatever
be
on
their
mind
the
breakfast
show
be
a
mass
communication
effort
aim
at
touch
issue
of
interest
to
every
associate
in
the
company
for
example
there
s
nothing
bad
than
when
a
customer
come
up
to
me
and
say
can
t
find
anybody

an
associate
at
one
of
our
new
york
area
store
with
the
growth
we
re
predict
on
long
island
be
there
any
program
to
train
and
find
more
quality
people
so
they

give
the
kind
of
quality
service
that
our
customer
demand
it
be
a
good
question
the
growth
of
our
northeast

as
fast
as
we
can
hire
associate

in
term
of
staff
i
told
her
we
have
double
the
staff
in
certain
paint
department
we
have
double
in
many
lumber
department
during
the
week
in
some
store
we
be
add
percent
to
percent
more
associate
on
the
weekend
we
be
very
much
concerned
about
the
same
issue
that
ybu
be
i
continued
the
standard
have
to
be
raise
because
the
competitor
who
be
left
today
be
well
and
get
more
aggressive
the
breakfast
show
also
include
slickly
produce
company
news
segment
with
report
on
everything
from
international
development
include
lighthearted
moment
such
as
our
waterloo
ontario
store
s
development
of
a
horse
and
buggy
parking
area
for
mennonite
customer
who
shun
car
to
announcement
on
the
late
in
product
knowledge
class
since
we
have
also
participate
in
welcome
aboard
satellite
telecast
these
live
program
be
aim
at
new
associate
as
part
of
a
comprehensive
enculturation
process
bernie
and
i
also
have
individual
program
that
put
us
in
front
of
our
manager
on
a
regular
basis
for
the
last
few
year
i
have
be
conduct
quarterly
world
tour
in
which
over
the
course
of
three
nonstop
week
i
visit
every
division
met
with
all
the
district
manager
discuss
the
company
s
future
strategic
plan
and
sought
out
the
late
candidate
for
our
best
practice
program
all
the
word
of
wisdom
didn
t
come
from
me
hopefully
a
few
do
but
these
tour
also
include
virtually
all
senior
manager
of
the
company
typically
bill
hamlin
larry
mercer
senior
vice
president
of
human
resource
steve
messana
ron
brill
senior
vice
president
of
finance
and
accounting
marshall
day
and
others
they
all
participate
because
it
s
the
responsibility
of
every
officer
of
our
company
to
constantly
be
take
our
people
to
the
next
level
and
the
reason
we
do
it
on
the
road
rather
than
atlanta
be
number
one
to
save
money
because
there
arc
a
lot
more
district
manager
and
store
manager
than
there
be
senior
manager
and
we
want
to
be
in
the
environment
where
they
feel
most
comfortable
at
the
start
of
each
world
lour
meeting
each
division
present
to
us
the
five
or
six
best
practice
that
they
want
to
share
with
the
other
division
then
the
division
president
package
the
three
very
best
idea
we
do
not
do
the
same
thing
in
the
southwest
that
we
do
in
the
northeast
or
we
may
not
do
them
as
well
in
one
division
as
in
the
other
they
each
have
different
strength
and
weakness
but
the
one
thing
that
they
all
have
in
common
be
be
entrepreneur
sometimes
those
of
us
back
at
the
store
support
center
in
atlanta
won
t
know
what
they
be
experiment
with
in
some
of
these
division
but
by
the
end
of
the
three
week
tour
we
return
to
each
division
president
a
book
with
all
the
best
practice
and
accompany
documentation
that
show
what
the
division
do
and
what
the
sale
result
be
best
practice
be
something
that
we
didn
t
do
as
well
before
the
world
tour
begin
to
be
frank
it
s
not
that
people
didn
t
share
but
in
a
culture
such
as
ours
that
so
strongly
value
new
idea
it
be
harder
for
some
manager
to
receive
idea
from
other
people
than
to
create
their
own
today
thanks
to
our
best
practice
program
the
best
store
manager
we
have
could
have
zero
creativity
but
if
that
person
be
a
sponge
and
be
willing
to
think
about
take
all
the
best
idea
from
the
whole
store
system
it
would
be
a
pretty
effective
approach
you
would
have
to
be
smart
to
do
that
i
mention
the
worldtours
in
the
past
tense
because
in
we
intend
them
to
be
lead
not
by
me
but
by
our
new
group
president
bill
hamlin
and
larry
mercer
as
for
bernie
he
conduct
at
least
eight
bernie
road
show
a
year
in
which
he
personally
shape
and
develops
the
talent
of
our
division
president
district
manager
and
most
important
store
manager
and
associate
in
the

the

officer
of
that
division

the

they
go
through
all
the
merchandising
philosophy
and
concept
why
we
do
what
we
do
so
everybody
understands
why
we
re
merchandising
a
product
why
we
bought
it
how
we
price
it
and
what
we
expect
from
the
manufacturer
they
go
shelf
by
shelf
line
by
line
it
s
an
immensely
effective
training
tool
that
night
bernie
solicits
question
from
the
district
manager
and
officer
everybody
in
attendance
have
what
bernie
call
immunity
during
these
meeting
that
mean
manager
can
ask
any
kind
of
question
no
matter
how
blunt
invasive
or
even
offensive
it
might
be
these
meeting
be
intend
to
be
naked
honest
exchange
of
information
and
opinion
bernie
insists
on
it
no
pussyfoot
around
if
he
doesn
t
get
a
frank
discussion
he
won
t
hesitate
to
berate
the
manager
to
stop
be
milquetoast
if
he
have
to
he
ll
challenge
them
the
next
day
he
ll
study
all
their
issue
what
be
and
isn
t
work
if
there
be
something
he
can
t
answer
directly
he
ll
reach
the
appropriate
company
officer
who
can
when
they
walk
out
of
a
meeting
with
bernie
they
have
an
answer
to
everything
that
they
want
to
know
they
feel
more
secure
over
the
year
these
road
show
have
basically
change
the
way
we
merchandise
product
in
the
store
because
bernie
and
i
relearn
our
business
firsthand
from
people
on
the
floor
of
the
store
the
associate
know
more
about
the
product
and
what
the
customer
be
look
for
than
we
do
it
be
a
change
teach
experience
this
be
a
merchandise
driven
company
and
that
be
why
we
be
successful
you
can
only
do
so
much
with
computer
and
number
what
it
come
down
to
be
what
customer
see
in
the
store
with
their
own
eye
what
say
to
them
buy
me
try
me
uncertainty
be
one
of
the
drive
factor
in
failure
for
a
company
when
our
associate
focus
start
move
off
the
customer
onto
their
own
personal
thing
and
they
start
spending
their
day
more
concerned
about
what
management
be
do
as
in
what
be
they
do
why
be
they
do
this
why
would
they
institute
this
program
or
that
policy
that
suggests
a
breakdown
in
internal
communication
i
have
make
improve
internal
communication
a
big
priority
here
s
an
example
one
day
bernie
and
bill
hamlin
be
visit
a
home
depot
and
a
customer
complain
that
the
store
be
always
run
out
of
certain
merchandise
like
what
bernie
ask
electrical
box
he
say
curious
bernie
invite
the
man
to
accompany
them
back
to
the
electrical
department
where
he
sought
out
an
associate
he
didn
t
identify
himself
i
need
some
electric
box
bernie
say
we
re
out
of
them
the
young
man
say
how
come
bill
ask
well
i
never
order
enough
because
i
have
no
place
to
put
them
do
you
get
much
call
for
these
bill
ask
lot
the
associate
say
he
explain
that
he
order
six
at
a
time
because
that
be
all
he
have
room
for
at
a
time
what
would
happen
bill
ask
if
you
order
i
d
sell
them
what
would
happen
if
you
order
i
d
probably
sell
them
out
what
would
happen
if
you
order
bill
ask
oh
the
associate
say
that
would
probably
be
just
about
enough
then
why
don
t
you
do
it
again
he
answer
that
there
be
no
room
for
them
so
bill
suggest
pile
them
up
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
rack
where
the
fitting
be
normally
set
i
can
t
put
box
on
the
floor
the
associate
say
terrify
bernie
doesn
t
want
anything
on
the
floor
bernie
who
bernie
ask
still
enjoy
his
anonymity
bernie
marcus
the
chairman
of
the
home
depot
oh
bernie
say
bernie
marcus
doesn
t
want
you
to
do
that
so
what
be
bureaucracy
bureaucracy
be
this
young
man
who
happens
to
be
a
district
manager
for
us
today
they
finally
explain
to
the
associate
that
bernie
marcus
be
stand
right
in
front
of
him
and
that
bernie
marcus
never
say
anything
of
the
kind
we
believe
our
associate
know
we
re
not
stupid
so
if
they
see
something
that
doesn
t
make
sense
they
should
question
it
if
their
suggestion
make
sense
we
ll
change
to
accommodate
it
we
know
how
to
move
and
change
with
the
time
bureaucracy
be
give
in
to
stupidity
and
ignore
common
sense
when
you
know
something
be
wrong
and
you
don
t
challenge
it
you
have
become
bureaucratic
entrepreneur
don
t
act
that
way
the
reason
this
be
so
important
be
that
the
root
cause
of
create
a
bureaucratic
environment
be
when
people
be
afraid
to
make
mistake
and
when
they
be
afraid
to
make
mistake
they
write
more
memo
call
additional
meeting
or
ask
for
meeting
to
be
extend
all
of
those
thing
be
manifestation
of
people
who
be
afraid
to
make
decision
because
they
re
afraid
to
make
mistake
we
encourage
people
to
make
decision
planning
be
great
analysis
be
great
but
most
of
the
time
when
you
get
percent
of
the
fact
that
s
really
all
you
need
to
make
a
decision
to
get
to
the
last
percent
could
take
forever
make
a
decision
and
get
on
with
it
we
want
our
people
to
be
unafraid
of
make
mistake
the
only
time
people
don
t
make
mistake
be
when
they
re
asleep
and
if
you
be
wrong
all
we
ask
be
that
you
be
willing
to
step
back
admit
that
s
not
work
and
try
path
b
or
c
what
we
try
to
do
with
my
world
tour
and
bernie
s
road
show
be
to
answer
question
encourage
risk
and
decision
make
and
take
the
mystique
out
of
senior
management
the
question
they
ask
us
be
the
question
that
affect
their
life
when
we
leave
that
room
we
want
our
people
to
feel
secure
about
the
management
of
this
company
that
we
be
not
gamble
their
life
at
the
crap
table
in
addition
to
those
issue
there
be
basic
company
philosophy
and
value
that
we
want
to
impart
to
them
at
every
opportunity
we
want
to
reemphasize
customer
service
ethic
morality
and
culture
the
importance
of
get
our
value
across
to
our
associate
be
why
we
go
to
the
expense
of
building
a
close
circuit
satellite
television
network
that
we
call
hdtv
rob
hallam
who
be
now
our
director
of
internal
communication
be
the
passion
behind
develop
hdtv
in
as
a
vehicle
for
us
to
communicate
to
the
thousand
of
new
employee
join
us
each
month
that
strategy
have
grown
to
include
other
method
such
as
print
and
electronic
communication
one
of
the
best
management
tool
we
have
for
oversee
the
vast
number
of
home
depot
be
the
store
walk
it
s
nothing
more
than
a
visit
preferably
unannounced
by
anyone
from
the
two
of
us
to
a
board
member
to
an
officer
of
the
company
to
a
district
manager
we
walk
the
aisle
examine
the
display
the
signage
eavesdrop
on
associate
conversation
with
customer
and
talk
to
the
customer
ourselves
on
announce
store
walk
we
become
part
of
the
action
don
orange
apron
and
work
while
we
inspect
the
facility
the
number
one
value
of
our
store
walk
be
that
they
keep
our
district
manager
close
to
the
action
it
keep
them
from
get
disconnect
so
many
thing
happen
on
a
store
walk
the
most
important
of
which
be
role
model
and
teach
it
s
look
at
something
and
note
what
s
right
and
what
s
wrong
we
will
walk
around
and
talk
to
the
associate
if
there
be
no
customer
around
but
when
somebody
need
help
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
president
will
provide
that
help
we
have
to
set
the
example
for
the
store
people
there
be
nothing
more
important
we
be
not
more
important
than
the
customer
neither
be
anything
we
be
try
to
communicate
on
the
floor
of
the
store
because
if
we
don
t
have
that
customer
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
anyway
walk
a
store
with
bernie
be
not
unlike
be
there
with
your
neighbor
or
your
spouse
he
spot
the
real
commonsense
basic
stuff
they
would
such
as
the
lawn
mower
gas
tank
without
a
cap
on
it
how
do
you
expect
to
sell
it
without
put
the
cap
on
it
or
he
ll
notice
that
the
handle
be
not
work
on
the
gas
grill
or
the
broken
bag
of
charcoal
or
a
sign
that
doesn
t
have
a
price
on
it
i
on
the
other
hand
will
have
do
my
homework
on
that
store
i
know
its
payroll
turn
and
shrinkage
but
what
i
will
also
tell
you
and
show
you
be
how
this
store
have
perform
on
a
particular
level
and
what
it
need
to
improve
i
learn
the
merchandise
end
of
the
store
walk
from
pat
farrah
however
and
will
focus
on
these
opportunity
from
a
sale
perspective
a
pat
farrah
walk
be
more
of
an
offensive
maneuver
he
have
the
ball
and
he
be
go
for
the
score
his
unyielding
love
of
merchandise
and
his
relationship
to
the
merchandise
cause
him
to
relate
to
it
differently
than
we
do
pat
can
field
strip
it
tell
you
how
much
it
weighs
what
kind
of
motor
it
have
and
put
it
back
together
again
he
know
the
three
size
we
should
or
should
not
carry
and
how
many
color
it
come
in
store
walk
be
such
an
important
and
valuable
tool
to
this
company
that
they
re
require
not
just
of
our
executive
but
of
our
board
of
director
too
ken
langone
start
the
tradition
and
institutionalize
it
after
other
director
pester
him
about
how
he
knew
so
much
inside
dope
on
the
store
it
flattens
the
management
pyramid
by
create
communication
from
the
very
top
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
company
and
because
our
board
travel
so
much
they
cover
a
tremendous
amount
of
ground
especially
when
they
visit
the
store
unannounced
and
unidentified
the
best
store
walk
be
unannounced
and
unexpected
by
the
store
s
management
and
associate
but
sometimes
they
call
us
and
beg
to
be
walk
when
they
be
that
proud
we
just
have
to
go
the
big
the
store
get
and
the
more
well
know
bernie
and
i
personally
become
within
the
company
the
more
problematic
an
announce
store
walk
becomes
so
the
challenge
today
be
to
keep
these
walk
unannounced
so
the
store
don
t
spend
a
week
get
ready
for
them
at
the
expense
of
the
customer
often
store
manager
will
take
us
from
area
to
area
but
they
don
t
take
credit
for
what
go
on
they
want
us
to
meet
the
people
who
really
make
it
happen
show
bernie
and
arthur
what
you
do
here
it
show
that
they
really
have
a
team
operating
manage
and
control
their
store
if
you
don
t
have
a
team
you
can
t
operate
a
store
like
ours
during
a
typical
store
walk
we
will
either
ask
for
or
randomly
invite
to
associate
to
meet
us
in
the
break
room
with
no
manager
present
and
we
will
sit
with
them
and
talk
about
the
business
you
would
be
stun
by
what
we
find
out
in
canada
we
have
just
introduce
an
esop
program
call
the
group
register
retirement
saving
plan
in
canada
when
bernie
walk
a
store
there
but
the
associate
didn
t
have
a
clue
about
how
to
participate
in
the
plan
nobody
really
explain
it
to
them
that
open
up
a
pandora
s
box
we
discover
we
be
do
a
very
bad
job
of
marketing
these
thing
to
our
own
people
in
fact
our
esop
program
come
out
of
a
conversation
with
a
kitchen
designer
who
be
leave
the
company
during
a
store
walk
bruce
berg
introduce
die
man
and
bernie
say
why
be
you
leave
and
the
man
say
because
i
don
t
have
a
retirement
plan
here
bernie
stop
dead
in
his
track
and
spent
the
next
minute
talk
to
the
man
one
on
one
when
they
be
do
bernie
turn
to
berg
you
know
bruce
we
have
to
do
something
to
hang
on
to
people
like
that
six
month
later
ron
brill
roll
out
our
esop
incidentally
another
reason
for
the
esop
program
be
to
protect
our
young
suddenly
rich
associate
from
themselves
many
sell
stock
as
fast
as
they
earn
it
in
those
heady
early

something
you
couldn

away
we
institute
a
seven

so
it
have
a
chance
to
build

the

smart
associate
be
not
afraid
of
us
we
discover
great
thing
by
walk
the

then
it
be
a
matter
of
take
it
and
see
how
far
we
can
spread
it
if
it
be
a
great
presentation
of
snow
shovel
that
probably
won
t
work
in
miami
but
the
same
presentation
might
work
for
dirt
shovel
when
we
get
a
concept
that
work
something
tiiat
be
successful
we
spread
it
around
our
best
practice
program
come
out
of
what
we
learn
on
store
walk
if
something
be
really
great
in
phoenix
why
be
we
not
do
it
in
new
orleans
here
be
two
example
sign
be
very
important
to
the
home
depot
great
big

require
great
big
sign
and
many
year
ago
jeff
anderson
then
a
department
head
in
our
jonesboro
store
with
a
strong
entrepreneurial
streak
go
a
little
overboard
on
signage
he
take
sign
that
be
by
and
put
them
on
all
the
storm
door
screen
door
and
window
previously
those
big
sign
be
use
just
on
endcaps
suddenly
when
you
walk
into
his
building
material
and
millwork
department
these
big
sign
explode
in
your
face
the
only
thing
write
on
the
sign
be
the
price
it
demonstrate
how
proud
we
be
of
our
price
and
it
put
some
excitement
in
the
department
denny
ryan
be
the
first
executive
to
see
the
sign
he
be
so
excite
he
race
back
and
told
bernie
about
it
bernie
go
straight
over
and
take
a
look
but
he
be
not
nearly
as
excite
as
ryan
be
he
come
back
and
say
be
you
totally
blind
i
walk
in
that
store
but
i
hardly
make
it
back
to
the
building
material
department
because
there
be
so
many
other
thing
wrong
with
the
store
at
the
time
ryan
be
responsible
for
the
merchandising
of
building
material
and
he
walk
in
that
store
with
blinder
on
he
saw
his
building
material
department
and
it
be
magnificent
the
signage
concept
be
subsequently
roll
out
everywhere
in
the
country
but
what
he
didn
t
see
be
the
whole
rest
of
the
store
he
be
look
myopically
at
thing
but
those
sign
really
be
something
special
something
you
ll
still
see
in
every
home
depot
store
today
we
start
call
them
bfss
big
fat
sign
although
the
middle
initial
originally
stood
for
something
more
profane
we
have
clean
up
our
business
language
since
then
pretty
soon
we
be
put
bfss
on
everything

south
of
san

when
non

would
come
in
some
of
our
employee
have
a
har
d
time
communicate
how
to
do

such
as

in
the

anglo
but
bilingual
he
need
visual
tool
for
his
weekend
clinic
and
come
up
with
the
idea
of
put
how
to
project
example
on
endcaps
at
the
end
of
certain

create
a
step
by
step

step
visual
how
to
guide
the
depot
don
concept
caught
fire
immediately
and
spread
across
the
entire
company
today
you
ll
find
this
best
practice
in
virtually
every
aisle
of
every
home
depot
it
be
such
a
good
idea
most
of
our
competitor
copy
it
outright
as
well
there
s
a
natural
tension
between
best
practice
and
entrepre
neurism
a
best
practice
approach
of
take
idea
from
somewhere
else
be
much
harder
to
implant
in
an
entrepreneurial
system
in
an
entrepreneurial
system
manager
want
to
initiate
their
own
idea
make
them
defensive
about
idea
that
come
from
somewhere
else
our
company
be
still
learn
how
to
balance
the
two
the
corollary
be
that
our
competitor
can
often
copy
our
idea
and
spread
them
through
their
organization
faster
than
we
can
do
our
own
load
n
go
the
kid
workshop
tool
corral
and
depot
don
be
all
best
practice
that
have
be
knock
off
by
our
competition
the
good
news
be
some
of
our
bad
idea
have
be
copy
too
sometimes
they
run
with
a
red
herring
and
get
burn
by
it
what
we
be
try
to
do
on
store
walk
be
engage
our
associate
this
be
a
people
business
and
our
goal
be
anything
from
engage
them
in
strategic
conversation
to
just
get
to
know
each
other
so
we
can
transfer
culture
and
idea
it
s
about
building
relationship
so
people
be
open
to
learn
it
s
about
create
a
teachable
moment
we
expect
them
to
make
some
note
but
generally
the
goal
be
to
way
for
us
both
to
improve
the
business
we
be
look
for
input
from
them
as
much
as
anything
else
we
be
the
coach
we
don
t
run
the
store
for
them
we
don
t
make
all
their
decision
we
have
guideline
but
the
rest
of
it
be
kind
of
free
form
the
tip
or
the
hint
we
want
to
get
across
be
thing
like

at
what
your

something
about
it

some
sort
of
magic
a
silver
bullet
that
one
of
us
will
provide
and
it
will
change
their

but
there
isn

we
do

that
allows

the
rest
be

their
time

what
the
customer
be
see
talk
to
the
customer
and

that

where
you

as
long
as
they

up
all

able
to
make
independent
on

decision
without
have
to
get
a
tremendous

bernie
have
a
little
test
to
see
how
long
it
take
for
an
associate
to
recognize
him
it
be
an
interest
test
if
he
walk
around
a
store
for
minute
or
an
hour
and
no
one
recognizes
him
he
know
there
be
a
serious
problem
in
the
store
can
you
guess
why
eye
contact
they
be
not
look
at
his
face
nobody
have
look
at
his
face
that
be
why
they
haven
t
spot
him
they
haven
t
acknowledge
him
in
fact
he
have
walk
into
store
where
he
have
bumped
into
associate
and
end
up
say
i
m
sorry
they
don
t
even
say
they
be
sorry
and
he
know
as
a
result
that
we
must
have
a
bad
manager
and
an
even
bad
store
in
south
florida
bernie
once
spent
an
hour
and
a
half
in
a
store
put
his
face
right
into
the
associate
face
and
nobody
ever
recognize
him
why
not
within
this
company
he
be
very
recognizable
as
be
i
we
appear
on
publication
and
video
see
by
every
associate
we
be
as
visible
within
our
company
as
any
chief
executive
anywhere
in
the
world
the
flip
side
of
this
test
be
the
place
where
it
take
an
associate
five
second
to
say
hey
aren
t
you
bernie
marcus
bernie
be
get
out
of
his
car
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
home
depot
store
in
tucson
arizona
and
a
lot
engineer
look
at
him
and
say
oh
my
god
it
s
you
typically
it
take
no
more
than
five
or
ten
minute
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
ego
it
have
to
do
with
the
fact
that
they
be
not
look
at
his
face
or
anybody
else
s
many
people
be
use
to
go
into
store
where
the
employee
don
t
make
eye
contact
they
don
t
acknowledge
you
they
couldn
t
care
less
about
you
that
should
not
happen
in
a
home
depot
the
only
way
to
find
out
how
our
people
be
respond
to
customer
be
to
go
out
there
alone
not
with
an
entourage
when
bernie
go
in
a
store
and
they
pick
him
out
in
five
minute
he
feel
good
about
it
then
he
walk
around
the
store
and
see
what
the
store
really
look
like
it
be
not
prepared
for
him
it
be
prepared
for
the
customer
which
be
really
the
critical
thing
they
be
not
in
stock
because
they

know
bernie
be
come
they
be
in
stock
because
they
know
the
customer
be
come
walk
those
store
bernie
becomes
the
dumbest
person
that
you
ever
saw
he
asks
the
dumbest
question
he
have
learn
never
to
educate
himself
on
anything
so
he
will
pick
something
up
and
say
how
do
this
work
and
he
want
someone
who
say
oh
let
me
show
you
then
he
wanders
from
one
department
to
the
next
learn
pretty
fast
whether
or
not
we
have
a
training
problem
in
that
store
it
becomes
self
evident
if
the
manager
be
not
do
their
job
we
be
so
careful
about
who
we
hire
that
if
we
don
t
teach
them
and
train
them
we
end
up
with
people
who
be
just
like
those
in
our
competitor
store
the
whole
issue
be
what
we
call
be
ground
engage
pat
far
rah
spends
percent
of
his
time
in
the
store
bill
hamlin
and
larry
mercer
a
little
less
than
that
bernie
and
i
probably
spend
to
percent
of
our
time
in
the
store
the
balance
be
spent
training
manager
in
our
culture
and
teach
merchandising
gonna
go
round
in
circle
our
feedback
be
a
way
of
provide
home
depot
officer
and
manager
with
insight
into
their
leadership
style
the
primary
purpose
of
be
for
the
development
of
home
depot
leader
it
be
not
the
same
as
a
performance
appraisal
because
it
focus
primarily
on
leadership
skill
and
be
not
tie
to
salary
or
bonus
however
performance
appraisal
and
be
use
together
to
help
determine
what
kind
of
management
development
and
which
job
assignment
make
the
most
sense
the
name
come
from
the
fact
that
the
manager
receive
feedback
from
everyone
that
work
around
them
their
bos
their
peer
and
the
people
that
report
to
them
the
process
involves
fill
out
a
survey
that
rate
the
manager
on
leadership
quality
that
we
value
at
the
home
depot
not
only
do
the
people
that
work
around
the
manager
fill
out
the
survey
but
the
manager
also
rate
themselves
on
the
same
leadership
skill
honest
answer
be
need
if
the
be
go
to
help
our
leader
recognize
their
strength
and
weakness
i
believe
it
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
development
process
we
have
ever
go
through
even
though
this
feedback
be
for
the
development
of
the
manager
the
report
can
pack
a
punch
imagine
be
the
manager
get
that
report
full
of
honest
feedback
from
trust
associate
and
find
out
you
re
view
as
unapproachable
or
bad
however
not
all
the
information
on
the
report
be
negative
study
on
receive
feedback
have
show
that
people
tend
to
ignore
the
positive
all
manager
myself
and
bernie
include
go
through
a
every
eighteen
month
and
most
of
the
home
depot
leader
who
have
receive
their
result
classify
them
as
eye
opening
establish
tie
that
bind
and
strengthen
them
in
recent
year
two
important
dynamic
have
affected
the
rank
of
our
senior
officer
number
one
our
company
have
grown
so
quickly
that
someone
be
always
be
promote
into
senior
officer
rank
and
at
the
pace
at
which
we
be
all
move
we
need
way
of
communicate
effectively
on
the
fly
in
a
low
growth
or
no
growth
kind
of
environment
people
can
be
in
meeting
all
the
time
and
all
be
part
of
the
same
thing
but
in
our
situation
where
everybody
be
physically
go
in
different
direction
all
at
the
same
time
trust
be
really
important
because
we
can
t
be
every
place
at
once
we
must
rely
on
each
other
implicitly
number
two
my
visibility
within
the
company
have
be
steadily
expand
as
bernie
turn
over
more
and
more
of
the
day
to
day
operation
and
decision
make
for
these
reason
i
have
look
for
opportunity
to
build
on
my
relationship
with
our
senior
officer
and
smooth
the
transition
between
me
and
bernie
participate
in
outward
bound
s
team
building
experience
have
encourage
within
us
the
ability
to
communicate
sometimes
without
even
say
a
word
these
outing
build
trust
because
trust
be
all
you
have
on
trip
into
the
rugged
middle
of
nowhere
with
nothing
more
than
what
you
can
carry
on
your
back
i
be
the
more
physically
active
of
the
company
s
cofounder
i
m
the
one
who
have
run
the
new
york
city
and
los
angeles
marathon
who
ski
who
ride
the
rapid
take
outdoor
trip
with
the
senior
officer
have
give
them
a
new
personal
intimacy
and
familiarity
with
me
that
until
recently
many
only
share
with
bernie
our
outward
bound
type
trip
where
we
get
out
of
the
office
and
away
from
the
phone
let
people
see
each
other
in
a
different
light
it
recommits
us
to
each
other
we
rediscover
the
dynamic
that
make
it
all
work
several
year
ago
our
western
division
officer
participate
in
an
outward

program
on

life
the
western
group
have
a
great
experience
there
and
suggest
i
try
it
i
found
the
notion
irresistible
and
organize
a
retreat
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
ranch
in
southern
utah
in
october
it

include
bruce
berg
dick
hammill
marshall

and
lynn
martineau
virtually
everyone
but
bernie
and
bill
harris
get
there
be
more
than
half
the
fun
they
take
us
three
at
a
time
in
single
engine
piper
cub
airplane
that
flew
for
two
thrill
hour
about
foot
off
the
ground
over
nothing
but
brush
just
like
you
see
in
old
movie
western
it
be
suppose
to
be
degree
when
we
arrive
the
plan
be
to
ride
horse
by
day
and
camp
out
by
night
but
it
be
actually
degree
and
it
be
try
to
snow
the
next
two
day
it
do
snow
as
berg
put
it
it
be
colder
than
a
well
digger
s
as
out
there
that
wouldn
t
be
so
bad
at
a
four
star
mountain
resort
but
this
place
be
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
the
ranch
didn
t
have
bed
no
one
ever
slept
there
fly
out
wasn
t
an
option
in
that
weather
besides
that
be
not
the
home
depot
way
who
be
go
to
be
the
wimp
to
stand
up
and
say
i
don
t
want
to
do
this
we
have
no
choice
but
to
see
the
trip
out
to
its
bitter
end
most
of
us
laid
our
sleep
bag
out
on
the
hardwood
floor
but
two
guy
have
their
own
idea
of
rustic
comfort
hammill
and
andy
mckenna
our
senior
vice
president
of
strategic
planning
slept
on
the
floor
of
an
old
school
bus
berg
figure
the
inevitable
snore
in
the
bus
would
keep
him
awake
found
a
full
granary
and
crawl
inside
to
keep
warm
what
he
didn
t
think
of
right
away
be
that
granary
attract
rat
so
he
spent
his
night
warm
although
his
bunk
mate
still
snore
and
squeal
in
their
sleep
the
cold
create
some
unexpected
hardship
no
one
be
prepared
for
anything
near
that
kind
of
wet
bitter
cold
so
several
people
dress
around
the
clock
in
virtually
all
the
clothing
they
brought
with
them
if
you
ever
have
nightmare
about
use
a
drafty
outhouse
on
a
windy
degree
utah
morning
then
you
can
imagine
what
our
entire
three
day
visit
be
like
it
get
dark
early
so
we
would
go
inside
where
we
ate
dinner
stand
up
because
there
wasn
t
enough
room
to
do
anything
else
there
be
no
electricity
so
at
night
all
twenty
five
of
us
plus
five
ranch
hand
go
in
the
one
room
with
a
fireplace
and
huddle
together
by
seven
p
m
we
d
be
in
the
room
with
the
fireplace
no
tv
no
radio
no
nothing
and
we
just
kind
of
star
at
each
other
for
four
hour
before
find
enough
floor
to
call
a
bed
not
that
the
trip
be
a
disaster
it
really
wasn
t
the
owner
of
the
ranch
a
c
be
a
colorful
if
somewhat
cantankerous
former
rodeo
star
a
c
would
get
up
in
the
morning
climb
in
his
little
piper
cub
and
fly
around
his
property
to
find
his
horse
then
he
and
another
cowhand
would
use
a
truck
to
bring
the
horse
in
that
first
and
only
clear
day
a
c
want
to
ride
fast
so
he
give
a
command
and
all
the
horse
start
run
like
the
wind
that
be
fine
with
berg
and
martineau
who
have
either
live
or
work
on
ranch
and
be
comfortable
around
horse
but
marshall
day
a
city
slicker
who
have
never
ridden
before
threw
his
rein
in
the
air
grabbed
hold
of
the
saddlehorn
and
held
on
for
dear
life
at
least
he
stayed
in
the
saddle
berg
s
horse
do
a
degree
turn
when
he
wasn
t
look
and
his
body
kept
go
straight
mr
cowboy
hit
the
ground
and
roll
a
couple
of
time
before
get
up
that
s
when
we
all
start
laugh
at
him
berg
get
the
last
laugh
however
when
we
watch
one
of
the
cowhand
rope
a
would
be
steer
that
have
not
yet
be
castrate

most
of
us
have
never
see
this
do
before
the
guy
have
the
animal
on
the
end
of
the
rope
then
he
use
a
pocket
knife
to
remove
its
testicle
the
steer
be
not
a
happy
camper
at
all
about
it
as
you
might
imagine
i
be
wear
a
bright
yellow
rain
suit
and
i
dismount
from
my
horse
to
get
a
closer
look
sure
enough
as
soon
as
it
be
untied
the
steer
go
right
after
me
and
i
ran
away
from
it
the
bad
thing
you
can
do
under
the
circumstance
that
pound
steer
smack
me
in
the
butt
and
once
everyone
be
sure
i
wasn
t
hurt
they
crack
up
hammill
be
another
first
time
rider
instead
of
guide
his
horse
around
a
tree
it
lead
him
right
toward
a
large
low
hang
branch
he
panicked
end
flat
on
the
ground
the
horse
kept
go
without
him
as
he
rebound
off
the
branch
and
land
with
a
thud
on
the
hard
ground
hammill
get
up
and
say
wouldn
t
it
be
great
to
go
sail
next
year
so
a
year
later

five
or
six

to
a
foot
yacht
while
many
people
wrestle
with
sea
sickness
i
demonstrate
a
very
healthy
respect
for
the
ocean
water
a
mix
of
uncertainty
and
curiosity
i
go
snorkel
for
the
first
time
with
hammill
jumping
off
the
back
of

a
fear

of

that
be
five
year
old
there
be
recondition
lawn

that
look
atrocious
kinskey
and
co
wipe
down
the
lawn
mower
with
wd
and
hawk
them
like
carnival
barker
for
to
percent
off
until
they
be
all
go
when
the
manager
return
the
store
look
brand
new
kinskey
s
crusade
sent
a
pretty
powerful
message
you
re
probably
wonder
why
kinskey
didn
t
just
fire
the
manager
whose
name
be
ashok
patel
but
that
s
not
the
way
we
do
business
patel
be
relatively
new
to
our
company
oversee
our
old
and
perhaps
most
difficult
store
leader
in
this
organization
don
t
want
to
crush
somebody
try
to
get
something
do
even
if
it
s
not
yet
work
out
kinskey
look
at
it
as
an
opportunity
to
help
the
store
and
teach
patel
and
the
people
that
he
just
promote
instead
of
talk
kinskey
show
him
what
he
expect
by
the
way
patel
not
only
grasped
the
lesson
but
kinskey
eventually
promote
him
to
regional
merchandising
manager
a
liaison
between
the
buyer
and
our
atlanta
store
kinskey
also
stand
tall
as
an
example
of
another
home
depot
value
do
the
right
thing
don
t
just
do
thing
right
when
he
be
a
store
manager
kinskey
have
a
person
work
for
him
who
he
believe
deserve
a
raise
of
percent
it
be
an
outrageous
amount
kinskey
go
to
his
district
manager
make
his
case
and
be
turn
down
but
instead
of
shrug
his
shoulder
and
walk
out
he
stood
up
on
the
desk
and
start
stamp
his
foot
this
guy
deserves
this
raise
he
insist
he
felt
so
strongly
that
a
percent
raise
be
the
right
thing
for
this
associate
that
he
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
i
le
get
in
everybody
s
face
over
this
he
stood
up
for
what
be
right
one
of
the
most
important
issue
wc
face
especially
at
a
time
of
enormous
growth
be
produce
enough
qualify
people
to
run
and
work
in
all
the
new
store
we
want
these
people
to
carry
on
the
home
depot
value
and
use
them
as
the
basic
for
make
the
right
decision
in
their
store
we
think
it
s
important
enough
so
that
this
message
be
personally
deliver
in
every
training
class
the
week
long
class
for
assistant
manager
manager
and
district
manager
start
with
me
and
end
with
bernie
even
our
investor
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
founder
of
the
company
still
participate
in
training
manager
expound
the
home
depot
s
explicit
value
as
if
that
be
beneath
us
bernie
you
don
t
really
still
teach
those
class
do
you
one
man
ask
yeah
i
do
bernie
say
so
do
arthur
so
do
most
of
our
officer
how
can
you
do
that
this
company
be
go
on
billion
in
sale
you
can
t
do
that
sure
we
can
we
have
to
bernie
say
and
when
the
company
do
billion
and
when
the
company
do
billion
whether
i
be
here
or
not
the
officer
of
the
company
will
still
participate
in
the
training
because
we
set
the
stage
when
you
start
hand
it
off
to
people
who
do
it
professionally
you
don
t
get
the
same
emotion
the
same
direction
because
we
be
the
they
when
people
say
this
be
what
they
believe
and
they
have
to
hear
it
from
our
mouth
we
have
to
set
the
stage
for
what
the
philosophy
of
the
company
be
our
role
be
to
set
program
to
visualize
the
future
to
listen
carefully
to
train
and
teach
and
then
allow
these
people
to
do
their
own
thing
kill
bureaucracy
if
anything
ever
kill
the
personality
of
this
company
it
will
be
creep
bureaucracy
it
be
always
there
unseen
and
it
s
always
try
to
cover
us
like
a
fungus
every
bureaucrat
who
sends
out
a
piece
of
paper
to
the
store
that
be
not
necessary
be
part
of
that

we
fight
the
bureaucratic
urge
by
give
our
store
manager
the
freedom
some
might
call
it
a
very
long
leash
and
the
confidence
in
themselves
that
they
would
never
have
someplace
else
at
the
same
time
we
be
our
own
bad
critic
you
won
t
often
hear
us
sit
around
pat
ourselves
on
the
back
in
fact
if
you
sat
in
on
a
board
meeting
or
one
of
our
staff
meeting
or
literally
any
time
we
be
together
with
the
merchant
or
operating
people
you
would
think
we
be
go
broke
you
might
even
think
geez
i
well
sell
my
stock
we
treat
everything
like
a
potential
catastrophe
so
we
don
t
have
a
catastrophe
on
our
hand
when
we
acquire
national
blind
and
wallpaper
factory
its
president
david
katzman
sat
in
on
his
first
mini
staff
meeting
with
all
the
home
depot
president
and
key
officer
about
halfway
through
the
morning
i
stop
what
i
be
do
look
at
katzman
and
say
don
t
look
so
worried
thing
be
actually
very
good
here
i
be
start
to
get
nervous
katzman
admit
i
be
wonder
what
be
i
in
for
here
wait
till
they
get
to
me
and
that
be
a
relatively
routine
meeting
bernie
pat
ken
and
i
have
rag
debate
over
the
way
thing
be
be
do
an
outsider
would
most
certainly
have
thought
that
the
whole
company
be
go
down
the
toilet
there
be
no
callus
on
our
back
from
pat
each
other
but
if
you
take
a
consensus
as
to
what
we
felt
described
our
true
effectiveness
as
a
retailer
we
be
probably
at
about
percent
satisfaction
today
hire
the
best
there
be
an
aversion
in
most
organization
and
among
most
manager
to
hire
people
who
be
smarter
than
they
be
what
have
make
us
successful
from
the
time
we
start
in
retail
we
have
always
believe
in
hire
the
best
people
don
t
just
hire
good
people
and
let
their
potential
go
to
waste
give
up
responsibility
and
authority
to
them
challenge
them
to
surpass
you
and
every
time
they
show
spark
of
genius
your
own
career
will
take
off
because
you
be
responsible
for
them
some
people
be
afraid
to
hire
smarter
people
they
re
insecure
that
person
be
go
to
take
my
job
baloney
they
re
go
to
help
you
up
invert
pyramid
if
we
broke
down
the
management
structure
at
the
home
depot
on
a
blackboard
bernie
marcus
and
arthur
blank
would
be
at
the
bottom
the
store
would
be
at
the
top
the
people
at
the
store
be
the
most
important
after
customer
because
they
interface
with
the
customer
and
since
bernie
and
i
really
couldn
t
begin
to
tell
you
how
to
wire
a
house
we
be
the
least
important
when
it
come
to
satisfy
a
customer
the
sign
at
the
front
entrance
of
our
main
office
in
atlanta
say
store
support
center
not
world
headquarters
it
be
not
a
corporate
ivory
tower
it
be
truly
the
store
support
center
we
want
everybody
in
this
building
to
know
that
we
be
here
to
support
the
store
if
a
store
call
anyone
in
the
store
support
center
from
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
president
to
the
janitor
our
instruction
to
them
be
to
stop
what
you
be
do
and
take
the
store
call
sometimes
it
be
hard
for
people
to
be
efficient
internally
because
of
that
but
that
doesn
t
matter
internally
our
number
one
customer
be
the
home
depot
store
when
they
have
a
problem
and
they
run
to
the
phone
because
of
the
chaotic
atmosphere
of
a
home
depot
store
it
be
not
like
they
have
be
think
about
make
this
call
for
a
couple
of
hour
they
have
a
need
right
now
so
we
have
to
be
there
for
them
don
keough
a
member
of
our
board
of
director
and
a
retire
president
and
ceo
of
the
coca
cola
company
told
us
a
great
story
that
we
repeat
in
every
management
training
session
the
day
he
be
make
president
of
coca
cola
keough
walk
out
of
the
board
meeting
get
on
an
elevator
and
punch
the
number
of
a
floor
he
have
never
be
on
before
then
he
wander
the
floor
look
around
and
randomly
walk
into
the
office
of
a
business
manager
he
have
never
met
before
hi
he
say
i
m
don
keough
the
new
president
of
coca
cola
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
do
to
sell
coca
cola
the
guy
look
at
him
and
say
i
don
t
sell
coca
cola
i
m
in
the
accounting
department
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
sale
keough
shook
his
head
disappointed
everybody
that
work
in
this
building
have
to
be
involve
in
sell
a
can
of
coca
cola
he
say
and
that
be
exactly
what
we
say
to
our
people
at
the
store
support
center
in
our
invert
management
structure
everyone
s
career
depends
on
how
the
associate
in
the
store
function
if
the
people
in
the
store
support
center
or
divisional
office
don
t
feel
like
they
be
sell
a
product
to
customer
in
the
store
then
they
be
part
of
a
bureaucracy
and
they
will
stymie
the
store
not
help
them
we
don
t
care
what
your
job
be
what
have
you
do
to
help
a
customer
in
our
store
today
what
have
you
do
to
sell
a
product
to
our
customer
what
have
you
do
to
bring
a
customer
into
our
store
what
have
you
do
to
make
a
manufacturer
want
to
sell
to
our
company
you
have
a
role
and
if
you
don
t
think
you
do
you
don
t
belong
here
if
you
don
t
know
what
that
role
be
you
need
to
find
out
respect
for
the
individual
what
s
the
secret
of
the
partnership
between
bernie
and
me
there
have
never
be
anything
significant
undertaken
by
our
company
that
the
two
of
us
didn
t
work
together
closely
on
and
there
have
not
be
a
major
decision
make
since
that
we
be
not
in
agreement
with
each
other
about
that
doesn
t
mean
we
never
differ
but
we
have
the
kind
of
respect
for
each
other
where
if
one
of
us
feel
strongly
about
something
the
other
won
t
fight
him
on
it
even
if
we
don
t
agree
we
believe
that
s
a
real
strength
of
the
home
depot
in
other
company
founder
have
difference
and
people
internally
take
advantage
of
that
but
when
people
come
to
us
individually
percent
of
the
time
they
will
hear
the
same
answer
from
either
one
of
us
that
s
significant
because
we
be
the
odd
couple
that
have
ever
come
down
the
pike
forget
mutt
and
jeff
or
oscar
and
felix
our
physical
and
emotional
difference
be
so
obvious
to
everybody
who
know
us
that
it
be
a
miracle
that
we
survive
year
together
because
we
be
such
polar
opposite
personality
create
the
home
depot
if
it
have
be
conceive
of
by
any
of
a
thousand
other
people
they
could
not
have
create
what
we
do
personality
be
our
x
factor
especially
in
the
early
day
each
one
of
us
be
a
strong
will
personality
bernie
pat
and
ken
be
the
extroverted
giant
slayer
i
be
the
reserve
less
bombastic
businessman
who
counterbalance
the
excess
of
the
other
three
in
the
home
depot
our
personality
become
magnify
you
know
how
manufacturer
combine
one
drug
with
another
to
make
a
strong
new
drug
that
s
why
our
partnership
work
we
each
posse
a
different
combustible
element
that
won
t
ignite
without
the
others
think
about
all
the
obstacle
that
we
overcame
be
fire
bankruptcy
opening
store
on
a
use
wing
and
a
short
prayer
so
we
work
together
and
we
have
experience
together
that
be
just
unbelievable
at
this
point
we
should
probably
be
over
what
create
the
home
depot
we
be
not
when
we
sit
in
our
meeting
we
be
no
different
than
we
be
the
first
year
of
our
business
we
talk
about
how
we
have
do
thing
wrong
how
badly
we
run
our
business
how
we
be
not
treat
our
customer
properly
the
topic
and
tone
be
no
different
than
they
be
two
decade
ago
we
have
customer
on
a
lease

when

we
realize
that
we
have
the
financial
capacity
and
the
wherewithal
to
give
back
to
the
community
where
we
do

there
be
a
concept
in

consider
a
mitzvah
a
good
deed
to
give
to
somebody
who
doesn
t
have
and
we
believe
strongly
in
give
back
to
the
community
the
beauty
of
that
philosophy
be
that
we
don
t
tell
our
people
that
that
be
something
they

to
do
we

for

how
many

they

we
do
what
we
could
now
we
give

we
be
try
to
increase
business
in
the

we
do
it
because
we
feel
that
we
take
an
awful
lot
out

impact
we
could
have
and
it
be
extraordinary
we
have
be
in
florida
longer
than
anywhere
but
atlanta
we
lose
tour
store
our
employee
be
impact
it
hit
us
on
a
lot
of
different
front
it
be
another
define
moment
for
us
because
it
be
the
first
time
since
we
have
be
in
business
that
something
of
that
magnitude
bad
happen
in
a
market
we
serve
we
be
vested
in
south
florida
not
only
with
customer
but
with
our
own
associate
we
have
a
big
people
investment
there
that
s
why
everybody
drop
everything
they
be
do
and
pitch
in
we
literally
sent
truckloads
of
cash
because
there
be
no
bank
open
to
cash
paycheck
we
coordinate
a
program
that
insured
our
employee
continued
to
be
paid
even
if
the
damage
store
be
dose
or
even
if
we
couldn
t
immediately
locate
the
employee
we
have
seventy
employee
and
their
family
who
lose
their
home
and
we
help
find
them
temporary
apartment
and
hotel
food
water
and
even
gas
grill
for
cooking
their
meal
we
also
provide
crisis
counsel
and
no
interest
loan
home
depot
associate
from
coast
to
coast
sent
sixty
truckloads
of
relief
supply
to
their
counterpart
in
south
florida
we
rent
an
square
foot
warehouse
to
store
all
of
the
donate
good
from
our
store
we
give
as
much
as
we
could
to
our
associate
and
distribute
the
rest
to
the
local
community

meanwhile
people
be
call
in
to
talk
radio
show
where
they
enjoy
the
veil
of
anonymity
say
thing
like
my
brother
in
law
told
me
that
the
home
depot
be
gouge
he
paid
a
sheet
for
plywood
there
i
only
paid
at
xyz
lumber
well
his
brother
inlaw
probably
do
pay
a
sheet
if
he
bought
cabinet
grade
plywood
instead
of
cdx
and
his
brother
in
law
be
probably
the
same
naive
person
who
before
the
hurricane
hit
didn
t
know
the
difference
between
cabinet
grade
birch
and
cdx
it
be
very
frustrate
a
local
tv
station
take
these
radio
talk
show
as
gospel
and
make
an
across
the
board
report
that
our
industry
be
price
gouge
they
didn
t
talk
to
us
they
just
put
it
on
the
air
that
infuriate
bruce
berg
because
we
be
sell
so
many
vital
building
good
at
our
cost
and
he
respond
by
call
up
several
radio
and
tv
station
and
scream
at
them
it
wasn
t
the
best
approach
because
everyone
s
nerve
be
raw
and
frayed
besides
nobody
believe
berg
be
who
he
say
he
be
because
of
the
language
he
use
he
be
absolutely
livid
then
the
state
attorney
respond
to
the
tv
report
come
after
us
be
you
people
gouge
customer
he
ask
let
us
see
your
cost
that
be
all
berg
could
stand
why
don
t
you
get
out
of
tallahassee
and
come
on
down
here
and
look
at
our
cost
and
see
what
we
be
sell
this
stuff
for
he
respond
in
the
end
of
course
the
governor
cite
us
as
corporate
citizen
of
the
year
but
that
be
after
the
firework
we
do
get
a
lot
of
positive
press
because
we
pumped
more
generator
and
chain
saw
into
the
market
and
offer
more
product
knowledge
than
anyone
else
and
we
give
away
water
foodstuff
and
anything
else
we
could
certain
product
line
such
as
drapery
hardware
be
drop
from
stock
at
these
store
priority
item
be
generator
chain
saw
polyethylene
plywood
nail
and
whatever
you
need
to
clean
up
after
a
storm
such
as
wet
vac
mop
and
broom
within
a
few
day
we
also
recognize
the
extreme
need
for
propane
power
gas
grill
how
else
be
people
with
no
electricity
go
to
cook
south
florida
be
an
all
electric
market
that
hardly
us
any
natural
gas
barbecue
be
the
only
way
they
could
cook
our
first
order
be
for
five
truckloads
of
barbecue
grill
and
five
truckloads
of
gas
we
start
buying
six
mil
polyethylene
which
be
be
use
to
cover
partially
destroyed
roof
then
the
army
come
in
and
bought
all
the
polyethylene
we
have
so
we
order
more
how
much
do
you
want
the
manufacturer
s
rep
ask
you
start
send
truckloads
berg
told
him
and
we
ll
tell
you
when
to
stop
at
time
product
knowledge
be
our
most
valuable
commodity
there
be
people
buying
watt
generator
which
they
expect
would
run
a
whole
house
just
as
if
it
be
still
wire
to
florida
power
and
light
it
won
t
our
people
must
have
explain
a
thousand
time
that
it
will
run
a
refrigerator
two
light
bulb
a
toaster
and
a
fan
but
you
can
t
hook
it
up
to
your
air
conditioner
most
people
have
no
idea
they
thought
they
have
just
bought
a
nuclear
power
plant
for
their
backyard
and
all
of
this
be
happen
in
three
language
english
spanish
and
retiree

the
underground
market
be
another
problem
because
demand
for
product
be
outrageous
people
would
come
in
and
buy
a
product
from
our
fence
in
store
then
would
turn
around
and
sell
it
at
a
premium
price
in
our
very
own
parking
lot
one
guy
drove
a
truck
with
eight
generator
in
the
flatbed
right
into
our
parking
lot
try
to
sell
them
for
twice
our
price
and
if
we
have
a
truckload
of
generator
come
on
a
home
depot
truck
we
have
to
cover
it
because
our
driver
could
be
in
jeopardy
from
people
clamor
for
the
product
that
be
inside
lumber
be
tarped
over
for
the
same
reason
most
store
in
the
affected
area
receive
a
truckload
of
john
manville
insulation
daily
at
cutler
ridge
it
be
two
truckloads
daily
we
have
people
at
any
time
unload
truck
at
any
give
store
we
do
mass
hire
not
only
io
get
the
merchandise
into
the
store
but
to
sell
it
to
the
customer
we
brought
on
more
than
permanent
associate
in
two
week
at
the
hialeah
store
alone
these
people
be
in
addition
to
our
normal
associate
base
of
people
in
all
we
hire
people
for
a
dozen
affected
south
dade
store
within
a
six
week
time
period
get
them
all
process
orient
train
and
out
on
the
sale
floor
take
a
titanic
effort
we
do
not
low
our
standard
from
the
point
of
what
we
require
in
term
of
background
check
drug
test
and
those
type
of
thing
but
do
we
conduct
detailed
interview
no
after
the
storm
find
qualify
people
be
a
challenge
because
anybody
with
a
chain
saw
could
make
or
more
an
hour
cutler
ridge
open
with
associate
cashier
and
cash
register
post
andrew
that
store
employ
associate
include
cashier
at
cash
register
we
be
always
run
out
of
orange
apron
needle
to
say
david
bloom
go
to
a
kmart
and
bought
four
king
size
sheet
staple
them
together
and
sprayed
now
hire
on
them
then
he
hung
the
sign
two
story
high
on
the
back
of
the
building
face
the
florida
turnpike
even
with
our
buying
power
and
pull
there
be
certain
supply
that
be
virtually
impossible
to
keep
in
stock
we
couldn
t
get
tin
tab
for
instance
which
you
use
for
attach
black
felt
paper
to
roof
before
instal
tile
desperate
we
found
a
local
tin
can
maker
who
have
the
necessary
stamp
machine
and
we
put
him
in
the
business
of
make
tin
tab
there
be
literally
a
roof
shortage
in
the
united
state
because
so
many
of
these
material
be
divert
to
south
dade
some
manufacturer
do
have
bona
fide
unplanned
shipping
cost
associate
with
supply
the
market
they
pass
these
along
but
we
just
take
it
in
the
short
and
margin
lenny
kapiloff
be
a
building
material
merchant
in
the
southeast
division
he
bought
all
the
door
and
window
shingle
roof

and
sheetrock
for
the
store
that
make
him
very
important
because
with
so
many
blown
off
roof
and
every
window
in
south
dade
broken
we
need
ton
of
glass
and
felt
paper
kapiloff
bought
felt
paper
from
canada
california
and
mexico
wherever
it
be
available
he
bought
it
we
quickly
exhaust
whatever
the
southeast
division
s
regular
supplier
could
produce
a
truckload
of
felt
paper
be
roll
it
would
arrive
at
a
store
and
be
sell
within
twenty
minute
he
call
his
counterpart
in
our
western
division
and
ask
for
the
name
of
their
supplier
then
he
would
order
as
much
felt
paper
as
they
would
sell
him
it
be
never
enough
we
never
bought
felt
paper
from
celotex
before
the
hurricane
because
it
be
too
expensive
but
after
the
storm
we
bought
all
they
could
make
even
at
a
dollar
more
a
roll
than
anyone
else
charge
they
turn
on
the
factory
for
us
and
the
celotex
people
show
up
every
morning
with
fresh
bagel
and
donut
to
thank
us
cost
be
irrelevant
availability
be
the
only
issue
kapiloff
bought
so
much
product
that
instead
of
truck
it
be
eventually
deliver
by
rail
car
that
increase
shipping
cost
but
at
least
we
have
the
merchandise
in
november
just
when
we
have
a
steady
supply
of
felt
paper
the
dade
county
commission
change
the
kind
of
felt
paper
that
be
necessary
for
rebuild
it
require
paper
of
a
heavier
weight
and
it
also
have
to
have
a
yellow
stripe
on
it
the
yellow
stripe
be
so
that
overwork
building
inspector
could
see
from
the
street
that
it
met
code
without
examine
it
so
we
have
to
switch
to
a
different
grade
of
paper
and
put
a
yellow
stripe
on
it
that
be
a
killer
even
celotex
couldn
t
produce
enough
material
to
meet
demand
so
kapiloff
go
to
some
extraordinary
length
he
call
a
friend
at
a
roof
company
in
wilmington
delaware
and
ask
about
the
availability
of
roof
material
there
he
be
direct
to
a
local
company
that
have
its
entire
inventory
in
truck
kapiloff
bought
truckloads
by
november
the
cutler
ridge
store
be
receive
eight
truckloads
of
felt
paper
and
ten
truckloads
of
shingle
a
day
toward
the
middle
of
november
one
of
the
company
that
sell
us
interior
door
told
kapiloff
that
it
be
raise
door
price
by
two
dollar
apiece
they
be
maxed
out
in
term
of
production
and
felt
it
be
a
fair
increase
and
a
reasonable
time
to
do
it
we
be
buying
door
a
week
for
these
store
so
we
be
maxing
out
everybody
s
production
limit
it
be
either
take
the
two
dollar
price
increase
or
we
wouldn
t
get
door
since
they
could
certainly
sell
our
order
elsewhere
in
the
market
we
accepted
the
price
increase
at
the
time
kapiloff
be
also
the
buyer
for
our
houston
store
so
he
call
southern
millwork
which
supply
door
to
the
houston
store
and
ask
if
they
would
ship
into
south
dade
the
company
agree
to
send
us
six
truck
three
time
a
week
all
of
which
go
directly
to
our
cutler
ridge
store
that
relationship
blossom
so
eventually
southern
millwork
set
up
in
business
right
in
miami
to
show
our
appreciation
for
help
us
in
a
pinch
and
to
reduce
our
reliance
on
the
manufacturer
that
increase
price
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
we
put
southern
millwork
s
product
in
all
of
our
south
florida
store
from
cutler
ridge
north
to
boca
raton
three
month
later
we
push
the
other
supplier
completely
out
of
our
south
florida
store
although
we
still
do
business
with
them
elsewhere
in
the
state

our
window
manufacturer
keller
be
base
in
miami
and
work
twenty
four
hour
a
day
make
us
window
we
have
another
vendor
home
advantage
from
whom
we
bought
window
glass
that
company
go
to
the
extraordinary
length
of
put
someone
on
its
payroll
in
each
of
our
south
dade
store
to
cut
glass
on
the
spot
the
president
of
leslie
locke
ralph
pepper
call
kapiloff
to
see
what
he
could
do
to
help
do
you
have
any
people
who
can
answer
phone
kapiloff
say
half
joking
but
on
monday
pepper
actually
sent
someone
down
for
a
week
just
to
answer
phone
it
be
bizarre
but
it
just
go
to
show
you
the
length
people
go
to
to
get
through
a
crisis
poly
america

we
start
a
lot
of
new
manufacturer

down
there
and
expand
the
dimension
of
many
exist
relationship
bernie
personally
get
involve
with
georgia
pacific
a
substantial
lumber
supplier
of
ours
and
told
them
that
we
would
not
tolerate
price
increase
for
a
certain
amount
of
time
they
froze
price
on
the
plywood
they
sell
to
us
in
south

one
day
kapiloff
and

found
themselves
work
as
lot
guy
meaning
they
be
shag
cart
from
a
store
s
parking
lot
because
there
be
so
many
customer
and
not
enough
available
body
to
return
cart
to
the
store
the
company
bought
lunch
and
dinner
for
associate
at
the
affected
store
for
at
least
the
first
month
follow
the
storm
because
everyone
be
work
twelve
and
fourteen
hour
day
and
late
in
november
berg
come
through
again
for
his
cutler
ridge
crew
many
of
whom
be
still
month
away
from
return
to
their
home
by
throw
them
a
thanksgiving
dinner
at
the
store
what
be
a
grand
opening
compare
to
this
what
be
set
up
three
store
at
once
it
be
a
cakewalk
anybody
that
go
through
hurricane
andrew
know
that
you
can
live
through
anything
because
a
lot
of
them
lose
their
home
every
night
our
team
take
a
half
hour
for
a
debrief
what
issue
do
you
face
today
what
could
we
do
well
tomorrow
note
from
those
session
later
be
use
to
update
our
companywide
disasterrecovery
plan
preparation
be
critical
you
must
have
a
flexible
plan
the
main
lesson
of
our
post
hurricane
andrew
experience
be
that
whatever
you
give
to
the
community
you
will
get
it
back
tenfold
and
when
our
store
be
fully
functional
people
in
miami
wouldn
t
think
of
shopping
anywhere
else
we
create
an
endure
bond
with
the
community
the
decentralize
nature
of
our
company
be
another
factor
in
our
quick
and
vital
response
to
the
tragedy
if
we
be
a
centralize
company
micromanaging
every
move
from
atlanta
we
would
not
have
react
as
swiftly
as
we
do
instead
we
have
people
on
scene
in
florida
who
understood
their
responsibility
to
the
market
their
customer
and
our
culture
we
have
a
plan
mobilize
quickly
and
have
employee
who
willingly
give
up
several
month
of
their
home
life
to
help
the
people
of
south
florida
get
their
life
back
when
the
cutler
ridge
store
reopen
it
gross
s
million
a
week
before
andrew
it
be
not
a
high
volume
store
budget
for
no
more
than
a
week
but
after
the
hurricane
it
be
the
high
volume
store
in
the
company
as
a
result
of
hurricane
andrew
do
we
have
a
strong
market
position
in
south
dade
yes
do
we
own
the
market
no
we
lease
our
customer
they
be
free
to
go
whenever
they
want
to
sometimes
the
lease
charge
be
quite
expensive
but
that
be
part
of
the
culture
of
the
company
we
can
t
ever
take
them
for
grant
because
as
soon
as
we
do
they
will
find
somebody
else
who
will
take
well
care
of
them
we
can
disappoint
our
customer
once
and
they
will
put
up
with
it
twice
not
likely
many
have
forgotten
all
about
what
we
do
for
them
after
hurricane
andrew
so
we
don
t
sit
back
and
feel
secure
in
south
dade
because
of
what
we
do
six
year
ago
hurricane
andrew
be
a
moment
of
maturation
for
us
as
a
participant
in
our
community
but
it
be
just
a
springboard
in
all
our
orientation
and
culture
and
value
talk
store
manager
and
district

about
it
later
it
be
the
right
thing
to

the
next
day
they
take
turn
guard

so
nothing

at

of
our

it
extends
to
the
entire

that

serf
so
we

very
deliberately

we
will
distribute
it

we
say
no

be
just
about
money
if
we
really
want
to
have
an
impact
in
these
community
and
if
in
fact
we
want
it
to
be
about
more
than
money
then
we
have
to
build
relationship
we
told
habitat
we
would
be
delighted
to
be
a
national
partner
of

we
want
to
do
more
than
write
a
check
and
get
back
to
business
we
offer
training
volunteer
material
and
then
some
cash
that
be
a
much
more
comprehensive

while
at
handy
dan
and
at
the
home
depot
in
august
it
be
my
turn
one
of
the
tradition
of
this
dinner
be
that
the
honoree
get
to
request
a
guest
speaker
of
his
or
her
choice
consider
our
history
some
thought
my
choice
be
a
curious
one
ross
perot
perot
graciously
accepted
fly
in
at
his
own
expense
and
he
make
a
great
controversial
speech
about
our
grow
involvement
in
the
persian
gulf
but
before
the
dinner
perot
sat
down
with
us
for
a
personal
chat
about
what
could
have
be
i
don
t
make
many
mistake
in
my
life
perot
say
but
i
have
to
admit
that
be
one
of
the
best
mistake
i
ever
make
without
question
we
all
knew
that
the
home
depot
would
not
be
the
company
it
be
today
if
perot
have
be
the
major
stockholder
but
he
be
very
magnanimous
about
it
a
true
gentleman
i
be
proud
of
what
you
guy
have
do
he
say
everything
you
say
you
be
go
to
do
you
do
and
fella
i
shop
these
store
all
the
time
i
buy
everything
in
your
store

in
we
budget
almost
million
for
charitable
contribution
but
we
have
no
idea
how
to
spend
it
each
year
up
until
then
responsibility
for
community
give
have
be
rotate
among
bernie
me
and
ron
brill
but
as
the
dollar
amount
grow
we
realize
that
decide
who
to
give
back
to
be
become
a
full
time
job
there
be
no
other
asset
that
we
would
budget
a
million
dollar
for
and
have
no
plan
where
to
send
it
that
s
when
we
hire
suzanne
apple
to
help
her
job
be
to
take
our
general
vision
of
tzedaka
and
make
it
work
in
the
real
world
the
big
challenge
be
make
it
something
that
wasn
t
just
about
us
we
didn
t
want
glory
for
ourselves
or
the
home
depot
we
want
proactive
result
apple
s
first
move
be
to
decentralize
the
dollar
and
to
train
our
district
manager
to
be
active
in
their
community
we
developed
three
focus
area
for
the
give
program
affordable
housing
youth
at
risk
and
the
environment
at
the
same
time
we
target
eight
community
nationwide
in
which
we
become
proactively
involve
dallas
miami
tampa
orlando
atlanta
los
angeles
san
diego
and
phoenix
those
be
our
major
market
in
and
we
target
additional
dollar
for
them
apple
then
go
door
to
door
to
charitable
group
in
these
community
look
for
opportunity
solicit
proposal
from
them
for
us
to
do
a
project
a
great
example
of
how
this
work
be
in
tampa

local
preservation
organization

we
weren

we
help
pull
that
group
together
a
little
bit
by
we
budget

a
year
later
we

provide
formal

we
stimulate
associate
to
do
thing
and
support
them
financially
but
they
either
do
it
or
they
don
t
it
be
up
to
them
and
we
find
that
most

it
the
kind
of
people
who
willingly
do
these
thing

the
kind
of
people
that
we
want
to
attract

there
be
a
problem
in

be
a
part
of
the
solution
this
be
all
part
of
the
christian
judaic
feel
that
we
think
you
should
have
in
an
ethical
business
it
be
more
informal
than
formal
in
our
company
our
people
believe
the
way
we
believe
and
at
the
home
depot
they
found
a
place
where
they
can
act
on
these
kind
of
feeling
whenever
there
be
a
habitat

the
great
pleasure

hearing
what

do
after
they
have

as
they
do
in
make

they
don
t
call
and
ask
for
permission
they
just
do
it
and
they
know
we
will
support
them
in
do
it
the
future
respond
to
change
be
one
of
the
reason
for
the
success
of
the

arthur
twenty
year
after
we
start
this
company
on
a
truckload
of
fireplace
screen
and
a
warehouse
of
ceiling
fan
you
would
think
we
would
be
satiate
we
be
wealthy
beyond
our
dream
successful
even
somewhat
famous
we
get
our
picture
in
the
paper
and
we
appear
on
magazine
cover
even
well
we
ve
make
millionaire
out
of
more
than
of
our
associate
we
probably
have
more
self
make
blue
collar
millionaire
on
our
payroll
than
anyone
else
in
corporate
america
why
do
they
still
work
here
after
strike
it
rich
because
they
love
their
job
as
much
today
as
they
do
when
they
start
the
home
depot
be
a
fun
place
to
work
there
will
always
be
pressure
and
day
when
they
think
as
we
do
why
be
i
here
this
be
aggravate
i
have
enough
money
to
go
anywhere
but
the
less
need
there
be
to
stay
on
the
less
pressure
there
be
and
the
home
depot
as
a
company
have
be
great
to
these
people
who
know
they
make
an
important
and
ongoing
contribution
to
our
success
and
their
own
the
home
depot
be
one
of
the
few
company
where
people
who
have
be
here
a
long
time
should
have
a
significant
amount
of
money
sock
away
and
they
still
wear
blue
jean
to
work
and
abhor
tie
sport
coat
and
other
standard
business
attire
you
can
always
tell
the
people
on
our
elevator
who
don
t
work
here
because
that
s
the
way
they
dress
the
competitiveness
of
the
home
improvement
industry
motivates
my
work
at
the
home
depot
i
get
to
transfer
that
piece
of
my
personality
from
when
i
be
young
as
it
related
to
sport
and
my
study
and
apply
it
to
the
business
arena
today
when
you
think
about
the
retail
business
every
day
you
plan
out
certain
thing
but
there
be
so
many
thing
you
don
t
control
in
the
marketplace
and
every
day
you
have
to
react
every
day
you
have
to
plan
every
day
the
circumstance
change
it
could
be
something
as
simple
as
the
weather
how
do
it
affect
the
business
how
will
you
deal
with
competition
how
do
you
deal
with
opportunity
how
do
you
deal
with
customer
who
be
change
all
the
time
one
of
the
thing
i
love
about
retail
be
that
it
be
not
stable
it
be
always
shift
there
be
always
dynamic
take
place
to
be
successful
in
retail
you
must
be
willing
to
stick
to
your
value
understand
not
just
what
your
value
be
but
that
every
day
they
will
be
paint
against
a
different
environment
and
you
must
be
ready
for
that
respond
to
change
be
one
of
the
reason
for
the
success
of
the
home
depot

what
s
next
we
spent
a
large
part
of
contemplate
where
our
growth
will
come
from
in

year
the
answer
include

the
president
of
our
south

division
spent
six
month
visit
fifteen
country
in

key

europe
and
latin
america
focus
specifically
on
developed
as
oppose
to
emerge
country
in
each
country
the
goal
be
to
benchmark
with
other
company
and
spend
time
learn
about
the
local
home
improvement
market
housing
pattern
and
cultural
difference
one
of
the
frustration
that
cause
be
when
pena
give
us
his
recommendation
the
truth
he
say
be
that
the
whole
world
need
what
we
have
pena
found
opportunity
for
us
everywhere
our
estimate
indicate
the
combine
international
do
it
yourself
and
pro
market
be
large
than
the
entire
u
s
market
worldwide
we
found
that
home
improvement
retailer
provide
relatively
poor
service
even
though
the
customer
to
whom
we
spoke
indicate
good
service
be
universally
important
to
them
we
be
particularly
encourage
by
this
give
the
home
depot
s
strength
in
this
area
the
desire
for
good
customer
service
be
universal
but
the
housing
and
product
need
be
very
different
throughout
the
world
and
sometimes
within
region
therefore
it
be
essential
that
we
adapt
to
market
difference
in
the
area
of
product
selection
and
store
service
in
addition
we
realize
that
critical
mass
in
international
market
will
take
longer
than
have
be
our
experience
in
the
united
state
and
even
canada
international
home
improvement
market
development
and
diversity
be
unique
from
country
to
country
so
it
s
not
possible
to
take
a
successful
model
and
transplant
it
to
another
country
each
country
require
its
own
model
which
adapts
to
local
custom
culture
demographic
and
geography
finally
in
most
country
we
visit
we
found
that
the
diy

pro
customer
market
be
segment
most
market
have
different
store
or

center
in
as
a
result
home
way
bear
some
clear
resemblance
to
the
home
depot
in
its
layout
signage
color
and
even
their
own
version
of
a
familiar
company
mascot
that
lead
to
some
suggestion
that
china
might
be
our
first
non
english
speak
market
but
we
have
enough
market
closer
to
home
to
try
first
we
re
not
out
to
open
in
as
many
country
as
possible
just
to
say
we
re
there
we
re
not
in
this
to
collect
flag
so
during
the
next
five
year
we
will
selectively
plant
seed
the
first
in
chile
there
have
never
be
anything
like
the
home
depot
in
chile
before
we
determine
chile
be
the
best
place
to
start
for
a
number
of
reason
first
of
all
it
have
the
most
developed
diy
pro
market
in
latin
america
in
addition
housing
be
become
more
westernize
which
mean
it
doesn
t
require
a
percent
merchandise
change
for
us
at
this
stage
in
its
development
chile
represent
a
s
or
early
s
retail
opportunity
compare
to
the
united
state
we
picked
probably
the
best
non
english
speak
country
in
the
world
to
export
our
concept
because
of
the
stable
economy
stable
government
and
high
education
level
chile
appear
to
have
what
it
take
to
support
the
concept
and
the
chilean
government
support
foreign
investment
we
want
to
go
into
a
country
in
which
we
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
do
well
and
where
we
could
form
a
partnership
with
the
right
people
eventually
we
believe
south
america
will
be
a
big
profit
center
for
the
company
and
provide
the
quick
return
at
the
low
risk
of
the
country
we
review
our
first
store
in
chile
open
on
august
bill
hamlin
and
i
be
there
that
day
and
we
have
tear
in
our
eye
watch
our
chilean
associate
give
customer
service
equal
to
the
great
level
we
ever
saw
in
our
store
in
the
united
state
or
canada
when
we
saw
the
chilean
customer
respond
the
same
way
to
our
threelegged
stool
wide
product
assortment
best
product
and
excellent
customer
service
mile
away
it
really
reinforce
the
potential
the
company
have
over
die
long
haul
it
be
the
single
big
opening
in
our
history
draw
people
in
a
single
day
our
second
chilean
store
also
open
strong
in
december
language
be
not
a
barrier
to
export
our
culture
and
value
once
more
our
culture
prove
itself
exportable
we
married
our
company
culture
to
chile
s
national
culture
and
create
a
hybrid
that
be
still
recognizable
to
one
and
all
as
a
home
depot
store
that
really
raise
the
bar
for
me
as
to
where
we
can
go
with
this
company
it
give
me
a
lot
more
confidence
to
move
ahead
even
more
quickly
than
we
originally
expect
so
in
addition
to
three
more
store
in
chile
schedule
to
open
in
fiscal
we
will
also
enter
the
buenos
aire
argentina
market
for
the
first
time
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
fiscal

whenever
possible
we
will
use
regional
manufacturer
in
chile
as
we
have
in
the
united
state
and
canada
because
we
recognize
everyone
have
civic
pride
and
they
will
want
to
see
product
with
which
they
be
already
familiar
as
well
as
select
import
that
s
also
because
of
import
duty
and
currency
fluctuation
i
think
one
of
the
main
reason
for
our
instant
success
be
the
establishment
of
a
fullblown
buying
office
in
chile
for
chile
we
be
determine
to
get
the
mix
right
the
first
time
despite
the
start
up
expense
in
fact
we
now
believe
in
put
all
divisional
operating
infrastructure
in
place
before
opening
new
store
not
the
other
way
around
in
fact
percent
of
the
good
we
sell
in
chile
be
manufacture
in
that
country
when
chilean
president
eduardo
frei
ruiz
tagle
and
his
wife
enter
the
store
to
look
around
he
could
not
believe
that
percent
of
that
product
be
make
in
his
own
country
he
have
never
see
it
brought
together
in
that
way
before
if
we
be
try
to
run
this
store
from
atlanta
georgia
i
know
we
would
not
have
be
able
to
do
that
the
success
we
ve
have
be
from
regionally
building
the
store
that
be
right
for
their
community
incidentally
as
we
do
when
we
acquire
the
aikenhead
s
store
in
canada
we
spent
a
lot
of
effort
bring
to
chilean
associate
to
train
in
the
united
state
for
six
month
to
a
year
before
that
store
open
so
it
be
a
blending
of
the
culture
of
our
company
and
the
culture
building
code
and
even
the
weather
of
the
country
and
the
product
we
found
there
now
the
question
becomes
will
there
be
a
short
circuit
between
the
customer
and
our
associate
will
our
company
culture
transcend
the
language
difference
our
chilean
partner
s
a
c
i
falabella
supply
the
logistics
and
distribution
capability
to
provide
a
smoother
and
more
cost
effective
flow
of
good
to
the
store
they
also
have
the
most
widely
carry
credit
card
in
chile
with
million
cardholder
in
country
more
than
visa
or
anyone
else
but
falabella
will
not
have
a
bernie
or
arthur
or
pat
will
they
adequately
judge
the
customer
s
input
and
respond
that
will
be
the
most
critical
factor
in
gauge
our
success
outside
the
united
state
in
non
english
speak
area
chile
be
not
a
big
market
but
if
the
first
two
store
continue
to
do
well
we
can
eventually
open
a
dozen
store
there
argentina
be
an
even
big
market
surprisingly
our
first
store
in
puerto
rico
have
the
strong
opening
sale
wise
in
the
history
of
the
company
if
thing
continue
to
go
well
it
will
give
us
real
comfort
that
there
be
an
international
side
to
this
business
in
or
year
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
people
look
back
and
say
the
summer
of
be
one
of
the
significant
milestone
in
our
success
specialty
concept
why
do
the
home
depot
even
need
to
be
in
another
business
to
continue
meeting
wall
street
s
expectation
and
trading
in
the
same
multiple
to
which
we
have
become
accustom
we
must
go
beyond
our
traditional
base
that
s
why
in
addition
to
the
home
depot
we
own
and
operate
the
expo
design
center
although
the
first
expo
design
center
open
in
it
take
us
six
year
and
four
prototype
before
we
settle
on
the
model
that
satisfied
our
return
on
investment
model
expo
be
a
kitchen
and
bath
project
base
business
that
complement
the
home
depot
it
come
about
because
there
be
once
a
great
location
in
san
diego
that
we
want
but
it
be
only
two
mile
away
from
an
exist
home
depot
store
we
be
concerned
that
one
of
our
competitor
would
take
it
if
we
didn
t
we
come
up
with
the
idea
of
put
what
become
expo
in
that
space
which
turn
out
to
be
a
real
plus
barry
silverman
now
president
of
our
southwest
division
developed
many
of
expo
s
original
merchandising
concept
as
a
concept
expo
be
a
good
one
in
those
day
but
not
a
great
one
it
try
too
hard
to
be
something
new
a
showcase
for
upscale
kitchen
and
bath
design
sell
to
customer
in
an
intimate
one
on
one
relationship
with
our
designer
while
at
the
same
time
offering
cash
and
carry
product
a
la
the
home
depot
the
format
be
not
conducive
to
the
big
consultative
sale
we
saw
as
expo
s
future
steve
smith
who
have
be
with
expo
from
the
begin
bryant
scott
and
i
take
the
concept
back
to
the
draw
board
we
work
until
midnight
at
my
kitchen
table
reinvent
expo
from
then
on
bryant
and
steve
begin
building
expo
s
that
present
a
strictly
showroom
atmosphere
with
virtually
no
cash
and
carry
item
so
while
the
original
concept
be
less
than
perfect
scott
and
smith
make
it
profitable
and
expandable
our
insistence
on
get
a
good
shareholder
return
one
of
this
company
s
key
value
sent
them
back
to
the
draw
board
time
and
time
again
we
just
couldn
t
get
it
right
financially
until
then
it
have
become
apparent
that
there
be
other
customer
need
that
must
be
met
and
so
we
have
branch
out
into
other
arena
as
well
as
other
country
home
depot
be
and
always
will
be
evolve
to
find
new
and
well
or
additional
way
to
serve
our
customer
of
course
spin
off
concept
from
the
home
depot
be
not
without
its
pitfall
we
launch
a
chain
call
the
home
depot
crossroad
in
that
be
intend
to
service
rural
market
and
we
quickly
regret
it
store
open
in
place
such
as
waterloo
iowa
quincy
illinois
and
columbia
missouri
they
be
massive
facility
with
almost
square
foot
under
roof
and
another
square
foot
outside
the
merchandise
mix
include
everything
from
tractor
tire
to
carpet
we
must
have
be
out
of
our
mind
thankfully
we
come
to
our
sens
before
too
much
damage
be
do
and
we
convert
the
crossroad
store
into
home
depot
write
off
the
whole
idea
as
one
of
our
sillier
moment
nothing
venture
nothing
gain
at
least
we
re
willing
to
take
chance
and
we
do
learn
a
great
deal
about
the
need
of
farmer
and
rancher
which
we
now
accommodate
in
many
home
depot
store
where
appropriate
we
come
to
the
realization
a
few
year
ago
that
not
every
customer
shop
at
the
home
depot
for
all
their
need
all
the
time
they
may
shop
with
someone
else
by
phone
through
a
catalog
or
via
the
internet
and
we
want
to
capture
that
purchase
in
the
future
that
s
why
we
acquire
two
direct
base
company
in
the
mid
s
maintenance
warehouse
base
in
san
diego
and
national
blind
and
wallpaper
which
be
base
in
detroit
each
ship
product
directly
to
the
customer
whether
it
be
the
professional
or
the
diy
customer
we
see
tremendous
opportunity
in
that
kind
of
relationship
with
customer
who
don
t
want
to
come
into
a
store
to
shop
or
don
t
have
the
time
the
ongoing
business
of
both
company
be
profitable
neither
be
a
turnaround
on
top
of
that
they
brought
some
important
capability
that
benefit
our
store
some
that
we
be
use
today
some
we
will
apply
in
the
near
future
half
of
national
blind
and
wallpaper
s
business
be
in
wallpaper
half
be
in
window
covering
we
carry
both
of
those
category
inside
the
home
depot
but
they
have
certain
product
line
that
we
don
t
and
can
offer
the
convenience
of
phone
order
it
s
a
cost
effective
way
of
do
business
we
can
also
integrate
their
unique
and
efficient
system
into
our
store
so
all
of
our
customer
can
enjoy
enhance
custom
order
capability
for
example
the
home
depot
have
a
special
order
process
for
blind
that
tends
to
be
time
consume
it
s
not
something
we
specialize
in
as
a
core
competency
but
for
national
blind
and
wall
paper
it
be
their
people
be
excellent
at
handle
special
order
detail
and
complete
a
sale
and
the
same
process
that
might
take
up
to
twenty
five
minute
in
a
home
depot
store
could
take
only
five
to
seven
minute
on
the
telephone
our
first
pilot
program
to
integrate
national
blind
and
wallpaper
into
the
home
depot
come
in
ten
detroit
store
we
put
telephone
in
the
decor
department
and
create
the
special
order
center
when
our
store
associate
reach
the
point
of
place
an
order
they
hook
the
customer
up
with
the
special
order
center
that
free
the
store
associate
to
help
the
next
customer
and
the
blind
customer
get
their
order
in
quickly
and
accurately
our
goal
after
validate
the
result
be
to
expand
this
program
throughout
the
company
this
be
what
the
merger
and
acquisition
people
call
synergy
it
s
an
overuse
word
but
i
think
we
have
a
great
deal
of
synergy
with
national
blind
and
wallpaper
there
be
many
product
that
the
home
depot
handle
on
a
special
order
basis
thing
that
a
phone
center
could
support
which
be
why
we
see
this
get
big
in
the
future
so
as
much
as
we
acquire
a
profitable
company
we
more
importantly
acquire
a
capability
we
very

we

yet
tapped
all
the

between

but
as
we
put
together
our
e
commerce
business
we
re
go
to
look
to
maintenance
warehouse
as
a
potential
order
fulfillment
operation
that
distribution
capability
be
go
to
be

in

like
many
retail
company
we
re
generally
excite
about
the

although
we
be
proceed
carefully
into

we
ve
have
a
world
wide
web

since
grow
it
from
mostly
financial
information
to
include
more
customer

we
want
to
build
it
far
into
a
site
that
add
value
and
drive
business
into
the
store
a
place
where
we
can
far
build
the
brand
for
example
in
we
partner
with
mindersoft

to

elect
to
receive
ongoing
home
improvement
tip
tailor
to
their
specific
interest
and
skill
level
be
also
the
year
we
begin
offering
the
public
an
opportunity
to
buy
share
of
our
stock
directly
from
home
depot
via
our
in
ternet
site
we
be
the
first
company
to
make
this
option
available
to
people
who
weren
t
already
shareholder
and
for
those
exist
or
potential
shareholder
who
would
like
to
attend
our
annual
meeting
in
atlanta
but
can
t
make
the
trip
in
we
plan
to
broadcast
that
meeting
on
line
follow
the
lead
of
dell
intel
and
others
finally
we
will
be
offering
our
annual
report
online
and
be
already
allow
shareholder
to
vote
their
proxy
via
our
internet
site
this
be
more
convenient
to
them
and
save
us
money
in
we
be
test
a
limited
range
of
product
for
sale
online
we
must
come
up
with
a
formula
that
s
right
for
us
the
right
price
range
and
whether
the
range
of
product
sell
will
be
brand
or
not
the
nice
tile
about
e
commerce
be
that
you
can
change
on
the
fly
i
m
sure
we
will
overall
direct
sale
capability
should
become
one
more
way
we
can
meet
our
customer
need
and
provide
total
customer
satisfaction
in
we
also
acquire
an
atlanta
base
truck
rental
company
name
load
n
go
it
be
a
concept
dream
up
with
us
in
mind
in
and
we
test
it
at
four
nashville
store
the
idea
be
that
customer
can
rent
a
truck
from
us
to
haul
especially
large
purchase
this
be
more
convenient
flexible
and
inexpensive
for
the
customer
than
have
us
make
delivery
by
the
end
of
load
n
go
will
be
in
approximately
store
we
now
walk
very
carefully
through
the
acquisition
we
make
because
wall
street
have
very
high
expectation
of
our
return
on
investment
roi
if
we
pick
up
a
company
that
have
a
low
roi
wall
street
will
punish
us
wall
street
have
to
see
synergy
or
bridge
building
there
be
very
few
company
that
we
could
buy
that
would
carry
a
time
profit
to
earnings
pe
ratio
the
majority
of
the
acquisition
we
will
look
at
tend
to
be
small
business
that
be
much
more
specialized
than
we
be
company
we
can
learn
from
and
use
the
leverage
of
our
hundred
of
store
to
grow
another
important
issue
for
us
in
consider
an
acquisition
be
culture
if
ours
be
not
akin
to
what
we
re
acquire
it
represent
a
major
problem
be
what
they
believe
in
similar
to
what
we
believe
in
if
not
we
re
go
to
have
to
work
very
hard
to
make
it
fit
and
it
may
not
be
worth
it
that
s
why
we
generally
prefer
to
build
from
within
villager
hardware
we
believe
that
there
will
always
be
room
for
a
good
neighborhood
hardware
convenience
store
operator
in
part
because
we
have
expand
the
overall
hardware
market
as
do
it
yourselfers
become
more
confident
they
take
on
big
project
if
they
be
go
to
spend
or
more
they
may
feel
it
be
worth
pull
into
a
parking
lot
of
car
but
sometimes
for
those
big
project
they
don
t
want
to
go
back
to
a
big
box
store
for
a
convenience
purchase
there
s
a
percentage
of
people
who
don
t
want
to
set
foot
in
large
superstores
of
any
kind
toy
r
us
wal
mart
or
ours
our
villager
s
hardware
convenience
store
will
cater
to
those
people
these
people
feel
more
comfortable
drive
up
to
a
store
where
they
can
park
their
car
right
in
front
go
in
get
a
can
of
paint
or
a
hammer
walk
out
and
be
do
in
five
minute
some
convenience
store
operator
create
a
special
reason
why
customer
shop
there
other
than
just
convenience
for
instance
sears
recently
bought
orchard
supply
hardware
a
california
company
that
we
have
compete
with
for
year
orchard
have
an
unusual
convenience
store
format
with
a
lawn
and
garden
focus
particularly
in
soil
and
fertilizer
and
thing
of
that
nature
service
level
be
very
high
it
be
a
small
store
with
a
unique
product
niche
and
there
will
always
be
room
for
that
concept
a
convenience
store
that
understands
which
of
the
shopping
attribute
it
can
compete
with
versus
which
one
it
shouldn
t
will
always
be
successful
in
the
marketplace
that
s
why
in
we
launch
a
pilot
program
villager
s
hardware
in
new
jersey
our
effort
be
to
leverage
our
brand
name
downscale
and
create
a
more
intimate
store
at
some
time
in
some
place
for
some
people
less
home
depot
will
actually
be
more
people
often
describe
me
as
complex
or
complicate
and
i
be
probably
not
an
easy
man
to
live
with
at
home
or
at
work
part
of
that
come
from
my
fiercely
competitive
nature
part
of
it
be
my
grind
need
to
climb
to
achieve
to
do
on
the
other
hand
there
be
another
side
to
me
a
somewhat
contemplative
quiet
side
where
i
draw
back
from
all
of
this
do
and
compete
to
think
and
reassess
that
s
my
balance
my
brain
be
competitive
my
heart
isn
t
it
be
fed
by
love
and
care
and
cooperation
it
s
a
funny
kind
of
mix
inside
of
me
but
this
be
my
yin
and
yang
i
need
both
of
these
side
of
my
personality
fortunately
the
home
depot
provide
an
outlet
for
both
competition
and
care
i
m
not
a
devoutly
religious
jew
but
i
do
see
myself
as
a
religious
person
in
my
own
way
i
have
internalize
a
lot
of
the
value
and
outlook
and
sensitivity
of
jewish
life
without
necessarily
go
through
the
formality
of
prayer
although
i
do
enjoy
attend
service
with
my
family
i
like
the
quiet
splendor
of
be
in
the
synagogue
the
kind
of
isolation
it
provide
from
the
outside
world
i
think
i
bring
a
sense
of
value
and
decency
to
business
that
represent
the
very
best
part
of
not
only
judaism
but
of
christianity
as
well
i
believe
in
the
value
of
relationship
and
i
like
bernie
have
try
to
carry
that
into
the
company
il
on
may
assume
the
title
of
chief
executive
officer
of
the
home
depot
inc
although
that
represent
a
transition
in
day
to
day
responsibility
that
have
already
take
place
inside
the
company
it
wasn
t
a
big
deal
externally
it
give
the
business
press
something
new
to
write
about
at
the
same
time
it
be
a
wake
up
call
challenge
bernie
and
me
with
regard
to
future
succession
at
the
top
of
the
company
do
we
have
the
best
kind
of
option
for
backing
us
up
although
we
think
there
be
some
extraordinarily
talented
people
within
the
company
today
we
told
our
senior
staff
that
we
think
there
probably
need
to
be
another
three
or
four
player
brought
into
the
company
at
a
senior
level
who
can
give
us
a
deeper
pool
to
consider
for
future
succession
the
company
should
have
more
choice
than
we
have
today
and
they
should
be
in
place
and
ready
to
go
our
philosophy
have
always
be
to
answer
the
bell
before
it
ring
and
that
be
true
when
it
come
to
succession
as
well

we
be
not
in
a
rush
when
it
be
appropriate
for
me
to
drop
one
title
and
give
it
to
somebody
i
will
do
that
my
job
today
include
focus
on
strategic
issue
related
to
our
core
business
merchandising
operation
and
system
support
second
be
pursue
growth
initiative
such
as
opening
international
store
expand
expo
and
develop
new
specialty
concept
and
produce
earnings
a
great
deal
of
my
time
be
spent
focus
our
opportunity
forward
even
if
they
won
t
be
significant
in
term
of
revenue
for
a
number
of
year
i
be
also
lead
us
through
organizational
and
structural
change
bring
in
people
from
the
outside
who
will
get
us
ready
for
the
next
five
to
seven
year
growth
spurt
this
tie
in
with
succession
planning
there
may
never
be
another
tag
team
partnership
atop
this
company
do
breakfast
with
bernie
and
arthur
but
there
will
always
be
a
similar
balance
of
personality
and
style
i
be
sensitive
to
surround
myself
with
people
who
be
equally
competent
but
also
different
from
me
we
believe
that
the
best
marriage
be
two
people
who
share
the
same
value
but
be
different
in
many
way
because
as
long
as
you
aren
t
fight
over
value
difference
help
you
grow
the
two
of
us
developed
personally
and
professionally
over
the
last
two
decade
because
while
our
value
be
the
same
our
style
be
quite
different
this
company
be
more
than
the
bernie
and
arthur
show
it
be
bernie
and
me
and
all
these
other
folk
who
every
day
run
this
business
the
way
we
always
promise
it
would
be
run
it
be
very
hard
to
replace
founder
where
do
you
find
someone
with
bernie
s
emotion
or
my
problem
solve
and
financial
insight
but
this
company
be
not
go
to
self
destruct
because
bernie
retire
i
could
take
some
time
off
and
the
home
depot
wouldn
t
miss
a
beat
we
have
everyone
back
up
so
that
nobody
be
indispensable
first
generation
home
depot
people
such
as
larry
mercer
bill
hamlin
lynn
martineau
vern
joslyn
and
bryant
scott
live
through
the
same
tough
time
that
we
live
through
we
be
confident
of
their
ability
to
carry
on
in
our
stead
if
we
do
the
job
properly
if
we
continue
enculturating
our
people
with
the
value
that
built
this
company
we
can
alleviate
the
pain
that
normally
occurs
with
a
transition
from
the
company
s
founder
to
professional
manager
the
people
who
follow
us
will
have
to
be
well
than
we
be
we
expect
to
leave
the
company
in
well
hand
than
those
that
create
it
that
s
what
i
tell
people
who
be
run
our
store
your
job
be
not
to
train
people
who
arc
as
good
as
you
your
job
be
to
train
people
to
be
even
well
than
you
we
need
io
judge
ourselves
not
on
the
quality
of
work
we
do
today
but
on
the
quality
of
people
we
train
to
lead
us
tomorrow
despite
the
change
in
his
title
bernie
still
spends
almost
as
much
time
on
the
business
of
the
home
depot
as
he
do
before
his
retirement
the
big
difference
be
he
spends
more
time
work
out
of
florida
still
actively
involve
with
merchandising
the
ridgid
deal
be
ample
evidence
of
that
and
work
directly
with
our
senior
level
executive
it
be
very
hard
for
somebody
like
bernie
to
leave
a
company
like
this
and
nobody
would
think
of
ask
him
to
give
it
up
he
also
feel
a
genuine
sense
of
loyalty
and
obligation
to
the
people
who
have
help
make
him
what
he
be
today
during
managementtraining
class
bernie
say
i
be
a
product
of
what
you
be
if
you
weren
t
as
good
as
you
be
i
wouldn
t
be
where
i
be
today
i
be
a
famous
individual
i
have
my
picture
in
magazine
i
have
my
name
on
building
but
when
we
start
this
company
i
be
nothing
i
be
broke
before
the
home
depot
bernie
keep
his
hand
in
the
company
via
telephone
fax
and
face
to
face
meeting
he
play
golf
or
dines
with
our
vendor
business
partner
board
member
and
manager
several
time
a
week
he
also
get
a
copy
of
every
major
piece
of
correspondence
memo
or
policy
that
i
make
the
relationship
continue
to
be
one
of
complete
partnership
year
ago
we
have
conversation
about
succession
with
sam
walton
and
he
felt
very
strongly
that
david
glass
be
the
only
guy
who
could
follow
him
you
won
t
ever
find
another
sam
walton
but
glass
be
a
great
substitute
for
him
when
walton
picked
glass
he
do
that
know
that
one
day
he
be
not
go
to
be
there
and
glass
could
run
the
business
in
fact
he
be
probably
run
it
even
well
than
walton
do
we
be
work
toward
that
goal
of
what
happens
when
bernie
and
i
be
not
here
anymore
we
have
a
lot
of
strong
people
in
the
wing
right
now
we
have
the
luxury
of
time
but
if
something
unexpected
be
to
happen
to
any
one
of
us
the
company
would
survive
legacy
we
take
a
lot
of
chance
bernie
when
a
company
be
small
and
it
be
in
constant
communication
with
the
people
in
the
organization
meeting
them
face
to
face
every
day
or
once
a
week
it
be
a
very
simple
matter
for
everyone
to
understand
what
the
company
be
all
about
when
a
company
reach
our
size
communicate
our
value
and
belief
be
more
challenge
arthur
and
i
can
no
longer
personally
train
all
of
our
associate
but
we
can
train
our
core
people
from
senior
officer
through
district
and
store
manager
they
spend
hour
with
us
they
understand
our
philosophy
they
understand
the
essence
of
who
we
be
we
say
you
ve
heard
it
straight
from
our
mouth
now
get
out
there
and
walk
the
walk
talk
the
talk
carry
that
message
to
associate
today
or
in
five
year
be
a
job
we
entrust
to
them
this
go
back
to
all
of
my
history
in
retailing
i
have
never
have
anybody
work
for
me
in
retailing
that
didn
t
work
for
me
out
of
love
as
oppose
to
fear
we
carry
this
approach
into
building
the
home
depot
we
care
about
each
other
and
we
care
about
the
customer
the
thing
that
we
do
for
customer
inside
and
outside
of
the
store
demonstrate
our
commitment
to
them
and
then
when
something
happens
within
the
company
we
circle
the
wagon
we
help
each
other
now
how
do
you
get
that
message
out
by
every
mean
of
communication
that
you
can
of
course
but
living
it
be
the
best
way
for
us
it
mean
walk
the
store
and
hug
people
or
the
fact
that
our
associate
call
us
bernie
and
arthur
and
pat
the
fact
that
we
will
drop
what
we
be
do
to
personally
wait
on
customer
in
the
store
the
fact
that
we
be
willing
to
stop
and
teach
and
train
somebody
on
the
spot
we
will
go
into
a
store
and
take
five
or
ten
or
fifteen
associate
into
a
break
room
buy
them
a
cup
of
coffee
and
say
tell
us
what
we
can
do
well
tell
us
how
we
be
treat
you
we
know
we
can
t
possibly
touch
people
this
way
but
all
of
our
associate
know
we
be
out
there
do
it
they
know
we
be
accessible
to
them
let
me
go
back
to
the
essence
of
what
the
company
be
rolemodeling
every
manager
and
every
district
manager
in
this
company
be
a
trainer
and
a
teacher
their
role
be
to
listen
react
and
get
thing
do
if
they
can
t
do
that
they
shouldn
t
be
in
the
position
that
they
be
in
look
at
the
influence
they
have
on
us
they
hire
the
people
they
train
the
people
they
be
in
control
of
produce
and
nurture
our
most
vital
crop
the
associate
in
the
store

when
i
be
a
kid
the
first
opportunity
i
ever
face
be
on
a
merry
go
round
it
have
a
brass
ring
on
a
mechanical
arm
and
if
you
reach
out
from
your
pony
and
grabbed
the
brass
ring
you
would
get
a
free
ride
i
be
the
kid
who
always
reach
out
sometimes
i
fell
off
the
horse
but
i
always
get
right
back
up
and
try
again
most
of
my
friend
on
the
other
hand
never
even
try
they
never
reach
for
that
brass
ring
that
be
the
original
risk
reward
i
believe
opportunity
be
still
out
there
for
anybody
with
the
courage
to
reach
out
but
recognize
these
opportunity
be
the
difference
between
people
who
be
successful
and
people
who
be
not
many
of
the
thing
that
happen
to
us
at
the
home
depot
go
back
to
our
willingness
to
take
risk
over
and
over
and
over
again
and
everything
that
ever
happen
to
us
all
the
lucky
break
be
opportunity
that
present
themselves
arthur
pat
and
i
reach
out
for
a
lot
of
brass
ring
to
start
this
company
and
we
didn
t
fall
off
the
horse
more
than
a
few
time
some
people
look
at
the
home
depot
today
and
they
say
wow
you
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
the
truth
be
it
have
often
be
a
struggle
it
look
easy
now
and
the
story
be
fun
to
retell
give
the
distance
of
year
but
people
forget
there
be
a
lot
of
pain
a
lot
of
time
where
we
live
on
the
edge
we
take
a
lot
of
chance
we
also
have
tremendous
opportunity
that
turn
into
break
know
a
banker
such
as
rip
fleming
be
also
a
big
break
enjoy
a
critical
business
and
personal
relationship
with
ken
langone
be
paramount
to
our
success
even
work
for
sandy
sigoloff
be
a
break
without
sandy
where
would
we
be
today
when
i
look
back
at
my
life
today
i
feel
good
about
myself
and
the
life
have
lead
i
feel
as
though
i
ve
accomplish
a
great
deal
of
good
in
my
life
for
my
family
my
business
associate
and
my
community
i
think
that
i
ve
give
back
to
the
world
what
i
ve
take
out
i
feel
good
about
have
help
create
a
company
that
s
make
its
mark
in
the
world
but
i
get
the
most
joy
outside
of
my
family
from
watch
the
people
we
help
up
the
ladder
and
see
the
success
that
they
have
also
enjoy
they
join
us
as
kid
many
just
out
of
high
school
well
they
re
not
kid
anymore
they
re
men
and
woman
who
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
home
depot
might
never
have
realize
their
potential
they
found
their
place
in
this
company
a
place
where
a
square
peg
can
fit
into
a
round
hole
i
get
chill
think
about
these
people
and
what
they
ve
accomplish
many
rise
from
lot
attendant
to
position
of
great
authority
respect
leader
in
their
field
the
manager
and
officer
of
this
company
they
re
run
multi
million
and
multi
m
zdz
dollar
business
they
re
personally
worth
scad
of
money
and
they
re
all
give
back
to
their
community
just
as
arthur
and
i
do
every
one
of
them
be
charitable
not
because
we
say
they
have
to
do
it
they
do
it
because
they
re
good
people
with
good
value
