uniqueness

the
single
most

factor
that
decides

the

breakthrough
measure
and
assess
uniqueness
of
an

have
always
be
a
challenge
there
be
no
well
define
metric
or
a
standard
to
ass
uniqueness
which
be
applicable
to
all
type

perspective
the

producer
of
innovation
and
the
consumer
of
the
innovation
situation
in
which
newness
be
difficult
to
ass
due
to
lack
of
reliable
information
available
a
combination
of
the
next
two
lens
obviousness
of
the
problem
and
obviousness
of
the
solution
be
use
impact
a
new
product
or
a
new
process
be
consider
innovative
only
if
it
have
either
achieve
a
high
impact
and
or
prof
its
ability
to
create
a
large
impact
in
future
this
chapter
explains
the
three
difficulty
we
all
face
in
measure
the
impact
objectively
the
first
be
our
ability
to
define
the
beneficiary
of
the
impact
this
could
be
the
client
the
end
customer
the
company
the
community
or
a
combination
of
all
these
most
innovator
find
it
difficult
to
quantify
the
benefit
of
their
innovation
to
their
own
company
the
second
challenge
be
in
decide
the
scale
or
metric
on
which
the
impact
of
innovation
be
measure
as
manager
we
have
learnt
to
think
of
revenue
cost
and
market
share
to
measure
the
success
of
innovation
the
impact
of
all
innovation
cannot
be
measure
use
financial
metric
but
could
be
easily
measure
use
environmental
or
social
metric
for
example
reduction
of
pollution
from
manufacturing
operation
or
increase
employability
of
people
from
the
nearby
community
far
there
be
innovation
that
have
measurable
impact
but
cannot
be
convert
to
any
of
the
three
financial
social
or
environmental
measure
an
example
be
an
innovation
that
increase
employee
or
customer
satisfaction
by
per
cent
give
equal
weightage
to
the
various
type
of
impact
have
encourage
all
employee
to
take
up
innovation
project
that
may
not
necessarily
have
a
financial
impact
the
third
problem
arises
because
it
take
time
for
innovation
to
achieve
the
outcome
that
be
originally
project
how
do
we
ass
the
impact
of
innovation
that
have
be
commercialize
only
recently
and
a
much
large
impact
be
expect
in
future
past
impact
be
usually

one
such
measure
be
the

innovation
quotient
oiq
in
simple

it
be
a
measure
that
enables
a

to
track
its

progress
on
innovativeness
and
compare
it
with

portfolio
on

invest
in
the
next

year
with
the
help
of
information
available
in
our

and
some
additional

we

of
an

be
critical
to
meet

exceed
its

the
analysis
also
establish
that
the
best
way
to

the

of

be
to
have
a
hybrid
approach

for
some

project
that

management
attention
for
a
longer
period
define
as

project
data
indicate
that
innovation
project
with
longer
gestation
period
perform
well
but
they
need
a
senior

as
a

who
could
assure
continuity
of

beyond
the

of

all
of
whom
create
the

to

successful
chapter
take
a
step
back
and
answer
the
follow
question
what
make
some
people
innovator
who
enables
and
influence
them
the
most
why
do
innovator
participate
in
a

like
innovista
finally
why
do
company
encourage
their
people
to
participate
in
innovista
the
answer
to
these
question
be
drawn
from
a
research
conduct
on
three
distinct
set
of
people
the
first
set
comprise
serial
innovator
who
be
define
as
anyone
who
have
participate
in
innovista
for
seven
or
more
year
in
the
first
ten
year
anyone
else
who
have
participate
for
five
or
six
year
but
deliver
well
quality
of
innovation
more
unique
and
high
impact
after
apply
the
above
filter
on
around
people
we
identify
ninety
two
serial
innovator
out
which
sixty
one
participate
in
our
survey
while
these
innovator
give
us
insight
on
the
commonalty
among
the
serial
and
successful
innovator
we
also
want
to
know
if
any
of
these
commonality
be
specific
to
serial
innovator
we
identify
a
second
set
of
people
who
be
not
innovator
in
our
database
and
use
them
as
the
comparison
set
and
ran
the
same
survey
the
third
set
of
people
comprise
top
level
officer
cxos
of

and
those
reporting
to
them
who

to
find
their
perception
about
the
programme
and
also
about
their
people
who
participate
in
the
programme
the
analysis
of
all
three

by
a
discussion
with
some
of
them
to
draw
deeper
insight
and
support
story
and
incident
the
insight
drawn
from
this
research
could
be
summarize
as
below
some
myth
about
innovation
that
be
not

be
found
to
be
very
useful
by
business
leader

also
reinforces
the
transformational

can
deliver
to

hr
the
return
from

the

the

bold

we
would
be

of

where
we
be

be
clear
that
though
during
the
early
twentieth
century
the
tata
group
deliver
many
innovation
it
could
not
institutionalize
a

through
which
its
employee
could
continue
deliver
innovation
with
the
same
gusto
ratan
tata
recognize
that
tata
company
have
to
change
their
ethos

to
allow
people
to
express
creative
idea

the

that

be
learnt
in

the

be
a

that
he
told
an

there
be
one
kind
of
charity
common
enough
among
us
and
which
be
certainly
a
good
thing
though
i
don
t
think
it
be
the
best
thing
we
can
have
it
be
that
patchwork
philanthropy
which
clothes
the
rag
feed
the
poor
and
heals
the
sick
and
halt
i
be
far
from
decry
the
noble
spirit
which
seek
to
help
a
poor
or
suffer
fellow
be
but
charity
of
the
hospital
and
the
poor
asylum
be
comparatively
more
common
and
fashionable
among
the
parsee
what
advance
a
nation
or
a
community
be
not
so
much
to
prop
up
its
weak
and
most
helpless
member
as
to
lift
up
the
best
and
most
gift
to
make
them
of
the
great
service
to
the
country
i
prefer
this
constructive
philanthropy

seek
to
educate
and
develop
the
faculty
of
the
best
of
our
young
men
and
if
this
be
to
be
do
what
i
ask
my
fellow
parsee
be
what
difference
be
it
to
them
whether
it
be
exclusively
for
their
benefit
or
for
all
the

than
a

employee
start
to
unconsciously
improve
they
instinctively
begin
look
for
best
practice
from
around
the
world
and
adopt
them
they
sought
the
support
of
consultant
to
bring
try
and
test
practice
into
company
and
improve
their
result
almost
everywhere
tata
company
and
manager
use
to
say
we
want
to

tell
us
what
we
can
adopt
show
us
someone
who
be
do
it
and
we
will
do
it
too
while
the
unconscious
improvement
orientation
do
produce
good
result
it
also
become
a
problem
when
view
through
the
lens
of
innovation
which
require
people
to
venture
into
untried
area
and
territory
a
proposition
that
be
consider
risky
in
a
milieu
that
have
become
averse
to
failure
it
be
very
clear
that
manager
be
adopt
well
establish
practice
from
around
the
world
and
have
become
reluctant
to
break
the
mould
and
do
something
for
the
first
time
the
need
be
to
blend
drive
for
improvement
with
willingness
to
try
something
new
clarion
call
to
manager
one
of
the
first
person
to
sense
the
shift
that
take
place
from
unconscious
innovation
to
unconscious
improvement
be
the
then
chairman
ratan
tata
in
one
of
the
annual
event
in
attend
by
the
ceo
he
spoke
about
the
need
for
innovation
he
say
to
be
leader
we
need
to
innovate
we
need
to
bring
out
the
creative
strength
of
our
people
and
create
an
environment
where
we
do
thing
differently
and
do
thing
others
have
not
do
his
concern
be
that
in
their
endeavour
to
improve
that
too
unconsciously
tata
manager
have
become
comfortable
in
be
follower
while
he
do
recognize
that
these
manager
benchmarked
themselves
against
the
best
and
try
to
emulate
them
sometimes
even
surpass
them
that
be
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
business
challenge
of
the
come
decade
cite
lead
japanese
korean
and
chinese
company
that
grow
by
innovate
not
by
copying
ratan
tata
impressed
upon
the
ceo
that
if
we
want
to
be
up
there
we
have
to
give
some
attention
to
be
innovative
in
term
of
what
we
do
i
be
just
try
to
say
that
we
should
create
a
space
where
we
can
lead
do
thing
differently
and
do
thing
that
others
have
not
do
we
will
not
in
the
long
term
global
environment
ever
be
leader
unless
we
be
also
innovative
with
ratan
tata
suggest
innovation
driven
leadership
the
two
main
challenge
that
emerge
be
how
do
company
change
themselves
to
allow
their
people
to
express
creative
idea
that
would
be
give
serious
consideration
by
the
management
how
do
company
inculcate
innovation
without
lose
the
trait
of
continuous
improvement
ratan

increase
as
a
result
of
these

from
a

with
which
he

forward
let
us
be

big
and
let
us

of
what
we
do
and
let
us
not

afraid
to
be
leader

should
not

as

the
programme
be
run
quietly
without
any

as

for
us
a
total
of
team
participate
from
thirty
five
tata

in
this

while
there

one
core
lesson
these

take
a

of
care
to
recognize
their

m
present
inspirational
story
about
their
innovation
and
the
people
behind
those
innovation
we
realize
that
none
of
the
tata
company
have
a
process
to
identify
and
recognize
innovator
tata
innovation
day
be
consider
a
step
in
the
right
direction
ratan
tata
in
his
address
at
a
leadership
conference
in
december
say
in
the
past
i
have
talk
about
innovation
and
i
be
delighted
to
see
the
action
that
have
be
take
by
the
team
that
go
to
view
the
innovation
process
and
the
environment
in
some
of
the
world
s
most
innovative
company
i
be
delighted
that
this
have
take
place
and
very
very
excite
that
we
have
make
this
first
move
but
it
be
only
a
first
move
we
have
an
immense
task
ahead
of
us
now
he
far
say
in
our
quest
for
innovation
we
should
have
the
humility
to
recognize
and
draw
on
good
idea
and
creative
thought
irrespective
of
where
they
come
from
whether
they
come
from
academia
whether
they
come
from
a
workman
or
whether
they
come
from
a
young
manager
and
we
should
be
able
to
ass
such
idea
and
have
the
vision
to
be
able
to
see
how
far
it
can
go
the
challenge
therefore
for
all
of
us
in
managerial
position
be
in
fact
to
create
that
environment
of
encouragement
and
motivation
the
message
be
clear
we
need
to
drive
a
change
in
the
mindset
of

from

of

the

out
of

question
in

the
two
that

how

your

state
that
the

the
question
we
ask
ourselves

what
be
tata
group
the
thirteen
company
that
we
survey
together
contribute
to
more
than
per

of
the

of
all
tata
company
in
a
similar
survey
be
conduct
with
employee
of
five
company
locate
in
the
uk
and
europe
our
hypothesis
be
that
the
result
would
be
different
as
the
employee
in
that
geography
would
be
aware
and
confident
about
their
innovation
the
result
however
be
similar
to
the
result
of
the
servey
not
only
do
the
participant
perceive
their
company
to
be
less
innovative
as
compare
to
other
company
in
that
geography
they
felt
the
same
when
compare
with
the
tata
group
none
of
our
company
unlike
m
and
a
few
others
globally
have
a
mechanism
to
identify
share
and
celebrate
their
best
innovation
amongst
its
employee
this
lack
of
information
about
the
innovation
from
their
own
company
along
with
the
fact
that
the
employee
be
reading
about
innovation
happen
within
and
outside
the
tata
group
lead
them
to
feel
that
their
own
company
be
less
innovative
than
others
this
feel
manifest
as
a
low
score
give
by
them
to
their
innovativeness
indicate
lack
of
self
confidence
another
simple
exercise
during
the
roadshows
of
tata
innovation
day
corroborate
this
far
the
audience
be
ask
to
write
down
top
five
innovation
that
their
organization
have
do
in
the
last
one
year
the
response
reveal
a
disconcert
fact
there
be
very
little
convergence
which
meant
there
be
lack
of
information
about
their
own
innovation
this
establish
the
first
insight
the
lack
of
knowledge
about
oneself
and
the
perception
that
others
be
well
could
be
one
of
the
reason
why
employee
lack
self
confidence
and
doubt
their
innovativeness
the
second
insight
be
that
almost
all
company
lack
a
formal
and
well
define
recognition
programme
for
innovation
we
dug
deeper
and
found
that
some
company
have
annual
award
but
only
a
few
recognize
team
for
innovation
however
far
analysis
reveal
that
those
who
recognize
team
for
innovation
neither
define
a
yardstick
to
ass
innovation
nor
highlight
the
innovativeness
of
the
project
in
the
citation
that
be
give
to
the
winner
the
third
insight
be
that
the
middle
manager
exhibit
the
least
confidence
about
the
innovativeness
of
their
company
the
senior
leadership
of
company
have
start
ask
their
employee
to
take
bold
innovation
project
and
assure
their
support
to
them
the
young
employee
as
always
be
full
of
energy
and
idea
and
want
to
work
on
excite
innovation
project
and
be
confident
about
their
capability
the
middle
manager
however
believe
that
continue
with
improvement
would
help
them
achieve
their
quarterly
and
annual
performance
target
and
would
lead
them
to
the
path
of
personal
growth
the
fourth
insight
reveal
the
widespread
confusion
between
the
two
word
improvement
and
innovation
we
create
our
own
simple
explanation
to
help
employee
differentiate
between
the
two
but
the
large
message
deliver
to
them
be
that
both
improvement
and
innovation
be
equally
important
one
should
always
strive
to
be
part
of
at
least
a
few
project
that
would
qualify
as
innovation
chapter
explains
the
method
we
use
to
differentiate
between
innovation
and
improvement
in
gopal
in
one
of
his
interview
say
the
tata
group
have
a
long
history
of
innovation
however
many
be
unaware
of
the
extent
and
significance
of
the
innovation
undertaken
and
their
impact
on
the
entire
group
and
nation
this
be
reaffirm
when
he
once
ask
a
group
of
about
a
hundred
manager
in
kolkata
to
raise
their
hand
if
they
thought
the
tata
group
be
innovative
only
a
few
hand
go
up
for
the
next
hour
he
go
on
to
share
the
story
of
the
tata
group
s
innovation
through
the
decade
towards
the
end
he
ask
the
same
question
again
and
this
time
most
of
the
people
raise
their
hand
tell
story
to
people
about
their
own
innovation
be
the
best
way
to
disseminate
information
to
make
employee
aware
about
their
potential
and
infuse
self
confidence
in
them
it
be
a
case
of
we
have
do
it
in
the
past
and
we
can
do
it
again
the
verdict
base
on
these
insight
and
finding
be
clear
tata
innovation
day
have
to
be
scale
up
it
be
expect
that
the
programme
would
capture
inspirational
story
of
employee
and
share
them
with
tata
employee
would
help
in
building
self
confidence
the
begin
of
a
virtuous
circle

march
ahead
from
here
on

inception

as

the
springboard
for
a
few
more

that
enable

most

of
engineer

and

who

to
work
consider
the
profile
of
these
employee

create
simple
and
logical
programme
on
innovation
the
task
be
massive
consider
that
we
have
to
make
a
large
cultural
shift
in
company
that
have
be
in
existence
for
several
decade
this
transformation
be
complex
since
there
be
several
fledgling
company
and
quite
a
few
acquire
company
we
continued
to
consistently
invest
in
building
knowledge
on
innovation
and
experiment
fearlessly
some
experiment
fail
and
many
others
succeed

not
all

successful
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
not
all
innovative
idea
be
successful
and
we
should
not
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
a
failure
mean
that
this

story
behind
this
inclusion

a
peek
into
how
the
experience
of

to
the

of
the
deliverable
for
these
knowledge

be
to
conduct
new
experiment
in
their
respective
field
to
encourage
them
to
undertake
newer
experiment
that
would
help
create
new
knowledge
we
have
not
only
built
an
incentive
system
but
also
institute
an
award
call
freedom
to
fail
this
award
be
give
to
those
who
carry
out
an
experiment
which
have
fail
but
if
successful
it
have
the
potential
to
find
a
new
way
of
do

new

or
create
a
new
thing
altogether
new
product
i
be
very
keen
to
add
this
award
in
tata
innovista
but
be
not
get
explicit
internal
support
by
december
though
the
tgif
have
not
be
form
yet
straw
in
the
wind
suggest
that
a
body
would
be
constitute
which
most
likely
would
be
lead
by
gopal
dare
to
try
during
one
of
the
gala
dinner
at
the
leadership
conference
in
i
grabbed
the
opportunity
and
ask
gopal
about
his
view
of
add
the
freedom
to
fail
award
his
response
be
it
be
a
good
idea
but
do
you
think
people
will
come
forward
to
participate
i
respond
i
would
like
to
give
it
a
shot
i
would
like
to
run
it
for
two
year
in
the
second
year
if
we
do
not
get
traction
i
will
call
it
a
fail
experiment
but
only
after
apply
for
this
award
and
perhaps
win
it
this
be
how
freedom
to
fail
become
the
second
award
in
the
innovista
programme
the
success
of
have
result
in
the
enthusiasm
of
but
be
temper
with
some
trepidation
because
the
new
award
expect
team
to
share
their
failure
instead
of
success
in
front
of
a
large
audience
my
worry
start
in
the
first
quarter
of
when
i
saw
enthusiastic
participation
in
the
successful
innovation
award
but
not
in
the
newly
introduce
freedom
to
fail
award
gopal
s
word
be
haunt
me
before
the
closing
date
of
the
entry
i
met
a
few
ceo
and
senior
manager
with
whom
i
have
an
excellent
relationship
and
explain
this
award
to
them
we
discuss
about
various
project
and
initiative
that
their
company
have
try
but
be
unsuccessful
and
picked
one
project
that
wasn
t
embarrass
to
share
in
front
of
the
audience
absence
of
contender
for
this
award
greatly
help
in
get
company
to
agree
for
participation
we
get
six
nomination
very
soon
this
award
create
excitement
not
only
within
but
also
in
the
external

this
award

rename
as

to
try
and

more
than
nomination
in

in
similar
ideology
we
research
relevant
literature
and
look
for
similar
award
or
concept
which
may
have
precede
our
own
we
discover
the
follow
in
the
same
year
when
we
introduce
the
award
dombrowski

about
the
high
risk
involve
in
innovation
and
the
need
for
leader
to
support
innovator
the
article
state
the
point
we
want
to
drive
in
be
that
behind
each
successful
innovation
story
that
we
hear
there
be
people
who
champion
the
idea

for
support
at
each
stage
of
the
innovation
process
and
make
it
their
mission
to

innovation

intrepid
people

at

enormous
risk
on

of
their
organization
in

capable
of
do
so
because
of
the
support
they
receive
from
their
leader
senior
management
should
explicitly
manifest
their
willingness
to

to
conform
than

to

mistake
to

they
go
to
great
length
to

an
error

the
concept
of
creative
failure
this
type
of
failure

when

from
familiar
routine
in
a
bold
attempt
to
carry
out
experiment
undertaking
manageable
and
prudent
risk
people
who
commit
creative
error
should
not
be
mocked

deride

rather
encourage
to
undertake
far
sensible
risk
in
a
spirit

optimism

error
such
as

the

believe
it
be
possible
to

the
team
work
on
this
project
for
four
year
of
which
more
than
a
year
be
spent
in
find

which
be
achieve
with
the
support
of
swansea
university
in
the
uk
the
team
design
a
bio
reactor
that
would
continuously
produce
the
chaplin
the
process
for
produce
the
chaplin
use
extremely
harsh
chemical
initially
but
the
team
design
a
more
environmentally
acceptable
method
the
team
found
that
the
coat
be
hydrophobic
repels
water
on
one
side
and
hydrophilic
attracts
water
on
the
other
the
idea
be
to
ensure
that
the
hydrophilic
side
attach
to
the
steel
and
the
hydrophobic
part
remain
on
the
outside
thereby
repel
water
and
stop
corrosion
the
team
create
the
most
effective
mix
from
five
chaplin
to
make
the
coat
material
finally
the
coat
be
test
for
its
ability
to
withstand
a
wide
range
of
temperature
the
sample
be
then
assess
for
the
durability
and
corrosion
performance
test
the
team
found
that
the
small
imperfection
in
the
coat
due
to
either
surface
roughness
of
steel
or
surface
damage
due
to
scratch
lead
to
the
tear
and
peel
of
the
coat
this
peel
expose
the
underlie
steel
surface
undermine
the
corrosion
protection
however
more
importantly
the
peel
back
coat
expose
the
hydrophilic
part
of
the
underside
of
the
coat
which
attract
more
water
this
lead
to
excessive
corrosion
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
be
be
attempt
after
four

the

this
question

pronged

design
first
the
professor
developed
a

for

output
of

second
they
analyse
the

the
pattern
of
entry

re
entry
by

in
the

award
be

the

the

both
these

the

indeed
appear
to

the

the

question
confuse
employee
and
discourage
them
from
identify
project
that
would
qualify
as
innovation
be
my
work
truly
innovative
or
be
it
just
an
improvement
innovation
be
deliver
by
r
d
guy
i
be
not
in
r
d
award
so
i
be
not
involve
in
design
any
new
product
so
how
can
i
innovate
i
don
t
have
a
patent
be
my
innovation
of
any
worth
i
cannot
assign
a
monetary
value
to
quantify
the
impact
or
benefit
of
my
innovation
would
it
still
count
as
an
innovation
my
project
benefit
us
only
once
and
be
no
more
in
use
innovation
be
know
to
have
a
future
value
and
so
will
my
project
still
be
consider
as
an
innovation
we
belong
to
a
small
company
our
innovation
will
never
be
able
to
compete
with
innovation
of
large
company
in
the
marketplace
and
also
for
award
last
year
my
project
be
well
than
my
colleague
s
but
his
project
won
the
limelight
be
there
an
objective
way
of
judging
innovation
as
in
many
organization
none
of
our
company
have
a
definition
of
innovation
a
definition
give
an
unambiguous
start
point
to
shape
a
subject
it
work
as
a
pivot
around
which
the
structure
of
the
subject
could
be
built
it
give
an
opportunity
to
build
a
vocabulary
to
propagate
the
subject
and
for
people
to
debate
and
improve
the
subject
of
innovation
be
actually
very
rich
in
its
vocabulary
because
of
thousand
of
research
paper
and
book
that
have
be
write
by
academician
unfortunately
this
vocabulary
be
not
well
know
among
the
work
professional
and
have
remain
confine
to
academician
and
consultant
a
few
word
and
phrase
that
employee
mostly
use
during
a
discussion
on
innovation
be
idea
invention
creativity
and
patent
the
vocabulary
get
built
and
use
rapidly
if
the
subject
gain
popularity
let
s
take
a
few
example
from
cricket
powerplay
fielding
restriction
in
limited
over
cricket
be
add
to
the
dictionary
of
cricket
once
the
shorter
form
of
one
day
cricket
match
start
and
evolve
once
t
the
shortest
form
of
a
cricket
match
today
at
international
level
gain
popularity
we
get
newer
word
such
as
the
slow
ball
knuckle
ball
and
free
hit
the
two
shorter
form
of
cricket
become
more
popular
than
the
traditional
longer
duration
match
and
help
in
produce
many
more
skilled
cricketer
in
india
now
look
at
baseball
how
many
indian
even
posse
the
basic
vocabulary
of
this
sport
the
situation
would
be
similar
amongst
american
and
european
when
it
come
to
the
vocabulary
of
cricket
we
want
to
make
the
innovation
sport
as
popular
as
cricket
in
india
played
by
almost
every
indian
and
in
all
form
from
gully
cricket
to
the
international
level
tournament
such
as
the
indian
premier
league
ipl
have
provide
more
opportunity
to
player
and
have
raise
the
aspiration
of
people
we
use
tata
innovista
our
innovation
tournament
to
inspire
employee
to
actively
play
this
sport
and
make
innovation
a
popular
sport
if
more
people
play
a
sport
then
by
virtue
of
their
interaction
they
get
to
know
more
about
the
finer
detail
which
in
turn
help
them
play
well
we
knew
that
our
innovation
tournament
if
support
by
the
leadership
could
take
the
form
of
a
movement
and
would
give
us
opportunity
to
gradually
add
new
term
and
word
to
the
active
vocabulary
of
our
people
for
innovation
to
become
a
movement
we
want
all
type
of
innovation
to
be
take
up
and
present
by
employee
from
all
age
group
function
and
corner
of
the
organization
to
address
the
eight
concern
list
above
and
to
make
the
innovation
sport
inclusive
and
equally
attractive
for
people
work
in
all
part
of
the

academic
exercise

make
people
understand

spread
those
word
actively
be
always
a
challenge
to
disseminate
the

we
use
all
the
three
touchpoints
provide
to
employee
to
participate
prepare
and
pitch
to
win
the
innovation
award
the
road
show
similar
to
exhibition
match
or
friendly
match
that
the
world
cricket
body
organizes
to
promote
cricket
in
new
country
in
the
focus

on
encourage
people
to
participate
without

about
the
quality
of

as
a
result
the
participation

by
eight
time
by
the

as
how
do
you
avoid

your

the
limitation
in
the
current
business
model
that
would
constrain
the
outcome
of
this

be
your

two
key
dimension
of
the
criterion
that
be
common
for
all
award
be
a
uniqueness
of
the

and
b
impact
of
the

these
two
dimension
of
the
criterion
form
the
bedrock
of
our
vocabulary
hence
let
me
explain
these
in
detail
dimension
extent
of
uniqueness
uniqueness

the
source
of
differentiation

be
it
in
the
product

process
this
dimension
of
uniqueness
help
in
distinguish
incremental
improvement
and
innovation
the
extent
of
uniqueness
could
be
use
as
one
of
the
input
to
ass
the
level
of
success
an
innovation
might
get
in
the
marketplace
the
extent
of
uniqueness
be
not
always
easy
to
measure
or
ass
while
the
team
and
management
may
use
this
uniqueness
to
decide
go
or
no
go
for
a
project
ultimately
it
be
the
customer
or
the
beneficiary
who
decides
if
there
be
sufficient
uniqueness
the
customer
also
evaluates
if
uniqueness
in
the
innovation
be
commensurate
with
the
price
at
which
he
would
be
willing
to
make
a
switch
from
the
exist
product
service
process
while
too
little
of
uniqueness
give
a
tag
of
me
too
a
very
high
degree
of
uniqueness
may
fail
to
get
adopt
by
the

may
come
to

an
innovation

be
new
to
the
world
on
the
one
hand

on
the
other
hand
it
could
just
be

there
be
many
situation
in
which
it
be
difficult
to
ass
newness

in
such
case

also
to
validate
the

through
the
above
process
we
use
the
second
lens

usually
not
protect

be
kept
as

the
absence
of

about
what

the
first
lens
of

cannot
be
use
to
determine

in
such
case
this
lens
of
obviousness
be
apply
twice
first
on
the
problem
that
the
innovation
have
solve
and
then
on
the
solution
contain
in
the
innovation
obviousness
of
the
problem
at
the
fundamental
level
all
the
problem
that
customer
face

for
innovation
clayton
christensen
of
harvard
business
school
have
say
that
innovation
product
and
service
be
hire
by
people
to
accomplish
a
job
well
so
if
a
job
can
be
execute
well
solves
a
problem
by
hire
a
new
product
customer
would
do
so
it
be
therefore
not
surprising
that
a
high
level
of
emphasis
be
give
by
company
to
listen
to
and
observe
customer
to
spot
newer
problem
and
define
the
problem
accurately
we
ask
team
question
such
as
which
problem
of
the
customer
have
this
innovation
solve
be
the
problem
new
or
old
how
be
the
customer
deal
with
this
problem
earlier
how
be
the
competitor
solve
the
same
problem
if
your
innovation
be
the
best
at
solve
the
problem
what
be
the
next
best
solution
available
to
solve
the
same
problem
people
usually
don
t
like
to
answer
such
uncomfortable
question
these
question
over
a
period
nudge
employee
to
uncover
high
order
unstated
problem
of
customer
and
define
them
sharply
thereby
improve
the
capability
of
innovator
their
manager
and
mentor
this
aspect
be
highlight
in
the
case
study
of
jaguar
land
rover
in
chapter
when
the
lens
of
obviousness
be
apply
to
the
problem
or
need
of
the
customer
it
show
how
new
or
unknown
the
problem
would
be
to
the
people
who
could
have
attempt
to
solve
it
on
the
one
hand
the
problem
could
be
obvious
and
long
stand
for
example
frequent
charge
of
phone
or
use
of
cable
to
charge
the
phone
but
extremely
difficult
to
solve
people
in
various
part
of
the
world
would
have
make
several
attempt
to
solve
such
problem
on
the
other
hand
the
problem
could
be
unknown
or
newly
uncovered
for
example
the
first
ipod
which
uncovered
the
latent
frustration
of
customer
in
manage
and
listen
to
music
of
their
choice
or
the
problem
be
actually
new
problem
related
to
autonomous
car
solve
well
know
and
obvious
problem
that
have
exist
for
several
year
with
an
out
of
the
box
and
non
obvious
solution
be
likely
to
contain
lot
more
uniqueness
as
compare
to
solve
the
latent
or
newly
identify
problem
once
a
new
problem
be
unearthed
several
solution
innovation
get
surface
until
only
a
few
survive
follow
be
the
five
example
of
problem
that
have
exist
for
several
year
and
be
well
know
to
people
who
knew
the
respective
industry
it
be
very
likely
that
if
someone
have
solve
these
problem
it
would
have
certainly
result
in
an
innovation
with
a
high
level
of
uniqueness
while
the
problem
be
give
below
in
brief
the
actual
solution
have
be
detailed
partly
in
this

the

this
be
ideal
it
pose
another
challenge
which
kpi
should
be
use
to

the
impact
kpis
follow
a
tree
structure
in
all
organization
a
large
change
in
a
kpi
of
a
division
could
create
a
very
minuscule
change
in
the
kpi
that
be
tracked
at
the
organization
level
to
make
it
comparable
across
innovation
we
use
only
those
kpis
that
be
tracked
at
the
cxo
level
when
can
we
say
that
innovation
be
successful
the
next
question
one
could
ask
be
the
benefit
from
an
innovation
be
usually
realize
slowly
as
the
acceptance
of
innovation
increase
amongst
customer
hence
at
what
stage
shall
we
declare
an
innovation
successful
and
reward
it
an
award
for
innovation
should
ideally
be
give
at
a
time
when
there
be
no
doubt
about
its
success
it
be
also
desirable
that
the
announcement
of
award
should
evoke
interest
and
surprise
audience
and
reader
therefore
there
be
always
a
dilemma
about
the
timing
of
the
award
if
the
award
be
give
much
after
the
innovation
be
successful
in
the
marketplace
and
people
know
about
it
there
be
not
much
excitement
neither
for
the
recipient
nor
for
the
audience
on
the
other
hand
give
an
award
to
an
innovation
at
a
very
early
stage
would
be
very
excite
for
the
recipient
and
the
audience
who
may
be
unaware
about
the
innovation
the
downside
of
do
this
early
be
the
risk
of
innovation
not
meeting
the
expectation
of
the
company
and
the
customer
after
win
the
award
which
may
raise
question
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
award
process
to
balance
the
above
contrast
need
of
the
audience
the
recipient
and
the
sponsor
of

the

two
enablers
to
maintain
the

the
team
need
to
keep
their

alive
until
the

be
scale
up
to
a

level
have
become

be
difficult
to
replicate
the
above
question
related
to
the
enablers
of
future
impact
of
the
innovation
have
contribute
far
to
the
vocabulary
and
have
start
influence
the
innovator
and
their
mentor
to
discus
these
question
at
the
very
begin
of
their
future
innovation
project
let
us
look
at
an
example
the
indian
railway
primarily
maintains
three
type
of
wagon
for
bulk
material
movement
a
bobsn
side
discharge
b
bobrn
bottom
discharge
and
c
nbox
revolve
type
turn
upside
down
to
discharge
these
three
wagon
have
have
individual
design
all
these
year
the
load
and
unload
station
for
these
three
be
quite
different
and
hence
they
can
t
be
use
interchangeably
this
necessitate
have
sufficient
number
of
wagon
of
each
type
all
the
time
tata
steel
which
contribute
per
cent
of
the
total
freight
of
indian
railway
own
two
type
of
wagon
bobsn
and
nbox
under
the
own
your
wagon
scheme
oyws
steel
company
have
to
maintain
enough
inventory
of
different
type
of
wagon
for
their
internal
raw
material
movement
in
tata
steel
engineering
team
design
a
dual
discharge
wagon
that
could
be
use
as
bobsn
as
well
as
nbox
this
be
a
breakthrough
as
it
reduce
the
capital
cost
and
improve
the
availability
of
wagon
previously

let
me
narrate
a
story
from
the
time
of
jamsetji
tata
in
jamsetji
s
express
mill
be
produce
the
best
yarn
in
india
the
mill
have
reach
this
high
level
of
quality
and
productivity
due
to
jamsetji
s
prolific
experimentation
and
improvement
narrate
in
chapter
he
didn
t
believe
in
trade
secret
at
all
he
would
share
the
improvement
and
the
process
without
any
hesitation
with
others
include
rival
his
principal
aim
be
to
raise
the
standard
of
the
industry
in
the
country
once
an
agent
of
a
rival
company
come
to
jamsetji
and
sought
advice
about
the
machinery
that
they
should
purchase
for
the
new
mill
they
be
planning
to
put
up
at
nagpur
where
the
empress
mill
also
be
locate
the
advice
be
so
readily
tender
that
the
agent
be
suspicious
jamsetji
told
his
friend
half
in
jest
that
if
the
new
mill
fail
it
would
be
well
for
him
as
a
potential
acquirer
if
it
contain
the
proper
machinery
the
situation
have
change
by
the
late
twentieth
century
and
the
begin
of
the
twenty
first
century
as
company
start
protect
their
innovation
for
an
innovation
to
deliver
benefit
for
a
longer
time
it
be
generally

important
to
ensure
longevity
of

by
avoid
or
delay
competitor
from
copying
it
innovation
that
be
protect
by

find
it
easy
to
achieve
this
we
know
that
patent
cannot
be
register
to
protect
innovation
that
be
not
base
on
technological
breakthrough
the
thought
of
use
patent
alone
to
sustain
the
uniqueness
of
innovation
and
assure
a
well
chance
of
achieve
the
project
future
impact
be
limit
and
create
two
problem
the
assessment
of
future
impact
become
unfair
to
those
innovation
that
be
fantastic
but
have
no
opportunity
to
register
patent
it
create
dysfunctional
behaviour
amongst
employee
to
file
a
patent
even
if
it
didn
t
make
sense
to
invest
in
the
patent
filing
process
if
there
be
no
scope
for
a
patent
in
an
innovation
the
team
start
to
lose
interest
to
address
these
problem
and
continue
to
encourage
employee
and
manager
to
innovate
and
patent
only
relevant
new
technology
and
discovery
we
make
a
few
change
in
the
definition
and
criterion
to
reflect
the
follow
have
patent
alone
be
not
enough
ideally
the
patent
should
be
able
to
ring
fence
all
possible
alternative
path
that
the
competitor
could
use
to
achieve
the
same
result
the
strength
of
patent
in
prevent
others
from

similar
product
and
service
be
consider
more
important
the
term
patent
and
patent
strength
have
be
replace
with
difficult
to
replicate
patent
be
nothing
but
a
legal
way
to
stop
others
from
copying
so
that
the
innovator
could
protect
and
enjoy
the
return
for
a
longer
time
there
could
be
many
other
way
of
building
entry
barrier
to
achieve
the

result
of
thwart
the

trade

some
example
to
achieve
the
same
grab
a
sole
licence
of
a
new
technology
from
a
technology
provider
could
be
another
way
to
avoid
replication
one
more
way
to
make
it
difficult
for
others
to
copy
an
innovation
that
be
difficult
to

be
to
plan
a
series
of
fast
pace
innovation
to
keep
it
ahead
on
uniqueness
it
be
essential
to
note
that
there
be
some
innovation
that
the
team
and
the
company
would
like
others
to
copy
and
adapt
in
the
interest

what
be
the

on

we
learnt
that
assessment
of
an
innovation
be
contextual
it
depends
on
the
choice
available
at
the
time
of
assessment
a
product
could
be
very
unique
when
compare
with
other
product
available
to
the

customer
the

product
might
be
far
less
unique
when

available
in

geography
a
product
may
be
very
unique
when
it
be

could
gradually

we

it
this

us

at
all
let
me
give
three
example
of
interest
innovation
example
whale
shark
be
the
large
fish
in
the
world
a
harmless
giant
that
come
to
the
shore
of
gujarat
to
breed
fisherman
use
to
kill
whale
shark
to
save
their
fishing
net
in
a
unique
and
innovative
approach
tata
chemical
brought
about
an
emotional
connect
among
the
fisherman
by
create
association
between
their
cultural
tradition
and
the
fish
this
linkage
be
establish
by
communicate
the
notion
that
since
the
whale
shark
enter
gujarat
water
to
give
birth
to
little
one
they
be
like
daughter
who
come
to
their
mother
s
house
to
give
birth
instead
of
provide
nourishment
to
the
daughter
the
fisherman
be
kill
them
this
unique
and
powerful
message
be
communicate
with
finesse
through
various
medium
street
play
spiritual
leader
school
rally
and
painting
competition
the
behaviour
reverse
and
the
fisherman
start
to
cut
open
their
net
to
release
whale
shark
whenever
they
get
entangle
this
project
touch
the
jury
and
other
participant
emotionally
but
fail
to
win
the
award
example
the
most
critical
area
of
a
large
business
process
outsource
bpo
company
apart
from
the
backbone
of
its
communication
line
be
transportation
of
employee
because
a
bpo
with
its
huge
employee
base
need
to
cater
seamlessly
to
myriad
client
in
multiple
time
zone
across
country
meeting
client
requirement
be
directly
dependent
on
associate
available
as
per
plan
tc
use
to
pick
up
and
drop
its
employee
the
total
commute
time
of
employee
be
very
long
because
they
be
picked
up
early
to
keep
enough
buffer
for
delay
in
the
pickup
process
in
the
administration
and
hr
team
implement
a
new
transport
management
system
that
integrate
vehicle
rout
employee
roster
schedule
and
vehicle
track
system
to
provide
advance
information
to
the
manager
about
delay
and
absenteeism
of
their
employee
who
be
schedule
for
pickup
the
system
have
many
first
it
alert
employee
in
advance
about
the
vehicle
arrival
time
as
in
car
hail
service
have
a
panic
button
inside
the
vehicle
have
built
in
automatic
safety
alert
to
the
control
room
if
there
be
a
lone
woman
employee
in
the
vehicle
etc
all
these
result
in
a
per
cent
increase
in
employee
satisfaction
and
per
cent
reduction
in
employee
pickup
cost
but
fail
to
win
the
award
example
the
jaago
re
campaign
be
present
twice
once
each
in
and
by
the
marketing
and
sale
team
of
tata
global
beverage
the
campaign
be
built
to
establish
emotional
connect
with
the
customer
of
tata
tea
its
objective
be
also
to
elevate
the
position
of
tea
from
a
mere
medium
of
physical
or
mental
rejuvenation
to
a
medium
of
awaken
jaago
re
one
billion
electoral
vote
campaign
be
a
unique
programme
to
awaken
the
youth
towards
their
electoral
right
the
campaign
receive
two
million
visitor
and
the
problem
of
non
receipt
of
voter
id
be
solve
for
over
user
in
jaago
re
be
use
to
awaken
the
people
of
india
against
corruption
both
these
be
path
break
innovation
for
a
tea
company
and
be
do
for
the
first
time
by
a
consumer
product
company
however
it
too
fail
to
win
the
award
it
be
evident
that
innovation
which
be
not
from
the
core
area
fail
to
make
a
mark
when
compare
to
those
from
manufacturing
and
core
operation
there
be
two
way
to
address
this
problem
either
through
the
evaluation
criterion
or
by
separate
the
non
core
innovation
we
do
both
the
previous
chapter
explain
how
the
impact
of
innovation
be
measure
and
assess
use

four

all
of
which
have
equal

the
architecture
of
all
these
award
have
be
depict
in
figure
let
us
start
from
the
left
of
this
figure
and
understand
how
these
award
be
mutually
exclusive
and
collectively
exhaustive
in
encourage
all
employee
to
practise
the

be
at
least
month
away
from
reach
the
customer
and
get
commercialize
it
be
create
because
of
an
insight
gather
during
an
interaction
with
r
d
professional
we
know
that
the
team
constitution
for
innovation
project
change
as
thing
progress
for
some
innovation
project
the
source
of
uniqueness
lie
in
the
technology
developed
by
researcher
and
scientist
in
the
final
stage
of
such
project
when
they
enter
the
commercialization
stage
and
pitch
for
innovation
award
the
team
seldom
include
the
researcher
or
scientist
who
be
instrumental
in
develop
the
technology
doesn
t
this
sound
unfair
why
do
this
happen
after
a
research
team
completes
the
technology
development
it
take
several
month
or
may
be
year
to
successfully
embed
the
technology
into
product
and
service
this
period
be
much
more
if
the
new
product
need
regulatory
approval
or
thorough
test
or
require
a
significant
change
in
customer
buying
and

at
this
stage

marketing
product
application
branding
and
supply
chain
together
they
work
cohesively
to
successfully
commercialize
the
innovation
during
this
time
the
researcher
would
have
move
to
other
project
and
do
not
have
an
active
role
in
this
stage
of
commercialization
and
be
forgotten
they
too
lose
interest
by
then
this
appear
to
be
logical
and
natural
process
with
no
one
at
fault
but
the
researcher
be
lose
out
on
the
recognition
due
to
them
figure

of
award
some
researcher

their
unhappiness
about
not
get
recognize
for
their
work
we
all
know
that
award
be
value
most
if
they
be
give
immediately
after
the
accomplishment
consider
this
we
separate
the
two
key
milestone
for
a
technology
driven
innovation
first
milestone
be
the
time
when
the
technology

as
they
now
stand
a
fair
chance
to
get

immediately
after
the
technology

developed
these
award
unearth
interest
and
relatively
unknown
research
outcome
which
otherwise
could
have
go
unnoticed
in

the
award
also
help

well
alignment
between
the
goal
of

as
they
be

to
distinguish
the
new

from
its

similarly
small

do
not
always
qualify
as
a
new

in
the
mind

similar
challenge

with

of

most
customer
perceive

an

we
have
chosen
not
to

all

to
necessarily
undertake
the

the
scope
of

brand
of
corrugate
steel
roof
sheet
consumer
of
this
brand
steel
be
primarily
base
in
rural
area
typically
a
customer
who
want
to
build
a
roof
for
his
house
either
approach
a
dealer
directly
to

or
contact
a
mason
or
fabricator
who
recommend
him
to
a

after
purchasing

the
customer
approach
a

to
make

customer
be
bother
by

such
as

in

who
constitute

get
optimally
design

manufacture

include
its

at
a

this
greatly
reduce
the

of

who
have

innovation
in
core
process
a
few
example
of
core
process
be
the
credit
approval
process
of
a
financial
service
company
the
manufacturing
process
in
a
steel
company
engine
assembly
in
an
automotive
company
the
housekeep
process
of
a
hotel
company
the
test
and
bug
fix
process
in
a
software
company
etc
the
innovation
in
these
process
dominantly
result
in
reduce
cost
and
improve
efficiency
of
the
process
through
shorten
of
cycle
time
all
lead
to
well
profitability
there
be
a
few
situation
under
which
a
core
process
innovation
result
in
increase
the
revenue
one
classic
example
would
be
of
an
innovation
that
either
reduces
the
cycle
time
of
the
production
process
or
change
the
raw
material
mix
to
increase
the
throughput
of
the
manufacturing
process
thereby
increase
the
overall
production
this
may
result
in
high
sale
assume
there
be
a
demand
unfortunately
even
though
core
process
innovation
result
in
reduce
cost
and
improve
profitability
they
have
limited
visibility
to
the
customer
market
and
other
external
stakeholder
this
be
a
major
reason
why
these
innovation
do
not
contribute
towards
enhance
the
perception
of
a
company
about
its
innovation
capability
if
we
compare
some
of
the
most
innovative
company
globally

there
be
a
total
of
twenty
six
company
in
the
three
list
of
innovative
company
that
indicates
wide
divergence
in
the
method
use
by
three
agency
to
prepare
their
list
on
the
other
hand
there
be
only
twelve
company
in
the
three
list
of
profitable
company
which
indicates
convergence
in
their
method
how
many
company
be
there
in
both
the
list
of
innovative
company
and
profitable
company
only
two
namely
apple
and
samsung
in
the
list
of
innovative
company
some
be
recently
found
they
be
mostly
from
hi
tech
sector
and
be
far
from
achieve
profit
be
the
reverse
true
be
the
most
profitable
company
far
from
be
innovative
the
list
of
most
innovative
company
be
drawn
use
the
perception
of
expert
or
shareholder
market
cap
which
be
the
reason
for
wide
divergence
in
the
list
the
contribution
of
product
and
service
innovation
be
the
high
in
building
this
perception
the
list
of
most
profitable
company
be
objectively
drawn
base
on
the
profit
report
in
p
l
statement
of
the
company
result
in
convergence
of
the
three
list
there
be
no
doubt
that
all
these
profitable
company
would
be
use
innovative
way
and
mean
to
keep
their
cost
low
and
increase
their
profit
many
of
these
innovation
would
be
in
core
process
which
unfortunately
do
not
get
report
in
medium
and
do
not
contribute
in
improve
the
perception
of
shareholder
the
role
of
core
process
innovation
be
critical
for
company
in
country
like
india
that
serve
price
sensitive
market
in
the
develop
economy
when
it
come
to
example
of
core
process
innovation
most
of
us
would
think
of
innovation
that
have
reduce
cost
in
a
manufacturing
set
up
let
me
give
two
small
example
from
service
company
one
result
in
reduce
cost
and
the
other
increase
revenue
example
e
script
be
an
example
of
a
core
process
innovation
in
an
it
company
in
tc
implement
automation
through
software
robot
in
the
bpo
industry
these
robot
carry
out
predefined
task
earlier
do
by
the
associate
the
innovation
save
million
of
dollar
for
tc
during
those
day
by
this
application
be
augment
by
introduce
a
layer
of
artificial
intelligence
machine
learn
and
natural
language
processing
it
won
the
innovation
award
in
example
process
innovation
of
power
utility
company
such
as
tata
power
delhi
distribution
limited
generally
reduce
distribution
loss
which
in
turn
increase
the
revenue
use
of
tamper
proof
electric
meter
reduction
in
cable
and
transformer
fault
reduction
in
billing
error
detect
unauthorized
use
of
electricity
be
some
of
the
example
that
reduce
the
distribution
loss
and
increase
the
revenue
innovation
in
support
process
consider
support
function
such
as
human
resource
information
technology
supply
chain
marketing
sale
finance
and
account
employee
work
in
these
support
function
have
a
much
low
opportunity
to
exhibit
a
high
level
of
uniqueness
and
achieve
an
impact
that
be
comparable
to
those
who
work
in
core
process
and
new
product
development
moreover
innovation
in
these
area
be
typically
base
on
some
simple
and
elegant
idea
that
be
rarely
back
by
science
and
patent
give
below
be
a
few
example
of
innovation
which
could
contribute
in
building
the
self
confidence
of
employee
on
their
innovativeness
but
only
after
these
be
capture
and
recognize
let
me
cite
a
few
example
example
magizinc
be
a
new
type
of
patent
steel
coat
developed
by
tata
steel
europe
it
not
only
offer
well
corrosion
protection
but
also
help
customer
in
easy
processing
of
steel
in
their
factory
the
marketing
team
developed
a
total
cost
of
ownership
scan
tco
scan
that
quantify
the
exact
increase
in
the
customer
s
equipment
uptime
if
they
use
this
steel
this
innovation
enable
the
customer
to
accurately
calculate
the
economic
value
of
switch
from
conventional
steel
to
magizinc
it
lead
to
tata
steel
become
the
only
steel
supplier
in
the
world
to
offer
such
an
innovative
service
for
its
magizinc
product
this
innovation
result
in
the
first
commercial
order
much
ahead
of
competition
example
tc
hire
a
large
number
a
few
thousand
of
fresh
graduate
from
college
campus
every
year
a
typical
campus
recruitment
exercise
at
tc
involve
visit
a
set
of
identify
institute
and
conduct
the
selection
process
the
intensity
of
war
for
talent
at
indian
campus
have
increase
make
it
difficult
to
attract
the
top
talent
tc
hr
take
the
first
big
leap
from
the
traditional
mode
of
recruitment
to
create
an
ecosystem
of
engagement
throughout
the
life
cycle
of
student
and
capture
their
digital
footprint
this
enable
creation
of
leader
board
to
spot
and
map
talent
not
only
do
hr
programme
such
as
campus
commune
academic
interface
codevita
enginx
and
several
others
result
in
reduce
the
recruitment
cost
substantially
they
also
help
in
spot
and
attract
top
talent
a
complete
case
of
hr
innovation
in
tc
be
provide
in
chapter
example
silicomanganese
simn
be
a
critical
ingredient
in
steel
make
and
as
with
other
raw
material
be
be
sell
in
bulk
tata
steel
too
produce
simn
and
decide
to
focus
on
the

this
market
be
plague
with
quality

issue
the

team
brand
simn
and
sell
it

tata
silcomag
be
the
world
s
first
brand
ferro

introduce
through
an
organize

system
this
brought
a
paradigm
shift
pilfer
and
tamper
proof
brand
bag
with
exact
weight
and
product
traceability
be
unheard
of
for
this
type
of
a
product
example
in
the
marketing
and

team
of
tata
global

implement
a
rural

to
think
plan
and
execute
as
they
face
the
most
amount
of

the

the
coal
that
he
found
in
the
warora
mine
be

he
take

if
it
could

the
result
be
unsatisfactory

he
do
not
give
up
he
advertised
in

offering
a

found
some
of
the
answer

of

innovation
quotient
how
do
one
measure
the
innovation
capability
of
an
organization
there
be
various
method
that
people
have
use
in
the
past
market
cap
this
method
look
at
the
difference
between
the
market
cap
and
the
book
value
of
the
stock
the
method
assumes
that
the
perception
of
the
shareholder
about
the
innovation
capability
of
the
company
drive
the
price
of
the
share
and
hence
the
market
cap
while
this
be
the
generally
accepted
method
in
absence
of
a
well
method
it
favour
b
c
company
especially
the
hi
tech
company
in
today
s
world
we
have
explain
in
chapter
that
this
method
doesn
t
often
include
b
b
manufacturing
company
that
might
be
very
innovative
in
their
process
percentage
of
revenue
from
new
product
this
method
indicates
the
agility
of
company
in
successfully
introduce
new
product
or
service
in
the
marketplace
unfortunately
there
be
no
standard
definition
for
this
measure
and
company
define
it
themselves
as
per
their
convenience
and
understand
the
reason
that
make
this
metric
non
comparable
across
company
within
the
industry
and
across
industry
be
described
below
definition
of
new
product
some
company
include
incremental
innovation
in
this
measure
and
others
do
not
an
example
would
be
change
in
packaging
of
a
consumer
product
will
this
qualify
as
a
new
product
similarly
will
a
change
in
the
screen
size
of
a
mobile
phone
qualify
as
a
new
product
since
this
measure
be
define
by
the
company
producer
and
not
by
use
a
standard
definition
or
by
consider
the
view
and
perception
of
consumer
of
innovation
there
be
large
variation
in
what
get
include
and
what
do
not
even
within
the
same
industry
time
period
some
company
measure
the
revenue
from
new
product
introduce
in
the
previous
three
year
while
others
report
this
for
the
previous
two
year
this
variation
amongst
the
company
in
the
same
industry
make
it
difficult
to
compare
them
the
variation
seem
logical
only
if
the
nature
of
industry
change
for
instance
this
period
for
an
automotive
company
could
be
high
as
compare
to
a
financial
service
company
cannibalisation
if
the
new
product
introduce
by
the
company
replaces
an
exist
product
or
influence
revenue
from
an
exist
product
the
negative
effect
should
ideally
be
consider
when
reporting
this
measure
company
do
not
consider
this
negative
impact
which
be
not
a
true
reflection
of
the
innovation
and
hence
not
an
ideal
measure
for
comparison
other
limitation
there
be
some
more
limitation
of
use
this
measure
as
discuss
below
process
innovation
this
measure
of
percentage
revenue
from
new
product
doesn
t
consider
process
innovation
which
mostly
result
in
cost
reduction
and
hence
improvement
in
profit
even
if
one
wish
to
modify
this
measure
to
take
into
account
reduction
in
cost
it
be
not
possible
to
arrive
at
the
annual
number
for
cost
reduction
because
these
be
not
capture
in
any
of
the
current
accounting
system
profitability
the
measure
ignores
profit
or
loss
from
new
product
many
new
product
take
time
before
they
become
profitable
which
discourages
company
to
report
profitability
or
profit
from
product
introduce
in
the
previous
one
two
five
or
even
more
year
we
have
be
able
to
devise
a
unique
method
to
measure
the
innovation
capability
or
innovation
quotient
this
method
could
be
easily
understood
with
the
help
of
an
example
of
a
diamond
merchant
who
buy
rough
diamond
and
employ
people
to
cut
and
polish
them
and
finally
sell
them
at
a
premium
let
us
assume
that
every
week
this
merchant
ass
the
value
of
diamond
process
by
his
people
in
that
week
to

the
approximate

these
two

he
have
found
a
way
to
assign
a

in
a
range
of
to
every

the
number
indicates
the
worth
of
a
diamond
a
high
number
indicates
a
well

for
the

he
do
the
same
assessment
for
the
diamond
process
by
his
people
data
of
week
clearly
show
that
not
only
do
his
people
produce
two
extra
diamond
but
the
overall
quality
also

reflection
most
innovation
should
present
themselves
for
assessment
all
company
participate
and
take
pride
in
showcasing
their
project
in
tata
innovista
our
more
recent
communication
to
people
be
anything
that
make
you
feel
proud
should
find
its
way
into
innovista
despite
this
the
question
remains
do
tata
innovista
capture
all
the
innovation
of
the
company
the
follow
two
observation
give
us
confidence
that
all
the
major
innovation
get
into
tata
innovista
the
overall
participation
have
increase
fifty
time
in
the
last
ten
year
in
these
year
the
number
of

have
increase
from
three
to
fourteen
the
value
derive
from
this
programme
have
prompt
large
company
to
start
a
similar
programme
internally
for
themselves
i
have
briefly
explain
this
towards
the
end
of
this
chapter
in
the
survey
of
cxos
and
others
from
fifty
company
cite
earlier
one
of
the
question
that
we
ask
them
be
what
percentage
of
your
innovation
get
capture
in
tata
innovista
the
average
response
be
per
cent
company
that
report
this
number
to
be
less
than
per

may
not
find
oiq
to
be
a
true
reflection
of
their
innovation
capability
how
accurate
and
authentic
be
the
assessment
as
explain
earlier
the

and
the
knowledge

make
it
very
objective
the
second
dimension
of

be
assess
base
on
the
number
state
by
the
team
to
ensure
the

of
the

impact
a
senior
business
leader
associate
with
every
innovation
validates
the
number

thereby
reduce
the

found
these

of
and
hard
to
believe
in
we
undertook
another
exercise
and
approach
the
team
of
and
who
together
have
claimed
a
return
of
us
billion
the
exercise

carry
out
to
verify
whether
the

if
they
be
found
to
be

what

the
reason
and
how

the

very
close
to

the

indicate
that
the

and
if
possible
use
it
to

we
ask
each

about

we

half
the

let
s
look
at
a
few
example
example
steeljunction
a
retail
store
from
tata
steel
be
conceptualize
in
early
it
won
the
innovista
award
in
steeljunction
be
born
when
focus
on
retail
be
very
high
and
tata
steel
be
already
very
successful
in
the
retail
sector
for
its
steel
rebar
and
steel
sheet
the
objective
of
start
the
retail
brand
be
to
get
tata
steel
into
product
business
especially
those
product
that
would
consume
its
own
steel
it
be
also
an
attempt
to
create
opportunity
to
expose
consumer
to
steel
product
and
increase
the
overall
steel
consumption
steeljunction
be
the
first
foray
of
an
integrate
steel
company
into
upmarket
retail
business
by
steeljunction
succeed
in
manage
the
front
end
attract
customer
import
steel
product
from
china
get
footfall
and
complete
the
first
few
pilot
on
modular
kitchen
after
the
team
have
to
innovate
the
back
end
process
increase
the
range
of
product
by
get
into
innovative
steel
product
such
as
door
steel
gate
grill
modular
kitchen
furniture
such
as
cupboard
and
others
the
management
and
team
have
to
be
patient
in
create
differentiate
supply
chain
after
sale
service
and
a
cost
model
for
consistent
supply
chain
there
be
a
dilemma
between
achieve
break
even
or
achieve
scale
with
the
limited
investment
that
be
approve
for
this
venture
finally
steeljunction
end
up
keep
product
of
other
company
and
brand
it
open
a
few
more
store
but
could
not
continue
to
retain
or
improve
the
uniqueness
through
continuous
release
of
innovative
process
product
and
service
example
dr
sumitesh
da
chief
graphene
technology
in
tata
steel
have
an
interest
story
to
tell
about
the
two
project
that
won
the
tata
innovista
award
in
but
couldn
t
meet
the
projection
they
be
award
base
on
the
promise
they
show
at
the
time
of
presentation
when
we
test
our
hypothesis
that
degradation
of
uniqueness
lead
to
degradation
of
impact
he
say
degradation
of
uniqueness
be
not
applicable
to
project
that
have
not
be
commercialize
yet
until
and
unless
scale
up
be
accomplish
within
a
fix
time
the
difficulty
to
commercialize
increase
exponentially
as
time
pass
there
be
a
degradation
of
perseverance
and
the
killer
instinct
ebb
away
this
be
what
matter
for
the
two
project
that
have
complete
only
their
technical
journey
and
need
to
complete
the
commercialization
process
he
be
obviously
refer
to
the
valley
of
death
in
the
innovation
life
cycle
which
highlight
the
most
difficult
challenge
of
convert
successful
r
d
outcome
into
commercial
use
the
project
of
use
nano
material
in
water
to
improve
its
heat
extraction
property
need
the
work
to
be
do
in
two
area
manufacturing
of
nano
material
and
system
engineering
of
the
heat
exchange
system
that
use
nano
particle
the
innovation
be
complex
and
need
dedicate
team
effort
over
a
sustain
period
sumitesh
told
us
we
be
look
for
internal
sponsor
who
could
help
us
put
together
a
multi
disciplinary
team
drawn
from
engineering
project
procurement
research
and
technology
put
such
a
team
together
becomes
increasingly
difficult
especially
in
case
where
the
distance
between
the
core
subject
of
project
and
the
core
subject
of
the
organization
widens
although
the
pilot
project
have
show
big
opportunity
for
save
energy
and
increase
throughput
of
the
steel
plant
it
struggle
on
both
the
front
manufacturing
nano
material
and
the
engineering
solution
sumitesh
far
say
all
innovation
need
at
least
one
passionate
person
at
the
senior
level
if
the
subject
of
innovation
project
be
not
the
core
aspect
of
the
business
the
chance
of
the
project
fall
apart
increase
if
there
be
no
sponsor
for
see
the
team
through
tough
time
and
help
in
evolve
different
financing
administrative
and
collaboration
option
it
rarely
happens
that
the
team
which
do
wonder
at
the
lab
stage
be
able
to
pull
off
a
similar
show
when
it
come
to
commercialize
the
innovation
this
be
what
exactly
happen
in
case
of
the
other
project
of
hydrogen
harvest
wherein
the
team
try
to
capture
the
hydrogen
generate
as
a
by
product
when
water
be
sprayed
on
the
red
hot
slag
the
team
achieve
a
purity
of
per
cent
when
it
won
the
award
and
show
multimillion
dollar
revenue
from
carbon
credit
unfortunately
as
soon
as
the
core
member
part
way
the
project
stall
the
topic
once
again
be
far
from
the
core
and
have
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
steel
make
business
we
probed
sumitesh
far
to
find
the
reason
for
baton
not
get
hand
over
for
non
core
project
he
say
such
project
germinate
and
progress
only
due
to
the
personal
passion
of
a
senior
leader
and
not
due
to
the
strategic
demand
of
the
company
we
have
learnt
this
and
today
we
have
a
sponsor
or
a
mentor
who
have
be
able
to
put
together
a
multidisciplinary
team
the
sponsor
be
able
to
rope
in
different
stakeholder
both
financially
and
administratively
so
that
the
time
to
commercialize
be
reduce
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
hopefully
with
the
graphene
business
we
will
cross
the
bridge
hence
instead
of
degradation
of
novelty
applicable
to
the
performance
of
project
that
have
begin
commercialization
it
be
the
degradation
of
perseverance
and
killer
instinct
that
matter
for
project
that
need
to
jump
the
valley
of
death
large
the
distance
between
the
subject
of
innovation
and
the
core
subject
of
the
organization
high
be
the
chance
of
degradation
in
killer
instinct
and
perseverance
and
high
be
the
need
for
leadership
involvement
example
after
spending
more
than
two
year
study
the
small

medium
business
smbs

plus
educational

start
use
this
in
the
very
first

it
start
with
around
thirty
five
solution

instance
that
reduce
the
cost
to

tc
and
offer
well
pricing
to
customer
it
be
the
first
integrate
solution
meant
for
smbs
and
be
available
through
the
public
cloud
in
multiple

this
be

the

either

manish
say
the
mentor
should
have
a
high
level
of
trust
in
the

and
should
continuously
evaluate
the

without

to
dilute
the

scope

lose

of
the

goal
that

decide
at

to
maintain

the
uniqueness
of
the

the

felt
that
the

of
a

who
would
safeguard
the
team
in

of

this
point
be

elaborate
in

arup
summarize
the
role
of
the

stay
on
course
be
the
key
challenge
especially
since
disruption
occur
frequently
impact
all
the
current
assumption
he
far
add
the
mentor
need
to
ensure
that
the
quantum
of
benefit
from
the
innovation
project
be
explicitly
built
into
the
long
term
financial
projection
of

an
analysis

the
people
involve
in

either
of
the
extreme
for
these
two
type
of
participant
be
not
good
for
the
programme
a
high
percentage
of
first

be
indicative
of
a
programme
low
in

and
unable
to
retain
interest
among
the
participant
similarly
a
very
high
percentage
of
repeat
user
would
indicate
that
the

be
not

to
meet
its

create

the
right
way
for
this

the
next
question
we
want
to
explore

what

award
one

to

the
answer
to
this
question
why
do
some
people

would
have
give
insight
into
the

movement
second

who
would

fifty
nine

very
unlike

he
played
an

role
similar
to
that
of

on
twenty
three
occasion

have
reach
the
final
of

five
time
he
believe
that
if

start
criticize

it
be
likely
that
the

and
the
associate
opportunity
be
good
this
be
an

view
and
we
probed
him
for
an
example
he
explain
quick
start
be
such
an
idea
and
everyone
say
it
be
not
possible
and
that
the
sardar
the
common
parlance
for
a
sikh
which
gurmit
be
have
go
crazy
i
pursue
the

cajole
my

to
try
it
out
we
spoke
to
a
few
of
his
subordinate

that
once
he
back
the

they
do
not
have
to
worry
about
the
failure
as
long
as

backing
them
up
he

his

then
help
them
remove
the
roadblock
and
maintain
the

then
be
if

they
be
not

who
help
them
with

discus
this

the
chapter
intrinsic
attribute
that
make
people
serial
innovator
our
research
uncovered
a
few
distinct
behavioural
pattern
intrinsic
to
serial
innovator
these
be
discuss
below
innovator
thrive
on
new
problem
they
do
not
hesitate
to
apply
creativity
to
solve
them
all
manager
love
problem
but
only
those
they
have
be
train
to
solve
new
problem
be
unpopular
amongst
most
manager
because
they
do
not
like
failure
and
prefer
to
be
see
as
a
reliable
manager
dr
harrick
vin
then
vice
president
tc
learnt
from
prof
edsger
dijkstra
a
turing
award
winner
the
difference
between
a
good
and
great
scientist
he
say
it
be
not
in
their
ability
to
solve
a
problem
but
their
ability
to
select
the
problem
to
solve
harrick
believe
that
innovator
should
solve
those
problem
that
be
likely
to
get
aggravate
over
time
he
learnt
this
from
one
of
his
innovation
that
enable
transfer
of
video
file
over
low
bandwidth
network
over
a
period
the
bandwidth
become
abundant
make
his
innovation
redundant
he
believe
that
in
this
digital
world
innovator
should
solve
the
problem
of
harness
abundance
not
manage
constraint
ability
to
observe
people
spot
the
problem
and
visualize
it
be
another
strength
of
serial
innovator
sanjay
told
us
i
find
it
easy
to
spot
problem
and
give
it
a
grand
vision
my
team
help
me
solve
the
problem
and
in
this
process
we
have
file
forty
patent
out
of
which
nine
have
be
grant
the
project
mkrishi
in
which
he
be
a
key
member
have
touch
more
than
a
million
farmer
by
talk
about
the
project
he
say
i
built
the
platform
ground
up
deployed
it
in
the
field
and
make
sure
that
it
touch
the
life
of
farmer
in
positive
way
we
get
many
award
but
the
most
important
reward
be
when
one
farmer
call
say
that
it
be
his
last
call
and
he
want
to
die
people
on
ground
immediately
connect
with
him
solve
his
issue
and
save
his
life
sanjay
felt
that
most
ideators
or
innovator
be
not
able
to
give
a
grand
vision
to
the
challenge
and
this
be
an
important
aspect
where
senior
leader
could
provide
support
successful
innovator
have
a
deep
passion
to
objectively
extract
the
root
cause
before
jumping
to
a
solution
suman
biswas
of
tata
steel
knew
that
the
problem
of
high
cost
of
produce
super
ductile
steel
be
due
to
the
expensive
alloy
material
use
in
manufacturing
expert
felt
that
the
use
of
alloy
element
be
necessary
to
provide
the
require
strength
to
steel
suman
and
team
analyse
the
problem
in
depth
and
believe
that
redesign
the
process
of
make
the
final
product
rebars
would
give
it
the
necessary
strength
even
in
the
absence
of
expensive
alloy
element
the
team
do
a
quiet
trial
and
produce
super
ductile
rebars
but
sell
them
as
normal
rebars
to
avoid
the
formal
approval
process
there
be
no
loss
to
anyone
from
this
experiment
as
the
customer
receive
well
rebars
at
the
cost
of
normal
rebars
the
team
continued
with
the
experiment
for
another
month
and
establish
the
consistency
of
the
product
after
a
month
say
suman
we
present
it
in
the
leadership
meeting
everyone
immediately
knew
that
this
would
save
a
few
million
dollar

of
their

we
far
probed
them
on
five

from
our

be
the

of

about
their

which
in

suggests
their

have
high
level
of

determination
and
perseverance
in
the
previous
chapter
we
learnt
that
impactful
innovative
idea
have
longer
gestation
period
such
idea
be
complex
and
require
active
involvement
of
multiple
agency
over
a
longer
period
of
time
to
successfully
complete
the
implementation
a
high
level
of
determination
be
need
to
execute
an
outlandish
idea
v
hariharan
of
tata
motor
say
i
have
a
mad
obsession
to
take
ahead
the
idea
despite
many
roadblock
he
felt
that
this
obsession
be
necessary
because
for
every
supporter
for
an
out
of
the
box
idea
there
be
ten
adversary
after
much
persuasion
hariharan
be
successful
in
convincing
his
colleague
to
use
an
expensive
grade
of
steel
that
save
processing
time
in
the
factory
he
proudly
say
now
this
steel
and
method
be
be
use
in
most
light
and
medium
commercial
vehicle
for
an

of
the
night
shift
when
i
be
responsible
for
the

i
try
a

so
much
that
i
carry
out
the

itself
it
be
successful
and

recall
a
night
shift
in
when
he
be
solely
responsible
for
the
shift
he
say
suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
to
modify
the
design
of
the
internal
machinery
of
the
wristwatch
i
sat
the
whole
night
and
design
it
completely
my

be
not
keen
on
this
idea
as
he
want
me
to
focus
on
something
else
i
try
hard
to
get
a
prototype
manufacture
to
convince
my
senior
i
show
the
design
to
my
colleague
who
all
like
the
idea
the
news
about
my
idea
and
my
attempt
to
get
a
prototype
spread
for
a
month
until
one
fine
day
the
head
of
manufacturing
call
me
he
too
like
the
idea
and
within
two
day
the
prototype
be
make
and
show
to
the
manage
director
the
result
be
an

calibre
hybrid

that
have
not
only
save
several
million
dollar
for
titan
until
now
but
also
double
the
capacity
of
the

vividly
remembers
the
senior
member
of

with
over
thirty

or
mentor
the

from
his
department
to
reach
the
final
five
time
out
of
which
they
won
twice
say
i
never
give
up
i
be
still
push
for
some
innovation
for
over
a
decade
in
their
book

by
choice
jim
collins
and
morten
t
hansen
found
that
empirical
creativity
be
one
of
the
factor
that
make
a
company
great
by
empirical
the
author
meant
rely
upon
direct
observation
by
conduct
practical
experiment
and
engage
directly
with
evidence
rather
than
rely
upon
opinion
whim
and
conventional
wisdom
david
exhibit
this
trait
when
he
add
my
learn
style
be
theoretical
pragmatist
theory
always
come
first
and
if
it
s
theoretically
possible
then
no
matter
how
challenge
it
inspires
me
he
believe
that
determination
could
be
single
out
as
a
key
attribute
because
if
one
see
pioneer
through
the
prism
of
history
they
be
almost
never
welcome
at
the
time
when
they
be
pioneer
they
be
usually
fear
mocked
or
revile
and
sadly
that
remains
true
even
today
external
factor
that
make
people
serial
innovator
we
ask
every
serial
innovator
to
imagine
that
they
have
be
move
to
another
company
with
an
expectation
that
they
would
continue
to
innovate
most
innovator
be
delighted
to
hear
of
such
an
opportunity
as
they
believe
that
the
new
place
would
be
easy
to
find
unsolved
problem
we
also
ask
about
the
factor
and
condition
that
would
enable
them
to
innovate
in
the
new
place
the
response
reveal
that
the
role
of
people
around
the
innovator
at
the
workplace
have
the
most
influence
the
influence
of
people
during
the
upbringing
of
innovator
from
an
early
childhood
to
adulthood
didn
t
come
out
as
important
the
role
of
school
friend
college
and

be
also
much
low
on

the

of

as
most
significant
by

follow
by
that
of
subordinate
figure
factor
that
influence
serial
innovator
innovator
prefer
manager

who
demand
innovation
and
give
freedom
to

innovation
need
people
to
experiment
many
of
these
experiment
fail
innovator
hate
be
shackle
or
prevent
from
do
experiment
they
need
confidence
that
they
would
not
get
penalize
for
fail
experiment
their
manager
give
this
assurance
only
if
they
believe
and
accept
that
they
have
problem
and
challenge
which
need
to
be
solve
and
can
be
solve
only
if

to

the

and
now
the

he
say
ravi
influence
me
the
most
and
always
drove
me
to
do
something

he
kept
push
the

and
never
allow
me
to
be
complacent
by
provide

narrate
an

example
the
deaerate
tank
that
hold
cool
fluid
be
make
of
metal
and
use
to
leak
after
a
few
year
truck
driver
fleet
owner
and
mechanic
have
learnt
to
live
with
the
problem
by
weld
the
leak
tank
we
introduce
a
plastic
tank
that
reduce
the
weight
and
become
popular
in
the
market
it
work
well
for
several
thousand
kilometre
but
then
it
too
start
leak
from
the
weld
joint
unlike
metal
tank
plastic
tank
couldn
t
be
repair
ravi
push
us
and
ask
us
to
make
a
plastic
tank
that
do
not
have
a
weld
joint
it
be
impossible
to
think
at
that
time
and
no
one
take
it
seriously
he
kept
push
and
after
a
lot
persuasion
we
carry
out
several
experiment
involve
new
material
finally
we
be
able
to
make
the
first
ever
plastic
tank
for
the
cool
fluid
with
no
joint
there
have
be
zero
failure
in
the
last
five
year
and
we
now
sell
it
to
several
automotive
company
subhashis
kundu
subhashis
head
operation
h
blast

tata
steel
spoke
excitedly
about
his
bos
uttam
singh
he
say
we
be
operating
our
blast
furnace
at
a
very
high
coke
rate
of
more
than
kg
per
tonne
with
two
year
of
experiment
we
reduce
the
coke
rate
by
more
than
kg
per
tonne
this
have
a
substantial
impact
on
our
bottom
line
uttam
himself
conduct
two
workshop
to
generate
idea
and
encourage
us
to
carry
out
experiment
he
be
not
the
one
like
many
others
who
would
ask
the
ideator
to
execute
his
idea
he
will
find
the
best
person
to
execute
good
idea
conduct
experiment
in
blast
furnace
be
consider
extremely
risky
so
we
ask
subhashis
about
it
he
explain
if
we
fail
uttam
take
the
full
blame
there
have

which
be
acceptable
to
my
manager
a
very
interest
difference
between
serial
innovator
and
non

be
the
high
inclination
of
serial
innovator
to
rely
on
their
bos
as
a
source
of
support
or

an

which
be
the

of
the

in
a

a

he
explain
that
unless
the

yes
he
can
provide

engage
with
the

very
closely
which
be
very
rare
and
not
consider
to
be
a
good
management
style
v
nellaiyappan
of
titan
have
a
story
that
go
back
to
when
he
have
complete
a
mere
three
year
in
titan
he
design
a
world
time
watch
which
also
result
in
the
first
patent
for
titan
he
show
the
design
to
his
bos
j
shivaswamy
who
like
the
design
and
immediately
arrange
a
meeting
with
xerxes
desai
then
manage
director
of
titan
for
the
very
next
day
and
ask
nellaiyappan
to
go
alone
for
the
meeting
desai
heard
him
look
at
the
design
keenly
and
like
it
very
much
eighteen
year
have
pass
and
nellaiyappan
still
get
emotional
about
the
inspiration
that
shivaswamy
have
provide
t
v
narendran
summarize
this
point
there
be
individual
at
tata
steel
who
have
present
their
case
multiple
time
at
tata
innovista
and
even
won
multiple
award
typically
they
be
also
high
performer
in
the
organization
the
basic
premise
however
remains
that
the
department
they
operate
in
provide
them
the
opportunity
and
atmosphere
to
engage
on
such
project

it
come
to
innovation
bos
subordinate
hunt
in
pair
the
analysis
of
serial
innovator
show
that
there
be
several
bos
subordinate
pair
who
innovate
regularly
there
be
a
few
serial
innovator
who
have
a
common
bos
who
challenged
them
give
freedom
and
inspire
them
to
innovate
in
some
case
a
serial

more
than
seventeen
year
with
the
watch
division
be
transfer
to
the
jewellery
division
of
titan
he
felt
he
get
transform
completely
in
the
new
division
only
because
of
his
bos
l
r
natarajan

he
say

always
challenged
the
obvious
he
use
to
give

job
which
could
not
be
carry
out
in
normal
way
but
give
us
the
freedom
to
experiment
without
be
prescriptive
he
support
us
by

as

school
of

where
we
learnt
new
tool
to

differentiate
between

who
seek
innovation
and
boss

drive
improvement
vijayakumar
make
a
very
insightful
comment

who
encourage
their
people
get
improvement
but
the
boss
who
inspire
and
enable
their
people

elaborate
he
put

to
do
thing
that
be
align
to
the
organizational

and
not
for
the
sake
of

he
get
the
best
out
of

something
special
in
him

another

jayakumar
angappan
senior
manager
titan
who
have
participate
in
innovista
for
eight
year
jayakumar
be
proud
of
his
innovation
that
treble
the
productivity
of
machine
surprising
even
the
swiss
manufacturer
he
spoke
about
the
major
contribution
of
seeni
he
consistently
give
well
thought
out
stretch
goal
and
challenge
that
emerge
from
his
knowledge
about
the
organization
we
threw
a
relatively
difficult
question
at
jayakumar
if
a
new
bos
come
who
doesn
t
throw
challenge
and
doesn
t
support
his
people
will
you
feel
suffocate
and
what
would
you
do
he
have
an
interest
answer
with
so
many
year
everyone
in
titan
now
know
how
to
identify
challenge
and
make
progress
in
such
a
situation
if
the
new
bos
doesn
t
change
himself
it
will
be
he
who
will
feel
suffocate
another
example
of
s
d
katariya
from
tata
motor
clearly
show
that
he
be
a
prolific
innovator
between
the
year
and
during
which
he
accomplish
more
than
per
cent
of
his
innovation
explain
the
reason
he
say
i
have
a
like
mind
person
in
my
team
in
this
period
and
we
together
use
to
challenge
and
fight
for
our
idea
that
person
left
the
company
in
this
example
reinforce
the
importance
of
bos
subordinate
pair
in
think
planning
and
implement
innovation
we
know
what
make
people
innovate
but
why
do
they
participate
in
innovation
award
the
above
discussion
explain
the
intrinsic
attribute
and
external
circumstance
that
influence
a
person
to
emerge
as
a
serial
innovator
we
be
now
left
behind
with
the
second
part
of
the
question
that
we
have
raise
at
the
begin
of
this
chapter
why
do
innovator
participate
in
innovista
in
our
survey
of
cxos
and
those
who
directly
report
to
them
we
ask
them
about
the
workplace
performance
of
people
who
participate
in
tata
innovista
the
analysis
indicate
that
per
cent
of
the
participant
be
high
performer
who
have
receive
a
rating
of
above
average
or
much
above
average
in
their
performance
appraisal
the
cxos
felt
that
almost
half
the
participant
be
in
the
rise
phase
of
their
career
trajectory
at
the
time
of
participation
this
indicate
the
popularity
or
attractiveness
of
the
programme
in
the
mind
of
high
perform
employee
this
information
sharpen
our
research
question
why
do
innovator
or
high
perform
employee
bother
to
participate
in
innovista
innovista
be
a

from

the
picture
with
him
be
a

energy
whenever

that
be
one
of
the

anyone
who

the
kind
of

we
get
within

it
gain

this
be

as
we

that
most

would
result
in

reduction
in

have
explain

that

a
key
factor
that

this
uniqueness
in

must
be
first
see
from
the
eye
of
the

follow
by
the
perspective
of
producer
for
a
global
first
innovation
to

it
should
be
relevant

innovation
explain

be
view
as
incremental
by

however
for
the
customer
of

these
may
be
unique
enough
to
make
them
buy
happily
either
because
it
would
have
be
well
in
performance
or
it
might
be
convenient
to
buy
or
consume
some
innovation
may
be
view
as
incremental
at
the
time
when
they
happen
but
soon
they
become
a
springboard
for
several
incremental
or
breakthrough
innovation
create
a
market
for
an
innovation
could
take
month
or
even
year
the
reason
for
this

not

could

that
find

problem
be

more
difficult

the

also
highlight
that
a

can
deliver
big

two
example
from

please
note
that
the
problem

once
discover
by

seem
to
be
obvious
to
others
very
soon
in
such

even

excellent
result

figure

face
a

the
above

shift
the

it
be
very
likely
that
the

for
many
of
our
problem
already
exist
in
some
corner
of
the
world
maybe
in
different
form
in
unrelated
industry
our
early
success
with
the
pilot
on
tata
innoverse
make
us
believe
that
a
large
percentage
of
innovation
especially
from
large
company
would
soon
have
some
flavour
of
open
innovation
i
also
believe
that
india
would
become
a
very
fertile
ground
for
practise
open
innovation
because
of
its
improve
ecosystem
of
start
ups
that
be
develop
cut
edge
technology
and
look
at
establish
company
to
demonstrate
their
solution
an
institutionalize
open
innovation
system
of
a
large
conglomerate
or
company
could
be
extend
to
its
customer
which
would
take
the
mutual
relationship
at
a
strategic
level
and
also
serve
as
a
differentiator
there
have
be
a
rapid
growth
in
the
social
sector
start
ups
and
social
entrepreneur
support
by
various
government

try
hard
to
make
a
genuine
difference
the
mandatory

need
to
partly
unlearn
their
proclivity
of
donate
money
to
provide
immediate
and
temporary
relief
many
problem
that
the

face
be
similar
across

csr
department
of
corporates
innovate
their
own
solution
to
tackle
the
problem
locally
a
programme
like
tata
innovista
could
increase
the
share
of
strategic
innovation
and
also
help
spot
the
best
solution
for
a
give
social
problem
in
a
particular
situation
by
use
the
basic
knowledge

all
new

could
be
deployed
in
all
other
relevant
place
and
drive
efficiency
in
capital
allocation
for
social
impact
project
i
have
show
in
chapter
that
the
gestation
period
of
innovation
project
have
a
considerable
influence
on
their
overall
quality
in
term
of
impact
how
do
we
encourage
senior
manager
to
have
a
good
mix
of
innovation
project
from
the
perspective
of
gestation
period
how
about
create
award
base
on
gestation
period
this
mean
that
innovation
project
that
have
a
gestation
period
of
less
than
one
year
could
compete
together
and
those
that
have
a
gestation
period
of
year
would
be
bunch
together
similarly
project
that
have
a
longer
gestation
period
of
say
more
than
five
year
would
vie
for
an
award
amongst
themselves
the
subject
of
knowledge
management
couldn
t
take
off
after
the
initial
excitement
mainly
because
it
fail
at
the
very
first
step
of
capture
new
knowledge
of
people
there
be
less
motivation
for
employee
to
share
their
new
knowledge
for
a
purpose
that
be
not
time
bound
and
whose
outcome
be
largely
intangible
moreover
the
definition
of
new
knowledge
be
as
nebulous
as
new
product
explain
in
chapter
this
programme
have
prove
that
a
competition
or
tournament
be
an
effective
way
to
capture
the
newly
generate
knowledge
in
the
form
of
innovation
attempt
once
the
innovation
be
capture
these
could
be
horizontally
deployed
within
and
across
the
business
unit
function
geography
and
product
family
therefore
if
a
km
programme
be
built
on
the
superstructure
of
a
programme
like
innovista
the
chance
of
its
success
be
high
finally
i
believe
that
the
transformation
would
take
the
next
big
leap
if
cxos
identify
and
own
a
portfolio
of
innovation
project
ensure
a
good
mix
of
big
and
small
short
and
long
term
incremental
and
disruptive
invest
in
them
track
them
and
hold
themselves
accountable
for
resourcing
the
project
appropriately
and
not
starve
them
i
believe
this
would
create
the
most
desirable
environment
for
disruptive
innovation
that
typically
exists
in
the
start
ups
and
impart
more
certainty
to
the
process
of
create
long
term
value
such
musing
seem
to
be
justified
when
i
read
the
recent
thought
of
ratan
tata
on
innovation
there
be
many
successful
traditional
company
which
be
know
for
their
excellence
in
execution
and
be
consider
to
be
the
gold
standard
in
the
sector
they
operate
but
there
be
also
company
that
be
driven
to
make
a
difference
by
question
the
unquestioned
and
develop
out
of
the
box
solution
to
meet
market
demand
it
be
these
less
traditional
company
that
excite
the
marketplace
through
their
elegant
solution
and
technological
leadership
these
be
the
company
that
create
an
environment
of
mental
freedom
to
dream
and
to
innovate
these
be
the
company
that
attract
and
retain
employee
who
inspire
each
other
to
find
well
solution
to
exist
problem
these
be
the
excite
company
of
tomorrow
driven
by
a
culture
that
encourages
innovation
and
reward
new
concept
and
solution
these
innovative
company
be
those
who
believe
that
nothing
be
impossible
