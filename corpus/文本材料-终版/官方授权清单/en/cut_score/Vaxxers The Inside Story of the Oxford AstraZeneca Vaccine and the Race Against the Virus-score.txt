the	4.98

neatly	-1
solve	6.58

chimpanzee	-1
that	4.94

infect	-1
human	6.26
and	5.22
give	6.54
them	4.92
a	5.24

because	5.0
human	6.26

so	5.08
we	6.38

the	4.98

we	6.38

t	4.84
actually	5.3
have	5.82
enough	5.46

to	4.98
do	5.76
that	4.94
and	5.22
i	5.92
could	5.52
see	6.06
that	4.94
this	5.06
be	5.68
potentially	5.96
important	6.32
but	4.24
the	4.98

in	5.5

this	5.06

can	5.62
be	5.68
so	5.08
we	6.38
decide	5.84
that	4.94
we	6.38
just	5.76
have	5.82
to	4.98

it	5.02
strike	3.96
me	6.58
that	4.94
there	5.1

vaccine	-1
development	6.38
similarly	5.98
i	5.92
be	5.68
already	5.28
pretty	7.32
confident	7.1
in	5.5
january	5.7
that	4.94
we	6.38
have	5.82
design	6.32
a	5.24
vaccine	-1
against	3.4
the	4.98
novel	6.68
coronavirus	-1
that	4.94
would	5.38
be	5.68

effective	6.76

we	6.38
couldn	4.49
t	4.84
just	5.76
assume	4.72
that	4.94
my	6.16
hypothesis	5.72
would	5.38
have	5.82
to	4.98
be	5.68
test	4.06

bad	2.64
case	5.02
scenario	-1
like	7.22
a	5.24

that	4.94
be	5.68
not	3.86
safe	7.04
rule	4.52
out	4.62
and	5.22
again	5.42
that	4.94
would	5.38
unfortunately	2.76
take	5.18
time	5.74
how	4.68
much	5.74
time	5.74

i	5.92
knew	5.94
it	5.02
would	5.38
be	5.68
several	5.66
week	5.08

we	6.38

meanwhile	5.28
it	5.02
be	5.68
become	5.7
clearer	6.3
to	4.98
me	6.58
every	5.64

as	5.22
the	4.98

spread	5.48
across	4.94
the	4.98

at	4.9
unprecedented	-1

that	4.94
we	6.38

even	5.58

really	5.84
it	5.02
be	5.68

what	4.8
we	6.38
need	4.84
in	5.5
normal	5.98

we	6.38
would	5.38
have	5.82
an	4.84

for	5.22
a	5.24

only	4.92

the	4.98

probably	5.64
about	5.16
a	5.24

some	5.02

will	6.02
contain	5.7

we	6.38

so	5.08
on	5.56
after	5.08

by	4.98
february	5.08
nearly	5.26

this	5.06

to	4.98
make	6.0
the	4.98

you	6.24

into	5.04
the	4.98

when	4.96
we	6.38

that	4.94

a	5.24

for	5.22
large	6.06

manufacturing	5.66
you	6.24

too	5.22
much	5.74

instead	4.92
we	6.38

no	3.48
one	5.4

to	4.98
do	5.76
it	5.02
be	5.68
late	3.46
at	4.9
night	6.22
so	5.08
we	6.38
agree	6.7
that	4.94
we	6.38
should	5.24
put	5.04
everything	5.96
safely	6.96
in	5.5
the	4.98
fridge	6.02
everyone	6.12
should	5.24
go	5.54
home	7.14
and	5.22
try	6.02
to	4.98
get	5.92
some	5.02
sleep	7.16
and	5.22
we	6.38
would	5.38
approach	5.94
it	5.02
with	5.72

brain	6.52
in	5.5
the	4.98
morning	6.56
the	4.98
next	5.62
morning	6.56
we	6.38
collect	5.66
all	6.22
the	4.98
material	5.62
and	5.22
ran	5.5
some	5.02

we	6.38
spent	4.76
the	4.98
rest	7.18
of	4.94
the	4.98
day	6.24
try	6.02
to	4.98
work	5.24
out	4.62
whether	4.92
there	5.1
be	5.68
some	5.02

to	4.98
salvage	-1
something	5.0

we	6.38
have	5.82

by	4.98
the	4.98
even	5.58
it	5.02
be	5.68
clear	6.3
that	4.94
it	5.02
be	5.68
hopeless	2.56
our	6.08
best	7.18

be	5.68
that	4.94

be	5.68
accidentally	3.98
discard	-1
i	5.92
don	4.98
t	4.84
think	6.2
i	5.92
can	5.62
explain	5.46
how	4.68
awful	2.92
this	5.06
felt	5.48
for	5.22
the	4.98
team	6.26
they	5.62
knew	5.94
how	4.68
important	6.32
this	5.06
be	5.68
and	5.22
they	5.62
felt	5.48
personally	5.9
responsible	5.8
for	5.22
the	4.98
failure	2.06
that	4.94
night	6.22
i	5.92
give	6.54
everyone	6.12
a	5.24
pep	-1
talk	6.06
they	5.62
have	5.82
already	5.28
do	5.76
one	5.4
impossible	2.9
thing	5.58
i	5.92
told	5.08
them	4.92
create	6.82
the	4.98

be	5.68
just	5.76
too	5.22
much	5.74
even	5.58
to	4.98
have	5.82
try	6.02
be	5.68
enough	5.46
i	5.92
remind	5.32
them	4.92
as	5.22
well	6.68
that	4.94
it	5.02
be	5.68

the	4.98

if	4.66
we	6.38
have	5.82
just	5.76
go	5.54
all	6.22

for	5.22
the	4.98

and	5.22
the	4.98
one	5.4

yes	6.74
this	5.06
run	5.48
have	5.82
not	3.86
be	5.68
successful	8.16
and	5.22
yes	6.74
we	6.38
have	5.82
lose	2.76

we	6.38
hadn	4.52
t	4.84
lose	2.76

that	4.94
we	6.38

however	4.7
in	5.5

than	4.74
advent	-1
we	6.38
change	5.56
the	4.98

make	6.0
a	5.24
first	6.82

at	4.9
the	4.98

we	6.38
design	6.32
the	4.98

it	5.02
seem	5.24
right	6.54
from	5.18
a	5.24
safety	6.18
point	5.42
of	4.94
view	5.72
to	4.98
take	5.18
the	4.98

and	5.22
expand	6.04
from	5.18
there	5.1
we	6.38
also	5.42
thought	6.38
a	5.24
lot	5.78
about	5.16
whether	4.92
we	6.38
would	5.38
test	4.06

the	4.98
advantage	6.84
of	4.94
a	5.24
one	5.4

vaccine	-1
be	5.68
obvious	5.64
in	5.5
a	5.24
pandemic	-1
we	6.38
want	5.7
to	4.98
see	6.06
rapid	5.8
protection	6.56
after	5.08
vaccination	-1
without	3.54

wait	3.74
until	4.94
a	5.24
second	5.38
dose	4.56
be	5.68
give	6.54
we	6.38
do	5.76
start	6.1
out	4.62
planning	6.16
a	5.24
one	5.4
dose	4.56
vaccine	-1
at	4.9
this	5.06
point	5.42
we	6.38
thought	6.38
we	6.38
be	5.68
make	6.0
an	4.84
outbreak	-1
vaccine	-1
to	4.98
contain	5.7
the	4.98
spread	5.48
of	4.94
disease	2.0
as	5.22
quickly	5.82
as	5.22
possible	6.24
and	5.22
we	6.38
knew	5.94
from	5.18
previous	4.88
trial	3.96
of	4.94
other	5.04
vaccine	-1
on	5.56
the	4.98
platform	5.16
that	4.94
chadox	-1
would	5.38
result	6.0
in	5.5
strong	7.06
immune	-1
response	5.68
after	5.08
just	5.76
one	5.4
dose	4.56
however	4.7
we	6.38
also	5.42
give	6.54
a	5.24
small	4.52
number	5.3
of	4.94
people	6.16
in	5.5
our	6.08
phase	5.06
i	5.92
trial	3.96
two	5.4
dos	5.16
four	5.2
week	5.08
apart	3.52
why	4.98
because	5.0
we	6.38
be	5.68
scientist	6.18
and	5.22
so	5.08
our	6.08
instinct	-1
be	5.68
to	4.98
try	6.02
to	4.98
find	6.0
thing	5.58
out	4.62
and	5.22
because	5.0
there	5.1
be	5.68
so	5.08
much	5.74
uncertainty	3.64
at	4.9
that	4.94
point	5.42
it	5.02
make	6.0

to	4.98
keep	5.86
our	6.08

the	4.98
time	5.74
we	6.38
start	6.1
to	4.98
get	5.92

that	4.94
those	4.94

in	5.5
these	5.1

it	5.02

possible	6.24
that	4.94

a	5.24

we	6.38

you	6.24
take	5.18
it	5.02
i	5.92
say	5.54
that	4.94
i	5.92

the	4.98

of	4.94
the	4.98

but	4.24
i	5.92
would	5.38
be	5.68
encourage	6.9
my	6.16
parent	7.04
to	4.98
accept	6.42
a	5.24

from	5.18

as	5.22
soon	6.34
as	5.22
it	5.02

as	5.22
i	5.92
be	5.68

one	5.4
i	5.92
would	5.38
do	5.76
the	4.98
same	5.36
the	4.98
point	5.42
of	4.94
vaccination	-1
be	5.68
not	3.86
just	5.76
to	4.98
protect	6.8
me	6.58
but	4.24
to	4.98
protect	6.8
the	4.98
vulnerable	3.34
in	5.5
the	4.98
community	6.28
and	5.22
i	5.92
would	5.38
always	6.48
want	5.7
to	4.98
assist	6.42
with	5.72
that	4.94
afterwards	5.76
the	4.98
team	6.26
come	5.82
to	4.98
do	5.76
a	5.24
morning	6.56
of	4.94
film	6.56
at	4.9
the	4.98
cbf	-1
during	5.2
the	4.98
actual	5.48
manufacturing	5.66
of	4.94
the	4.98
vaccine	-1
earlier	5.4
in	5.5
the	4.98
year	5.38
i	5.92
hadn	4.52
t	4.84
allow	6.0
any	5.22
camera	6.8
crew	5.6
in	5.5
as	5.22
we	6.38
have	5.82
to	4.98
work	5.24
in	5.5
a	5.24
very	6.12
clean	6.9
and	5.22
regulate	-1
way	5.24
and	5.22
it	5.02
isn	4.86
t	4.84
easy	6.76
to	4.98
sterilise	-1
a	5.24
camera	6.8
but	4.24
now	5.9
we	6.38
be	5.68
between	5.1
manufacturing	5.66
campaign	5.34
and	5.22
slightly	4.8
less	4.1
busy	4.58
so	5.08
although	4.58
it	5.02
be	5.68
a	5.24
disruption	-1
i	5.92
give	6.54
it	5.02
the	4.98
ok	5.94
my	6.16
daughter	7.04
ellie	-1
be	5.68
normally	5.5
very	6.12
keen	-1
to	4.98
stay	5.56
up	6.14
past	4.62
nine	5.42
o	4.96
clock	5.62
especially	6.16
if	4.66
tv	6.7
be	5.68
involve	5.8
but	4.24
a	5.24
couple	7.3
of	4.94
week	5.08
later	4.6
when	4.96
i	5.92
say	5.54
she	6.18
be	5.68
allow	6.0
to	4.98
stay	5.56
up	6.14
because	5.0
mum	6.7
be	5.68
go	5.54
to	4.98
be	5.68
on	5.56
tv	6.7
talk	6.06
about	5.16
make	6.0
vaccine	-1
she	6.18
seem	5.24
less	4.1
than	4.74
impressed	7.24
however	4.7
it	5.02
be	5.68
testament	5.4
to	4.98
the	4.98
producer	5.88
that	4.94
right	6.54
from	5.18
the	4.98
first	6.82
she	6.18
be	5.68
hooked	4.94
not	3.86
because	5.0
i	5.92
be	5.68
on	5.56
whatever	4.58
but	4.24
this	5.06
be	5.68
the	4.98
first	6.82
time	5.74
she	6.18
have	5.82
see	6.06
the	4.98
number	5.3
of	4.94
case	5.02
and	5.22
death	1.54
around	5.62
the	4.98
world	6.52
so	5.08
vividly	-1
and	5.22
clearly	6.18
portrayed	-1
i	5.92
think	6.2
it	5.02
make	6.0
her	5.84
realise	6.18
how	4.68
serious	4.42
what	4.8
we	6.38
be	5.68
do	5.76
be	5.68
and	5.22
maybe	4.7
she	6.18
felt	5.48
a	5.24
little	4.6
proud	7.32
she	6.18
also	5.42
love	8.42
the	4.98
footage	5.68
of	4.94
the	4.98
machine	5.38
fill	5.7
the	4.98
dos	5.16
on	5.56
the	4.98
production	6.02
line	4.98
and	5.22
ask	5.2
whether	4.92
i	5.92
have	5.82
a	5.24
cool	7.2
machine	5.38
like	7.22
that	4.94
as	5.22
you	6.24
know	6.1
have	5.82
read	6.52
chapter	5.6
i	5.92
sadly	2.28
do	5.76
not	3.86
we	6.38
do	5.76
it	5.02
by	4.98
hand	5.9
i	5.92
get	5.92
equally	6.4
positive	7.8
response	5.68
from	5.18
family	7.72
friend	7.66
and	5.22
mum	6.7
on	5.56
the	4.98
school	6.26
run	5.48
everyone	6.12
say	5.54
that	4.94
they	5.62
have	5.82
learn	6.7
something	5.0
and	5.22
felt	5.48
reassure	-1
about	5.16
the	4.98
vaccine	-1
there	5.1
be	5.68
a	5.24
lot	5.78
of	4.94
press	5.36
coverage	5.66
in	5.5
response	5.68
to	4.98
the	4.98
programme	5.84
too	5.22
and	5.22
it	5.02
all	6.22
felt	5.48
positive	7.8
the	4.98
daily	5.4
mail	6.36
described	5.58
me	6.58
to	4.98
my	6.16
mum	6.7
s	5.04
delight	7.78
as	5.22
have	5.82
a	5.24
ribald	-1

and	5.22
an	4.84
earthy	-1
kentish	-1

fn	-1
	-1
if	4.66
we	6.38
be	5.68

for	5.22
the	4.98
level	5.6
of	4.94

the	4.98

would	5.38
show	6.24
in	5.5
our	6.08
work	5.24
this	5.06
year	5.38
we	6.38
be	5.68
even	5.58
more	6.24
unprepared	-1
and	5.22
surprised	6.72
by	4.98
the	4.98
interest	6.36
show	6.24
in	5.5
us	6.26
personally	5.9
at	4.9
the	4.98

there	5.1
be	5.68
a	5.24

in	5.5
us	6.26
be	5.68
woman	6.84
scientist	6.18
i	5.92
know	6.1
that	4.94
sarah	5.4
found	6.54
this	5.06
particularly	5.46
annoy	3.1
she	6.18
be	5.68
on	5.56
record	5.78
as	5.22
say	5.54
something	5.0
like	7.22
this	5.06
be	5.68
why	4.98
be	5.68
we	6.38
even	5.58
discuss	5.96
woman	6.84
scientist	6.18
i	5.92
m	5.06
not	3.86
a	5.24
woman	6.84

i	5.92
m	5.06
a	5.24
scientist	6.18
and	5.22
more	6.24
than	4.74
half	4.6
my	6.16

be	5.68
woman	6.84
and	5.22
we	6.38
do	5.76
the	4.98
job	5.96
however	4.7
i	5.92
think	6.2
that	4.94
with	5.72
our	6.08
increase	6.56
public	5.18
profile	5.3
our	6.08
attitude	5.8
have	5.82
become	5.7
more	6.24
nuanced	-1
we	6.38
realise	6.18
that	4.94
we	6.38
be	5.68
be	5.68
see	6.06
as	5.22
role	5.68
model	5.8
and	5.22
that	4.94
be	5.68
i	5.92
think	6.2
important	6.32
woman	6.84
be	5.68
still	5.14

a	5.24

and	5.22
the	4.98
reason	5.54
for	5.22
that	4.94

complex	5.04
but	4.24
it	5.02
be	5.68

some	5.02

in	5.5
science	6.86
that	4.94

at	4.9
quick	6.02

can	5.62
be	5.68
counterproductive	-1
for	5.22
example	5.58
in	5.5
the	4.98
past	4.62
decide	5.84

have	5.82
a	5.24

our	6.08

clearly	6.18
there	5.1

so	5.08
the	4.98

this	5.06

you	6.24

i	5.92
would	5.38

we	6.38
