me	6.58
after	5.08
a	5.24
while	5.12
in	5.5

reflect	6.28
on	5.56
the	4.98

i	5.92
weed	4.44
them	4.92
out	4.62
i	5.92
ponder	-1
on	5.56
the	4.98
idea	7.06
which	4.94
remain	5.52
for	5.22
several	5.66

it	5.02
be	5.68
only	4.92
natural	6.56
that	4.94
my	6.16

should	5.24
take	5.18

a	5.24
reaction	5.52
against	3.4
this	5.06
dearth	-1
of	4.94

suppose	4.92
it	5.02
be	5.68

all	6.22
my	6.16

for	5.22
him	5.54
after	5.08
all	6.22
i	5.92

him	5.54
with	5.72
an	4.84
altogether	6.4
more	6.24
friendly	7.66
eye	6.14
his	5.56
role	5.68

that	4.94
be	5.68
a	5.24

role	5.68
indeed	6.0
meanwhile	5.28
i	5.92
can	5.62
lurk	-1
in	5.5
his	5.56
brilliant	7.68

and	5.22
console	-1
myself	6.3
that	4.94
he	5.42
have	5.82
left	4.64
me	6.58
the	4.98
best	7.18
part	4.98
of	4.94
our	6.08

front	5.58
for	5.22
us	6.26
both	5.9
ultimately	5.72
therefore	5.08
i	5.92
accept	6.42
the	4.98
identification	5.73
of	4.94
myself	6.3
with	5.72
him	5.54
and	5.22
ten	5.44
