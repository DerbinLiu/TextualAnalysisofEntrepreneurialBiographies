when	4.96
we	6.38
adjourn	-1
to	4.98
the	4.98
breakfast	6.86
table	5.32
i	5.92
found	6.54
more	6.24

to	4.98
reflect	6.28
upon	5.34
there	5.1
be	5.68
about	5.16
a	5.24

mr	5.26
stanley	5.24
at	4.9
the	4.98

it	5.02
struck	3.5
me	6.58
that	4.94
there	5.1

but	4.24
the	4.98
subject	5.44
of	4.94
their	5.16
talk	6.06
left	4.64
me	6.58
in	5.5
the	4.98

their	5.16
remark	5.49
upon	5.34

me	6.58
most	6.22
appropriate	6.26
to	4.98

it	5.02
surprised	6.72
me	6.58
to	4.98

learn	6.7

and	5.22
though	4.78
they	5.62
must	4.82
have	5.82
guess	5.64
by	4.98
my	6.16

age	4.88
that	4.94

too	5.22
much	5.74
but	4.24
in	5.5
think	6.2
that	4.94
it	5.02
be	5.68
rather	4.98
a	5.24
weakness	2.94
to	4.98

another	5.2
upon	5.34
this	5.06

that	4.94
and	5.22
i	5.92
thought	6.38
that	4.94
it	5.02
be	5.68
not	3.86
fair	6.96
to	4.98
retaliate	-1
with	5.72
inward	-1

that	4.94
he	5.42

when	4.96
it	5.02
be	5.68
my	6.16

then	5.34
i	5.92
thought	6.38
of	4.94
his	5.56

that	4.94

to	4.98
speak	5.9
of	4.94
personal	6.06

after	5.08
my	6.16
experience	6.34
in	5.5

lambeth	-1
you	6.24

any	5.22

could	5.52
still	5.14
show	6.24
in	5.5
an	4.84
honourable	-1

but	4.24
this	5.06

receive	6.5
wordy	-1
abuse	1.88
which	4.94
reminds	5.4
me	6.58
of	4.94
english	6.58

either	5.1
to	4.98
open	6.1
my	6.16

to	4.98
receive	6.5
from	5.18
him	5.54

his	5.56
mindless	-1
myrmidon	-1
that	4.94
filthy	2.82
abuse	1.88
they	5.62
be	5.68
only	4.92
too	5.22
eager	6.54
to	4.98
give	6.54
that	4.94
so	5.08
many	5.82
member	5.94
of	4.94
parliament	4.98
can	5.62
do	5.76
so	5.08
smile	8.1
only	4.92
show	6.24
difference	4.78
of	4.94
training	5.74
as	5.22

as	5.22
difference	4.78
of	4.94

us	6.26
i	5.92
do	5.76
not	3.86

the	4.98
capacity	5.5
of	4.94
be	5.68
indifferent	-1
to	4.98
the	4.98
vileness	-1
but	4.24
rather	4.98
feel	5.9
admiration	7.1
that	4.94
they	5.62
can	5.62
do	5.76
something	5.0
which	4.94
i	5.92
cannot	3.32

if	4.66
i	5.92
be	5.68
once	4.94
in	5.5
the	4.98

so	5.08
thin	5.74
skin	5.5
and	5.22
at	4.9
the	4.98
next	5.62
fight	2.7
i	5.92
should	5.24
probably	5.64
be	5.68
able	6.56
to	4.98
face	6.12
it	5.02
well	6.68
but	4.24

think	6.2
harmful	-1
to	4.98
the	4.98

and	5.22
not	3.86
for	5.22
personal	6.06

i	5.92
now	5.9
realise	6.18
that	4.94
since	5.24
usage	5.52
and	5.22
custom	5.94
demand	4.14
that	4.94

so	5.08
we	6.38
be	5.68
in	5.5
danger	2.82
of	4.94
lose	2.76
the	4.98

listen	5.94
to	4.98
his	5.56

that	4.94

just	5.76
a	5.24

feel	5.9
the	4.98

would	5.38
have	5.82
have	5.82
something	5.0
worth	6.78
reading	6.78
sometimes	5.28
i	5.92
appear	5.84
to	4.98

as	5.22
through	5.62
a	5.24
window	6.1

the	4.98

of	4.94
the	4.98
writer	5.96

his	5.56

there	5.1
be	5.68
something	5.0
too	5.22
frequent	5.78
also	5.42
in	5.5
the	4.98

pursue	5.68
this	5.06

for	5.22

you	6.24
will	6.02
get	5.92
the	4.98

heartily	-1
like	7.22
him	5.54

again	5.42

that	4.94

hardly	3.98
dealt	5.1

what	4.8
i	5.92
have	5.82
be	5.68

as	5.22
i	5.92
could	5.52
not	3.86
take	5.18
my	6.16
notebook	5.9
out	4.62
at	4.9
the	4.98
dinner	7.4
table	5.32
i	5.92
can	5.62
only	4.92
say	5.54
that	4.94
i	5.92
have	5.82
be	5.68
much	5.74
impressed	7.24
with	5.72
all	6.22
i	5.92
have	5.82
heard	5.36
and	5.22
feel	5.9
genuine	7.18
sympathy	5.36
for	5.22
them	4.92
which	4.94
make	6.0
me	6.58
reluctant	3.94
to	4.98
wound	2.96
them	4.92
but	4.24
the	4.98
truth	7.42
be	5.68
there	5.1
be	5.68
too	5.22
many	5.82
leader	6.38
and	5.22
each	5.4
leader	6.38
pull	4.74
a	5.24
contrary	4.24
way	5.24
to	4.98
his	5.56
fellow	5.5
consequently	5.04
they	5.62
have	5.82
no	3.48
concrete	5.6
well	6.68
consider	5.56
policy	4.74
i	5.92
quite	5.32
agree	6.7
with	5.72
them	4.92
that	4.94
our	6.08
government	4.64
be	5.68
to	4.98

allow	6.0
the	4.98

be	5.68
broken	3.02
so	5.08
repeatedly	4.72

that	4.94
their	5.16

be	5.68
not	3.86
what	4.8
that	4.94
of	4.94

would	5.38
have	5.82
be	5.68
for	5.22

desire	6.68
their	5.16

though	4.78
i	5.92

strongly	6.14
of	4.94
the	4.98
weakness	2.94
